international economic and scientificcompetition such changes provided and c ontinue to provide both opportunities and problems for the us st system th reports contained many recommendations on how the us st system and especially the us government rdestablishment can respond many recommendations centered on the need for newmechanisms for determining national st goals and priorities and federal

report reasoned that because scientific progress is essential for the nation science is proper concern of gove rnment the latter statement confirmed by the great contribution of science and tec hnology to the war effort this conclusion echoed in part the finding of report of the national resources committee theprewar focus of federal science planning that federal support of research was anappropriate responsibility of the federal gove rnment and might help the united states out of the great depression 4 bush convened four committees which submitted their reports to him th medical advisory committee the committee on science and the public welfare the committee on the discovery and development ofscientific talent and the committee on publication of scientific information major conclusions of the bush report based upon the work of the committees were that the government should extend fi nancial support to basic medical research in the medical schools and in universities fund civiliancontrolled militaryresearch in support of that conducted by the armed services support the generalwelfare by funding basic research in academia and in regard to applied research by improving the procedures for hiring and reta ining federal scientific personnel and by providing tax and patent incentives to i ndustry provide reasonable number of undergraduate scholarships and graduate fellowships to develop the nationsscientific talent especially those currently in the armed services and declassifysecret scientific information as rapidly as possible 5 the bush report also called for the establishment of national research foundation which was to be the central scientific agency within the federalgovernment although there was consen on this idea by 1945 the two major proponents bush and senator kilgore di ffered on some important matters such as whether the new organization should mainly support basic research proposed bybush or rd broadly proposed by kilgor in furtherance of societal goals another major issue was political control of the organization president trumanvetoed the first bill because it did not provide for presidential appointment of thedirector it took until 1950 before those issues were resolved and the nationalscience foundation nsf was established in the interim however several other federal rd agencies also were established eg the atomic energy commissionand the office of naval research and rd responsibilities and capabilities of other agencies eg the national institutes of health nih were increasedconsequently nsf was not the governments

to crisis the evolution of the us st system also received significant direction as st policymakers responded to several periods of national crisis since world warii one crisis was the soviet unions 1957 launching of sputnik the earths first artificial satellite that caused widespread fear of the impending domination ofmilitary space efforts by the soviets as well as concern about soviet technologicalleadership the united states responded in several ways including theestablishment of the predecessor committee of the house science committee theenactment of the national defense education act 7 the creation of the national aeronautics and space administration nas the creation within the department of defense of the defense advanced re search projects agency darpa and greatly expanded budgets for the nations military and civilian space efforts another national crisis to which the st system responded was the arab oil embargo of 1973 congress responded with the enactment of the energyreorganization act of 1974 8 which among other things established the energy research and development administration the enactment of the department ofenergy organization act 9 in 1977 which established the department of energy doe comparable development although it may be termed major adjustment to an existing situation the soviet military threat rather than response to new crisiswas the large increase in defenserelated rd funding during the 1980s begunduring the last year of the carter administration federal defenserelated rdfunding reached peak of about 70 of total federal rd funding in 1986 after reaching postwar low of about 50 in 1979 by 1996 preliminary estimates ofdefenserelated rd funding had decreased again to about 51 nearly the 1979level although the final figure

therapidly increasing space budgets of the early 1960s other strains that impacted onthe st system were number of societal and political pressures including thosecaused by the vietnam war the struggle for civil rights and the conservation andenvironmental movements perhaps most important to the st community was thenew belief by significant segment of the c itizenry that the nations problems could not be solved by science and technology that was symbolized by the inability of the most powerful nation in the world to subdue technologically inferior enemy in vietnam as one analyst saw matters societys support for science had been based on the assumption that progress in the various scientific disciplines would ultimately lay the foundation for better life for all americans but as americans lost confidence in thispremise as their optimism about the fu ture became tinged with pessimism the foundations of societys support for science and scientists faith inthemselves eroded 13 one significant attempt to address societal needs through the application of science and technology during this period was the research applied to national needsrann program of the national scien ce foundation in part because of doubt concerning the role the federal government should play in civilian applied researchthe program established in 1971 was abolished in 1978 because of various strains on the nation s st system during this period there was movement for the establishment of national science and technology policy and for strengthening the presidents science advisory committee

entities c onduct major st policy study efforts two such major science policy study efforts occurred during the early 1960s just beforethe period of policy disarray discussed above by the elliott committee and thedaddario subcommittee of the house of representatives the elliott committee was the house select committee on government research which during its existence in 1963 and 1964 reviewed the rd programs of nine federal departments and 12 agen cies submitted ten major studies and made over 40 recommendations the daddario s ubcommittee during its existence from 1963 through 1970 conducted number of hearings and produced number ofreports on government and science as set forth in its 1963 statement of purpose the reason for the study was that the fede ral government was then providing more than twothirds of the total research and development money being spent in theunited states 17 in fact the federal share of rd funding peaked at 665 in 1964 and decreased to below 60 by 1969 it has further decreased to about 34 atpresent the lowest share reported by nsf in its 44yearold rd data series 18 the most recent comprehensive congre ssional science policy study effort was that of the science polic task force of the hous committee on science and technology during the mid1980s that effort might be viewed by some as fitting better into the preceding categories of major st system restructuring or reactionto crisis rather than fine tuning i ndeed one of the two strong factors that made such review highly desirable was the urgent need to reverse the

health of science unlike th other two task forces discussed above this task force effort was not intended to be comprehensive but to expand the current sciencepolicy dialogue which has been too narrowly focused on funding levels and notsufficiently concerned with the st ructure of the research system 24 the task force made use of informal offtherecord brie fings from active members of the research policy community and commissioned several performance assessments by outsidegroups of number of different research efforts conducted by the nations research communities and federal rd agencies in reviewing national science policy since the bush report the report concluded that the real question is whether available resources are being allocated in mannerthat can best achieve national goals yet this question has never been addressed ina comprehensive manner 25 the basis of the task forces recommendations was that in this era in which the us st system is perceived to be under stressfederal rd priorities should not be driven by fiscal concerns and circumscribed by the boundaries of scientific disciplines rather the report stated that for eachnational goal including those that still need to be adequately defined the policy questions should be what research is most necessary and what mechanisms forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97836crs9 26ibid 10 27ibid 4 28ibid 1011

of the executive branch and the many congressional committees with jurisdiction over some aspect of rd the taskforce sought to outline broad strategies by which the committee can strengthenits oversight of the federally funded research portfolio while crafting policy directedat improving the linkages between federally funded research programs and national goals it recommended two principal strategies strengthen mechanisms for setting governmentwide researchpolicy goals and for oversight of the federal research portfolio by exploiting committeejurisdiction over the office of science and technology policy ostp integrate various performance assessment mechanisms into the research process using legislative mandates in order to help measure the effectiveness offederally funded research programs 27 the report looked beyond the continuous need to fine tune the nations st system it suggested that the committee may wish to consider fundamental reformulation of science policy principles with the view toward exploiting research as tool designedto achieve national goals rather than as black box into which federal funds aredeposited and from which social benefit is somehow derived 28

1990 dollars to over 21 billion in 1990 thiswas due initially to escalation of the co ld war and the presidential commitment to land men on the moon followed by slight decrease and leveling off from the late 1960s to about 1975 then an increase in fundi ng due in large part to the expansion in health and life sciences research p 5 during the 30 year period the numberof academic researchers grew steadily so that there will always be more opportunities than can be funded more resear chers competing than can be sustained and more institutions seeking to expand than the prime sponsor the federalgovernment can fund p 7 the objec tive then is to ensure that the best researchers continue to be funded that fu ll portfolio of research is maintained and that there is sufficient research work for ce of the highest caliber to do the job p 7 findings four major issues would challenge the federal research system in the 1990s according to ota including 1 setting priorities in the support of research2 understanding research expenditures 3 adapting education and humanresources to meet the changing needs of th research work force and 4 refining data collection analysis and interpretation to improve federal rd decisionmaking recommendations the report offered issues and options for each issue which largely were recommendations ev though ota was statutorily prohibited from making recommendations on the first issue setting priorities in the support of research the report found that federal priority setting falls short in three ways criteria used in selecting various areas of research and megaprojects are not made explicit and vary widelyespecially in highlevel office of mana gement and budget mb and congressional decisionmaking there is mechanism to evaluate the total research portfolio in terms of progress toward many national objectives and the issues of developinghuman resources and regional and institutiona l capacity need to be considered along with the principal criteria for selection scientific merit and mission relevance p 11 ota suggested numerous executive and gislative actions to cope with these problems httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97836crs13 congress cannot look only to the scientific community for guidance on setting priorities warned ota due to the absence of scientific tradition for rankingresearch topics and investment choices acr oss fields and subfields thus like the 1988 academy report ota stated that c ongress should hold biennial hearingson the state of the research system includi ng crossfield priorities in science and engineering and the criteria used for deci sion making within the cognizant research agencies p 21 this would require the research agencies ostp and omb to present coordinated budget plans that cut across scientific disciplines andresearch areas coordination among relevant committees of congress would makethis most productive p 43 as will be discussed below other types ofcongressional action were recommended to deal with the other problems otaemphasized that to effect changes in the research system congressional action must be comprehensive and sustained posture hearings with the science advisorand agency directors will not suffice p 44 when establishing priorities executive branch agencies could provide the congress with more transparent and iterative planning information that makestradeoffs and reflects the application of criteria of merit program relevance andother goals that reveal the relationships among new and continuing projects thesupport of new investigators and the changing costs and duration of research inrelation to capacity building congress c ould also initiate specific changes in the executive agencies that would increase their ability to respond to changingpriorities p 21 including measures to encourage flexibility risktaking strategic planning coordination and new methods of funding the second issue understanding research expenditures addressed the observation that federal expenditures for individual components of research projectshave increased faster than inflation understanding and coping with these increasesis imperative in research decision making p 43 according to the report thereare inconsistences in defining what is meant by the costs of doing research both in terms of inputs which vary because of sala ries indirect costs which are the largest component increase in research project budgets p 24 stage of the researchprocess equipment costs and likelihood of competitors and in terms of outputssuch as performance or cost per unit output ota discussed various options tolower costs including fixedprice gran ts and congressional pursuit of programs to develop permanent grantreducing measures to slow or limit increases in researchexpenditures on individual research grants greater costaccountability byperformers and more accuracy in developing estimates of costs for megaprojects p 2627 congressional actions presumably in the form of hearings could explore costaccountability efforts at the research agencies and throughout the researchsystem p 43 the government should also try to balance the demand for moreresearch output by its performers especially in academia where researchers aredriven by the need to publish in order to advance professionally against the actual need for more research the third issue that ota examined adapting education and human resources to meet changing needs focused on the controversial topic of supply and demand for scientific personnel ota concluded that thencurrent predictions of shortages ofscientific personnel were overstated and should not be used to formulate publicpolicy demand for personnel even outsi of government may depend on levelshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97836crs14 of federal funding in order to maintain required capacity government should continue programs to expand the number and diversity of students in the education pipeline and to prepare graduate students for career paths in or outside ofresearch p 28 ota endorsed legisl ative action in support of minorities and women setaside programs and other activities to enlarge the diversity of theworkforce the report addressed the issue of sel ective augmentation of academic research capacity by encouraging havenot instituti ons to concentrate excellence in select research programs departments and centers and build from there p 33 prioritychoices have to be made when expanding academic research capacity becauseacrosstheboard enhancement of all res earch programs may lead to each program being unable to garner enough support to im prove research capability p 33 the report endorsed programs to build capacity in lagging states or regions like the experimental program to stimulate co mpetitive research epscor program and noted the tension between research and teaching in academia and the need foruniversities to play greater role in di versifying the careers of recent phds it concluded that it was important to share research equipment space and people inteams or interdisciplinary centers what it called larger more industrial modelwith shared infrastructure in discussing the fourth issue refining data collection and analysis to improve research decision making ota said that four categories of data could be useful in decision making 1 research monies how they are allocated and spent 2personnel characteristics of the research workforce 3 the research process how researchers spend their time and what their needs are eg equipment andcommunication for research performance and 4 outcomes the results ofresearch gaps and uncertainties characterize these kinds of data with nih andnsf being the agencies that collect the best data other agencies rarely collect the kinds of internal statistics needed to in form research decision making and identify problems ota recommended that all agen cies that support research should provide comparable data using common definitions to identify the si ze of the research workforce expenditures including salaries equipment and indirect costs the size of research groups and research production units and their relative dependenceupon the government and other funding sources and numbers of proposalsubmissions and awards p 40 congress could instru ct every research agency to develop baseline of information direct nsf to expand its focus and coordinating function for data collection and analysis and direct ostp in conjunction with omb to devise plan to increase the re porting and use of agency data in the budget process especially cross cutting information in priority research areas p 41congressional hearings ought to be held to examine the state of data on theresearch system and improvements needed to inform congressional decisionmaking p 43 the ota report also addressed the issue of measuring the evaluation of research outcomes and said that while there is merit in quantitative measures suchas degrees awarded and citation rates it also was important to include peer and expert judgments using such criteria as the originality of research results theprojects efficiency and costs impacts on education and the research infrastructure and overall scientific merit p 39 this discussion evoked debates still in progresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97836crs15 33carnegie commission on science technology and

federal government claimed that major changes over the last decade and more have changed the framework for science and technology in the united states it examined how the us stenterprise can best respond to the new fr amework and in particular what should be the role of the federal government the report was written by the committee onscience engineering and public policy cosepup joint standing committee ofthe national academy of sciences the na tional academy of engineering and the institute of medicine the committee consis ted of experts in range of fields in st most members were from academe the report is often called the griffiths report after the committee chair phillip griffiths it divided the st enterprise into three parts research technology deve lopment and education and training the report addresses the first two parts issues the changes that the griffiths report identified include the increasing prominence in society of the products of science and technology the end of the cold war the information revolution major medical advances and increasing intensityin international economic and scientific competition corporate research anddevelopment also has been changing in particular it has decreased in the unitedstates especially with respect to other c ountries there also have been changes in how st activities are performed the number of largescale major projects hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97836crs20 increased and the nation is experiencing possible saturation of the market for new phds in the sciences furthermore some people are questioning the historicalassumption that st makes needed contributions to national objectives forexample some question how continuing increases in government investment inmedical research can be justified with health care becoming more expensive despite or perhaps because of that research ot hers point out that environmental problems persist despite substantial investment in research findings the report found that us econom ic and national security depends on making better use of us global scien tific leadership and engineering capabilities us strength in st has contributed fundame ntally to the rise of the country to its current position of global leadership and can continue to contribute to it industry health care the military and environmen tal protection all depend on st and will continue to do so in addition the advances in knowledge from scientific researchhave changed and enriched society in profound ways beyond the material science and technology are used in different ways to meet different societal needs many industries are born out of science eg biotechnology thesemiconductor industry but industries depe nd less on science as they mature eg aircraft automobiles hightech industries do not necessarily depend on currentfundamental research eg semiconductors defense has become more dependenton civilian technologies which is shift from previous decades it is impossible to predict reliably whic h areas of science will contribute new technologies therefore resources currently used for research to advanceknowledge if redirected to more immediate or practical research goals would reduce the potential for new discoveries that w ould advance society and the economy and would not necessarily solve the immediate problems being addressed to continue and enhance the us global leadership position the federal government needs improved ways to judge th health of the st enterprise and its various components it must also respond to changing workforce needs as theeconomy develops further the information revolution continues st and theindustries they support become increasingly internationalized and us educationcontinues to evolve recommendations the report made several recommendations aimed at ensuring continuing and enhanced us global leadership in st the two coreideas were the call for an explicit nationa l goal of maintaining global leadership in st and the idea of identifying position of leadership through the deliberations of independent panels of experts investment in st to guide us investment in the wide range of possible st activities the report recommended that for some major areas of science the united states should be the global leader and that it should strive to be among the world leaders for all major areas of science areas means broad disciplines andtheir major subdisciplines such as biology and neuroscience being among theleaders means that us capabilities and infrastructure in the area should not beexceeded by other countrieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97836crs21 37deborah stine cosepup staff officer telephone conversation with author 12 august 1997 by ensuring such excellence the us can bring knowledge to bear within and across disciplines on needs relating to national objectives can take advantage ofadvances made in other countries and can attract the best talent in st among the areas in which the united states should be the leader are fields for which national objectives can be met only if the nation is leader or that capture the imagination of the public or that affect other areas of science disproportionately the choices should involve comparative asse ssment of different fields they should involve different mechanism than decisions about the best direction within field which should be made by the scientists in that area the report asserted that these goals can be met within current total federal funding levels the reason given was that the united states is already leader inmany areas and small reallocations could have major effects on others measuring national performance the griffiths report recommended that the united states perform fieldbyfield peer assessments via panels of independentscientists of us research compared with that of other countries those assessments would help identify strengths and barriers within and among fields and help resolvedebates over megaprojects they would be used to guide priorities for investment but steps should also be taken to make the federal budgetary process for sciencemore coherent using mechanisms already in place such as ostp committees one question about this recommendation is how one would designate an area to be examined the delineation of areas might be difficult and contentious once such designations occur there is also th risk that they could also lead to an unintended rigidification of fi elds and create the very ba rriers to interdisciplinary work that the report criticizes to test th idea cosepup is engaging in series of bench marking exercises in which co mmittees of experts will assess chosen areas of research in the united states in comparison to other countries three areascurrently being examined are mathematics materials science and engineering andimmunology 37 other recommendations establishment of leadership will also entail use of merit review to ensure quality research adequate stable funding for qualified investigators involving minimum administrative burden mechanisms to encourageinterdisciplinary work and emerging fields and investment in education to ensurethe continuous development of the research workforce in cooperation with the private sector the federal government should work to ensure that the united states maintains position of technological leadership p33 in areas of major broad industrial and economic impact that goal cannot beachieved primarily through federal policies but the government should create anenvironment in which technology flourishes p 37 the federal governmentshould support the development of promising new technologies in cases whereindustry will not because the necessary research and development may be toocostly lengthy or risky for an individual company p 38 examples where thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97836crs22 38the report language cited p 87 also states that the senate appropriations committee was concerned whether the federal research and development budget isdesigned to meet new national security c oncerns military economic and health that confront our nation in postcold war world the committee is concerned for examplethat medical research is not at its optimal level of priority and support relative to itsimportance to national securityfederal government has performed such function in the past include aeronautics semiconductors computers and satellite co mmunications they were supported for national security reasons but other project s such as synfuels and breeder reactors failed allocating federal funds for science and technology national academy of sciences national research council allocating federal funds for science and technology washington national academy press 1995 96 p overview the national research council produced allocating federal funds for science and technology in response to congressional request to examine the criteria that should be used in judging the appropriate balance of funds to research and development activities the appropriate balance among different types ofinstitutions that conduct such research and the means of assuring continuedobjectivity in the allocation process 38 the report was written by committee of 18 experts from academe and industry includi ng former government officials and chaired by frank press it is often referred to as the press report issues perhaps the major issue influencing the committees deliberations was the increasing current and projected constraints on federal funding for rd resultingfrom sustained efforts to balance the federal budget additional considerations included the reemergence of proposals to create department of science and thechanging environment for rd created by th end of the cold war and increasing global economic competition findings many people consider the federal governments investment in research and development to be essential for meeting many national needs majorstrength is the breadth of fields supported and the diversity of agency involvement making resources available to respond quickly to unforseen problems such as aids in addition to meeting missionspecific needs universities have been an especially important locus of investment stable thoughtful investment can solve manyproblems costeffectively but it is often not possible to predict what specificinvestment will lead to major advances especially in technology the current system of funding and managing rd evolved during times of funding growth and mission expansion b ecause it has progressed by building new structures rather than changing old ones it is not as wellsuited to times ofconstricting budgets while individual scientists and engineers can readily adapt tochanging priorities adaptation is much more difficult for large research institutions in 1994 the federal government invested 70 billion in rd of that amount 35 to 40 billion went to federal science and technology fst with the

sciences science technology and the federal government national goals for new era washington dc national academy press 1993 also discussed in this crs reportbeing spent on projects that were neith er longterm investments in new knowledge nor investments in creating substantially ne w applications p 57 those shortterm activities included initial pr oduction maintenance and upgrading of largescale weapons and space systems at the department of defense department of energy and the national aeronautics and space administration p 52 the pooling of these two very different kinds of expenditure masks federal investment in science and technology at time when focus on such investments is especially important p 54 the depart ment of defense has begun to distinguish between the two it considers basic research and development science andtechnology and its other expenditures systems development 39 other agencies do not make similar distinctions most agencies traditionally distinguish between basic and applied research however that distinction is often difficult to make in practice and is usually not as important in decision making as other fact ors the relationship between the two kinds of research is complex and most federally funded research is at once bothapplied and basic p 77 in addition fe deral investment in science and technology has complex relationship with industrial involvement with government supportcentral to creating national economic advantage p 81 recommendations the report has 13 recommenda tions altogether several focus on the budget process and several parallel recommendations made in thegriffiths report 40 the central recommendation was that the federal government should create specific fst budget and use it in ma king funding decisions the budget would include the 35 to 40 billion identified above as science and technology investment the report envisioned that the fst budget w ould be presented by the president and considered by congress as part of the allocation process the premise for thisrecommendation was that coordinated approach to budgeting is necessary in timeof budget reduction different fields of st depend on each other and comprehensive fst budget would permit consideration of how cuts in one areacould affect others it would thereby ssen the risk that cuts in one programmatic area could inadvertently damage the health of another higherpriority field the proposed creation of separate fst budget was the most central and original recommendation in the report the strength of the fst budget concept is that it corresponds to the set of research and technology development activitiestypically conducted in the science and ngineering departments of us research universities many of the federal laboratories and ffrdcs federally fundedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97836crs24 41gary d krenz ed the future of the governme ntuniversity partnership ann arbor university of michigan p 161174 summarized elsewhere in this crs report 42stine telephone conversation research and development centers and so private firms p 54 the approach would focus on the investment aspects of federal science and technology in period of severe constraints on the federal budget and reduced allocations forrd p 54 the concept has been criticized on the grounds that it would not have the desired effect 41 on the one hand it might be considered largely irrelevant to the political process through which the budget is allocated the comparative prioritieswithin the fst budget might carry little wei ght compared to other considerations within agencies and congressional committees on the other hand it might set upa zerosum game situation for st fundi ng whereby the amount identified in the budget acts essentially as cap alternatively it might actually reduce theconnection of st investment to national goals by focusing on comparisons withinthe st enterprise rather than with respect to other means of achieving the goal the national academy of sciences has used the proposed fst budget approach to produce analyses of the admi nistrations budget request to congress for fy1997 and fy1998 however those analyses are essentially posthoc crosscuts and do not indicate how decisionmaking would be affected by adopting theapproach the academy is currently c onsidering using an fst budget analysis to determine the impact of changes in the federal budget on science and technology 42 this report repeated the recommendation of the griffiths report that the united states should be the global leader for at least some major areas of science and thatit should strive to be among the world lead ers for all major areas the nation should also pursue international cooperation especially for large and expensive projectsreview of research proposals and program s should be competitive based on merit and involve external evaluators funding should focus on researchers and pr ograms rather than institutions to that end investment in academic instituti ons would be preferable to extension of federal laboratory activities beyond their assigned missions federal laboratoriesserve important functions but should not seek new missions unless they offer both critical advantage over other performers and the new mission better meets national needs p 19 the federal government should encourage the development of commercial technologies by the private sector but it s hould fund them directly only in pursuit of government missions such as defense or new enabling or broadly applicabletechnologies for which government is the only funder available p 21 good management of science and technology is important however regulation imposes costs and federal agencies must strike balance between theneed for accountability and

curricula to increase the versatility and employa bility of the graduates it is held that scientists and engineers possess problemsolving skills that are broadly applicablein business and finance however selected doctoral degree programs are beingchallenged as too analytical and too orient ed toward subspecialities an increasing number of employment positions for doctora holders are found in industry rather than in academia and are becoming more re moved from the basic research skills that earned them their doctoral degree 44 critics have called for limiting enrollment in certain graduate programs and the phasing out of others the nature of industrialwork is changing and so the training offered by the many postdoctoral positions mustbe altered as well industry wants graduate students

next generation of academic researchers in vi ew of the broad range of ways in which scientists and engineers contribute to national needs it is time to review how theyare educated to do so 45

objectives graduate scientists and engineers and th eir advisors should receive more upto date accurate and accessible information to make informed decisions aboutprofessional careers broad electronic

1996 jerome b wiesner symposium ann arbor univer sity of michigan february 26 1996 251 p overview this conference was held in hopes of moving toward consensus on principles that would underpin new partnership between the government and thenations research universities as stated in the conferences opening address the major focus of those principles should be the expectations that the public should have for the nations research universities and what the research universities needfrom the government in order to meet those expectations report was issued prior to the conference from the committee on institutional cooperation that arrived at set of draft principles arranged in four thematic areas research and scholarship in support of the nations wellbeingeducation for the next century responsible allocation and utilization ofresources and stewardship of the public trust the questions addressed by the principles are concentrated on the what universities can do to meet visionsenunciated for these four areas these draft principles were summarized in theconferences opening address opening remarks were also made by rep ehlers and rep rivers about what each hoped to get out of the conference rep ehlers hoped it would serve to begin development of new model for universitygovernment relations rep rivershoped it would address the direction in which the nation should move to ensure aproductive academic enterprise and healthy economic future the conference was oneday event featuring speakers from government university and industry the keynote ddress was given by dr charles vest president of mit sessions were entitled the university in national science andtechnology policy outputs research and education for the 21 st century and inputs responsible allocation and stewardship of resources issues certain themes or issues appeared in several of the presentations and are presented here there was general agreement that changes in the relationship between the federal government and universities were ta king place these changes resulted from number of forces including the decline in available funding resources growingdemands on universities to meet regulatory requirements growing skepticism bythe public of the value of university res earch and the lack of clear science and technology policy direction following the end of the cold war while there ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97836crs28 general acceptance that universities have made significant contributions to the nation during the cold war period there does not seem to be the same feeling about theimportance of university research to the nations future many newer members ofcongress are challenging assumptions long held about funding university research the speakers agreed that funding university research was an important investment for the nation the rate of return on rd in general and universityperformed research in particular has been shown to be high that it is an investment compared to other calls on federal funds however is not accepted by all policymakers further there are questions about how new knowledge generated inuniversities can most effectively be transfe rred to those parts of society where it is needed how can partnerships be expande d to effect greater technology transfer several speakers brought up the interaction between research and education while most believed they are naturally supportive of one another many felt that there are forces that are straining this s ynergy the failure of the government to pay the full cost of research is causing univers ities to divert funds that otherwise would have gone to education at the same time the public is led to believe that research and education are often at odds with one another universities are viewed by someas not doing enough to contain costs to sure access to all bright and talented students others argued that support of education on the k16 level needs to be increased to expand the capacity of society to accommodate an increasingly complexworld further some felt that the educati on of the next generation of scientists and engineers is not getting the attention it needs many of the speakers commented about the changing research policy environment policy goals for research s eem to be undefined since the end of the cold war the rationale as to where res earch goes next has not been clearly spelled out global economic competition has contributed to those changes as aconsequence the innovation system fostered by the universitygovernmentpartnership appears to be coming apart the important midtier of the researchhierarchy precompetitive research largely carried out by industry has all butdisappeared with industry concentrating on shortterm productoriented research and universities continuing to focus on longterm fundamental research the flow of knowledge between industry and universities has been severely hampered as resultfinally efforts to balance the federal budget and reduce the size of government are having profound effect on the research nvironment while research funding has not suffered nearly as much as first feared the future still appears bleak several speakers brought up the role of the states as many federal functions devolve to the states it is reasonable to ask whether they should also contributemore to university research support there can be an important role for the statesin certain research areas states could become part of the governmentuniversitypartnership some argued however that it is not reasonable to expect much from the states since they are already providi ng substantial amounts for general university support findingsrecommendations while the conference did not arrive at collective findings there were themes shared by seve ral speakers that served as findings andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97836crs29 are presented here these findings usually contained explicit and implicit recommendations which are also included where appropriate the universitygovernment partnership has proven to be of great value to the nation over the last several decades that partnership was based on the premise that new knowledge was fundamental to the nations well being and the most effectiveway to develop new knowledge was through fe deral funding of basic research at the nations universities in the future new knowledge will be even more important formeeting the needs of society universitie s in partnership with the government and industry will continue to be primary source of that new knowledge without actions by both universities and the government the partnership might falter in the future public support is criti cal to the partnerships success at this time public support is not strong without better understanding of public concerns and taking steps to address them universitie s are in danger of further erosion of support universities need to be accountab they must recognize the need for greater efficiency and cost control strengthening peer review and maintenance ofthe research infrastructure funding constraints will make it essential thatuniversities share existing resources with all research performers including thenational laboratories the federal governments responsibilities include more predictable and flexible process for determining funding leve ls particularly with respect to large projects while the government has th responsibility for ensuring accountability and ethical conduct of research administra tion of the regulations governing research performance which now often acts as disin centive needs to be more efficient and less burdensome finally the federal govern ment needs to move toward the goal of funding the full cost of research it supports advocacy of the importance of university research appears to be lacking on the part of both universities and the federal gove rnment all partners must do better job of showing that science is in the common interest universities have anespecially important role in engaging c ongress in discussions about the importance of science and investment in research corollary is the importance of aggressively pursuing the transfer of new knowledge and the scientific process to help society achieve its goals without better links to industry technology transfer will not beeffective both universities and the gove rnment have responsibilities in enhancing this transferhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97836crs30 endless frontier limited resources us rd policy for competitiveness council on competitiveness endless frontier limited resource us rd policy for competitiveness washington council on competitiveness april 1996 145 p overview the council on competitiveness is nonpartisan nonprofit forum of chief executives from the business university and labor communities thecouncils primary mission is to set nati onal action agenda for maintaining us leadership in global markets technology innovation education nd training that will raise the standard of living of all amer icans the council was established in 1986 and is supported by private contributions foundations and other grantingorganizations the council regularly produces reports benchmarking uscompetitiveness in general and in specific technology areas issues this report discusses the changing global environment in science and technology the challenges these changes create for the us rd establishmentand what institutions in each of the three sectors government private and academia need to do to meet those challenges the report also provides more specificdiscussions on six industrial sectors airc raft automotive chemicals electronics information technologies nd pharmaceuticals the follo wing discussion highlights the general part of the report findingsconclusions the global environment in science and technology has been undergoing fundamental change the council described four changes thatimpact the structure and policies of the us rd establishment tighter budgetsa shift toward nearerterm research globalization and changes in the innovativeprocess itself the rd establishment in the united st ates is undergoing budgetary pressures that are not likely to be relieved in the n earterm in 1986 the united states had the highest rd intensity rd expendituregross domestic product gdp equal to28 in the industrialized world in 1995 the rd intensity of the united states dropped to 24 the council estimated that in 1996 the intensity could drop to22 federal support for research and velopment peaked in 1989 in real dollars and is expected to continue to decline as the government seeks to balance its budgets private sector support for research and development has been relatively flat since 1988 although there is some expectation that private sector investment in research and development will increase soon it is not clear whether it will increase enough to offset declines in federal support while the unites states still spends more on research and development than any other country and more than many of them combined the united states has fallen behind in some areas also in terms of nondefense rd intensity the unitedstates trails japan and germany the council also noted that if japan doubles itsgovernmental rd expenditures by the year 2000 as it has said it will try to do it will spend more than the united states on nondefense related research andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97836crs31 development flat or declining budgets mean that the united states must make painful choices about what it will fund related to this decline in research intensity is shift in emphasis to research with shorter time horizons this shift is driven primarily by industry as it has sought to concentrate on core capabilities many fi rms have either done away with central laboratories or support more of their central laboratory research and developmentwith funds from business units firms still support longerterm research but rely more on government laboratories or universitie s to do it this is also affecting the time horizon of those institutions research and development is becoming increasingly global advances in science and technology are not only coming fr om traditional sources in the industrial world eg germany and japan but also from new sources india israel china and other asian countries us firms are increasing the amount of research anddevelopment bought or conducted overseas foreign firms are increasing theamount of research and development bought or conducted in the united states thistrend presents both challenges new comp etitors and opportunities new partners the council suggested that the united stat should encourage as much rd to be done in this country as is possible in cluding us multinationals that might find benefit in doing research overseas the innovation process itself is changing technologies are becoming more sophisticated and complex requiring interdisciplinary teams to conduct researchdevelopment and innovation also pr oduct cycles are shortening putting premium on speed and incremental improvement s this presents challenge to find the resources to continue conducting the l ongterm research needed to discover and exploit more revolutionary advances the council came to two primary conclusions called findings first increased partnerships can help meet the challenges of the changing environmentgovernment the private sector and univers ities must continue to find ways to form partnerships not only with each other but with their counterparts in other countries the second primary conclusion was that the current debate over what rolegovernment industry and academia should play in the nations research anddevelopment enterprise is polarized detr imental to making progress and based on an outmoded distinction between basic and applied research the complexity oftechnologies today does not allow for clear distinction between basic research and applied research nor is the linear m odel for innovation which describes innovation as following an orderly flow from basic research to applied research to product development adequate to describe the real process by which innovation occurs recommendations the council made two general recommendations although it does not identify them as such the first is that all institutions within the three sectors must prioritize by concentr ating on their core missions and capabilities and then make sure their internal policies facilitate partnerships in order to leverage their investments as much as possible the report goes into little more detail on what each sector needs to consider httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97836crs32 the second recommendation is to restructure the framework upon which the roles of government industry and universitie s are determined it suggested doing away with the notion of basic and applied research as an organizing concept and go instead to the relative timehorizon and the am ount of risk associated with particular research and development see the figure below government should supportlongerterm research basic or applied with higher risk research that needs to bedone but which private industry is unlikely to do without government support type of research responsib ility for conducting research shorttermlowriskprimary secondary industry notforprofit midtermmidrisk industrygovernment universitieslongtermhighrisk universitiesgovernmen tgovernmentindustry the council stated that industry is leading the way in focusing its efforts and facilitating partnerships at least among industrial firms and perhaps withuniversities but to maintain momentum i ndustry needs to increase its contribution to research and development industry too still needs to take better advantage ofwhat government laboratories and universities have to offer the federal government has had harder time focusing its efforts primarily due to political pressure to keep current progr ams going in rather bold statement the council suggests that government must meet its long standing obligation tostimulate civilian research among its core missions along with national defenseand public health should be the stimulation of research that is required to keep the united states economically competitive government industry and academiashould select these technologies together the council notes that doe nih nasaand nsf have made efforts to be more responsive to industry needs but that theseprograms are relatively small and politically vulnerable the federal government also needs to redefine the mission of its laboratories onethird of the federal investment in rd goes to federal laboratories doelaboratories account for about onequarter of that most of the rest goes to dod nasa and nih while stating that federal laboratories should be preserved thecouncil recommended that their missions be narrowed that unnecessary overlap be eliminated bureaucratic oversight reduced and that culture of partnering be more firmly established the council noted that these are not new suggestions but thatno consensus has emerged on how to do them the council did not make anyspecific recommendations the federal government also must maintain its investment in university research in 1970 the federal government provided universities with 70 of theirrd support by 1993 this dropped to 53 universities are the key to basicresearch they attract industrial laboratories and investment and they train futurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97836crs33 scientists and engineers however maintaining investment should not necessarily mean expanding the number of research programs the council made three other more sp ecific recommendations to improve the environment for innovation government need s to reduce those regulations that raise the cost of innovation for example some regulations of the food and drugadministration associated with clinical trials government should also eliminatethe treasury departments regulations that require us multinational firms to treat portion of their domestic research and development expenses as having beenconducted abroad and the federal government should make the rd tax creditpermanent cutting costs will be particularly hard for universities after of 50 years of significant growth the tasks of universitie s are made more difficult by their having conflicting missions universitys primary mission is to educate however they also receive industrial or federal funding to do research they are increasingly being relied upon to do the countrys longterm research but are being contracted to domore shorter term research also while universities are supposed to be thestorehouse of public knowledge more and mo re of their research is considered proprietary either by the firms providing th funds or by the universities themselves finally the national rd establishment must rely increasingly on interdisciplinary efforts but university tenure policy departme nt structure and program offerings are becoming more specialized although federal government research funds aredeclining universities still rely heavily on th em and are vulnerable to further cuts in federal rd spending universities need to define their own priorities more clearly and reassess their links to industry and the federal system evolution of us science policy harvey brooks evolution of us science policy technology rd and the economy edited by bruce smith and claude barfield washington the brookings institution and the american enterprise institute for public policy research 1996 1548 overview this book is publication of papers given at conference sponsored by the national science foundation and hosted by the brookingsinstitution and the american enterprise in stitute in october 1994 the aims of the project were to assess the role of rd in the economy to identify promising newareas of research and analytical approaches and to contribute to the public debateas the nation seeks to define new framework for its rd policies in the postcoldwar era issues the primary issue addressed by dr brooks was whether is it desirable and feasible for the federal government to take more explicit role in directingscience and technology resources to meet sp ecific social objectives in this case to improve us economic competitiveness and performance findingsconclusions dr brooks did not answer the above question directly but puts the question in the context of long historical debate about the feasibility and desirability of planning the agenda of the science and technology enterprise tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97836crs34 meet explicit societal or economic goals in the 1930s michael polyani and jd bernal had this debate polyanis position was that society could benefit mostefficiently over the long run by giving the science and technology community largedegree of autonomy to set its own research and development agenda bernal argued that the enormous potential benefits that science and technology held for societycould only be realized through publicly discussed and debated flexible planinvolving government and many other representatives of society dr brooks described what he considered to be different phases of science policy in the united states defined in part by shifts in emphasis from one of thesemodels to the other he argued that the united states was currently october 1994in phase where the bernal model is in ascendancy the key social objective now guiding us science and technology policy aside from public health which hasenjoyed continuous and increasing govern ment support since the 1950s is economic competitiveness and performance dr brooks cites as evidence of this latest shift the clintongore position paper entitled science the endless resource taking off from the vannevar bush report entitled sciencethe endless frontier the clintongore position paper suggested that governments role is not just to createnew knowledge but to ensure that it is accessed and used to better society dr brooks identified nine issues associated with this shift toward the bernal model and the social objective of improving economic performance that were as yet unresolved national laboratories especially the large doe laboratories probably arebetter positioned than universities to meet the social objective of improvingeconomic performance they have experience in mobilizing highlevelinterdisciplinary teams to solve specifi c problems also they do have some manufacturing experience upon which to dr aw universities however which typically explore even appliedoriented problems in more depth mightactually provide more net social benefits through the additional knowledgegenerated by doing that what are the implications for university priorities and policies which respondto calls for greater synthesis and diffusion of science and technologicalknowledge rather than just the creation of that knowledge giving greaterweight to knowledge synthesis and dissemination implies everything fromradical changes in instruction methods to development of hardware andsoftware as aids to knowledge access and retrieval the practicalities of doing this at universities or at intermediate organizations have not been worked out what will or should be the impact of increased interest in economic performance on participation of foreign entities in governmentsupportedresearch and development programs the productivity of the us technical work force has become steadily more dependent on students scientists engineers and skilled practitioners from all over the world however there are many inconsistencies in the legal mandates of new programs regarding the participation of foreign nationals and foreignowned companies reverse brain drain where more foreign nationals are returning to their nativecountries than are coming here makes any us techno nationalism even morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97836crs35 counterproductive the issue can longer be treated by the scientific and technical community with benign neglect what should be the ground rules criteri and procedures governing state and federal agencies involvement in international cooperative research andeducation programs the united states is acquiring reputation as anunreliable international partner declining federal rd budgets will likelymake this issue worse if job growth is the ultimate goal what institutions and what technologies are the best ones to support and by what processes will this goal be translatedinto concrete and reasonable objective project selection criteria that commandwidespread support in the community the federal government has yet to develop clear rationale for public s upport of projects in collaboration with industry for the benefit of economic velopment and job growth what are the public benefits sometimes higher pr ofits and jobs are considered to be the public benefit how can it be ensured that government funds for research and development are not simply displacing private funds for research and development intrying to assess this there should be realistic allowances for displacingpotential private investment such llowances might include better diffusion and exploitation of the knowledge generated by cooperative program what are the longterm implications of this emphasis on economicperformance on the allocation of resources to universities nationallaboratories nongovernment nonprofit boratories and private laboratories and to what extent should resources be channeled through political subunits ie state regional or local government s except for shortterm increase in the share of federal rd investme nt going to universities in the 1950s and 1960s the relative allocation of that investment between the differentinstitutions have varied little since the nd of world war ii is that allocation still appropriate will increased emphasis on economic performance andcooperative research with industry alter the allocation will emphasis on economic performance split and disperse notgeographically but administratively the technological capacities nowaccumulated in national laboratories are the large centralized organizationalstructures of national laboratories appropriate to the economic performancemission without wellthoughtout restructuring plan laboratories maysimply be closed and the skills and experience scattered what does rapid downsizing of the federallyfunded rd system mean forinstitutions whose primary mission is to train and educate new scientists andengineers and what changes are needed in the nature of their training evenif funding to universities is sustained if graduates cannot find jobs outside academia where will they go it is unlik ely that the private sector can or will absorb those people quickly because of the different nature of the worktypically done at national laboratories as compared with private sectorlaboratories httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97836crs36 recommendations dr brooks did not offer any specific recommendations but he did caution that the debate between openended university research versus appropriable science cannot and should not be resolved rather he argued thatsociety benefits most from the tension and interplay between the two investing in innovation toward consensus strategy for federal technology policy lewis branscomb et investing in innovation toward consensus strategy for federal technology policy cambridge harvard university center for science and international affairs april 24 1997 26 p and lewis branscomb et technology politics to technology policy issues in science and technology v 13 spring 1997 4148 overview the harvard report is result of project undertaken by the science technology and public policy progr am at harvard university which was sponsored by the competitiveness policy council bipartisan federal advisorycommission many of the recommendations originated from diverse set of expertswho participated in policy confer ence held jointly by harvard and the competitiveness council in washington dc on november 1819 1996 theharvard report which is an interim report as well as the issues in science and technology article reviews the debate that emerged between the republican congress and the clinton administration regarding the appropriate federal role infostering technological innovation according to the authors much of this debate has been based upon the linear model which depicts technological innovation asa distinct threestep process involving basic research applied research anddevelopment however the authors noted that the experts who have studied thisprocess contend that technological innovati on is much more complicated process the report suggested that the president and congress should abandon their attempts to differentiate between basic and applied research the authors concluded that asingle overall science and technology policy must give way to policies geared atbetter defining the roles that industry government both federal and state anduniversities can play in contributing to the nations technological innovation thereport concluded by outlining six key principl the authors believed could help end the debate between the administration and congress and help revise americastechnology strategy during the next four years as well as into the 21st century issues when president clinton took ffice in 1993 he called for significant funding increases for the advanced tec hnology program atp as well as other federal costshared programs with the private sector including the partnership fora new generation of vehicl the defense departments technology reinvestment program and later the environmental technology initiative according to the reportwhen the republicans took control of congre ss many members in the majority party voiced strong opposition to the presidents technology initiatives they called for theelimination of the atp as well as othe r similar technology programs the authors contend that it is fortunate that the most strident voices did not prevail because to reverse course to that extent could have had disastrous consequences for theunited states the report stated that the partisan conflicts and ideological rifts ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97836crs37 the past few years while helping to clarify the terms of the debate over public investment in research have made it difficult to develop much needed consensus on the nature and scope of government i nvestment in and promotion of innovation harvard p4 however the report noted that the end of the cold war the decline in corporate support for longterm highrisk research growing international economiccompetition and declining federal rd budgets provide the administration andcongress with unique opportunity to set new course regarding the appropriate role of the federal government in fost ering technological innovation the principal guide to governments role in helping the nation innovate is rather straight forward government should try to help us firms respond to the competitive challenge ofa fastchanging global marketplace and shoul d be able to do it without meddling in domestic markets or favoring selected competitors issues p 42 while the reports acknowledged that ideo logical difference may be difficult to overcome there has been strong support fo r government research investments where private institutions underinvest because they cannot capture the full benefits but the return to society is greater than the public cost this has been the rationale for public support of basic research where the benefits are widely diffuse further the report noted that when political debate divides the world of rd into basic scientificresearch on the one side and lumps everythi ng else from applied research or basic technology research definition to follow and product development together on the other side sight is lost of huge and important gray area in between needdrivencreative research into new kinds of materi als new processes or ways of exploring and measuring and new ways of doing and making things harvard p8 findings the authors concluded that innovation is the product of intellectual creativity and broad based collective efforts they argued that the process ofinnovation grows more complex as countries around the world join in global effort to create and exploit new possibilities the authors found that the united statesrequires carefullycrafted broadlysupported approach to this global challenge the report concluded that the current single overall technology policy must giveway to comprehensive sophisticated technology policy based on widelyshared consensus that is continually evaluated and adjusted to meet changing competitive markets recommendations in that light the report outlined six principles which reflect the view that the most appropriate and effective role for the federalgovernment is to ensure that organizations and individuals have the knowledge skilland incentives to generate private investment in innovation the report stated thatthese principles are entirely consistent with the governments central economicstrategy to encourage savings and investment rather than driving consumption principle 1 encourage private innovation leverage private investment in innovation to spur economic growth improve living standards and accomplishimportant government missions by creating incentives for and reducing barriers totechnology development and researchbased innovation httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97836crs38 the central thesis of this recommendation was that the engine of innovation and productivity growth is in the private sect or wherever possible the authors argued the pursuit of technology policy should favor the use of market mechanisms suchas tax incentives and creating markets for nonmarket entities such as tradablepermits for sulfur emissions over direct government funding of rd however policymakers should realize that private firms underinvest in longerrange research and in research to meet public purposes therefore federal interventions mustencourage private investment in technology development rather than substitute for it the report contended that cost shari ng arrangements should be basic precept of federal technology initiatives where both public and private value is produced costsharing requirements might be reduced in those cases where firms allow or evenencourage the technology to be widely shared however the report stated thatindustrys cost sharing requirements should be raised as the investment area iscloser to the market principle 2 emphasize basic technology research focus direct government investment in science and technology fo r economic purposes on longrange broadly useful research in basic technology as we ll as basic science both of which produce benefits far in excess of what the private sector can capture itself in terms of direct or matching support of federal research the report recommended the government continue to focus on traditional basic scientificresearch as well as basic technology res earch both of which produce benefits far in excess of what the private sector can capture itself basic technology researchincludes activities which involve investigating fundamental processes complementto basic scientific research of specific tec hnologies such as blue lasers biosensors and the wearable computers such activitie s usually start early in the innovation process and lead to knowledge that is of ten nonproprietary and widely diffusible though clearly on course for industria l applications basic science and basic technology research are inextricably linked and dependent upon one anotherfurther companies have become more reluctant to put resources into basictechnology research that is long term and high risk or both even though thisresearch could eventually pay handsome returns to society as whole the reportnoted that more narrowlytargeted or short term research with clearly defined goals like product and process development shoul d be funded by the intended beneficiary which might be private firm or in the case of technology needed primarily forgovernment purposes by federal agency the report also contended that publicprivate technology partnerships should be structured so that it is clear how the results will reach broad range of users and benefit the public at large this implies using consortia of private firms universitiesand national laboratories in almost every case except where the government is the customer for the end product the report noted that mixture of institutional performers may be best since industry universities and national laboratories have their unique ways of ensuring that new work reaches variety of potential users principle 3 make better us of available technology promote effective use and absorption of technology across the econom ic spectrum with special attention to the role of higher education and the states in technology diffusion httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97836crs39 essentially this recommendation focused on the need for stronger federal and state efforts to improve the transfer of technology to the private sector primarily smaller firms primarily because many sm all firms have limited ability to choose among technologies and to make effective use of them the federal governmentworking closely with states and regions should develop closer links betweentechnology policy and workforce training and development this will help spur the diffusion and use of technology and create strong links between technology and the creation of highwage and highskill jobs the report noted that the national institute of standards and technology nist manufacturing extension partnershi p mep program is an effective model of federalstate partnership in technology diffusion and regional economicdevelopment the report also recommended that the states should play role in shaping nists advanced technology program atp for example atp should longer focus its grants to single company but should focus it resources on establishing multi company consortia so th at groups of companies can benefit from new ideas such as techniques for creating new polymers materials forsemiconductors and new systems for managing information principle 4 use all policy tools not just rd support utilize the full range of relevant policy tools eg tax in centives regulatory reform standards and intellectual property rights recognizing that different industries technologies and regions may call for different mixes of these policy tools one size fits all technology policy is almost certain not to be successful rather the report argued every industry is different and government agencies mustbe sensitive to these differences which calls for different policy tools and differentmixes of science technology and systems research for example strong patentprotection is essential to business success in pharmaceuticals but less so in the computer industry where most large firms are crosslicensed internationallybiotechnology companies draw directly on fo refront basic research while chemical and materials firms are more dependent on advanced process technology besides directly funding rd the fede ral government should support an array of indirect incentives to help foster technology development and diffusion including besides those mentioned above facilita tion of standards development federal procurement antitrust law and competition policy and consensus building andpolicy analysis like that performe d by the defunct office of technology assessment for example direct federal funding for the national informationinfrastructure nii is not as important as the role the federal government is playingin ensuring that regulatory hurdles are cl eared and technical projects are funded so that programs such as the secondgenerati on internet can be useful for both public and private sector customers principle 5 leverage globalization of innovation encourage us led innovation abroad as well as at home and able us firms to get maximum benefit from worldwide sources of technical knowledge essentially us technology policy must encourage and facilitate globalization and transnational collaboration not impede it the united states must learn tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97836crs40 cooperate as well as compete given the rapidly growing technical assets in other countries assets which in many cases are the product of public investments the report noted that resolving trade conflicts tends to get more public attention thaninvestments in transnational collaboration and cooperation in the development ofnew science and technology which often br ings even larger benefits according to the report the global information infrastructure gii where us firms andinstitutions enjoy commanding lead today is an excellent example of the need forus leadership in developing harmonious international environment principle 6 improve government effectiveness make government stable and reliable partner in longrange nationa l research effort through more effective institutions for policy development strong an d stable bipartisan support and stronger participation by the states in policy formation and execution the final recommendation called for strong and stable bipartisan support for technology policy primarily because of the longterm nature of most governmentinvestments and the policies recommended in this report american science andtechnology thrives because it is supported by pluralistic system there are manysources of support many types of perfor mers and maze of linkages among funders performers and users of science and tec hnology further there is not and should not be centralized technology policy process that undermines the value of pluralism technology policy should be explicitly experimental continually adjusted andinformed by access to expert advice the executive office of the president mu st provide the locus for linking broad national policy objectives such as economic and security policy with the technology agenda congress on the other hand must be an active but patient and sophisticated participant congress also has central decisionmaking role adjudicating among technology policy experiments policies that fail should be terminated policies thatsucceed must be maintained or expanded however most importantly policyexperimentation must be tried for sufficiently long time and under sufficientlyreasonable conditions in order to be judged the authors noted that theadministration in its first term may have moved to expand its technology policy initiatives too rapidly while congress may ve moved too fast to hamstring or authorize these initiatives the authors hoped that all sides will show more patience during the next four years the report also has an appendix which contains number of policy recommendations including calling for the national science foundation to support basic technology research establishment of an information technology policycouncil under the white house national science and technology council astrengthened technology

washington brookings institution press september 1997 175 phttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97836crs41 overview this book analyzed the basis of postworld war ii science policy in the united states the author first described the policy framework as it wasdeveloped by vannevar bush in his 1945 report science the endless frontier he then assessed how well that framework described the federal rd fundingsystem that emerged after the war after discussion of the historical basis for the bush research model the author proposed new model that he claimed moreaccurately portrays how rd is performed next he examined how this new model can be the used to restore the compact between government and science the book concluded with discussion of the role of scientists in developing science policy issues the bush report set forth models describing basic and applied research and the connection between basic research and technological innovation that became the foundation of us postwar science policy bushs first model classifiedresearch in terms of onedimensional linear spectrum defined by the motivationof the researcher at one end is curi ositydriven basic research motivated by the desire to seek new understanding and knowle dge about nature at the other end is usedriven applied research motivated by the desire to use that knowledge in apractical way the more one is concerned about application or use of research the farther one moves from basic research toward applied research bushs secondmodel proposed that the new knowledge spawned by basic research will eventuallybe converted through applied research and development in linear sequentialfashion into technological innovations that lead to economic growth and other societal benefits despite the broad acceptance of model separating basic research from any applied goals actual experience argues that it is unfounded much of thefundamental knowledge generated in the last century has been the result of basicresearch with specific applications in mind basic research can be both use andcuriositydriven bushs second canon the linear model of technological innovation is also suspect first it is too simple th connections between basic knowledge and innovations when they exist are much more complex than simple linear flowsecond not all innovation is derived from science often innovation will arise bytinkering with existing technology third not all connections when they do exist flow from science to technology there have been numerous cases where sciencedeveloped to explain already working technology findings while belief in the bush fram ework has guided science policy over the last 50 years it has come under increasing attack in the last several years as many longer believe that heavy investment in pure curiositydriven research will by itself guarantee the technology required to compete in the world economy and meet full spectrum of other societal needs reconsideration of the framework is gaining adherents as interest in applying science to economic growth increases the problem is that linear onedim ensional spectrum running from basic to applied research is inadequate to the task new model can be formulated as boxwith four quadrants the quadrants are fined on one axis according to whether the research is useinspired or curiosityinspired and on the other axis by whether itseeks fundamental knowledge or not th upshot is the appearance of newhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97836crs42 category or quadrant that is character ized by basic research driven by desire to solve practical problem it is ca lled pasteurs quadrant because much of the basic research he carried out that advanced fundamental understanding of thebiological sciences was motivated by trying to solve specific public health problemstwo other quadrants correspond to the bush framework in that they characterize pure curiositydriven basic research and pplied research for entirely practical ends these are called bohrs quadrant and edisons quadrant respectively because of thetype of research carried out by each the quadrants are not isolated from one another however and there is complex array of possible linkages between them new model of technologi cal innovation is also needed the new model must account for two trajectories the path of technology innovation leading from existing to new technologies and the path of scie ntific understanding leading from existing to new knowledge the two paths while i ndependent are loosely coupled at times they will influence each other quite strongl with the interaction moving in either direction quite often the linkage is us einspired pure science although there are other connections as well the connec tion between science and technology is more completely described in this model showi ng that each can drive the other but that the most important drivers are usually internal to the individual paths recommendations the postwar compact between science and the government appears to have fallen apart as result of three developments 1 end of the cold war perhaps the major factor in establishing and sustaining the compact was the desire to invest in scien ce in order to maintain technological edge over the soviet union with the end of the cold war that stimulus longer exists 2 integration of the world economy some countries notably japan have become very competitive in number of hightechnology areas without having astrong science base as result many have questioned the concentration on pureresearch if the major driver of economic growth is rapid technological innovation 3 the budgetary legacy of fiscal and economic policy the pressures brought on by efforts to reach balanced federal budget in 2002 have made it clear that rd funding will likely decline in constant dollars recommendation ia recognition of the reality and value of useinspired basic research can help develop firmer st policy the compact can be renewed by joining theinspiration basic science can draw from unm et societal need with the high value the policy community places on the problemsolving capacity of science p 107 recommendation iia process that brings together the scientific judgements of research promise and political judgements of societal needs p 108 can realize new compact if that process adheres to the followinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97836crs43 1 system for appraising scientific prom ise and social value at the project level should enlist the insight of the working sc ientist into the nature of the social goals on which his or her research bears p 118 2 scientists should not be excluded from the discourse that seeks to make judgements about social value or else the creative insight of the scientist fordefining and judging social goals would be lost and funding system with the potential for great conflict would be created 3 public funds invested in useinspired basic research will bring greater return if they are allocated among alternativ projects through peer review by panels capable of judging scientific promise and the societal benefit from the resulting scientific knowledge p 123 recommendation iiithe national institutes of health more than any other agency has put the use inspired basic research model to effective use in defining its research agenda nihhas accommodated policy direction for more attention on specific diseases primarilyby expanding usedriven basic research in the evolving arrangements for funding useinspired basic research attention should be given the possibility of rep licating the nih model in other areas where research promise is felt to match societal need with the field ofenvironmental science leading candidate p 144 recommendation ivthe national science foundation could provide leadership role in advising the administration and congress on science policy if so nsf must make it clearto congress that the key to turning the power of basic science to national needs is to build agendas of useinspired basic science funded by agencies across the government that bear on the nations needs p 154 the need to bring science to bear on national needs is still important if based on the premise that good basicresearch can be performed even if it is directed toward practical endshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97836crs44 47for ease of reference

proposedchanges in the role of the national scie nce board in making recommendations to the president on national science policy some additional projections and issues although not specifically discussed in the ten reports are assumed or implied for example the nation has moved far beyond the era of the bush report when the united states was the unchallenged stpower in the world consequently it was ge nerally implicit in the reports that were summarized that priorities for national sc ience and technology should be determined in both domestic and international context likewise constraints on the federalrd budget generally were treated as likely to continue 48 the reports revisited many of the themes that have arisen time and again in the st policymaking effortsof the last 45 years such as legislativ and executive branch st reorganization and st priorities but in the context of the current problems and opportunities facing the nation httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97836crs45 49quotations

ten selected reports all noted that significant national and international changes areaffecting the nations st system they discussed three kinds of responses new mechanisms for determining st goals priorities and budgets new models ofresearch development and innovation and refinement of the roles of government industry and academia in each and changes in university research and theuniversitygovernment relationships these points are discussed in the followingsections significant changes affecting the nations science and technology number of major changes are occurring in the world at large and in science and technology the end of the cold war is one such major change as is increasing international economic and scientific competition these changes provide bothopportunities and problems for the us st system the major impetus for example of the carnegie commission on science technology and government study was for society the profound difficulty ofmeeting the challenge of accelerating scie ntific and technological developments 49 as well as the challenges of economic grow th sustaining the environment and living peacefully in the postcold war world because of such changes the summary report called for transformation in the way science and technology policymakingis organized in all branches of government as well as in nongovernmentalorganizations the 1993 griffiths report of the academy stated that major changes over the last decade including the end of the cold war the information revolution and the increasing intensity of international economic and scientific competition already hadaltered the framework for us science and technology the press report of theacademy two years later also noted these same changes the council oncompetitiveness report discussed four changes that affect the us st systemincluding globalization of rd tighter rd budgets and the changes in research and innovation noted in the section on new models below the branscomb report identified these changes as providing an oppor tunity for the government to determine its appropriate role in technological i nnovation through for example its policies on transnational collaboration the stokes book identified these changes ascontributing to the weakening of the postworld war ii compact between scienceand government in this nation new mechanisms for determining st goals priorities and budgets the reports made many recommendations as to how the us st system and specifically the us government rd establishment can respond to the majorchanges occurring in the world and in science and technology theserecommendations centered on the need for new mechanisms to determine nationalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97836crs46 st goals and priorities and federal rd budgets the reports discussed aspects of national st policy that are contentious including the proper role of governmentin guiding the nations st for social purposes specific case being nationaltechnology policy the ota report concluded that mechanisms for federal st priority setting need to be improved because for example criteria used in selecting research areas generally are inadequate there is mechanism to evaluate research progress towardmany national objectives and human resources and regional and institutionalcapacities need to be considered along with scientific merit and mission relevance the griffiths report also raised questions about the historical assumption that st is making needed contributions to national objectives in some cases specifically inregard to some current medical and environmental research the ota reportaddressed the need to better understand the costs of conducting research which haveincreased faster than inflation and concluded that rd data collection and analysisincluding the results of research need to be improved to aid in decision making the ota reports focus was on cooperation across federal agencies the griffiths report made recommendations repeated in the press report that the united states should aim at being the world leader in some major areas of scienceand among the leaders in all major ar eas of science the report also recommended steps be taken to make the federal budgetary process for science more coherent the press report responded to congressional request to examine the criteria to be used in evaluating the balance in federal research and development funds and between rd institutions in an st system which evolved during time now past of funding growth and mission expansion it recommended that the governmentestablish federal science and technology budget eliminating from consideration activities like systems development in dod doe and nasa and that the entirefst budget be presented by the president and considered by congress in its budgetallocation process the academy is tinuing its work on how to apply the fst concept to decision making the proceedings of the conf erence held at the university of michigan on the future of the governmentuniversity partne rship noted that the changes occurring in the historic governmentuniversity partnershi p are in part due to the lack of clear federal st policy direction since the end of the cold war the brooks article discussed the historical debate about whether society benefits most by giving the st community large degree of autonomy to set itsown rd agenda or by public participati on in and governmental planning of the nations rd agenda arguing that the second model is in its ascendency andthat the key social objective guiding th nations st policy today aside from public health is economic co mpetitiveness nd performance the article outlined nine unsolved issues that must be addressed if this social objective is to be achievedincluding the changing relationships among government industry and academia the branscomb report called for carefully crafted comprehensive sophisticated and adaptable technology policy to replace the current one size fitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97836crs47 all technology policy it sets forth six pr inciples incorporating what it believes to be the governments appropriate role in technology policy defining new models for rd and innovation since at least from the time of the bush report basic and applied research and innovation have been considered to be connected in linear fashion questionswere raised in the reports analyzed here however that go to th very heart of what may be termed the standard model of rd and innovation severalrecommendations for new understanding of these terms and new models of theirrelationships were offered stokes proposed new model that he claimed more accurately portrays how rd actually is performed than does the bush model of curiositydriven basicresearch and applied research entirely for practical reasons stokes proposed newmodel that allows for basic research driven by desire to solve practical problem such model should be used in selecting areas of research to be funded by federalagencies stokes also argued that new m odel of innovation is needed that considers the paths of technology innovation and increased scientific understanding as largelyindependent loose connection exists with research stimuli going in eitherdirection often the coupling is usedriven basic research the press report questions whether the traditional distinction between basic and applied research is useful in practice or as important in decision making as otherfactors because most federally funded research is at once both applied and basicthe university conference noted that research is divided into three tiers shortterm productoriented research carried out by i ndustry midterm precompetitive research also conducted primarily by industry and longterm fundamental research carriedout mostly by universities the competitiveness council report also stressed that the complexities of modern technologies do not permit clear distinction between basic and appliedresearch nor does the linear model of innovation directly from basic research toapplied research to development reflect r eality these views were expressed in the branscomb report which discussed the importance of government conducting basictechnology research as well as basic scientific research the council reportrecommended reorganizing the rd roles of government industry and academiaaccording to shorttermlowrisk primarily industry midtermmidriskprimarily industry and government and longterm highrisk primarilyuniversities and government categories the university conference also warned that the innovation system fostered by the universitygovernment partnership appears to be dissolving and that withoutbetter links among academia government nd industry technology transfer will not be effective the branscomb report recommended increased governmental effortsin technology transfer at both the federal and state levels httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97836crs48 changes in university research and the governmentuniversity relationship the changes discussed in the reports have affected academia significantly including its funding by the federal governme nt the balance between teaching and research in universities and the increasing need for example for doctoral degreeholders in industry and government the ota report addressed the supply of and demand for scientific personnel the report concluded that the thencurrent estimates of shortages were overstatedbut also stated that the nations research capacity should be augmented in specific institutions of higher education specific sc ientific disciplines and underrepresented groups such as minorities and women the academy report on reshaping the graduate education of scientists and engineers addressed whether academia is producing the graduates necessary to powerthe us economy in an incr easingly technologically competitive world it concluded that due to number of factors includi ng economic immigration and international changes more broadlybased graduate programs are required to prepare studentsnot only for careers in academia but for pos itions in government and especially for the increasing number of positions for docto ral degree holders in industry the ota report had arrived at similar conclusion the university conference noted th at changes are taking place in the universitygovernment relationship due to number of factors including declines in federal funding and growing skepticism by the public of the value of universityresearch those changes also are affec ting the interaction between research and education decreases in federal funding for rd are causing universities to divert to research funds that otherwise would have supported education the conference argued that both the government and universities have responsibilities in rebuildingthe partnership the council on competitiveness report recommended increased partnerships not only between government and academia but also including industry it notedthat the primary mission of universities is to educate and that although increasingly relied on to conduct the nations longterm research they also are conductingincreasing amounts of shorterterm researc h primarily for industry these views were echoed in the university conference report the council on competitiveness report r ecommended that the missions of the federal laboratories be narrowed and their overlaps be eliminated the press report while not calling explicitly for downsizing the federal laboratories
