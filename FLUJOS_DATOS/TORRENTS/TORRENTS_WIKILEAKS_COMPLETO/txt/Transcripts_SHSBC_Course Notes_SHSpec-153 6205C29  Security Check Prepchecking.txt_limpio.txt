6205c29 shspec153 security check prepchecking the material of this lecture is summarized in hcob 10may62 prepchecking and sec checking details on prepchecking procedure when prepchecking ruds you are talking to the person about those things which are very pertinent to the subject of auditing these we have to have in if the pc is living life of secrecy we will find that ruds will go out even after having been put in broadly with prepchecking there is possibly something so wrong with the pc that joburg same as form 3 see p 239 above is needed to clean him up cases that go mad actually have number of missed withholds it is the missedness that makes them go mad their reach into an area is very difficult their departure from an area is difficult and the number of crimes they have under their hats is incredible their ruds go out as fast as you can get them in because there is tremendous weight of unknownness on the case the more closely the crimes are related to injuring scientology the less you will be able to get ruds in do recognize that if you cant keep the pcs ruds in the pc has overts matter how innocent he may seem people who invalidate emeters and have hell of time in session are having hell of time in life just because of their overts the easy way to get it off is to take some broad pervasive thing like joburg which has every crime known to man or beast on it using the joburg you will clip some corner of what they have been doing the pc would be damaged if the withholds were known so he doesnt give them up easily when one gets too many overts and withholds that are too damaging to oneself one wants to get the hell out the extremity of blowing from missed withholds is dying if you are auditing such case expecting that his overts will be of the magnitude of picking flowers in someone elses garden you will let them go ahead and croak out of kindness such pc has short attention span like if they are sick etc so the auditor has to be fairly quick he must parallel what the mind is doing find where the person doesnt want to go back to and what the people there dont know about the person what he is hiding etc since the pat list doesnt go straight to the area where the pc has his attention it has the liability of boring the pc to death before you get to his particular crime or item you must do it well and positively to minimize his dispersal of attention so handle things swiftly when you are cleaning up the relatively uncharged questions the ones that clean up with one incident good speed would be ten to twelve chains really prepchecked well per hour plus twelve or so null questions that speed keeps up the pcs interest fairly precise patter is being developed you need to word question so it keeps getting hot read and you need to get the question itself answered not some motivator version if you take motivator you will often find yourself spending long time and going nowhere just throwing endruds out eg halftruths untruths damaging others etc see p 244 above like mad when you realize you have done this go back and check it dont go on pursuing the wrong course canned lists scrape up areas that pcs are trying to avoid done well you can now prepcheck rudiments so that they will stay in and you can go on to routine 3 in checking up on past prepchecks look over only the what questions not the form in toto or the zero questions the process of prepchecking increases the persons responsibility so form 3 questions may now be alive that werent when it was done before the what questions that have really been nulled wont come alive again if you find one of these alive you are justified in chewing out the auditor the ones that are null will be stably gained
