ref brasilia 000440 b brasilia 000579 c sao paulo 000991 d sao paulo 000532 classified by deputy chief of mission phil chicola reasons 14 b and d 1 c summary in november of last year the government of brazil announced that it was backtracking on its effort to introduce counterterrorism ct legislation after yearslong effort by working group within the presidencys institutional security cabinet gsi to coordinate the drafting of the initiative within the government although they now seek to downplay the importance of having such legislation prior to the reversal gob officials claimed that new antiterrorism legislation was necessary to improve its legal regimewhich currently does not treat terrorist activities terrorism financing or support of terrorism as crimes some news reports have suggested that president lulas powerful chief of staff quashed the proposed legislation which had been attacked by some social activists and advocacy groups who feared it could be used against them and compared it to military era repression the media and political silence that greeted the governments reversal has exposed vacuum on matters pertaining to terrorism among the elites whose support would be required to overcome gob resistance as result our efforts to put this legislation back on brazils agenda will be an uphill climb end summary 2 u this cable is the second of two that looks at the brazilian governments latest actions to counter terrorist activities the first touched on brazils reform of its intelligence and counterterrorism structure crime without law to define it 3 u in 2004 the gob formed working group within gsi the presidencys office in charge of coordinating intelligence counternarcotics and national security charged with examining brazilian laws related to terrorism as well as the way the government was structured to deal with the challenges posed by international terrorists ref prior to this effort brazilian government officials and outside observers had concluded that brazilian laws dealing with terrorism were ambiguous and needed updating to account for modern realities refs b and c under brazilian law terrorist acts their financing and activities supporting terrorist acts are not considered crimes both the brazilian constitution and the national security act public law 7170 of 1983 which defines crimes against national security criminalize acts of terrorism in general however because the national security act harkens back to the military regime embassy contacts have indicated that it is highly unlikely the government would ever use it to charge someone with crime related to terrorist activity ref b in addition because terrorism under that law is proscribed without being typified even in the unlikely case someone attempted to test the prevailing wisdom on the applicability of militaryera national security law to charge someone with the crime of attempting to commit an act of terrorism they probably would be unable to do so the act specifically proscribes criminal acts that could be considered acts of terrorism such as sabotage and bombings but only as distinct crimes from terrorism because of this terrorist activities consisting of defined crimes under the law could not be charged explicitly as terrorism domestic politics to blame 4 u as soon as news reports started surfacing in early 2007 that gsi was about to wrap up its work the government started coming under fire from opponents of the bill the brasilia 00000504 002 of 004 influential ordem dos advogados do brasil oab the brazilian bar association criticized the government for pushing legislation that was according to oabs president cezar britto in reality thinly veiled move to criminalize the actions of social movements and those fighting for equality forced on the defensive several highranking gsi officials publicly suggested that any antiterrorism legislation would be rarely used and that judges would have discretion in applying it then in late november 2007 the government unceremoniously announced that it would not introduce the legislation to congress 5 c in meeting with poloff assistant secretary jose antonio macedo soares of the secretariat for monitoring and institutional studies at gsi and ministry of external relations representative to gsi where he holds the rank of minister and gsi advisor janer tesch hosken alvarenga explained that it was impossible to reach consensus within the government on how to define terrorism asked to confirm news item in the daily newspaper correio braziliense noting that minister dilma rousseff chief of staff to president lula in the casa civil had quashed the proposal alvarenga equivocated suggested that several clients had weighed in including the ministry of justice in the end he did not deny the news report stating that the decision had been political one 6 sbu brazilian war college analyst on strategic intelligence and author of numerous articles on counterterrorism topics andre luis soloszyn went farther asserting to poloff that the correio story sounded very credible to him and that the gsi working group was smokescreen for the government to demonstrate to the us and the international community that it was taking the issue of counterterrorism seriously soloszyn noted that there was little chance that this particular government stacked with leftist militants who had been the object of military dictatorshipera laws designed to repress politicallymotivated violence was going to put forth bill that would criminalize the actions of groups it sympathizes with such as the landless movement mst for there is way to write an antiterrorism legislation that excludes the actions of the mst an idea whose time has comeand gone 7 c asked if there was possibility the legislation could come back some time in the future both soares and alvarenga were pessimistic commenting on the enormously complex nature of the issue alvarenga noted that discussions of terrorism within brazilian society remain at an immature stage with few experts on the topic and very few people interested soares added that people within and outside the government find the possibility of terrorist attack taking place on brazilian soil so improbable that they are incapable of giving the issue much attention 8 sbu soloszyn echoed these comments indicating that he is one of the few individuals to focus on the issue of terrorism outside the government within the government the story is not much different he added and virtually one in congress was focused on the issue most legislators and general public are so in the grip of the it cant happen here mentality that they lack any idea of terrorist tactics the concept of support networks the threat of homegrown terrorism and exploitation of soft targets according to soloszyn the issue of potential pockets of islamic extremism among segments of brazils large muslim community is likewise an unstudied subject among specialists and unthinkable as proposition among the public at large the brazilian mind even among the highest echelons of the government he added cant get past its own cliches about the multicultural paradise that is brazil 9 sbu according to him the only factor that could change this indifference is another wave of violence like that unleashed by the first capital command pcc in sao paulo in 2006 ref d terrorism perpetrated by islamic extremists is too remote for brazilians to worry about the only way they are going to move on this he added is when it affects them on daily basis comment in the immediate aftermath of the pccs violence in 2006 president lula called their actions terrorism and made noises about finally getting some antiterrorism legislation on the books end comment we have to stop this farce 10 c in his conversation with poloff soares dismissed the importance of the governments reversal arguing that the success of any potential terrorist attack against the israeli embassy in brasilia is not going to be determined by whether there is law on the books outlawing terrorism brazil according to him has excellent working relationships with other countries he noted including with the us and israel soares added that he hoped to continue cooperating with the us despite what he described as the farcical elements within the bilateral ct dialogue soares did not miss the opportunity to repeat the oftheard complaint by gob officials about comments on the part of usg officials suggesting the triborder area tba remains top concern with regard to potential terrorist activity which then prompt the obligatory brazilian demands for evidence of such activity he called the exercise pointless since in his words we all know that your officials based their statements on information we provide the us soares also criticized argentine officials for their comments linking the tba to the 1994 amia bombing in buenos aires calling their accusations silly and baseless comment 11 c after various brazilian government officials had warned of the flawed nature of the brazilian legal system it is unfortunate though not surprising to hear gsi officials now argue that there is need for the gob to improve brazils legal regime to make it illegal to commit finance plan or support terrorist acts although we cannot confirm definitively that the casa civil quashed the initiative for political or ideological reasons it is certainly plausible outside of some agencies focused on security issues this government evinces very little interest in terrorism issues much less on legislation its base has interest in seeing enacted and that would require significant political capital to push through congress likewise with little knowledge or enthusiasm within congress there is one to take up the mantle there either as result the initiative has become an orphan of brazils current political realities for the moment any effort to suppress terrorism its financing or activities supporting terrorist activities will have to continue for the foreseeable future to follow the capone approach of taking down terrorists based on customs violations tax fraud and other crimes that unfortunately also carry less jail time while this approach can work it is not substitute for giving police and judges the additional legal tools that the international community has agreed are necessary in the fight against terrorism and nor is it substitute for institutionalizing counterterrorism within the brazilian legal system taking brazils reform of its ct structure ref together with its backtracking ct legislation once again shows mixed picture of brazils overall ct effort at the policy level furthermore the low standing ct holds as an issue among brazils elite casts some doubt as to whether the potentially useful reform of abin will actually materialize over the next months mission will consult with washington agencies as we review our strategy for increasing brazilian attention to counterterrorism 12 c comment cont on separate note we found soares admission that brazil provides the bulk of the intelligence on matters related to ct to be highly atypical although it sheds some light on question that has longpuzzled the mission that is whether policylevel officials particularly at itamaraty where they tend to be most disinclined to accept the suggestion that there may be terrorist elements active in their territory receive the same information from brazils intelligence elements as the us receives although we cannot answer definitively soares comments would suggest that to be the case and that despite their denials they recognize the potential problems brazil faces another possibility is that they have access to the same information but either because the information would be inadmissible in brazilian court or because it does not meet presumed higher threshold of what constitutes terroristrelated activity they technically do not consider it evidence of such activity this means they are either playing games or they are defining terrorism out of brazil neither interpretation presents flattering picture of the seriousness with which the senior levels of the brazilian government treat the issue of terrorism but both are consistent with what we have seen over the last several years from government that considers ct low priority end comment sobel
