bridge publications inc newsletter date continuing to create and perceive life now lets just accept as factual that thetan can create something and perceive it lets just accept that as fact you got it that he has to continue to create or he doesnt continue to perceive an easy example of this if an office boy fails to create his job newly in any given hour of the day he soon finds himself without job he thinks he is holding job nobody ever holds job one creates job one has to continue to create job and this one fully explained to pe class over course of couple of hours will cause some of the

the power of simplicity lectures an observation of the preclear an article by l ron hubbard from the power of simplicity lectures if you saw thetan going down the boulevard dragging behind him an old bentup bronze wreath of some kind or another which clanged and clanked and would keep getting caught on milestones and corners of things and so on you would say what you doing with that wreath well its rather obvious its memento of his last funeral or something like that we could say its just token or substitute for the body he just lost we could say its lot of things and wed say hey you dont need that wreath theres some much better items around if you want to pick them up as matter of fact you could go pick up another body if you wanted to he might do that but if he didnt and if he didnt drop the wreath and he just kept dragging it down complaining about how hard it was to get on down the road but all the time he was trying to get on down the road the wreath kept getting caught in the milestones you know i mean and you say hey you know youre dragging wreath funny part of it is you gave him big explanation at first and you told him he didnt need it and you told him lot of things you were assuming he knew he had wreath if you were to say to him hey you know youre dragging wreath along behind you fellow is liable to say nahh and you say well look around and hed say where where i

is also dragging along but thats another quarter of mile behind him and his attention is so fixed on it and it wont run that hes never noticed the wreath well just add that up as straight observation

desperation i said how did you lose your ear this was the wrong question it didnt take long to find out it was the wrong question either not that he blew up not that he blew up but i had asked him how he lost it not have you got an ear now youd say it was utterly impossible for an individual to go around without an ear for long time and not know that he didnt have an ear this fellow knew all the time he didnt have an ear but he didnt know he didnt have an ear dont you see and all of his difficulties and so forth were surrounding the incident of the ear and in order to get rid of those
