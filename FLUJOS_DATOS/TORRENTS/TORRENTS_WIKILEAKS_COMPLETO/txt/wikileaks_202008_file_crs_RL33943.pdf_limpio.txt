in the two social security trust funds will be exhausted by 2041 and thereafter social security payroll tax revenues will cover about 72 of promised benefits over the past decade severa l proposals have been put forward which could help to close the social security programs longterm financing gap one proposal would increase the social security payroll tax base so that 90 of covered earnings are taxablethe same proportion as in 1982 this policy would increase the payroll taxes paid by higherearning workers and not affect workers earning less than the current social security maximum taxable limit of 106800 some analysts have proposed raising the social security payroll tax base and reducing the payroll tax rate this policy would increase the taxes paid by higherearning workers and reduce taxes paid by low and middleincome workers this policy proposal could raise revenue for the social security program or be revenue neutral although the legislated social security payroll tax rate is 124 the average social security payroll tax is slightly progressive throughout the bottom 80 of the income distribution in that lowerincome families pay lower proportion of income in payroll taxes than higherincome families at the higherincome levelsthe top 20the payroll tax is regressive in that the proportion of income paid in payroll taxes falls as income rises the richest 1 of american families pay smaller proportion of their income in payroll taxes than the poorest 20 of families three policy options which raise the payroll tax base are examined two of the policies also provide tax relief to low and middleincome workers each of the three policies reduces the regressivity of the payroll tax at the upper end of the income distribution currently less than 10 of families contain worker earning more than the maximum taxable limit consequently over 90 of families would be unaffected by increasing the maximum taxable limit and if this change were combined with payroll tax rate reduction over 90 of families would pay lower payroll taxes it has been argued that the revenue increases from raising the payroll tax base would be significantly less than expected because of indirect behavioral changes by workers these predicted behavioral effects would reduce taxable earnings the proportion of family income subject to payroll taxes and tax revenue but recent research raises doubts concerning this position and suggests these behavioral effects would likely be negligible this report will not be updated

federal tax many lower income families pay the congressional budget office cbo estimates that the poorest 20 of us households paid about 8 of their income on social insurance payroll taxes in 20041 in contrast these lowerincome households paid negative income taxes because of the refundable earned income and child tax credits indeed justification for the earned income credit eic is to provide work incentives and relief from income and social security taxes to lowincome families who might otherwise need large welfare payments 2 the tax rate under current law on covered earnings is 124 for social security and 29 for medicare3 half of the tax rate is paid by the employee and the other half by the employer the selfemployed are responsible for the entire amount4 the tax rate for social security applies only on covered earnings below the maximum taxable limit which is 106800 for 20095 the medicare tax rate applies to all covered earnings the social security trustees project that the assets in the two social security trust funds will be exhausted in 2041 and after that social security payroll tax revenue will cover about 72 of promised benefits6 to help close social securitys longterm financing gap some analysts have proposed increasing the social security tax base by raising the maximum taxable limit so that 90 of aggregate covered earnings are taxable the percentage in 19827 cbo estimates that the maximum taxable limit would have to increase to 186000 in 2008 almost double the current limit so that 90 of covered earnings are taxable it is estimated that this policy could increase payroll tax revenues by 221 billion over the 20082012 period 8 since 1982 the ratio of taxable earnings to covered earnings has fallen from 90 reaching 833 in 2006 although most analysts advocate raising the ma ximum taxable limit to increase revenues for the social security program some would use the increased revenues for other purposes for example one analyst suggested reducing the payroll tax rate and keeping it revenueneutral by raising the maximum taxable limit 9 this change would provide payroll tax relief to low and middleincome workers 1 cbo historical effective federal

portion of social securitycovered earnings subject to the payroll tax has fluctuated since its inception taxable earnings as percentage of covered earnings was 924 in 1940 and dropped as low as 713 in 1965 the trend in this percentage since 1950 is displayed in figure 1 prior to 1972 the social security maximum taxable limit was updated periodically by congress which contributed to the dramatic and abrupt fluctuations in the 1950s and 1960s after 1972 the maximum taxable limit was automatically updated as annual average earnings increased which moderated the fluctuations somewhat in response to social security funding problems the 1977 amendments to the social security act increased the social security tax base by raising the maximum taxable limit so that 90 of covered earnings were taxable by 1982 this change explains the increase in the proportion of covered earnings that are taxable from 84 in 1976 to 90 in 1982 after 1982 the maximum taxable limit was automatically updated as annual

have become more unequally distributed since the early 1980s mostly due to wage gains at the top of the income distribution10 consequently larger share of earnings of highwage workers will be above

three policy options two of which have been proposed by various policy analysts the base year for the simulation is 2007 the last year for which appropriate data is available 11 the policy options compared in this report are policy option 1 this policy would increase the maximum taxable limit to 213900 up from the 2007 limit of 97500 which is the maximum taxable limit required so that 90 of covered earnings would have been subject to the payroll tax in 2007 12 the additional tax revenues are targeted to help close social securitys projected longterm financing gap consequently the payroll tax rate remains at 124 policy option 2 this policy would also raise the maximum taxable limit to 213900 but reduce the payroll tax rate to 115 so payroll tax revenues remain unchanged in essence the additional payroll tax revenues from increasing the maximum taxable limit are used to offset the reduction in the payroll tax rate policy option 3 this policy option would raise the maximum taxable limit to 213900 however half of the additional revenue is targeted to reduce the projected longterm financing gap and the other half is used to offset payroll tax rate reduction the payroll tax rate is reduced to 119 simulation results of the average social security tax rate for families with workers in different parts of the income distribution are reported in table 1 the average tax rate is the total payroll tax employee and employer shares of each worker in the family and divided by total family income total family income includes wages dividends farm income retirement income royalties and government cash transfers among others it does not include capital gains and in kind government transfers such as food stamps and housing assistance the average tax rate is reported for all families

distribution the social security payroll tax is slightly progressive in that higherincome families pay larger proportion of their income in payroll taxes than lowerincome families the average tax rate for families in the richest income quintile however is 84 14 the rate falls in moving up through the upper part of the income distribution the richest 10 of families pay smaller share of income in payroll taxes than the poorest 20 while the share of the richest 1 is about third that of the poorest 20 above the 80th percentile the payroll tax is regressive tax in that the average tax rate falls as income rises15 continued divided by an equivalence scale the equivalence scale is the one proposed by the national research council see constance f citro and robert t michael eds measuring poverty new approach washington dc national academy press 1995 14 the average tax rate for highincome families may be artificially high because income com ponents are topcoded that is cutoff at particular amount in the cps by the census bureau to prevent identification of highincome individuals 15 the results are broadly consistent with an analysis by cbo any differences are due to differences in the

for policy option 1 raising the maximum taxable limit and maintaining th current legislated tax rate for all families the average tax rate rises by almost 08 percentage points an 8 increase to reach over 10 this policy option however only affects workers whose earnings are above 97500 families in the bottom two income quintiles contain workers earning more than 97500 and about 02 of the families in the middle income quintile quintile 3 contain such workers consequently the average tax rates for the bottom three quintiles are largely unaffected by this policy option the average tax rate for the families in the top 40 of the income distribution however rises under policy option 1 the tax rate increases slightly for families in the fourth income quintile from 1102 to 1112 since only about 4 of these families contain worker earning more than 97500 the families in the top quintile however experience an 18 percent or 15 percentage point increase in their average tax rate the average tax rate increases by 20 to 32 percentage points for families in the top 10 of the income distribution policy option 2 raises the maximum taxable limit but reduces the tax rate so that total tax revenues remain unchanged since the policy is revenue neutral the average tax rate for all families is the same as for current law see the first row of table 1 the average tax rate for most families however does change the average rate falls for families in the bottom 80 of the income distribution quintiles 1 to 4 and increases for families at the top in general workers earning less than 105314 will pay less in payroll taxes than they do under current law workers earning more than this will pay more in payroll taxes the final option policy option 3 is blend of the first two policy options half of the increased revenue from raising the maximum taxable limit is used for financing the social security program and the other half offsets payroll tax rate reduction as was the case with policy option 2 this policy option reduces the average tax rates for families in the bottom 80 of the income distribution and increases it for families in the top income quintile for the richest 1 of families this option raises the average tax rate by 30 percentage points 82 increase the poorest 20 see their average tax rate fall by 04 percentage points or by about 4 table 2 provides an alternate view of the effects of the three policy options by reporting the simulated average dollar change in social security payroll taxes paid by families in different parts of the income distribution the reported dollar amounts include the change in both the employees and employers portion of the payroll tax it is important to keep in mind that family may contain more than one worker the dollar changes are consistent with the changes in the average tax rates reported in table 1 the first policy option increases the payroll tax for the average family by 548 this policy option does not affect families in the bottom two income quintiles and increases the tax payments for families in the middle quintile by only 2 on average the average family in the richest income quintile would pay 2194 more in taxes and the richest 1 of families would pay on average 14133 more in payroll taxes under this policy

tax base would be significantly less than expected because of indirect behavioral changes by workers based on this interpretation workers may respond to having more earnings subject to the payroll tax which in effect is reduction in earnings by reducing their work effort labor supply effect or shifting their income to forms that are not subject to th payroll tax taxable income effect these behavioral effects would thus reduce taxable earnings the proportion of family income subject to payroll taxes and tax revenue 16 as discussed below however recent research raises doubts concerning this position and suggests these behavioral effects would likely be negligible relatively few families would be negatively affected by the three policy options examined of the families with at least one worker about 10 contain worker earning more than the maximum taxable limit see table 3 families in the bottom two income quintiles contain workers earning more than the maximum taxable limit 97500

one worker for the few families with highearning workers changing the payroll tax rate can affect labor supply in two possible ways the first is the direct effect in which tax changes affect the wage received by the worker reducing wages could lead to reduction in work effort that is labor supply the empirical evidence indicates that mens labor supply is relatively inelastic that is changes in the wage have little effect on labor supply with estimated elasticities close to zero 17 in the past womens labor force behavior differed significantly from that of men this was especially true for married women but recent research indicates convergence in the labor force behavior of the sexes recent study suggests that over the past two decades womens labor supply elasticities have fallen and converged with that of men18 one study specifically examining the effect of the payroll tax on womens labor supply concludes there is work disincentive effect for women over 5019 since about 2 of women over 50 earn more than the maximum taxable limit few would potentially be affected by the three policy options analyzed furthermore this study is based on labor force data from the 1970sa time when womens labor supply was more responsive to wage changes 17 mark r killingsworth labor supply new york cambridge university press 1983 and richard blundell and thomas macurdy labor supply review

wage of one spouse affects the labor supply of the other spouse empirical studies however suggest married men are largely unresponsive to changes in their wives wages with estimated elasticities close to zero20 while womens labor supply however is thought to be responsive to changes in their husbands wage recent research suggests womens responsiveness has declined over the past two decades21 the cited studies suggest that raising the maximum taxable limit will have little effect on workers labor supply relatively few workers earn enough to be affected by such as policy change about 7 of all workers earn more than the maximum taxable limit additionally mens labor supply appears largely unaffected by changes in their own wage and their spouses wage and womens labor supply behavior has increasingly become like that of men and consequently they too appear largely unaffected by changes in their own wage and their spouses wage while work effort or labor supply may not be affected by changes in the payroll tax earnings subject to the payroll tax may be affected in the aggregate about threequarters of us families income comes from taxable earnings see the last column of table 3 of the rest most comes from earnings above the maximum taxable limit retirement income social security and pension income and investment returns interest dividends and rental income the proportion of family income from taxable earnings is over 80 for the bottom 80 of the income distribution while the richest 20 of families derive about 68 of their income from taxable earnings this proportion falls to under 50 for the richest 5 of families and to about 30 for the richest 1 consequently there may be some opportunities for workers with earnings more than the maximum taxable limit to shift their earnings to nontaxable form of compensation the economics research before 2000 generally suggests taxable income is responsive to changes in marginal tax rates 22 as marginal tax rates rise the pre2000 studies indicate taxpayers reduced their taxable income through tax avoidance strategies or tax evasion they can do this by increasing deductions to reduce taxable income or by taking compensation in forms that are untaxed such as stock options which are untaxed until exercised or subject to lower tax rates recent study however concludes that methodological problems lead to the estimated elasticities likely being overstated23 more recent research suggests that the earlier results may have been due to the behavior of few taxpayers in the extreme upper part of the income distribution24 several recent studies estimate that taxable income is much less responsive to changes in tax rates and suggest that relatively 20 paul j devereux changes in relative wages and family
