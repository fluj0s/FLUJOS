nonfederal resources the fy2007 request would have funded the national research initiative nri competitive grants program at 2475 million 663 million above the fy2006 level the proposed increase would have support ed initiatives in agricultural genomics emerging issues in food and agricultural secu rity the ecology and economics of biological invasions plant biotechnology and water secu rity in addition to supporting fundamental and applied science in agriculture usda c ontends that the nri makes significant contribution to developing the next genera tion of agricultural scientists the

science budget priorities throughout nasa are being driven by the vision for space exploration announced by president bush in january 2004 and endorsed by congress in the nasa authorization act of 2005 pl 109155 the vision includes returning the space shuttle to flight status then retiring it by 2010 completing the space station but discontinui ng its use by the united states by 2017 returning humans to the moon by 2020 and then sending humans to mars and worlds beyond constellati on systems the only rd program to receive large increase in the fy2007 request is responsib for developing vehicles to return humans to the moon the reduced rate of growth in requested funding for the science mission directorate tota l reduction of 31 billion through fy2010 relative to projections in the fy2006 request is mostly to offset higher than expected costs for returning the space shuttle to flight status the request for science has been particul arly controversial it includes full funding for

made possible by the increased resources of the doubling years with the projected biomed ical inflation index at 35 for fy2006 and 34 for fy2007 the nih budget has been losing ground in real terms

that extra funding had been included in od the senate od total was 20 million higher than the request the new pathway to independence award program 15 million in the request addresses nih concerns about the support of new investig ators particularly younger scientists making the transition from traini ng to independent research the average age at which they receive their first independent grant

at 361 million for fy2007 including an additional 3 million requested in ncrr sponsor of the current general c linical research centers program in addition to showing the appropriation by institute the other common way to describe the nih budget is by funding m echanism on average the ics devote more than 80 of their budgets to supportin g peerreviewed extr amural research by awarding research project grants research center grants contracts training grants construction grants and many other types of funding to researchers in universities and other institutions around the country the remaining 1520 of the ic budgetshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33345crs16 supports their intramural research programs and research management costs budget data displayed by funding mechanism rev eals the balance between extramural and intramural funding as well as the re lative emphasis on support of individual investigatorinitiated research versus f unding of larger projects comprehensive research centers agencydir ected research contracts research career training facilities cons truction and so forth the largest category research project grants rpgs represented 53 of the total nih request or 151 billion nih estimated it would support total of 37671 rpgs in fy2007 which was 656 fewer gran ts than the estimate for fy2006 the main reason for the drop was that large number of grants that were started toward the end of the doubling years were completin g their funding cycles the average length of an rpg award is just under four years but each years funds are awarded separately from that years appropriation within the rpg total about one quarter 9337 for 33 billion were to be competing new or competing renewal grants and the remaining threequarters were to be noncompeting continua tion grants the estimated number of competing rpgs woul d have been 275 more than the fy2006 number the request proposed that the av erage cost of competing rpg would not increase over the fy2006 level and that noncompeting grants would receive inflationary increases nih expected that the success rate of applicants receiving funding for competing rpgs would be about 19 the same as fy2006 compared with 22 in fy2005 during the doubling years the success rate averaged 30 32 in the request support for research centers would have grown by 23 to 28 billion research training grants would have remain ed at the fy2006 level 760 million research and development contracts would have increased by 44 million 16 to 27 billion because of the genes health and environment initiative the intramural research program 28 billion wa s slated to decrease by 9 million 03 research management and support would have increased by 14 million 13 to 11 billion extramural research facilities construction would have supported only the 25 million for biosafety labs with funds same as fy2006 for nonbiodefense extramural constr uction and funding for nihs own buildings and facilities remained at 89 million as noted above by moving the 25 million in facilities construction money from niaid to ncrr the house bill made the funds available for open competition instead of being limited to biodefense facilities the nih and other public health service agencies within hhs are subject to budget tap called the phs program eval uation transfer section 241 of the phs act which has the effect

in fy2006 constituted part of the explos ives countermeasures and support of components portfolios in the fy2007 request the request indicated that some activities most notably the counter m anpads program to protect commercial aircraft against portable ground toair missiles would conti nue at their current level of effort in fy2007 but re quired little additional budget authority because

pending the submission and approval of an expenditure plan in the st directorates main rdao account the house committee made 400 million unavailable for obligation until the under secretary reported on progress in addressing financial management deficiencies the senate transfer of st activities back to tsa was because the committee has repeatedly requested breakout of funding which st has fa iled

wildlife and natural habitats major research initiatives are carried out by usgs scientists who collect scientific information through research inventory and monitoring investigations these activities
