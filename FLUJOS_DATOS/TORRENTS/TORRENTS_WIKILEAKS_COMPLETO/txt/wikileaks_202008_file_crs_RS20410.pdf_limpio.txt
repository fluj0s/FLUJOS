negotiation by healthcare entities that but for their joint activity would normally be competitors would longer be considered unlawful sense of congress amendment states that medical decisions should be made by health care professionals and patients this report will set out briefly the present antitrust law and some relevant exemptions from it some pertinent parts of the statements of antitrust enforcement policy in health care1 and the major provisions of hr 1304 it will be updated to reflect changes in the legislative status of hr 1304 the relevant provision of current antitrust law is section 1 of the sherman act 15 usc 1 which prohibits contracts or conspiracies in restraint of trade when joint activity concerns pricing or output decisions it is not only prohibited but generally considered per violative of the antitrust laws ie automatic requiring detailed analysis of the circumstances surrounding and admitting of justification for the challenged activity2 section 1 is the provision which normally would be applicable tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20410crs2 2continued regulation of trade restrains the true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition on the other hand there are certain agreements or practices which because of their pernicious effect on competition and lack of any redeeming virtue are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and therefore illegal without elaborate inquiry as to the precise harm they have caused or the business excuse for their use ie per unreasonable northern pacific railway co v us 356 us 1 4 1958 3 see eg goldfarb v virginia state bar 421 us 773 787 activity that would normally be considered per unlawful if carried out jointly by individual competitors if carried out by an entity that is sufficiently integrated to have formed new entity with an identity apart from its individual components is however generally considered to be that of true joint venture and is treated not as per violative of the antitrust laws but analyzed under the antitrust rule of reason which balances the anticompetitive results of transaction against any procompetitive effect that might be produced by the activity see discussion infra re physician network joint ventures under the health care guidelines 4klors inc v broadwayhale stores inc 359 us 207 213 n 71959 sherman act is aimed primarily at combinations having commercial objectives see also state of missouri v now 620 f2d 1301

house judiciary committee at june 22 1999 hearings on hr 1304 presumably pitofsky was referring to physician negotiation directly about qualityofcare issues the agency has however prosecuted indirect joint action designed to achieve some likely permissible result see eg note 6 6in ftc v superior court trial lawyers assn 493 us 411 1990 the ftc challenged workstoppage by courtappointed attorneys allegedly instituted on behalf of the criminal defendants they served although the court was sympathetic to the attorneys arguments that the level of service to indigent defendants was significantly and adversely affected by the limited resources available to the attorneys and that the concerted action to get increased compensation was but means to secure higher quality service it said although the quality of representation may improve when rates are increased that fact is not an acceptable justification for an otherwise unlawful restraint of trade matter how altruistic the motives of respondents it is undisputed that their immediate objective was to increase the price that they would be paid for their services 493 us at 427 the arrangements made lawful in hr 1304 were justified as continuedjoint activities especially those pertaining to pricefees of entities engaged in commerce with the exception noted below at page 3 physicians are not exempt from the prohibitions of section 1 whether they agree on fees among themselves or as in the case under consideration in hr 1304 conclude an agreement in concerted negotiations with buyer of group members services health care professional joint negotiation with health plan3 joint action deemed noncommercial is not generally considered violative of the antitrust laws4 the ftc for example has never prosecuted case in which physicians have negotiated collectiv ely with health plan on an issue directly involving patient care5 nevertheless there is also some indication that only noncommercial entities which take concerted action to further some social welfare objective are completely protected even when they are driven by objectives which may be highly partisan6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20410crs3 6continued necessary to enhance the quality of patient care in the bill as introduced the legislation continues to be titled quality healthcare coalition act 7specifically 29 usc 157 8the recent decision of the house of delegates of the american medical association ama to form collective bargaining unit would have little impact on the current debate concerning the right of physicians to bargain collectively and would alter the current status of bargaining unit physicianemployees only in that they would when selecting bargaining unit representative as allowed by 29 usc 157 be able to choose the amasponsored union fewer than 20 or 108000 of physicians are in employed nonsupervisory positions that would make them currently eligible to bargain collectively 77 ntitrust trade regulation 34 july 8 1999 915 usc

90212 april 24 1990 antitrust immunity exemptions from the operation of the antitrust laws has specifically been provided in such areas as labor relations certain insurance practices and in instances in which private actors are thirdparty beneficiaries of the states socalled state action immunity brief discussion of the first two areas follows labor the antitrust statutory exemption declares that the labor of human being is not commodity or article of commerce 15 usc 17 it specifically authorizes the formation and existence of labor unions and recognizes the legitimate objects of members laborrelated activities pursuant to labor law employees here doctors who are employed by hospitals or health plans are granted collective bargaining rights by the national labor relations act7 and several sections of the norrisla guardia act 29 usc 101115 which expressly permit parties to labor dispute to act singly or in concert 29 usc 104 or prohibit federal courts from issuing injunctions in labor dispute on the ground that the participants are engage d in an unlawful combination or conspiracy 29 usc 105 the judicially created laborantitrust exemption which holds that congress desire to foster collective bargaining is best furthered by permitting employees who wish to jointly negotiate the terms of their employment to do so without fear of violating the antitrust laws requires the following 1 the practices being negotiated must inherently constitute mandatory subject of collective bargaining ie be bona fide terms or conditions of employment 2 the practices being negotiated should be more restrictive than is absolutely necessary to realize the goals it they purports to achieve 3 the practices must be embodied in valid genuinely negotiated collective bargaining agreement8 insurance mccarranferguson act9 15 us 1012b mandates not only that the business of insurance shall be regulated at the state level but also that act of congress shall be construed to invalidate impair or supercede any law enacted by any state for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance unless such act specifically relates to the business of insurance federal antitrust law does not specifically relate to the business of insurancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20410crs4 10in 1969 the supreme court decided that the business of insurance concerned the insurance relationship in securities

national health policy forum issue brief 72and neither the term nor its scope were defined in mccarranferguson accordingly some observers heldhold federal antitrust law inapplicable to any action undertaken by any member of the insurance industry position seemingly endorsed in the finding in hr 1304 as introduced that the mccarranferguson act has created an enhanced opportunity for market power of insurance companies in health care and has given such companies significant leverage over health care providers and patients reflected that confusion in fact as was indicated in testimony at the june 1999 hearings case law seems to indicate that the act probably does not either permit or authorize insurance companies to merge or to otherwise acquire or maintain market power10 although the mccarranferguson protectionimmunity available to the business of insurance does permit some joint action by insurance companies eg the sharing of actuarial data that might ultimately facilitate the acquisition of market power health care guidelines11 physician network joint ventures physiciancontrolled ventures in which the networks physician participants collectively agree on prices or pricerelated terms and jointly market their services are addressed in guideline number 8 which notes that typically such networks eg ipas or ppos12 contract with health plans to provide physician services to plan subscribers at predetermined prices and the physician participants in the network agree to controls aimed at containing costs and assuring the appropriate and efficient provision of high quality physician services13 the antitrusthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20410crs5 14those in which physician participants may not generally practice individually or affiliate with other networks or health plans ie may not either continue their individual practices or affiliate with other networks or plans 15ie the geographic market in which the group operates and from which it can reasonably expect its patients to come 1671 atrr special supplement at s16 risk sharing is used as an indicator of sufficient integration in the network to allow for treatment as single entity joint venture rather than as collection of competitors and eligible for rule of reason versus per antitrust analysis acceptable risksharing arrangements may include capitation fee withholds or other financial incentives eg performance targets and payment agreements under which participants agree to payment as predetermined percentage of plans premiums or revenue in accord with general antitrust principles physician network joint ventures will be analyzed under the rule of reason and will not be viewed as per illegal if the physicians integration through the network is likely to produce significant efficiencies that benefit consumers and any price agreements or other agreements that would otherwise be per illegal by the network physicians are reasonably necessary to realize those efficiencies id

1999 released may 20 1999safety zone for physician joint networks allows participation in exclusive networks14 by 20 percent or less of the physicians in each physician specialty with active hospital staff privileges in the relevant geographic market15 and 30 percent or less for bona fide nonexclusive networks and requires that participants in physician network joint venture must share substantial financial risk in providing all the services that are jointly prices through the network16 the guideline emphasizes however that merely because physician network joint venture does not come within safety zone in way indicates that it is unlawful under the antitrust laws17 the ftcs recent complaint against mesa county ipa18 illustrates the circumstances that will generally result in antitrust enforcement action paragraph six of the amended complaint states that the ipa was formed to promote the collective economic interests of mesa county physicians it has acted to restrain competition by among other things facilitating entering into and implementing agreements among its members express or implied to fix price and other competitively significant terms of dealing with payers or by collectively refusing to deal with payers paragraph twelve charges that the physician members of mesa county ipa have not integrated their practices to create efficiencies sufficient to justify their acts and practices part ii of the consent order mandates that the ipa directly or indirectly or through any corporate or other device in connection with the provision of physician services in or affecting commerce cease and desist from entering into adhering to participating in maintaining organizing implementing enforcing or otherwise facilitating any combination conspiracy agreement or understanding to 1 negotiate on behalf of any participating physicians with any payer or provider emphasis addedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20410crs6 19defined broadly to include any individual who

act of 1999 as noted above employees may currently negotiate jointly with their employers pursuant to either the nonstatutory laborantitrust exemption or the authorization contained in various provisions of 29 usc hr 1304 would extend that authorization to nonemployee independent physicians and other healthcare professionals19 it would create the legal fiction that for purposes of joint negotiation with nonfederally affiliated health plans20 they are employees entitled to the same treatment under the antitrust laws as are bargaining units which are recognized under the national labor relations act section 2a hr 1304 differs from the bargaining unit authorization in 29 usc 157 in that it expressly does not confer any right to participate in any collective cessation of service to patientssection 2c1 the labor provision expressly allows other concerted activities further the bill does not as does the nonstatutory laborantitrust exemption distinguish between mandatory and permissive subjects of bargaining any action taken in good faith reliance on the above authorization would not be subject to civil or criminal antitrust sanctions or to damages beyond actual damages incurred section 2b the bill which does not yet have any companion or similar legislation in the senate is as notable for what it does not contain as for the collective negotiation it sanctions there is limit on the subjects of that negotiation so that fees could be negotiated even with health plans that realistic ally exercise only minimal market power proposed amendment would have denied the negotiation exemption to any discussion of fees recently enacted similar but more limited legislation in texas21 on the other hand is specifically limited to physicians and requires that before fees may be negotiated the state attorne general must find that health plan enjoys substantial market power nor is there any requirement that negotiating unit either 1 be geographically or numericall circumscribed or 2 not contain more than single type of health care professional multistate or multidiscipline health care professional negotiating units consisting of eg all of the physicians rns lpns physical therapists etcin any size delineated area are theoretically possible the authority conferred by hr 1304 is limited to 3 years from the date of enactment after which time the general accounting office is to study the bills impact and make recommendations concerning its continuation sections 2d 2i
