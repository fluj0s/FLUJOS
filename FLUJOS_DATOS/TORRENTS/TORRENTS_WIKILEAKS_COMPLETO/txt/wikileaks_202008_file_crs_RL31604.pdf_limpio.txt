private individuals under the family and medical leave act fmla this report provides an overview of the supreme courts d ecision coupled with discussion of its significance for state immunity from privat lawsuits under other federal statutes overview of the family and medical leave act enacted in 1993 the family and medical leave act fmla2 was designed to aid workers who face the competing mands of the workplace and the family according to the acts findings employees who are ill or who are caring for child or sick relative are often forced to choose between their job security and family responsibilities3 congress also found that such caretaking demands typically constitute disproportionate burden on women who have historically been constrained by stereotypical assumptions about gender roles4 concerned that any leave policy that favored women over men would perpetuate gender stereotypes as well as cause employers to discriminate against women in hiring congress enacted the genderneutral fmla according to congress the purposes of the fmla are to balance the demands of the workplace with the needs of fa milies to promote the stability and ec onomic security of families and to allow workers to take reasonable leave to handle family or medical needs5 emphasizing that these goals should be met in manner that is consistent with the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment congress sought to reduce the potential for employment discrimination on the basis of sex andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31604crs2 6 id at 2601b4b5 7 id at 2612a1 8 id at 2617a13 9

enacting policy that grants leave to all eligible employees regardless of gender6 under the fmla employees may take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave under three specific circumstances these circumstances include 1 leave taken due to the employees own serious health condition 2 leave taken to care for the employees relative with serious health condition or 3 leave taken to care for an employees new child including child placed with th employee through adoption or foster care7 in order to enforce these leave provisions the act authorizes employees to sue for damages equitable relief and attorneys f ees if their rights have been violated8 likewise the federal gove rnment may sue employers on behalf of individual employees for damages and injunctive relief9 case history in nevada department of human resources v hibbs 10 state employee was fired for allegedly exceeding his 12 weeks of fmla leave to care for his ill wife contending that his fmla leave should run subsequent to not concurrent with the paid leave he had already taken the employ ee sued the nevada department of human resources for misapplying the fmla ruling fo r the state the district court dismissed the lawsuit on the grounds that the employee could not sue the agency because nevada is immune from private lawsuits under th eleventh amendment the court of appeals for the ninth circuit however reversed the distri ct courts decision11 shortly thereafter the supreme court granted certiorari12 and the court ultimately upheld the ninth circuits ruling that the fmla was enacted pursuant to valid exercise of congress 5 enforcement power and therefore did indeed constitute legitimate abrogation of state immunity from private suits13 notably the hibbs decision came in the wake of two similar sovereign immunity cases that the court had ruled on previously in kimel v florida board of regents and in board of trustees of university of alabama v garrett the supreme court held that federal statutes that target respectively age and disability discrimination do not validly abrogate state sovereign immunity becau they do not c onstitute appropriate enforcement legislation14 thus the hibbs case

which the court has generally ruled in favor of states righ ts in cases involving congressional abrogation of state sovereign immunity15 ii the legal background as noted above the hibbs case raised several important legal issues that stem from two different constitutional amendments namely the eleventh amendment and the fourteenth amendment each of these amendments as well as the supreme courts interpretation of them is described in this section the eleventh amendment and sovereign immunity the supreme court has long interpreted the eleventh amendment as protecting states from private suits brought in federal court16 under this doctrine of sovereign immunity however state is not immune from such suits if the state voluntarily and expressly waives such immunity or if the federal government validly abrogates the eleventh amendment in order to validly abrogate state sovereign immunity congress must both 1 unequivocally express its intent to abrogate that immunity and 2 act pursuant to valid exercise of power17 although the first part of the above st for congressional abrogation of immunity is easily satisfied if congress uses mistakably clear language to convey its intent to abrogate18 the second part of the test involves more complicated analysis under this test congress may act pursuant to valid exercise of power by means of its enforcement power under 5 of the fourteenth amendment19 indeed ever since the courts decision in seminole tribe v florida eliminated congressional authority tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31604crs4 20 517 us 44 1996 21 section 1 of the fourteenth amendment states in relevant part state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privile ges or immunities of citizens of the united states nor shall any state deprive any

of th few judicially approved mechanisms by which congress can enact statutes that permit private citizens to enforce federal legislation by suing state the fourteenth amendment and the section 5 enforcement power as noted above in order to determine wh ether statute has b een enacted pursuant to valid act of power court must be gin by examining the scope of congress enforcement power under th fourteenth amendment21 the supreme court has long recognized the sweeping powers guaranteed to congress under 5 of the fourteenth amendment22 congress 5 power is not confined to the enactment of legislation that merely parrots the precise wording of the f ourteenth amendment rather congress power to enforce the amendment include s the authority both to remedy and to deter violation of rights guaranteed th ereunder by prohibiting somewhat broader swath of conduct including that which is not itself forbidden by the amendments text23 in city of boerne v flores the supreme court described the limits of this enforcement power by noting that congress cannot decree the substance of the fourteenth amendments re strictions on the states24 according to the court congress may enforce the fourteenth amendment by enacting legislation that remedies or prevents constitutional violation but only the judicial bran ch may determine what constitutes constitutional violation25 thus congress can enact legislation that prohibits state conduct that vi olates the fourteenth ame ndment just as it can enact broader remedial legi slation but it may not enact substa ntive legislation that defines the scope of the constitutional requirements on states in order to distinguish between what constitutes appropriate remedial legislation and what constitutes forbidden substantive legislati on the boerne court held that when congress enacts remedial legislation the re must be congruence and proportionalityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31604crs5 26 id at 520 27 hibbs v nev dept of human res 273

to that end26 as the appeals court noted in hibbs the congruence and proportionality inquiry requires reviewing court 1 to identif with some precision the scope of the constitutional right at issue and 2 to determine whether the statute in question is an appropriate remedy for viol ations of that right27 iii supreme court review the supreme court granted certiorari in hibbs in order to review whether the family medical leave provision of the fmla is valid exercise of the 5 enforcement power that abrogates state immunity as not ed above the court ultimately upheld the family medical leave provision in 63 deci sion ruling that individuals may sue states in federal court for viol ations of the statute the eleventh amendment and sovereign immunity as noted above threshold question in sovereign immunity case is whether congress has unequivocally expr essed its intent to abrogate the eleventh amendment in kimel recent sovereign immunity case the supreme court held that an enforcement provision in the age discrimination in employment act which is identical to the enforcement provision in the fmla was clear expression of congressional intent to abrogate state sovereign immunity28 in hibbs therefore the court quickly determined that congress d satisfied the clear statement rule thus meeting the first part of the twopart test to determine whether or not the federal government has validly abroga ted state sovereign immunity29 however in order to determine whether the fmla was enacted pursuant to valid act of power the second prong of the twopart test the court was compelled to engage in detailed analysis of whether or not congress had legitimately exercised its enforcement authority under 5 of the fourteenth amendment the fourteenth amendment and the section 5 enforcement power in order to determine whether the family leave provision of the fmla was enacted pursuant to valid exercise of power the hibbs court used the twopart congruence and proportionality test to 1 id entify the constitutional violation that the statute in question is designed to prevent and 2 to determine whether the legislative record identifies actual constitutional violations that justify broad statutory remedy applying the first part of the congruen ce and proportionality test the court found that the constitutional right at issue in the fmla was the equal protection of the sexes sincehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31604crs6 30 id at 728 31 id at 72930 32 id at 730 33 id at 73035 34 id at 734 35 in spite of the garrett ruling the courts recent decision in tennessee v lane allowed disabled individual to sue the state for discri mination in its public services programs and activities the lane decision however was limited to cases involving violations of fundamental rights such as access to the courts tennessee v lane 021667 2004 us lexis 3386 may 17 2004the statute aims to protect the right to be free from genderbased discrimination in the workplace30 under the second element of the test the courts next inquiry was to determine whether the family leave provision of the fmla constitutes an appropriate remedy for sex discrimination the court began its task by evaluatin g whether congress had found sufficient evidence of unconstitu tional employment discrimination by the states noting that the courts own decisions reveal long history of state laws that discriminate against women in employment the majority in hibbs found that congress had originally attempted to remedy such discr imination by enacting title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 which abrogate d state sovereign immunity with regard to employment discrimination on the basis of sex31 despite the passage of title vii congress later found evidence that states had continued to re ly on invalid gender stereotypes in the employment context specifically in the administration of leave benefits32 thus prompting legislators to enact the fmla for example the legislative record behind the fmla reveals evidence that many states granted lengthy maternity leave but did not offer parallel paternity leave thereby reflecting stereotypical notions of caretaking roles and that some states with discretionary leave policies applied such policies in discriminatory fashion33 because the majority in hibbs found that congress could reasonably conc lude that such evidence reflected persistent pattern of unconstitutional employment discrimination by the states the court held that congress was justified in enacting the fmla as appropriate remedi legislation under its 5 enforcement power34 the majority distinguished the result in hibbs from the outcome in two other recent supreme court cases kimel and garrett that involved state sovereign immunity from suits under federal antidiscrimination statutes35 according to the courts analysis because age and disability discrimination are subj ect to rational basis review under the courts qual protection doctrine states may constitutionally differentiate between nonsuspect classes like age and disab ility if they demonstrate rational reason for doing so thus making it more difficult for congress to demonstrate pattern of unconstitutional state behavior that warrants remedial federal legislation under its 5 enforcement power sex disc rimination however receives heightened scrutiny which requires states and other governmental actors to prove that gender classifications are substantially related to an important governmental interest since it is more difficult for genderbased classifications to pass constitutional muster it ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31604crs7 36 nev dept of human res v hibbs 538 us 721 73537 2003 37 id at 73840 38 id at 737 39 the dissenting justices included justice

discrimination when suspect classifications like sex are involved36 in addition the hibbs court declared that the scope of the fmla was narrowly targeted to the violation at issue because for example th statute requires unpaid leave only and covers only certain employees and employers37 thus the majority concluded we believe that congress chosen remedy the familycare leave provision of the fmla is congruent and proportional to the targeted violation by creating an acrosstheboard routine employment benefit for all eligible employees congress sought to ensure that familycare leave would longer be stigmatized as an inordinate drain on the workplac caused by female employees and that employers could not evade leave obligati ons simply by hiring men by setting minimum standard of family leave for all eligible employees irrespective of gender the fmla attacks the formerly statesanctioned stereotype that only women are responsible for family caregiving thereby reducing employers incentives to engage in discrimination by basing hiring and pr omotion decisions on stereotypes38 the dissent although the majority opinion in hibbs garnered the support of six justices the remaining three justices joined in spirite d dissent that criticized the majority opinion on several grounds39 first the dissent criticized the proffered evidence of state employment discrimination arguing that both congress and the court had supplied evidence of discrimination by private employers but had failed to demonstrate an actual pattern of unconstitu tional behavior on the part of the states40 indeed the dissent specifically noted that several states had ready tackled the employment discrimination issue by enacting genderneutral leave policies before congress passed the fmla41 another criticism leveled by the dissent was that the fmla did not representappropriate remedial legislation but rather constituted substantive entitlement program imposed on the state 42 under this view the dissent argued that the fmla is benefit program designed to provide twelve weeks of leave and not remedial statute that requires states to provide leave on an equal basis43 drawing on these arguments the dissent contended that th fmla was not congruent and proportionalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31604crs8 44 id at 759remedial legislation and t hus was not valid abrogation of state sovereign immunity44 iv conclusion the supreme court held in hibbs that the family leave provision of the fmla was enacted pursuant to valid exercise of congress 5 enforcement power and therefore did indeed constitute legitimate abrogation of state immunity from private suits in doing so the court appears to be drawing in the sovereign immunity context the same line between statutes that protect suspect and nons uspect classifications as it has drawn in its equal prot ection doctrine although the hibbs decision represents departure from other federalism cases that have preserved state immunity despite congressional attempts to override such immunity the case does not necessarily represent an end to the trend in favor of states rights indeed state suit provisions under other federal statutes re main under legal attack in th federal courts and the two remaining leave provisions in the fmla ma also face constitutional challenges it is important to note however that even if th court finds other state suit provisions to be unconstitutional state employees whose statutory rights have been violated still have remedies available to them the pot ential consequences for state suit provisions under other federal laws as we ll as available alternative re medies are discussed below consequences for other federal laws although the supreme court affirmed th constitutionality of the family leave provision at issue in hibbs the remaining two leave provisions in the fmla may be affected by the courts ruling furthermore the hibbs decision also affects state suit provisions authorized under ot her federal statutes aimed at preventing discrimination some of the likely implications are discussed briefly below remaining fmla provisions individual suits against state employers under both the family childcare provision and the personal sick leave provision of the fmla are likely to be affected by the supreme courts decision in hibbs since hibbs upheld the family leave provision private suits against states under the fa mily childcare provision are also likely to be upheld ag ainst any future eleventh amendment challenges like family medical leave childcare leave would be defended on the grounds that it is intended to combat gende r discrimination and therefore constitutes appropriate 5 enforcement legislation capable of abrogating state immunity unlike family medical leave however the personal sick leave provision of the fmla cannot be justified as protecting against gender discrimination rather the personal sick leave provision has traditiona lly been defended on the grounds that it protects against discrimination based on temporary disability however in the wake of the supreme courts decision in garrett and in spite of the recent tennessee v lane case it appears highly unlikely that th court would uphold legislation based on disability discrimination as va lid 5 legislation indeed at least nine of the federal courts of appeals to consider the issue have held that state immunity is not validlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31604crs9 45 see eg brockman v wyo dept of family servs 342 f 3d 1159 1165 10th cir 2003 laro v new hampshire 259 f3d 1 11 1st cir 2001 lizzi v alexander 255 f3d 128

the government has alr eady conceded as much announcing that it is abandoning further constitutional defense of the abrogation of eleventh amendment immunity for the individual sick leave provision46 other federal laws as with the remaining fmla provisions the supreme courts decision in hibbs is likely to affect other federal statutes that contain state suit provisions given that the court in hibbs upheld the family leave provision as valid 5 enforcement legislation in part because it was intended to co mbat discrimination against suspect class state suit provisi ons authorized under other federal statutes aimed at preventing discrimination against suspect classes would likely be upheld as well for example prior to the hibbs decision statutory provisions authorizing private race or gender discrimination cl aims under titles vi or vii of the civil rights act or private suits under the equal pay act epa or title ix of the education amendments of 1972 had come under legal cha llenge despite the result in hibbs however disparate impact discrimination claims brought under these statutes remain susceptible to attack because the constitution prohibits disparate treatment onl private disparate impact claims may be perceived of as exceeding the scope of 5 in manner that lacks the requisite congruence and proportionality the federal c ourts have begun to hear sovereign immunity challenges to private its brought under these statutes with mixed results47 however detailed analysis of these cases is beyond the scope of this report alternative remedies regardless of which way the supreme court has ruled in past cases or will rule in future cases involving sovereign imm unity challenges to statutory provisions authorizing suits against the states indi viduals

authorized suits against the states state immunity from suit would not necessarily be absolute for example under the fmla the federal g overnment is authorized to bring suits against states in federal court on behalf of individual plaintiffs48 and such authority is typically available under other fe deral statutes that create rights of action against state employers furthermore despite state immunity from suits seeking money damages under the doctrine of ex parte young federal courts have limited jurisdiction over suits for prospective injunctive relief filed against state officials acting in their official capacities49 thus state employee may be able to sue his supervisors for injunctive relief even if his suit against the state agency is blocked by the eleventh amendment another enforcement alternative is available when statutes that provide federal funding impose the requirement that states waive their immunity from private suit in exchange for federal funds50 although the fmla is not such statute conditioning waiver upon receipt of federal funds is one way in which congress may secure an individuals right to sue under othe r antidiscrimination legislation51 finally states may voluntarily waive immunity by passing legislation that permits enforcement of state leave laws in state court52
