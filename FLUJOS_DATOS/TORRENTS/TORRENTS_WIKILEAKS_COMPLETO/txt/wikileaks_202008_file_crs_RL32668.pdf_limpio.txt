joanna stavins comparis on of social costs and benefits of paper check presentment and ecp with truncation new england economic review julyaug 1997 p 33electronic banking the implementation of the check 21 act background the general purpose of the provisions of the check clearing for the 21st century act check 21 act is to allow banks to take advantage of the efficiencies and the potential cost savings of processing checks electronically the term bank as specified in the act is used to include commercial banks savings institutions credit unions and the banklike functions of the us postal service and the us treasury the us banking system processes more than 40 billion checks annually but only fraction of these checks is processed electronically the cost savings of electronic processing are unknown because estimates of the cost of using check and the number of checks written each year remain in dispute as result estimates of cost savings range from 14 billion annually for truncation1 alone to 68 billion for replacing checks with fully electroni c straight through processing2 most of the savings from clearing checks electronically come from eliminating some or all of the handling sorting nd physically transporting of checks to the paying bank under the law before check 21 bank that presents check for payment must present the original chec k the paying banks could get around this law according to the uniform commercial code ucc sec tions 3501b2 and 4100 by negotiating processing agreements that make it unnecessary to physically present the paper check but since the benefits of electronic check clearing are not uniformly dispersed among the participan ts banks have found it difficult to obtain these agreements thus constraining the widespread adoption of various forms of electronic check clearing the most efficient form of electronic check clearing is one in which there is paperwork in the pro cess this is called straight through processing stp the recipient of check is paid electronically by debiting the payers bank account as soon as the check is presented the check 21 provisions fall short of stp consequently the cost savings are not as great as some other alternative electronic clearing processes ch as internet billpay or debit card paymentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32668crs2 3 see httpwwwfederalreservegovboar ddocspressbcreg2004 20040726defaulthtmthe legislation on december 17 2001 the federal reserv board fed sent proposed check truncation act cta to both the house financial services committee and the senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs the feds proposed legislation would have authorized th creation of substitute checks an electronically produced instrument that allows banks to truncate the original check clearing process and complete the process with an electronically generated image replacement document ird substitute ch eck the customers would receive the substitute check which would be the legal equivalent of the original check the concept was supported by americas co mmunity bankers the american bankers association the consumer bankers ssociation and the financial services roundtable they argued that the legisl ation would enable the industry to garner cost savings and speed up the check clear ing process for consumers the opposition to the bills came from the consumers union supported in its testimony by the consumer federation of america the us public interest re search group and the national consumer law center they wanted consumers accounts to be fully protected from disputes caused by the use of substitute checks the consumer would be made whole while the di spute is being resolved on june 5 2003 the house of repres entatives passed h r 1474 the check clearing for the 21st century act of 2003 and sent it to the senate banking committee on june 27 2003 the full senate passed the check truncation act of 2003 s 1334 the major differences between the bills were mainly in the area of consumer protection the nate cta was more generous than the house bill in its consumer protection provisions for exam ple s 1334 gave consumers 40 days to file an expedited recredit claim while hr 1474 would have given 30 days in addition the senates cta shifted the burden of docum entation more to the banks and less to consumers than the original hr 1474 the senate

critical cons ideration in the development of the check 21 law from the feds initial legisla tive proposal in 2001 this is evident in the extensive provisions concerning warranties indemnities and expedited recredits for consumers and banks the stronges t opposition to the check 21 act came from the consumers union cu its views in testimony were supported by the consumer federation of america the us public interest re search group and the national consumer law center the cu argued that the act would make it impossible for an estimated 458 million us households who are currently getting their paper checks back to continue to do so 9 cu stated that these consumers wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32668crs7 9continued supported by consumer federati on of america us public interest research group and the national consumer law center httpf inancialserviceshousegovhearingsasp formmodedetailhearing204 10see httpwwwconsumersunionorgfinancecheckwc102htmbe less protected from fraud under the check 21 act than under the existing check clearing process when there ar disputes about errors in the check payment process consumers would longer be able to verify their signatures and the accuracy of the amounts paid to payees from the original checks the consumers union suggested changes in the proposed legislation that would significantly increase consumer protection when checks are cleared electronically these changes focused mainly on the recrediting procedure10 first the cu wanted to extend the recredit provisions in the act to all checks where the original checks are not returned to the consumer and there is claim of improper payment or warranty claim this amendment would expand th indemnification c overage beyond the substitute checks in the check 21 act it could extend coverage to more than 20 of all bank checks that are currently not returned to customers and more than 80 of credit unions drafts that are also not returned to their members financial institutions opposed this extension because it would significantly raise financial institutions cost of handling disputed checks and drafts they argued that the protection was unnecessary and pointed to credit unions that have not returned checks since 1980 with almost complaints or problems the protection was not extended beyond the substitute check in the check 21 act second the consumers union argued that 10 days is too long for consumers to not have access to the disputed funds due to the use of the substitute check it preferred the expedited recredit provisions in the feds original proposal that the disputed amount of the payment would be credited to the consumers account by the close of the next bank business day after receiving the claim the purpose of the provision is to reduce consumer inconvenien ce due to the use of the substitute check however the check 21 act provides for recredit after 10 business days which the banking industry argues is appropriate in practice so banking analysts believe that most banks will recredit the accounts before the 10th business day third cu would have liked to rais the expedited recredit amount from 2500 to 5000 in hr 1474 disputed substitute checks for up to 2500 would be automatically recredited by the next business day while the dispute is being resolved cu sought to have the expedited recr edit limit raised to 5000 because the size of the amounts of these transactions is exp ected to increase over time in addition cu sought to shorten the number of days required to complete the overall recrediting process to less than 20 days financial institutions on the other nd prefer the longer time to clear up disputed checks in order to make sure that corrections are made accurately these suggested changes however could significantly raise the cost to financial institutions to the point where it is longer costefficient to adopt check truncation in pl 108100 the expedited recredit amount stayed at

20041104482gtl4ofromwashregua counter to the cus argument for prot ection against processing errors is that in cases where check truncations have been used for years processing errors are practically nonexistent and when they occu r they are quickly resolved asked by senate banking committee chairman richard shelby how many complaints she has received from credit union members about ectronically produced copies of checks the president and chief executive office of the nih federal credit union said that over period of 14 years she had receive d none in response to question from senator john sununu the vice chairman of th federal reserve system said that in his seven years on the fed boa rd he has never heard of case in which checks were doubledebited11 the already declining use of checks the overall number of checks being writte n has been declining partly because the fed is already truncating three million checks day for its member banks12 and additional checks are being truncated by private banking associations as well however the majority of banks use the tr aditional paper check clearing process the federal reserve with the rgest single check clearing operation closed 13 of its 45 checkclearing centers in 200313 and announced plans to shut down nine more in 2005 and 2006 the fed estimates that 2004s check processing will fall 9 from 2003s and further 13 to 15 in 200514 as consequence of the expected decline in the use of checks the fed has increased its fees for processing check by almost 8 to cover the increased cost per check cleared15 the decline in the number of checks being processed is not due to th just implemented check 21 but it is due to the growing popularity of alterna tive payment methods including debit transactions and online payments in ddition because of the rapid consolidation taking place in the banking industry more checks are being cleared inside the mega banks as internal settlements of these alternatives the most significant is the growth in automated clearinghouse ach trans actions achs are electronic payment systems that are run by the fed and privat banking organizations they are mainly large volume electronic payment systems

ach payments is the single most important reason for the dec line in paper check processing17 banks adaption to check 21 the check 21 act is not likely to significantly accelerate the decline in number of checks being processed in the near future while more checks will be processed electronically under check 21 the original checks will just be replaced by the substitute check after check 21 is implemented the major banks such as citibank bank of america and wells fargo are likely to increase their use of the substitute check at first because of the initial cost of devices used in producing the substitute checks or irds experts expect that most smaller banks will not already have the installed technology to gene rate substitute checks and the cost of acquiring the technology will stop them fro m participating in the check 21 process in 2003 an ird cost about 510 cents an item making the substitute check more costly to clear then than paper check right now18 some of the nations largest banks are said to be budgeting 100 million to 200 million for tr uncation hardware and software19 for the typical smaller community bank the price tag runs between 250000 and 400000 according to several experts in contrast according to an independent community bankers of america survey last year most community banks 46 had budgeted less than 50000 fo r 2004 technology spending20 even though the cost of producing substitute checks is expected to decline rapidly initial up front cost of clearing checks is expected to increase under check 21 another reason for the higher cost initially is that banks are now using multiple presentment formats paper electronic and ird the fed and private check clearinghouses provide clearing services in all three format s for banks receiving the substitute checks back office paperwork operations including the sorting and handling is not eliminated even with check 21 banks will still need their back office operations and they may have to ma ke additional investments in these back office operations to accommoda efficient management the substitute checks along with the original checks some bankers believe that they should wait until straight through processing stp becomes more popular stp is an entirely electronic clearing environment that would combine checks into the same stream as debit and credit cards atm and point of sales clearing httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32668crs10 conclusion the check 21 act establishes an electr onic check clearing mechanism in which banks may voluntarily generate image replacement documents in place of checks however in terms of using and being re sponsible for the physical substitute checks banks are mandated to participate in the new mechanism whether bank employs electronic check clearing depends on how well it fits with the banks business strategy bankers faced with expensiv technology adoption costs would not be likely to adopt check truncation if their cu stomers place high value on the float and on receiving their canceled checks large banks with millions of checking accounts supported this legislation and are expected to be the greatest beneficiary of this law smaller banks would have to increase th eir technology spending far beyond what they do now with the expectation of capturi ng fewer benefits or savings than the larger banks however even some of th large banks which are heavily invested in other forms of payment such as inte rnet banking and credit and debit cards that have electronic clearing processes may view check 21 as unwelcome competition they may oppose initiating use of substitute check themselves and as the act is implemented many of these large banks may refuse to go beyond meeting their legal responsibilitie s in the new process the new system may also confuse consumers who receive few or visible benefits from it in sum check 21 places the check clearing process in kind of way station between paper check clearing and fully electronic processing the latter is more efficient but is of concern to many consumers electronic clearing is also most welcomed by banks and recipients of f unds because it is faster and actually less prone to error over the years the pa yment system has improved by adding micr encoding to speed up the old system and debit cards and online bill paying with other forms of payment these additions have gained enoug h popularity to completely replace paper checks for some customers check 21 is yet another way to shift out of paper checks into electronic clearing many banks may not participate fully because check 21 to them is too temporary to make the required investment now
