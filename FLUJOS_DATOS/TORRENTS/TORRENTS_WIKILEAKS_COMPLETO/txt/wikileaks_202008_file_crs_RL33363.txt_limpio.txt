109th congress updated october 31 2006 william g whittaker specialist in labor economics domestic social policy division congressional research service the library of congress the davisbacon act issues and legislation during the 109th congress summary the davisbacon act 1931 as amended requires among other things that not less than the locally prevailing wage be paid to workers employed in federal contract construction through recent decades the act has become continuing source of contention some raise questions should the act be modified strengthened repealed can it be administered effectively and fairly adopted in 1931 at the urging of the hoover administration the act was regarded as an emergency measure intended to help stabilize the construction industry and to encourage employment at fair wages ie not less than those prevailing in the locality of the covered work it was amended in 1935 and its scope broadened in 1964 fringe benefit component was added subsequently davis bacon provisions have been incorporated within numerous federal program statutes the original davisbacon act was relatively simple statute which it was assumed the secretary of labor would have little difficulty administering however the nature of the statute changes within the construction industry and extension of the act to wide range of program statutes seem to have created complications by the 1950s some had begun to urge major amendment or repeal of the act through the rulemaking process the department of labor has modified application of the statute but controversies continue serious oversight of the statute commenced during the early 1960s and continued through the mid1990s since then there seems to have been general acquiescence toward the statute during the fall of 2005 the act was suspended for two months in the wake of hurricane katrina but then restored to its full effect among issues raised with respect to davisbacon have been the following revision of the database upon which prevailing wage rates are based expansion of the conditions under which helpers generally unskilled or semiskilled workers can be employed on davisbacon projects revision of the operational concept of site of the work for davisbacon purposes and updating of the prevailing wage determination process and the coverage threshold oversight has not resulted in conclusive resolution of issues surrounding the davisbacon act debate continues with respect to the application of the act to specific program statutes should all or most federal andor federally assisted contract construction be covered by prevailing wage requirement should the act apply in cases where indirect federal funding mechanisms are used ie tax credits andor revolving loan funds what is or has been

act of 1931 as amended requires that not less than the locally prevailing wage be paid to workers employed under federal construction contracts1 it also affects manpower utilization on such projects for example the employment of helpers or unskilledsemiskilled general utility workers with respect to the implementation of the act congress has assigned wide administrative responsibility to the secretary of labor but legislative oversight has continued more or less continuously at least since the 1950s through the years davisbacon provisions have been written into numerous program statutes application of the act to these and to new legislative programs has continued to spark congressional interest some have urged that the prevailing wage statute is as important now as it was in the 1930s others contend that the requirement should be set aside in order to stretch construction dollars by permitting payment of less than locally prevailing rates frequently the davisbacon or prevailing rate question has been contested within the context of program statutes in which wages were not central focus though nonetheless of considerable importance introducing the davisbacon act in 1931 at the urging of the hoover administration congress enacted prevailing wage legislation for federal contract construction legislation cosponsored by representative robert bacon rny and senator james davis r pa ie the davisbacon act2 the act was significantly amended in 1935 and its scope broadened in 1964 the definition of prevailing wage was expanded to include fringe benefits component otherwise the act remains essentially in its 1935 form3 although there have been intermittent efforts to repeal the davisbacon act and the 1 40 usc 31413148 davisbacon provides wage floor to recruit and retain skilled workforce contractors may be forced by the market to pay wages in excess of those found under davisbacon to be prevailing in the locality of the construction work 2 robert bacon had engaged in banking in new york prior to his election to the house of representatives in 1922 james davis had served as secretary of labor in the cabinets of presidents harding coolidge and hoover prior to his election to the senate in 1930 3 for quick historical overview of the act see crs report 94408 the davisbacon act institutional evolution and public policy by william g whittaker crs2 related copeland antikickback act 19344 such initiatives have been consistently rejected by congress which has through the years added davisbacon requirements to numerous individual program statutes the structure and context of davisbacon the davisbacon act requires that federal and some federally assisted construction contracts specify the minimum wage rates to be paid to the various categories of laborers working under those contracts minimum wages are defined as those rates of pay found by the secretary of labor to be prevailing b in the locality of the project c for similar crafts and skills d on comparable construction work the concept of locality is usually but not necessarily always county or metropolitan area normally construction work is divided into four categories residential nonresidential buildings highway and heavy construction the act does not require that collectively bargained union wages be paid unless such wages happen to be prevailing in the locality where the work takes place further the prevailing rate for davisbacon purposes represents floor not necessarily the rate that construction firm will have to pay in order to recruit and retain qualified workers5 typically the department of labor dol conducts two types of wage rate determinations general area determinations and where necessary specific project determinations dol sometimes collects data through direct survey process more often it works from data provided by contractors trade unions and other interested parties it may use both methods jointly the act requires that the advertised specifications for every construction contract in excess of 2000 to which the united states or the district of columbia is party must specify the wage that the secretary of labor determines to be prevailing in the locality for the various classes of laborers and mechanics employed on the covered work speaking generally dol does not recognize unskilled or semiskilled helpers as class of workers for wage rate determination purposes rather it evaluates workers by craft thus employers are discouraged from employing helpers on davisbacon projects turning to more skilled craftspersons instead dol does however recognize apprentices and encourages the employment on davisbacon projects of persons enrolled in bona fide apprenticeship programs6 4 some employers it was alleged had paid the prevailing wage to their workers but then demanded rebates or kickbacks to end this practice congress passed the copeland anti kickback act in 1934 pl 73324 though not part of the davisbacon act it operates in tandem with that statute and in policy terms is usually part of the davisbacon debate 5 there does not appear to be any systematic analysis of the gap if any between the floor provided by the davisbacon act and the wages actually paid to construction workers on covered projects 6 with the fitzgerald act in 1937 29 usc 50 ff the federal government assumed an oversight role with respect to apprentice training workers enrolled in programs recognized continued crs3 supplemented by other statutes work under davisbacon is covered by workhours and health and safety standards legislation though the latter are not part of the davisbacon act per the related 1934 copeland antikickback act requires weekly reporting of wages actually paid with an affirmation from employers that any deductions from wages due to employees were proper davisbacon applies to direct federal construction alteration or repair of public buildings and public works including painting and decorating where the contract is in excess of 2000 further davisbacon provisions have been written into numerous federal program statutes some states have enacted little davisbacon acts these state statutes however normally differ from each other and from the federal davisbacon act7 in general labor standards for federal contract procurement are governed by three statutes the davisbacon act applies only to federal contract construction the walshhealey public contracts act 1936 deals with labor standards with respect to goods produced under contract for the federal government the mcnamaraohara act 1965 popularly known as the service contract act deals with labor standards under federal service contracts these statutes do not apply to fully private sector work in addition there is the more general contract work hours and safety standards act 1969 the latter an amalgam of earlier federal workhours and safety enactments although the federal contract labor standards statutes supplement each other ie for construction goods and services they have different wage floors different triggering mechanisms and other requirements and are applied differently with respect to the various types of federal contract work8 the purposes of the act in the 1920s the federal government undertook major program of public works as the nation moved into depression after 1929 this program had important implications for the areas where the work was to be performed however given the 6 continued by the department of labor or in cooperating state programs receive specified training which when complete results in credential certifying the competence of the graduate journeyman the credential is portable ie recognized throughout the country such programs are usually funded jointly by the employer and the apprentice through temporarily reduced wage and often by contribution from the trade union in the craft the reduced wage option which increases normally with the systematic improvement in the skills of the apprentice tends to encourage employment of apprentices on davisbacon projects some open shop ie nonunion firms however prefer to train workers independently 7 see crs report rs20940 the little davisbacon acts and state prevailing wage standards by william g whittaker 8 for more extended but critical account of these statutes and their administration see armand j thieblot jr

rl32086 federal contract labor standards statutes an overview by william g whittaker crs4 depth of the economic catastrophe and the scope of unemployment any opportunity for work almost without regard to wage rates or conditions under which the work was to be performed was attractive both to workers and to struggling firms federal construction contracts were normally awarded to the lowest responsible bidder process that appears to have limited the options of the various federal agencies when selecting contractor treatment of workers and payment of fair wages were not taken into account the result some argued was the sacrifice of product quality and labor standards for shortterm economy certain itinerant contractors employing workers imported from lowwage parts of the country were able or believed to be able to underbid local contractors for federal construction work in this way it was alleged flybynight operators would win contracts based upon the payment of substandard wages to workers desperate for employment but sometimes lacking mature andor appropriate skills and then produce an inferior quality of construction in that manner the positive rehabilitative economic impact of public building and public works projects for the various localities was reduced to the disadvantage both of local contractors and local workers alike9 in drafting the davisbacon act congress was not searching for the cheapest available labor for federal construction work rather it prescribed payment of not less than the locally prevailing wage in order in part to protect fair local contractors and workers residing in and employed in local markets from contractors and low wage crews from outside of the area of construction work thus the original davis bacon act was as much protection for fair contractors as for workers10 however supporters have contended there is essential conflict between the purposes of the statute and securing bargain for the public agency consumer the taxpayer the prevailing wage statute preceded the fair labor standards act 1938 with its minimum wage provisions and was thus somewhat new concept in federal labor standards law11 davisbacon was viewed as device that might help to ensure quality of construction to stabilize the local economy and industry and to make the 9 during the late 1920s and early 1930s the contracting community appears to have been very much concerned about establishment of quality controls ethical standards and fair competition see for example gf schlesinger responsibility as prerequisite the constructor aug 1928 pp 2425 5561 irresponsible contractor defined the constructor aug 1928 pp 3536 51 horst accomplishments in cooperation elimination of irresponsibility marks progress of the industry the constructor

requirement did not preclude award of contracts to outside contractors it simply ensured that local labor standards would not be undercut 11 late in the 19th century the states had begun to enact prevailing wage laws with respect to public construction see david b johnson prevailing wage legislation in the state monthly labor review aug 1961 pp 839845 crs5 federal government indirectly through its power as consumer model for private sector employers with respect to labor standards12 continuing process in 1931 the davisbacon legislation was regarded as an emergency measure it sparked little controversy at the time of its enactment and from review of the hearings and debates of that period it seems clear that congress anticipated none of the administrative problems that would ensue few of the terms or concepts embodied within the statute were defined provision was made for predetermination of the prevailing wage rate only after bid was submitted and contract awarded would contractor learn what his wage obligations might be how disputes were to be adjusted was not specified it was assumed that the secretary of labor would have little difficulty enforcing the act but complications were soon to arise almost immediately restructuring of the act commenced as congress and the administration each began process of reassessment in early 1932 in an effort to preempt action by the congress president hoover moved to strengthen administration of the statute through executive order 577813 although congress proceeded with general oversight of the act and ultimately adopted reform legislation that initiative was vetoed by president hoover14 the copeland anti kickback act 1934 helped ensure that the appropriate rates would be paid without improper deductions then in 1935 congress approved basic changes to the statute the 1935 amendments reduced the coverage threshold from 5000 to 2000 b extended coverage from only public buildings as in the original enactment to construction alteration andor repair including painting and decorating of public buildings or public works and c required that the locally prevailing davisbacon wage rates be predetermined that is prior to solicitation of bids and that they be written into bid solicitations15 12 some have questioned whether given the fair labor standards act after 1938 there was continuing need for davisbacon prevailing wage protection 13 proclamations and executive orders herbert hoover march 4 1929 to march 4 1933 washington gpo 1974 vol ii pp 10661067 14 these reform initiatives are discussed in us congress senate relationship between employees and contractors on public works report pursuant to sres 228 hrept 74 332 part 2 74th cong 1st sess washington gpo may 13 1935 pp 79 15 reduction of the coverage threshold appears to have been motivated by at least two considerations first contracts for painting and decorating were often too small to come under the 5000 figure second it appears that some contractors artfully divided work into small parcels in order to avoid davisbacon coverage reducing the threshold to 2000 was viewed as means through which to extend coverage crs6 the debate over davisbacon by the 1950s congress had begun to add davisbacon provisions to various program statutes in which federal funding made the work possible but such extensions of coverage which would involve new and different types of contract work and new body of contractors seem to have sparked increased uneasiness with the act despite numerous efforts by davisbacon critics however proposals to weaken the prevailing wage legislation were uniformly rejected by congress through the years arguments for and against davisbacon have become largely fixed so have counter arguments of defenders and critics the logic and many of the assumptions these arguments contain have been questioned at length in the evolving debate few contentions about the act have gone or are likely to go unchallenged on both sides there are truths that advocates tend to accept without question current policy debate has focused upon change to amend the act whether to strengthen it or to diminish its impact or to repeal the statute outright outlined below are some of the arguments advanced by critics and by defenders of davisbacon expressed in summary as each side in the ongoing debate might state them some of these arguments pro and may not appear on the surface to be consistent but then not all critics or defenders of the act can be expected to make precisely the same assumptions further hardly phrase of either set of arguments has passed without refutation and counterrefutation16 perspectives of davisbacon critics some critics of davisbacon argue that the act is inflationary unnecessarily increasing public construction costs that it is difficult to administer that it has frequently been inequitably administered and that it hampers competition especially with respect to small and minorityowned businesses that may be unfamiliar with federal contracting procedures and lack the staff to deal with the requirements such procedures impose they contend that the act impedes efficient manpower utilization limiting the use of helpers or general utility workers some argue were davisbacon restrictions absent that contractors would be able to restructure the work to be performed dividing tasks into less complex assignments in order to make practical the employment of workers who may be less skilled and who are also less expensive to employ the result they argue would be increased efficiency and they suggest this would likely open more employment opportunities to minorities and women allowing them to gain work experience and onthejob training while reducing the costs of public construction 16 among trade unionists the davisbacon act affects primarily persons involved in the building and construction trades where the statute seems to have general support critics of the act however are more diverse group in some measure industry is split in policy terms the division of opinion seems to be more often philosophical reflecting basic attitudes toward labormanagement relations rather than division along partisan political lines the distinctions are not always neatly drawn crs7 besides critics note the davisbacon act 1931 1935 was enacted before there were federal minimum wage standards with the general minimum wage floor established under the fair labor standards act 1938 they suggest the davisbacon act is longer needed that is that super minimum wage for federal construction work is both unnecessary and inequitable they assert that labor costs for federal construction could be reduced with savings for the taxpayer if actual local market wages were paid rather than administratively determined locally prevailing wages which some argue may often be union rates17 in addition they urge simplification of the copeland acts reporting requirements arguing that simple declaration of compliance would have equal effect that compliance with existing law is onerous bureaucratic and that reports are rarely even examined perspectives of davisbacon supporters supporters of davisbacon often contend that the act prevents cutthroat competition from flybynight firms that undercut local wages and working conditions and compete unfairly with local contractors that the act helps stabilize the local construction industry an advantage to workers and employers alike the act they suggest may tend to assure the consuming agency of higher quality work since employers required to pay at least the locally prevailing wage are likely to hire more competent and productive workers resulting in better workmanship less waste reduced need for supervision and fewer mistakes requiring corrective action18 this may lead to fewer cost overruns and more timely completion of public construction and in the longterm lower rehabilitation and repair needs thus some argue the davisbacon act could actually save the taxpayer money on public construction supporters of the act also argue that davisbacon deters contractors from fragmenting construction tasks in order to utilize lowwage and lowskill helpers or pickup crews some argue that without davisbacon and in the absence of collective bargaining agreement contractors would probably be unlikely to provide training beyond the necessary and narrow requirements of the job and would not likely enter into formal program such as those monitored by dols bureau of apprenticeship and training reducing or eliminating apprenticeship programs in the construction industry might work to the disadvantage of minority and women workers who are entering the building trades in growing numbers in addition some assert that if helpers are substituted for skilled craft workers it would likely be minorities and some women who might be laid off or forced into lowerwage jobs that failed to take advantage of their skills 17 again one needs to recall that the davisbacon prevailing rate is floor not necessarily the rate that employers will actually have to pay dol suggests that union rates are used only where they are found to be prevailing in locality 18 conversely some argue that in the fully private sector there is significant amount of quality construction work that is performed without davisbacon protection crs8 what do we really know about the impact of the davisbacon act perhaps the most frequently asked question concerning the davisbacon act is how much money could be saved if davisbacon were repealed or modified to narrow its scope the short and honest answer is probably one really knows conversely does davisbacon save money for the federal government in its purchases of construction for example employment of more highly skilled workers on davisbacon projects here again response may also be uncertain davisbacon literature is extensive and diverse much of it in the form of public materials ie agency reports and analyses journalists have taken continuing interest in the act resulting in substantial popular literature serious academic studies may be fewer it is extremely difficult for an independent scholar to review the administration of the act to assess its impact first there is the scope of the task vast numbers of projects scattered throughout the united states administered by different agencies and involving hundreds of contractors and subcontractors working under dissimilar circumstances and in diverse labor markets second there is the problem of the availability of documentation since the contractors involved are of the private sector how much information has been preserved third access presents problem assuming that the data and documents have been preserved and could be made available securing such documentation and access to administrative personnel may be problematic both from the private sector contractors workers and unions and from the various public agencies if one assumes that documentation exists access is allowed that all of the parties are cooperative and that the means financial and other are available for such an undertaking there remains fourth complication the analyst would be comparing something that did happen with something that in fact for whatever reasons did not happen payroll records labormanagement relationships availability of skilled workers quality of supervision internal agency memoranda etc all relate to an actual project and not to what might have happened under other circumstances in the absence of davisbacon requirement would the contract have gone to the same contractor if so or if not would the contract have been managed in the same way did the act have any impact upon the wages actually paid or upon workforce utilization without davisbacon would different workers have been employed the work of governmental researcher may be further complicated by political or public policy considerations19 for all of these reasons there appear to be significant gaps in our knowledge of the act and of its administration despite oversight by congress extensive study by public and private agencies and the work of individual scholars further few studies 19 see also crs report 94908 davisbacon the act and the literature by william g whittaker crs9 of the act whether public or private have escaped criticism on grounds of flawed methodology or inadequate sample size thus precise estimates of impacts ought to be viewed with considerable caution20 some areas of continuing concern the davisbacon act has been focus of legislative and administrative consideration dol has instituted its own reform initiatives most notably during the reagan administration but these have often proven contentious and have resulted in prolonged litigation among areas of continuing concern and controversy are those discussed below the helper issue the davisbacon act makes mention of helpers nor does it refer to trainees apprentices or other skill groups rather it refers to various classes of laborers and mechanics and then leaves up to the secretary of labor the determination of just what those various classes might be and how they might be distinguished one from the other but just what is helper and how might he or she be differentiated from laborer or skilled construction worker an equally contentious issue has been whether the use of helpers is common or prevailing practice in the locality of proposed federal construction project21 setting out the issue under davisbacon before bids are solicited the minimum locally prevailing wage rate is determined for each category of worker that might be used on the project where helper category is not recognized in the locality of the projected construction craft or laborer rates have to be paid potentially but not necessarily increasing the labor cost of such construction on the other hand recognition of helper category where it is not common or prevailing area practice could defeat the purposes of the act ie allowing contractors to fragment tasks so that lowskilled lowwage helpers could be employed instead of laborers and craft workers resulting in downward wage spiral further some 20 distinction needs to be made between labor costs and project costs higher labor costs could result in lower project costs if more efficient and more skilled workers are employed but as practical matter to what extent are actual project costs governed by the requirements of the davisbacon act might they reflect the manner of federal agency oversight and monitoring of the progress of the work is federal construction work supervised as closely as that of the private sector what might be the impact of other federal requirements style of constructionarchitecture especially for ceremonial buildings is cost impacted by various set asides for sheltered contractors small and minority business and the like for an example of the problems private research involves see martha norby fraundorf with john p farrell and robert mason effect of the davisbacon act on construction costs in nonmetropolitan areas of the united states corvallis oregon state university jan 1982 21 for general background see herbert r northrup the helper controversy in the construction industry journal of labor research fall 1992 pp 421435 crs10 argue employment of helpers would undercut apprenticeship programs with generally deleterious impact upon skills transfer several questions are immediately apparent are helpers commonly employed in the area of the projected construction b is clear distinction made between helper and laborer or other craft workers c what is the technical distinction in terms of actual work performed between such groups of workers upon what is that distinction based d what might be the economic impact of the recognition and utilization of distinct category of helpers on davisbacon covered projects such questions have remained part of the debate over the helper issue through more than two decades and with the dawn of the 21st century they remain largely unresolved the position of dol on the issue has varied over time efforts to revise the helper requirement through the years helpers have been employed on davisbacon construction where their use was common in the area of the projected work and where they were clearly distinguished from laborers and from skilled craft workers however such use of helpers appears to have been infrequent during the late 1970s the carter administration opened the general issue of davisbacon implementation for debate and public comment seizing the opportunity industry urged closer adherence to area practice when establishing worker classifications especially helper classifications22 but before new davisbacon regulations could be given effect president carter was replaced in office by president reagan regulations proposed by the former administration were withdrawn and their substance reconsidered new davisbacon regulations proposed by the reagan administration in may 1982 redefined the concept of helper and potentially expanded their use this change was applauded by industry and objected to by the building trades unions23 litigation followed in order to circumvent objections raised by the courts dol redrafted the helper regulations in january 1989 during the bush administration the courts acquiesced in the judgment of the department and cleared the regulations for implementation at that juncture congress objected refusing to appropriate funds for implementation and enforcement of the regulation this restraint continued into the 1990s disappearing during fiscal 1996 then another impediment was raised dol under the clinton administration declined to act in june 1996 the associated builders and contractors brought suit to require dol to enforce its helper regulations dol responded quickly and in late july assistant secretary bernard anderson affirmed that the helper regulation approved but still suspended was simply nonadministratable anderson explained that the distinction between helpers and other workers in terms of their role and duties was insufficiently clear and that dol had intention of implementing the regulation in its current form24 in federal register notice of august 2 1996 dol noted that during the 14 years that had passed since the regulation was first 22 the constructor dec 1980 p 61 23 federal register may 28 1982 p 23644 ff 24 bureau of national affairs daily labor report july 29 1996 pp a9a10 crs11 published additional information has become available which warrants review of the suspended rule therefore the regulation remained in abeyance while dol engaged in substantive rulemaking on the issue25 through the next five months dol reassessed the data and in december 1996 it announced that the helper regulation would remain suspended until the department either 1 issues final rule amending and superseding the suspended helper regulations or 2 determines that further rulemaking is appropriate and issues final rule reinstating the suspended regulations26 in july 1997 the us district court for the district of columbia ruled that the department was within its rights to issue an indefinite suspension of the helper regulation27 then in april 1999 dol issued new proposed rule that would essentially reaffirm the status quo prior to the carter administration initiatives of the late 1970s two decades earlier28 thus the use of helpers would be limited to demonstrated common area practice where they were clearly differentiated from laborers and other craft workers under the proposed rule their use could be expected to be infrequent another look from the congress late in the 105th congress representative charlie norwood rga introduced legislation that would have created special category of workers ie helpers for davisbacon purposes but action was taken on the proposal early in the 106th congress in march 1999 the congressman introduced new legislation that would have established separate helper classification under the davisbacon act on july 21 1999 the house subcommittee on oversight and investigations committee on education and the workforce conducted general hearing on the impact of davisbacon helper rules for job opportunities in the construction industry the subcommittee however took further action the norwood bill was not reported the helper issue also arose during committee consideration of the labor health and human services and education appropriations for fy2000 in that instance representative anne northup rky raised objection to the helper regulation that dol had proposed in april 1999 at the congresswomans request language was added during markup that would have denied funding to implement administer or enforce the helper rule proposed by the clinton administration however through the legislative process the provision was dropped what impact its inclusion would have had may not have been entirely clear since in essence it would have codified existing practice as the 106th congress was drawing to close dol issued new final regulation governing the use of helpers it was dated november 14 2000 and was set to take effect 60 days after its publication in the federal register just hours prior to the end of the clinton administration the regulation provides that helpers 25 federal register aug 2 1996 p 40367 and bureau of national affairs daily labor report aug 1 1996 pp a2a3 26 federal register dec 30 1996 p 68646 27 bureau of national affairs daily labor report aug4 1997 pp a10a11 28 federal register apr 9 1999 pp 1744217458 crs12 will be recognized as distinct classification only where the following conditions occur i the duties of the helper are clearly defined and distinct from those of any other classification on the wage determination ii the use of such helpers is an established prevailing practice in the area and iii the helper is not employed as trainee in an informal training program the work of helper is not to be performed by any other classification of worker in the wage determination29 while this final regulation from the clinton administration has now gone into effect it may not be the end of the process on the one hand the department could at its discretion reevaluate the helper question and issue new proposed rule or conversely congress could attempt to resolve the issue through new legislation on may 23 2001 representative norwood introduced legislation that had it been passed would have redefined the concept of helper and would have permitted the use of helpers on davisbacon projects the bill was referred to the subcommittee on workforce protections where it remained at the close of the 107th congress initiatives of the 108th congress in the 108th congress the helper issue was raised again by representative marsha blackburn rtn with the introduction of new legislation the blackburn bill would mandate recognition for wage rate determination purposes of helpers as separate workforce classification and b require that helper be paid the prevailing wage of helpers employed on projects which are of character similar to the project on which the helper is employed in the locality in which the helper is employed the bill continues the term helper means semiskilled worker other than skilled journeyman mechanic who 1 works under the direction of and assists journeyman 2 under the journeymans direction and supervision performs variety of duties to assist the journeyman such as preparing carrying and furnishing materials tools equipment and supplies maintaining them in order cleaning and preparing work areas lifting positioning and holding materials or tools and other related semiskilled tasks as directed by the journeyman and 3 may use tools of the trade at and under the direction and supervision of the journeyman the blackburn bill was referred to the committee on education and the workforce and to the subcommittee on workforce protections where it died at the close of the 108th congress 29 bureau of national affairs daily labor review nov 20 2000 pp e1 forward for more detailed discussion of this issue see also crs report 96228 davisbacon employment of helpers on federal contract construction by william g whittaker crs13 initiatives of the 109th congress on september 27 2005 representative blackburn with mr norwood as cosponsor introduced hr 3907 the helpers job opportunity act the bill essentially the same as the blackburn bill of the 108th congress was referred to the house committee on education and the workforce and on november 7 2005 was referred to the subcommittee on workforce protections the site of the work coverage issue the initial davisbacon act of 1931 was relatively simple statute but with experience the statute was modified in 1935 new language was added to provide that the acts prevailing wage requirements should apply to the contractor or his subcontractor and to all mechanics and laborers employed directly upon the site of the work30 through the years with implementation of the act questions have arisen with respect to this seemingly uncomplicated provision for example what is the site of the work and how is directly to be defined by whom must the workers in question be employed these concepts have changed over time with altered technology and industry practice but rather than being quietly resolved the site of the work issue would become subject of administrative review and ultimately of litigation31 rulemaking in this area would continue until near the close of the clinton administration late in 2000 litigation would be extensive questions of interpretation differences in the interpretation of the site of the work are numerous for example given the specific wording of the statute if workers engaged in the construction of building working on the structure itself were covered by davisbacon would workers in an adjoining space mixing mortar etc be similarly covered how far removed from the actual structure could such work take place and still be regarded as directly upon the site of the work where some assembly of components is undertaken in holding area down the street little way would workers engaged in such assembly be regarded as employed directly upon the site of the work for davisbacon coverage purposes if prefabricated units to be used at construction site in alaska were assembled at site in seattle thousand miles away would the seattle workshop be considered part of the site of the work as one begins to apply the statute questions multiply for example one might use the case noted above is the site in seattle owned by the firm operating in alaska are the employees engaged in the work in seattle direct employees of the alaska firm is the seattle site dedicated solely to the alaska project or is the work in seattle being performed by manufacturing plant that makes and sells components to any construction firm engaging in work public or private are the 30 pl 74403 the provision remains part of the statute 31 see for example building and construction trades department aflcio v united states department of labor wage appeals board 932 f 2d 985 dc cir 1991 midway ball ball and brosamer v reich 24 f 3d 1447 dc cir 1994 and l p cavett company v us department of labor 101 f 3rd 1111 6th cir 1996 crs14 components thus purchased in the open market or are they developed and fabricated under specific federal contract when do the fabricated goods change ownership from the manufacturer to the construction firm are they installed by workers employed by the construction firm or by employees of the manufacturer and if the latter would these nonconstruction workers installers be davisbacon covered32 was the support facility created solely to serve the federal project did it have prior existence and will it likely close when the federal project is completed if contractor engaged in work covered by davisbacon has concrete hauled to the construction site the permanent location of the structure in this instance how are the drivers hauling the concrete to be treated does it matter by whom the drivers are employed or how long they are directly involved on the construction site however defined as opposed to actual hours spent driving if the construction contractor sets up separate firm to haul material would this device insulate the drivers from davisbacon coverage such questions may seem tedious but they have been through decades the subject of rulings from the comptroller general and focus of litigation andor of appeals through the hierarchy of dol among federal contracting agencies there has not always been agreement on these matters they have also been focus of attention for those who wish to extend davisbacon coverage broadly and for those who favor narrower application of the act dol has sought to deal with these issues through the regulatory process and continues to do so but with mixed results even precise judicial rulings have been insufficient to prevent partisans from finding nuances of meaning either in the statute or in the regulations from which further litigation might blossom33 32 several options could come into play the components in this hypothetical case could be offtheshelf purchases in which federal labor standards requirements may not be an issue they could be contract purchases of goods covered by the walshhealey public contracts act rather than the davisbacon act or if purchased from the manufacturer and installed by employees of the manufacturer the work could be regarded as an adjunct to the purchase of the goods possibly walshhealey covered or part of service contract covered under the mcnamaraohara service contract act the particular circumstances likely different in each case would seem to be determinative these issues were the subject of extensive

new rule is issued on september 21 2000 dol published in the federal register proposed rule redefining the concept of site of the work and calling for public comment through october 23 2000 under the proposed regulation site of the work would be defined to include in addition to the common concept of construction site any other site where significant portion of the building or work is constructed provided that such site is established specifically for the performance of the contract or project this would include further job headquarters tool yards batch plants borrow pits etc where they are dedicated exclusively or nearly so to the performance of the contract and are adjacent or virtually adjacent to the site of work it would not include permanent home offices branch plant establishments fabrication plants tool yards etc the existence of which is not dependent upon the federal or federallyassisted project preestablished facilities those extant prior to opening of project bids are not to be regarded as part of the site of the work34 the proposed rule was opposed by certain construction industry groups but supported by the building trades unions35 on december 20 2000 dol published the final rule in the federal register unchanged in this respect from the proposed rule it took effect on january 19 200136 but like the helper case the issue of the site of the work could be addressed further through departmental rulemaking through legislation neither one simple task or through further litigation the clean water act and prevailing wage in 1961 congress passed federal water quality legislation that would emerge as what is now popularly known as the clean water act cwa included in the 1961 legislation was provision applying davisbacon prevailing wage requirements to construction of sewage treatment facilities where there was federal involvement ie direct federal assistance notably through grants to the states an altered requirement in 1987 congress shifted its focus rather than continuing with program of direct federal funding grants of such construction it established structure of state revolving loan funds srfs about 80 federally funded with 20 nonfederal matching funds congress expected that by fy1995 the srfs would provide continuing source of financing for pollution abatement and that the federal role further appropriations would end in authorizing legislation 1987 congress mandated davisbacon coverage for such work commenced prior to fy1995 things did not work out as anticipated however first the srfs did not provide an adequate source of funding for pollution abatement work second congress continued to fund this work though channeling much its support through the srfs third because of series of unrelated environmental controversies

appropriate funds for the cwa and the srf program continued thus question arose if the abatement program remained federal in terms of funding and priorities notwithstanding the absence of authorizing legislation should the statutorily mandated administrative requirements of that program including the prevailing wage requirement remain in place in 1995 the environmental protection agency epa declared that davisbacon would longer apply to srfrelated construction that the requirement but not the funding had terminated at the end of the period covered by the 1987 authorization ie by fy1995 thereafter agencies involved in such work would be permitted to pay contract construction workers less than the locally prevailing wage the market permitting and to avoid any other perceived disadvantages associated with davis bacon coverage the building and construction trades department of the aflcio or bctd protested and following extended negotiation epa changed its position in may 2000 it proposed settlement agreement under which davisbacon would once more apply to certain cwasrf construction and in an announcement published in the federal register of june 22 2000 called for comment comment was sharply divided some industry groups and local governmental entities users of construction labor urged that davisbacon not apply and for the most part argued that epa was moving beyond its statutory authority in attempting to reinstate that requirement the bctd conversely held that davisbacon did apply and ultimately with the concurrence of epa that the environmental agency was statutorily bound to enforce the prevailing wage requirement in the federal register of january 25 2001 epa decided that davisbacon did and should apply and would be applied effective on july 1 2001 subsequently epa moved the effective date back to september 1 2001 and then to october 1 2001 the situation then became somewhat ambiguous37 consideration during the 107th congress debate on the davisbacon provision of the clean water act continued into the 107th congress as the house and senate commenced consideration of new clean water legislation in each instance the prevailing wage provision was relatively minor though contentious part of an otherwise comprehensive legislative package the committees in the house and senate proceeded independently though they covered much of the same ground senate action on february 26 and 28 2002 hearings were conducted in the senate by subcommittees of the committee on environment and public works two proposals were under consideration s

attention and remained so during full committee markup in may 2002 an amendment proposed by senator harry reid dnv resulted in applying davisbacon coverage to all cwa and safe drinking water srfs38 according to the national journal senator robert smith rnh argued that the amendment might be selfdefeating if davisbacon is added to this bill smith predicted itll be dead as mackerel dead dead

funds40 the amendment was approved and the bill as amended was ordered to be reported march 20 200241 the result it appears was stalemate according to the daily labor report house majority leader richard armey rtx declared that he will not allow bill to authorize appropriations for state water pollution control projects to come to the house floor because of davisbacon act amendment included in

however may not have placed davisbacon coverage in all instances beyond challenge proponents have put forth more specific language in subsequent legislation to ensure davisbacon coverage on november

was allowed to suspend the statute during period of national emergency the provision with some slight variation remains currently within the act the concept of national emergency however has not been defined the act has been suspended on four separate occasions 1 in 1934 president franklin roosevelt suspended the act for what may have been administrative convenience associated with new deal legislation it was restored in about 30 days with few people seemingly having been aware of the suspension 2 in 1971 president richard nixon suspended the act as part of campaign intended to quell inflationary pressures that affected the construction industry in just over four weeks the act was reinstated the president moving on to different approaches to the inflationary problem 3 in 1992 in the wake of hurricanes andrew and iniki president george h w bush suspended the act in order to render reconstruction and cleanup in florida and the gulf coast and in hawaii more efficient the impact of the suspension is unclear for the act was suspended on october 14 1992 just days prior to the 1992 election president william clinton won the election and restored the act on march 6 1993 4 on september 8 2005 president george w bush suspended the act in order to render more efficient reconstruction and cleanup of florida and the gulf coast in the wake of hurricane katrina the act was reinstated on november 8 2005 in 1934 and 1971 the suspensions applied to the entire country possibly with the understanding that they would be restored once the immediate emergency was over in 1992 and in 2005 only portions of the country were involved52 at the time of the 2005 suspension of the davisbacon act number of bills were introduced that would have affected the act in one manner or another among them are the following hjres 69 george miller hres 467 george miller hres 488 latourette hres 516 melancon hr 3684 flake hr 3763 george miller hr 3834 pallone s 1749 kennedy s 1763 boxer
