progress and implications for us interests introduction many analysts argue that process of political liberalization undertaken by former soviet president mikhail gorbachev in the late 1980s contributed to thecollapse and breakup of the soviet union at the end of 1991 the new independent states nis 1 that emerged from the breakup profe ssed intentions to democratize and to uphold human rights these assurances were given to the united states whendiplomatic relations were established nd several nis leaders on us visits have repeated these assurances 2 according to some analysts the interest in democratization in the nis is part of the expanding worldwide appeal of democratic governance3 but democracy is only one of several possible outcomes of tr ansition from communist rule in the nis many observers optimistically argue that all the nis have at least formallydisavowed communism they contend that majority of the nis have made at least faltering progress in democratization despite the harsh obstacles and legacies thenis have faced other observers are less sanguine concluding that only few of the nis appear to be making much progress in becoming democracies they also argue that none of the nis has made enough progre ss that democratization might be termed consolidated or unlikely to face reversal this paper examines democratization in the nis grouping them broadly into three categories based on their progress inreaching various benchmarks the paper will examine us administration policyon democracybuilding in the nis and congr essional and other concerns and issues in practice us democracybuilding effort s in each nis reflect various interests and aid goals as well as the particular needs of an nis and its receptivity to

world broadly us policymakers have stressed that thecontainment policy of the cold war has b een replaced with the policy of engagement and enlargement to increase the worlds free market democracies theadministration has argued that good relations with russia and ukraine are primary objective of us foreign policy and that fo stering democratization in these and other nis is one of the central objectives of u s aid democratic nis are viewed as us security interest since democracies are considered unlikely to start wars 4 in this view democratic russia and other nis could be integrated into the westerncommunity of democratic states and they would uphold international civil andhuman rights standards also us trade and business would be attracted todemocratic nis where the rule of law is respected according to the administration congress has generally supported admini stration efforts to foster democracy in the nis with differences in emphasi s and timing congress was at the forefront in the early 1990s in calling for coordinated us aid response to the breakup of thesoviet union and more recently in dir ecting the administration to devote more resources to bolstering independence nd democracybuilding in the nonrussian nis for fy1998 congress also generally endorsed the administrationspartnership for freedom initiative and partly funded it which calls for shifting andincreasing aid resources devoted to civil so ciety programs at the same time many in congress have voiced concerns about the longterm commitment of russia andother nis to democratization the effectiven ess of us

union development rule of law initiatives support forelections and electoral reform and support for civilian control over the military 5 more generally many observers have focu sed on several

progress and problems democratization faces more difficulties in the nis than in longexisting countries in latin america and southern europe that have recently democratizedaccording to many observers the nis face problems of national identity including defining citizenship that ar wrapped in issues of contested borders separatism and ethnic tensions in this view legacy of communist habits of thinking and acting makes democratization more difficult lthough such habits may be less entrenched where nis have had previous experience with some degree of

also influenced by the disposition of ruling elites toward reform as well as vari ations in mass political culture several nis leaders have discouraged democratic participation ranging from peacefuldemonstrations to elections sometimes lead ing to civil conflict in the late 1980s soviet russia had developed many new interest groups that urged gorbachev toimplement more reforms central asia in contrast had lower levels of urbanization and education and local and clanbased loyalties were often more significant thanwider political engagement and civic responsibility strong presidential systems in the nis have hampered the emergence of political parties and effective legislatures 13 the presidents either feel themselves to be above politics or head or back domin ant

todemocratization if power is shared more equitably among the branches ofgovernance marking at least concern with appearing democratic nis leaders have not usually canceled elections except in three central asia states where referendumson extending presidencies were held to ci rcumvent competitive elections some nis leaders have delayed or forced early ections such as legislative elections in

creation of market economies can pro ceed simultaneously as the best means to ensure stable reforms secretary albright argued in early 1998 that i do think thatthere are set of needs in developing stat that need to be fulfilled practically simultaneously in the best of all worlds political development and economicdevelopment go together she was in part responding to criticism that ussupport for economic development should precede support for free elections andother democratization efforts because the latter could be destabilizing 22 other critics have argued that the admi nistration should focus aid on nis that have made the most progress in democratization rather than spreading it thinlyamong most nis they lament that th progressive nis are not receiving enough us aid to surmount their tendencies to stagnate and decay rather than fullydemocratize they criticize what they view as shallow us efforts to merely foster more free elections worldwide they point out that in countries such as kazakstan and belarus where relatively free and fair elections have been held democratization since has faltered consolidation efforts should include more focused and longertermed efforts to foster individual right s and freedoms the rule of law the separation of church and state and ch ecks and balances on executive power they argue 23 among critics faulting us democracy building programs

policy has been the argument that us security interests in natos enlargementcould be harmed by countervailing rise to power of nondemocratic ultranationalists and militarists in russia 26 the

branch institutionbuilding support for upholding the broadrange of human rights is also sometimes included as are many or most economicreforms many would include such program s as crime fighting and fostering civilian control over the military as democracybuilding many have also advocated thatdemocracybuilding aid be targeted to localities and private groups as well as tocentral governments and that central governments receive less aid when they areresistant to reforms the state departme nt as noted has taken an expansive view that peopletopeople exchanges that bri ng nis citizens and

reduced or nodemocracybuilding aid and which nis ar so nondemocratic that they should not receive any us aid us assistance to the nis including democracybuilding aid has been conditioned on wide variety of factors including the freedom supportact and other legislation as well as admini stration policies the administration has mentioned criteria including whether an nis is strategically important to the united states or is regional power the prosp ects for the creation of democracy and free markets how open an nis is to us aid efforts and whether democratization may have demonstration effect on other nis in the region 49 other conditions bearing on whether an nis receives us assistan ce perhaps including democracybuilding aid include whether an nis adheres to ar ms control agreements does not wage war against its neighbors does not support terrorism does not transfer materials ortechnology that can be used to construct mass destruction weapons and upholdshuman rights specific legislative conditi ons on aid to russia that potentially affect us democracybuilding efforts have in cluded whether it upholds religious freedom and abjures assisting iran in building nuclear reactors and ballistic missiles rarely does an nis have clearcut record in democratization that makes policy choices simple the administration contends that us ties with uzbekistanazerbaijan
