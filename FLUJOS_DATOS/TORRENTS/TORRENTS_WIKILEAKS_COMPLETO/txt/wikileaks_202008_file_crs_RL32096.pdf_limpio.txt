pursuant to treaty of extradition6 supplementary treaty the 2003 treaty is the latest in long line of extradition pacts with great britain7 the difficulties that led to the s upplementary treaty arose from judicial application of the political offe nse exception found in the 1977 treaty8 the federal courts in this c ountry had held that the po litical offense exception f ound in most of our

on foreign relations 99th cong 1st sess 1985 hearings id at 4 testimony of department of state legal adviser abraham d sofaer united states courts have refused to extradite to the united kingdom four members of the provisi onal irish republican army pira who are accused or convicted of violent terrorist crimes in each case extradition was denied because the terrorist crimes were committed as part of political struggle these decisions direct blow to the rule of law id at 78 testimony of depatty gen d lowell jensenin recent years there have been four cases involving request by the united kingdom for the extradition of irish republi can army members charged or convicted of terrorist crimes in each of the four cases described the fugitive claimed that the unsettled political situation in northern irel and constituted war revolution or rebellion and that his offenses qualified for treatment as political offenses the us courts have accepted this argument in all but one case the british government has concurred in our view that it is unacceptable that criminal may commit heinous offense which shocks the sensibilities of all decent people flee the country which he has terrorized and find safe haven in another country by labeling his crime political offense 12 eg hearings at 35 testimony of state departme nt legal adviser abraham d sofaer the political offense doctrine is an exception to the general principle of extradition this exception arose in the 18th century as revolutionaries struggled for freedom against despotic regimes when revolutionaries fl ed to the fledgling democracies of western europe those governments sheltered them from political persecution they refused to extradite fugitives whom requesting states s ought to punish for engaging political activities in recent years the exception has resulted in refusals of us courts to extradite persons suspected or convicted of committing heinous cr imes that are not by their nature politicaltreaty became effective federal courts deni ed extradition requests on the basis of the political offense exception in four instances growing out of the unrest in northern ireland10 the two countries responded by negotiating supplementary treaty streaty doc 998 198511 as transmitted to the sena the supplementary treaty curtailed the political offense exception and also eased the statute of limitations bar extended the permissible duration of provisional arrest pending the formal submission of evidence sufficient to s upport an extradition re quest and made its changes retroactively applicab streaty doc 998 1985 exemptions to the political offense exception were the most controversial aspect of the treaty offered to the senate the administration argued that the political offense exception should not be available for crimes of violence committed in nation open to nonviolent resolution of political differences and that contrary to critics suggestions the treaty posed threat to civil liberties12 critics on the otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32096crs4 acts this supplementary treaty narrows the political offense exception as applied to united kingdom requests to pure political and nonviolent crimes it reflects the basic principle that terrorist violen ce should not be tolerated against stable democracies in which the political process is available to redress legitimate grievances and in which the judicial system provides fair treatment moreover by using bilateral treaty to implement this principle we would not alter our extradition laws across the board instead we are abler to decide whether to limit the exception on nationbynation basis the united kingdom is also an ideal nation with whom to begin this process from the moral and political point of view it is our longest nd closest ally and one of the most open political systems in the world some opponents have condemned this supplementary treaty as an assault upon civil liberties they clai m it will destroy the political offense exception will facilitate repression of dissent and will abo lish judicial review of extradition decisions these criticisms are unfounded the treaty does not eliminate the political offense exception but only removes from its scope certai n specified violent crimes moreover the exception will continue in full force with re spect to all nations other than the united kingdom and will never be revised with respect to repressive regimes 13 eg hearings at 99 statement of professor christopher h pyle the political crimes defense has been part of angloamerican ex tradition practice since the american civil war when britain refused to surrender gunmen for the southern cause who had sought refuge in canada it is standard provision of nearly 90 treaties of extradition that the united states has concluded with other nations and is comm on to the extradition treaties of most western nations the defense has survived for more than century despite periodic bouts with political assassinations kidnappings and bombing s for two reasons first western nations have found it prudent not to commit themselves by treaty to use their legal systems to help other nations suppress any and all rebellions second they have not wanted to be complicit in victors justice particularly where that complicity would outrage sympathetic nationality groups within their own borders id at 51 statement of rep biaggi 14 eg sexrepno 9917 at 12 additional views of sen helmsif this treaty had been in effect in 1776 this language would have labeled the boys who fought at lexington and concord as terrorists there is questi on that the british authorities in 1776 would have considered the guerilla operations of the americ ans to be murder and assault there is doubt whatsoever that such treaty would have required us to extradite the patriots who fired the shot heard round the world to swing on british gallows cf id at 491 statement of professor keara m odempseyin the first ten congresses of the united states total of 56 senators would probably have been extraditable under treaty such as this for they maliciously wounded and killed british soldiers and possessed firearms with the intent to endanger lifehand argued that the repudiated pol itical offense exception reflected longheld reluctance to deny refuge to the opponents of repressi ve governments 13 lest we be forced to extradite the overseas equivalents of the farmers and other minutemen at lexington and concord14 in addition some suggested that adjustments in the political offense exception might best be addressed uniformly in statute rather thanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32096crs5 15 g hearings at 71 testimony of rep hughes the principal effect of the supplementary treaty would be the derogation of over 100 years of american extradition practice and case law by virtually destroying the socalled political offense exception to extradition law moreover the legal adviser to the state department admitted that the united kingdom is an ideal nation from moral and political point of view to begin process of exempting stable democracies with fair legal systems from the restrictions of the political crimes defense i strongly oppose this treatybytreaty stratagem which i believe would effectively preempt the legislative process as result our extradition laws will not be consistently applied but will depend upon the status of the requesting nation as friend or ally id at 4079 statement of rep rodino 16 eg hearings at 143 testimony of rep hamilton fis h jr i ask that you take long look at the presumption underlying this treaty namely that the judicial process in northern ireland provides fair treatment the emerge ncy powers act now in effect in northern ireland was originally instituted by the british for the same reasons given for the institution of the treaty as response to the terrorism and violence in northern ireland but it has become an instrument of oppression against fair and moral political opposition the heritage of law precious gift of england to so many englishspeaking judicial systems throughout the world has apparently been set as ide by great britain in northern ireland i visited the north of ireland i was appalle d and offended at the abuses that i saw in the legal system in the diplock courts there were wide powers of arrest detention search and seizure the right to trial by jury had been abolished as cases were heard by single judge accused persons often faced physical and psychological co ercion and person charged with an offense had right to bail and could be detained indefinitely in the last few years there have been mass trials of up to 75 defendants at time in which one or more supergrasses or informants figured prominently in these cases the work of one informant protected by government immunity was enough to convict without further evidence in the united states this would amount mr chairma n to loss of constitutional rights under the 1st 4th 5th 6th 8th and 14th amendments i ask can we willingly be party to the enforcement of these laws under these conditions id at 656 statement of sen deconcini 17 eg hearings at 52 statement of rep biaggi sam oreilly lives in upstate new york he is 89 years old in 1916 he fought against the british in the socalled easter rebellion if this treaty were passed great britain could extradite sam oreilly to face charges relating to his activities almost 70 years ago other commentators asked whether these features might raise ex post facto or bill of attainder

allegedly involving violence or weapons including any solicitation conspi racy or attempt to commit such crimes 2 transfers responsibility for determin ing whether the extradition request is politicallymotivated from the courts to the executive 3 allows for extradition even if us federal law is violated 4 eliminates any statute of limitations 5 eliminates the need for any showing by the united kingdom of facts sufficient to show the person requested is guilty of the crime charged mere unsupported allegations are sufficient 6 allows for provisional arrest and detention for 60 days upon request by the united kingdom 7 allows for seizure of assets by the united kingdom 8 allows for extradition for one offense and then subsequent prosecution in the uk for an unrelated offense thus elimin ating the timehonored rule of speciality and 9 applies retroactively for offenses allegedly committed even before the ratification of the treaty boyle supra n2 the understanding declarations and provisos that accompany the senates approval of the 2003 treaty seem to refl ect its concerns over some of these objections exemptions to the political offense exception eliminates the political offense for any offense allegedly involving violence or weapons including any solicitati on conspiracy or attempt to commit such crimes it does and more there is likely to be little consensus over whether this is objectionable it is the issue that domin ated debate over the supplementary treaty there is little disagreement over the origins or original rationale of the exception as one court has explained the political offense exception is premised on number of justifications first its historical development sugge sts that it is grounded on the belief that individuals have right to resort to political activism to foster political change this justification is consistent with the modern consensus thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32096crs12 political crimes have greater legitimacy than common crimes second the exception reflects concern that individua ls particularly unsuccessful rebels should not be returned to countries where they may be subjected to unfair trial and punishments because of thei r political opinions third the exception comports with the notion that govern ments and certainly their nonpolitical branches should not intervene in the internal political struggles of other nations quinn v robinson 783 f2d 776 79293 9th cir 1986 the difficulty comes in defining the exceptions proper scope should it protect fleeing insurgents from prosecution nd punishment for acts of

again whether this is objectionable may depend upon perspective born of concern for fairness the f eatures of the supplementary treaty are nonetheless unique of cour the question of whether the crime upon which an extradition request rests is political crime is closely related to the question of whether an extradition request is grounde d in improper political motives the 2003 treaty strikes or at least extensively prune s perhaps the most individualistic features of the existing treaty the treatment of improperly motivated requests and the specifics concerning the existence of proba ble cause article 3 of the supplementary treaty establishes judicial procedure replete with appellate rights to bar extradition based on trumpedup charges or improperly motivated requests38 the senate foreign relations committee which added article 3 to the supplementary treaty explained its extraordinary dimensions article 3 part contains two distinct concepts first it authorizes court to deny extradition based upon persuasive fact ual showing that the requesting party has trumpedup charges against dissident in order to obtain his extradition for trial or punishment second it authorizes court to deny extradition if the person sought for extradition can establish by preponderance of the evidence that he would be prejudiced at this trial or punished deta ined or restricted in his personal liberty because of his race religion nationality or political opinions article 3a adapts language found in article 5 of the european convention on the suppression of terrorism to which the united kingdom is

supplementary extradition treaty with th united kingdom itself the federal courts have continued to apply if not strengthen th rule of noninquiry in this and other areas moreover most united states extradition trea ties negotiated subsequent to 1986 expressly leave the determination of the requesting count rys motive for requesting extradition to the executive authority of the requested country or do not specify the manner in which the requested country is to make this determination 42 hannay analysis of the usu k supplementary treaty 21 i nternational lawyer 925 926 1987under present case law in the ited states it is with in the jurisdiction of the courts to decide whether the crime for which extradition has been requested is political offense by contrast the secretar of state has sole discretion to determine whether an extradition request should be denied because it is subterfuge and accordingly courts traditionally have declined to consid er whether the requesting countrys motives in seeking extradition are politicalhe would be returned and thereby raise right of inquiry into the fairness of that system the chairman yes article 3b applies only to the united states it does two things first it limits the scope of article 3a in us extradition proceedings to offenses listed in article 1 of the supplementary treaty in other words if an individual is wanted for extradition to the united kingdom for fraud drug smuggling or some other offense not listed in article 1 that individual may not involve article 3a before federal magistrate or judge article 3b also gives either pa rty to the extradition proceeding the right to appeal finding under article 3a sexrept 9917 at 45 1986 the 2003 treatys pruning of the impr oper motivation clause leaves only political motives suspect and expressly removes the issue from the courts39 more broadly drafted clauses proscribing raci religious or other improperly motivated extradition requests are not uncommon elsewhere40 the 2003 treatys repeal of the judicial authority to inquiry into extradition motivation however comports with treatment of the issue diplomatically41 and judicially42 moreover as noted above the understandings declarations and provi sos upon which the senate insisted emphasize that whether particular extr adition request satisfies treaty requirementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32096crs16 43 nothing in this supplementary treaty sh all be interpreted as imposing the obligation to extradite if the judicial authority of the re quested party determines that the evidence of criminality presented is not sufficient to sustai n the charge under the provisions of the treaty the evidence of criminality must be such as according to the law of the requested party would justify committal for trial if the offens had been committed in the territory of the requested party in determining whether an individual is extraditable from the united states the judicial authority of the united states shall permit the individual sought to present evidence on the questions of whether 1 there is probable cause 2 defense to extradition specified in the extradition treaty or this suppl ementary treaty and w ithin the jurisdiction of the courts exists and 3 the act upon which the request for extradition is based would constitute an offense punishable under the laws of the united states probable cause means whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant man of reasonable caution in the belief that 1 the pe rson arrested or summoned to appear is the person sought 2 in the case of person accused of having committed crime an offense has been committed by the accused and 3 in the case of person alleged to have been convicted of an offense certificate of conviction or other evidence of conviction or criminality exists supplementary treaty art2 44 extradition shall be granted only if the evidence be found sufficient according to the law of the requested party either to justify the committal for trial of the person sought if the offense of which he is accused had been committed in the territory of the requested party or to prove that he is the identical person c onvicted by the courts of the requesting party 1977 treaty art ix1 remains an initial judicial determination and disclaim any intent to reopen the good friday agreement eliminates the need for any showing by the united kingdom of facts sufficient to show the person requested is guilty of the crime charged mere unsupported allegations are sufficient the supplementary treatys probable cause article reenforces the benefits of article 343 again the senate executive report is instructive the committee has made second major change in the supplementary treaty as submitted it has included as article 2 of the amended treaty restatement of the procedures that have traditionally governed the consideration of an extradition request in us courts this article reaffirms that the magistrate or federal judge is to permit the individual to present evidence in connec tion with the request it insures that individual is to be extradited without fair h earing it is designed to lay to rest any assumption that extradition under this supplem entary treaty will be automatic or that federal magistrates and judges will not carefully evaluate the evidence presented in support of extradition id at 56 while the 2003 treaty strikes 1 the s upplementary treaty language insuring an individual the right to contest the existence of probable cause to justify extradition and 2 the original treaty lang uage on the weight of evidence required for extradition44 it does insist that the documentation accompanying request include such information as would provide reasonable basis to believe that the person sought committed the offense for which extradition is requested 2003 treaty art83c httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32096crs17 45 abbell at 325 citing inter alia 14 opatty gen 281 1873extraterritorial crimes allows for extradition even if us federal law is violated it does but in less dramatic manner than the objection might imply as general rule the 2003 treaty like its pr edecessor limits extradition to misconduct outlawed in both countries the exception is found in cases of extraterritoria lity the existing treaty obligates the parties to extradite with respect to crimes committed within the jurisdiction of the requesting country 1977 treaty arti historically the united states has construed this language to mean offenses committed within the territory of the requesting country45 as the united states began to assert its criminal extraterritorial jurisdiction more regularly it began to negotiate extradition treaties that either permitted or required extradition to the united states with respect to crimes committed outside this country our present treaty favors the historical model each contracting party undertakes to extradite to the other an person found in its territory who has been accused or convicted of any offense committe d within the jurisdiction of the other party 1977 treaty arti the 2003 treaty requires extradition in extraterritorial cases where the law of the two countri would apply comparably but per mits extradition in other cases if the offense has been committed outside the territory of the requesting state extradition shall be granted in accordance with the provisions of the treaty if the laws in the requested state provide for the punishment of such conduct committed outside the rritory in similar circumstances if the laws of the requested state do not provide for the punishment of such conduct committed outside of its territory in similar circumstances the executive authority of the requested state in its discretion may grant extradition provided that all other requireme nts of this treaty are met 2003 treaty art 24 thus the united states would be permitted to honor british extradition request for an individual charged with violation of british law on the basis of conduct committed entirely within this country even if the conduct were completely lawful under our laws and it would be required to honor request based

states is party contain statute of limitations bar of some kind in some instances the bar is triggered by the law of the requesting country in some by the law of th requested country and in others by the law in either country46 the rationale is presumably the same as in other contexts that at least in some instances it is unfair to require individuals to defend themselves against stale charges after memories have faded evidence has disappeared and witnesses have died47 our existing treaty with the united kingdom bars extradition if trial would be barred by the lapse of time under the laws of either country48 the supplementary treaty submitted to the senate contained an amendment which would have limited this clause to instances barred by the laws of the requesting country the change was thought to benefit the united kingdom in terrorism cases which were not subject to statute of limitations49 the senate dropped the amendment from the supplementary treaty sexrept 9917 at 6 1986 since then number of the treaties submitted to the senate continue to contain statute of limitations clause50 but perhaps an equal number of others either silently omit the clause51 or include clause specifically declaring that the expiration of period of limitation is bar to extradition52 the 2003 treaty eliminates the passage of time as defense altogether regardless of the nature of the crime

article 8 for this purpose receipt of the formal re quest for extradition and supporting documents by the embassy of the requested state in the re questing state shall constitute receipt by the executive authority of the requested state 5 the fact that the person has been discharged from custody pursuant to paragraph 4 of this article shall not prejudice the subse quent rearrest and extradition of that person if the extradition request and supporting documents are delivered at later date 2003 treaty provisional arrest allows for provisional arrest and tention for 60 days upon request by the united kingdom it does but so does the existing treaty53 provisional arrest refers to the authority to arrest the individual sought for extradition before receiving the full documentation required to initiate extradition proceedings the 2003 treaty is more precise than the existing treaty in its description of the information that must accompany request for provisional arrest the 2003 treaty also afford s the parties great flexibility as to the permissible recipients of requests and doc umentation but the most substantial change seems to be that under the existing treaty the individual must be released after 60 days if the necessary documentation s not arrived while under the 2003 treaty release is discretionary54httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32096crs20 art 12

crimerelated assets are subject to seizure under the laws of the united kingdom and of the united states under various circumstances some of which implement or supplement our treaty obliga tions the existing treaty permits the transfer of evidence and assets from one country to the another55 facially the 2003 treatys treatment of forfeita ble property differs from its predecessor in two respects it describes the property subject to confiscation more broadly and it omits any reference to the rights of claimants to the extent permitted under its law the requested state may seize and surrender to the requesting state all items in whatever form and assets including proceeds that ar connected with the offense in respect of which extradition is granted the items and assets mentioned in this article may be surrendered even when the extradition cannot be effected due to the death disappearance or escape of the person sought 2003 treaty art 161 the existing treaty provision is limited to proceeds rather than items connected with the offense and only extends to items in the actual possession of the individual to be extradited the changes reflect greater federal emphasis on forfeiture as law enforcement tool than was the case when the existing treaty was negotiated federal law now authorizes confiscati on of property derived from or in some instances used to facilitate any number of federal crimes including terrorism56 organized crime57 drug trafficking58 and other profit generating crimes59 when they are involved in financial transactions in th is country it permits the conf

allows the united states to consent to deviation by the great britain and vice versa the rule of specialty permits individuals to be tr ied andor punished only for the crimes for which they are extradited65 the rule is designed to ensure th at an individual is not tried or punished for crime for which he woul d not have been extradited66 and the elimination of the rule might be particularly unfair where the individual sought has waived extradition for purposes of american law the rule is matter of st atutory construction67 and consequently can be overcome by provision in later treaty68

completely clear what the parties understand onward extradition to mean77 in the case of multiple extradition requests the 2003 treaty maintains essentially the same standards for dealing with re quests from third country that elects to submit contemporaneous request to the country of refuge rather than submitting subsequent request to the count ry to whom extradition has been granted if the requested state receives requests form two or more states for the extradition of the same pers on either for the same offense or for different offenses the executive authority of the requested state

possibility of any subsequent extradition between the respective requesting states and the chronological order in which the requests were received from the respective requesting states 2003 treaty art

inciple takes several forms in our various extradition treaties our existing treaty with great britain bars extradition if prosecution would be precluded in the country of refuge by virtue of any earlier trial there or in the reque sting country or in third country79 thus the united states may not extradite an indi vidual tried here fo r the same misconduct the united states may however honor reque sts where the individual has previously been tried in great britain or in th ird country because double jeopardy in the united states only proscribes trial by the same sovereign80 the 2003

provi so addresses the questi on of extradition following acquittal in the requesting country the senate notes that as in other recent united states extradition treaties the treaty does not address

allow for the retrial in the united kingdom in certai n limited circumstances of an individual who has previously been tried and acquitted in that country in this regard the senate understands that under us law and practice person sought for extradition can present claim to the secret ary of state that an aspect of foreign law that may permit retrial may result in an unfairness that the

terrorist offences associated w ith the troubles in northern ir eland who are currently in the united states httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32096crs30 in september 2000 the government decided that it was longer proportionate or in the public interest to seek the extradition of individuals convicted of terrorist offences committed prior to 10th april 1998 the date of the belfast agreement the new treaty does not change this position in any way we have also made it clear that we want to address the anomalous position of those suspected but not yet convicted of terrorismr elated offences committed before then had these individuals been convicted at the time of their offences they would by now have been able to apply for early release and so find th emselves in similar position to those already covered by the agreement unfortunately the legislation that would have resolved this anomaly had to be withdrawn due to lack of crossparty support however the british government remains keen to make progress on this and i can assure you that when the new treaty was being negotiated there was intention on our part to make it easier to target these people whose position we accept to be anomalous charles clarke home secretary northern ireland office belfast bt4 3tt september 4 2006 alberto gonzales attorney general us department of justice washington dc dear attorney general i am writing to reiterate the uk governments position relating to the extradition of individuals fro m the united states in relation to terrorist offences committed during the troubles in northern ireland in september 2000 the government decided that it was longer proportionate or in the public interest to seek the extradition of i ndividuals convicted of terrorist offences prior to 10th april 1998 who appear to qualif for early release under the good friday agreement scheme and who would on making successful application to the sentence review commissioners have little if any of their original prison sentence to serve i attach copy of the statement made by the then secr etary of state for northern ireland when this decision was announced i know that the former home secretary reiterated this when he wrote to you in march this year i can confir m on behalf of the uk government that this remains the case we have also made it clear that we want to address the anomalous position of those suspected but not yet convicted of terrorismr elated offences committed before the belfast agreement had these individuals been convicte d at the time of their offences they would by now have been able to apply for early rele ase and so find themselves in similar position to those already covered by the agreement the uk government introduced legislation to resolve this anomaly last year unfortunately that legislation had to be withdrawn due to lack of crossparty support however the uk government continues to accept that the position of these people is anomalous and i can assure you as the former home secretary did in march that when the new treaty was being negotiated there was intention on our part to make it easier to target them i attach short note which explains in more detail the provisions of the early release scheme nd the position of various groups of people it remains matter of great importance to the uk government that the extradition treaty should be ratified by the united states so that its benefits can be fully realised this is not because of any agenda related to northern ireland but because of the improvements that the updated treaty will bring to the extrad ition process in general in both countries my colleague john reid the home secretary has seen this letter and agrees fully with its contents httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32096crs31 i am copying this letter to senator lugar both you and he are welcome to share it with other members of the senate if that would be helpful the rt hon p eter hain mp secretary of state for northern ireland enclosures usuk extradition treaty northern ireland issues political background the political and security situation in nort hern ireland has been transformed following the 1998 good friday agreement huge amount of progress has been made since then including the historic statement from the prov isional ira in july 2005 in which they made clear that their armed campaign was over the focus in northern ireland today is on restoring devolved government and continuing to build prosperous and peaceful society good friday agreement and early release scheme as part of the good fr iday agreement gfa individuals convicted of terroristrelated offences committed before 1998 were able to apply for early release after serving only two years of their sentences over 400 prisoners have been released on license under this scheme the license requires that individuals do not become reengaged in terrorism or serious crime those released include many members of the provisional ira which has maintained ce asefire during this time the early release scheme was very difficult part of the good friday agreement for many people to accept but it demonstrated the uk governments co mmitment to moving forward with the peace process the early release scheme is part of uk law and remains in force any individuals who are convicted of qualifying pre1998 offenc in the future including any individuals extradited to the uk will be able to apply for the scheme individuals convicted of pregfa offences in 2000 the uk government announced that it would longer pursue the extradition of individuals convicted of p re1998 offences who had escaped from prison and who would if they returned to northern ireland and successfully applied for early release have little if any of their time left to serve that remains the position individuals suspected of pre gfa offences on the runs whilst the early release scheme addressed the situation of individuals who had been convicted of past offences there remained an anomaly in relation to individuals suspected of past offences who had gone on the run before they were tried the british government accepts that these individuals are in an anomal ous position since if they had been convicted before 1998 they could have been released by now under the terms of the good friday agreement in 2003 the british government therefore published proposals for scheme which would have allowed suspects on the run to be tried in their absence and to return to northern ireland without arrest or imprisonment following the iras statement that its armed campaign was over in july 2005 legislation was introduced to implement that commitment agreement could not be reached on that legislation during its passage through parliament and it was withdrawn in january 2006 the british government is currently reflecting on the way forward however as the 2003 proposals and the subsequent legislation demonstrate the british government is committed to addressing these cases in way which resolves the anomaly httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32096crs32 in the absence of any change in the law decisions on whether to seek the extradition of suspects on the run for pre1998 offe nces are still taken by the prosecuting authorities in line with the legal obligations on them as part of the normal criminal justice process but as the uk governments decision in 2000 not to pursue the extradition of convicted fugitives including in the united states who would qualify for early release under the gfa illustrates there is political agenda to pursue the extradition and trial of these people and any suspects who were extradited and subsequently convicted would be able to apply for early release af ter two years under the terms of the g ood friday agreement other individuals anyone convicted of an offence unconnected with terrorism or an offence committed after the good friday agreement will not be eligible for the early release scheme the uk law enforcement authorities continue to seek th extradition of such individuals in line with uk law outstanding warrants when home office minister baroness sco tland visited the us she explained that there were currently outstanding warrants for the extradition of individuals from the us to northern ireland secretary of state northern ireland office september 29 2000 statement by peter mandelson on extradition of convicted fugitives on 28 july all remaining prisoners eligible under the early release scheme who had completed 2 years of their sentences were released as envisaged in the good friday agreement the completion of these remaining releases has implications for number of people who were sentenced to imprisonment for offences committed before the good friday agreement but who failed to complete thes sentences in most cases those concerned escaped from custody and fled to other countries up to 20 years ago in many cases extradition proceedings were initiated and in so of these the government is now being pressed by court authorities to clarify its position whether to pursue an extradition request depends on the public interest at stake including the remaining sentence which the fug itive would stand to serve if he or she were returned it is clearly anomalous to pursue the extradition of people who appear to qualify for early release under the good friday agre ement scheme and who would on making successful application to the sentence review commissioners have little if any of their original prison sentence to serve in view of this and the time that has apsed i do not believe that it would now be proportionate or in the public interest to continue to pursue such cases if these individuals wish to benefit from th early release scheme they will be able to return to northern ireland and make an pplication to the sentence review commissioners if this is granted normal licence conditions in cluding liability to recall to prison will apply the decision has implications for the pros ecution of other offences where sufficient evidence exists it is not an amnesty as with the rest of the early release programme i do not underestimate the hurt this decision may cause the victims of those whos extradition will longer be pursued and the onus it places on all of us to ensure that the good friday agreement does result in permanent peace in which there are more victims
