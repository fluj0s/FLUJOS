topics discretion for the executive branch congress frequently faces the issue of how much discretion to give the executive branch congress has options to address delegation situations nd balance agency flexibility with accountability standardization vs customization should the management laws under which agencies operate be standardized with uniform rules or should some agencies have customized ag encyspecific laws should there be mix of the two approaches congress has options when confronted with these decisions functional silos vs integr ated general management functional perspective eg looking at agency ope rations from the perspective of budget officer or human resources officer can boost efficiency however if functional orientations become inward looking functions can operate in isolation resulting in coordination problems or ssed opportunities congress has options to use an integrated general management perspective to solve agency management problems making and measuring progress many executive branch agencies suffer from persistent major management problems often these problems relate to areas the general management laws were intende d to address congress has options for measuring and motivating agency progre ss in improving management practices agency chief officers and interagency councils statutorily created chief officers eg chief financial fficers and chief acquisition officers have increased in number in federal agencies congress also established interagency councils of these officers congress has options when considering whether additional chief officers should be established and how the councils could be more accountable the report reflects the status of general ma nagement laws at the end of the first session of the

analyzes major themes that run through the general management laws and identifies potential management policy options who manages the executive branch congress and the president who manages the executive branch the president or congress both branches together scholars have long bated their constitutional roles whether one institution is more powerful than the other in this regard and which should control the activities of federal agencies the record of the last two centuries provides ample evidence that congress and the president both manage the executive branch as scholars have noted6 the us constitution created system of separated powers but it also established system of checks and balances justice robert jackson captured this subtlety while the constitution diffuses power to better secure liberty it also contemplates that practice will integrate the dispersed powers into workable government it enjoins upon its branches separateness but interdependence autonomy but reciprocity7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32388crs4 8 congress and the president share power to ma nage the executive branch in many venues that are not within the scope of this report for example congress

the executive branch the constitution gives congress the power to establish administrative agencies and determine how they operate article i section 1 of the constitution provides that all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in congress of the united states section 8 pr ovides further that congress shall have power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers and all other powers vested by this constitution in the government of the united states or in any department or officer thereof in turn the constitution gives the president considerable power to manage the executive branch article ii section 1 vests the executive power in the president and section 3 provides that the president shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed however this power is limited as one commentator states the presidents duty is to ensure that officials obey congresss instructions and article iis take care clause does not create presidential power so great that it can be used to frustrate c ongressional intention9 article ii makes only two explicit references to executive departments10 section 2 states the president may

organization of executive departments b ecame more complex the structure of the executive departments in 1860 was much more complex than in 1800 the difference may be stated with some exaggeration by asserting that in 1800 department consisted of the secretary clerks and field establishment while in 1860 department consisted of the secretary group of bureaus handling the mass of routine busin ess usually without the intervention or even knowledge of the secretary and field service that in the larger establishments exceeded in size the parent departments of an earlier day18 several developments after the civil war including i ndustrializa tion the progressive movement efforts to combat the great depression two world wars and increasingly complex social policy problems led to the rise and growth of the administrative state and significant challenges to effectively managing the executive branch19 to deal with the complexity by 1946 congress had become delegator vesting much of its legislative authority in administrative agencies and great deal of the initiative for policy making and budgeting had passed to the executive branch20 observers noted that cong ress sometimes found it

formulate public policies in other words observers argued that agencies sometimes exercised legislative powers in response and also to improve ex ecutive branch management practices congress over time expanded the number and types of general management laws to address myriad aspects of the modernday executive branch as the entries in the crs compendium help show21 for example congress moved to increase transparency in its oversight of the executive branch by passing legislation such as the administrative procedure act 1946 the freedom of information act 1966 the federal advisory committee act 1972 and other laws described in the compendium22 to improve congressional oversight and increase executive branch accountability congress established insp ectors general 1978 enacted the congressional review of re gulations act cra and required agency strategic planning with the government performance and results act 1993 however congress did not merely seek to improve its oversight capacity congress also sought to reassert infl uence over the budget process with the congressional budget and impoundment control act 1974 because many agencies could not accurately account for their financia l operations congress passed the chief financial officers act 199023 and other laws to improve agencies capacities to manage their finances th list goes on as the compendiums more than 90 entries illustrate in sum then shoul d general management laws be thought of as legislative action and the results of congressional oversight nece ssary to bring disciplined management to executive branch agencies or less favorably should they be thought of as statutory directives that stifle fl exibility and initiative or does the answer lie somewhere in between for example the laws narrow agency discretion in management and perhaps help the president to motivate changes in agency behaviors the conclusion likely depends on the viewpoint of the questioner and the situation at hand but history can help shed light on the matter in any case numerous and potentially cont roversial issues both pe rennial and new remain which congress may consider before the report outlines some of these issues however the next section discusses how scholars have pproached an important ques tion to what extent can or should management practices in the public and private sectors be comparedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32388crs8 24 much of the training given to students in professional schools of public policy and administration and much of the publicsector management literature approach policy and management problems from the perspective of political appointees and senior career officials these unelected officials have c onsiderable administrative discretion in world where politics and administration are not always separable and where the officials work under laws and policies established by elected fficials as result considerable literature exists regarding how senior agency official s can use this discretion or seek additional discretion to improve government management practices and government performance or perhaps their definitions of performance for more on

administrators and 3 must serve goal s not of the organizations own choosing control over revenues productive factors and agency goals is all vested to an important degree in entities external to the

comparative difficulty measuring and coming to consensus on how to measure the performance of agencies33httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32388crs10 34 here the term management policy is defined generally as the principles or methods under which the executive branch or an agency is to be managed in the management and business literatures the terms management policy and business policy have been used

35 the literature surrounding this topic is extensive in building legislativecentered public administration rosenbloom generally argues that many general management laws were enacted as an effort to provide the executive with discreti on while still retaining congressional control and oversight over agency actions major themes and management policy options given the history of managing the executive branch and also the differences between management practices in the public and private sectors the entries in the compendium of general mana gement laws may raise public policy issues both for the general management laws themselves and for specific agencies moreover when considering the compendium as whole viewing the general management laws together several major themes emerge each of these themes in turn may raise potential issues and managemen t policy options for congress34 discretion for the executive branch congress frequently faces the question h ow much discretion should we leave for the executive branch35 for example when examining or reexamining any of the general management laws the questi on often becomes how much discretion the executive branch should be authorized to termine the contents scope or priorities of agency actions advantages and disadvantages this question has been heavily debated for some time on one hand giving disc retion to the executive branch can provide agencies flexibility to tailor the implementation of laws to specific circumstances as the president or agencies perceive them in addition some observers argue that this discretion allows agencies to be more res ponsive if circumstances later change for example an agency might take less time to issue and implement regulations or to exercise initiative to pursue management action than the time necessary for law to be passed further many argue that when agency responsibilities involve scientific standardsetting or other technical judgments the executive is often in better position to do so on the other hand discretion can allow the president or an agency to make decisions or engage in operations that mig ht not have support from congress had the subject been considered explicitly during th legislative process the presidents or an agencys views regarding the right thing to do might be at variance with those of congress and key stakeholde rs furthermore some argue that if the president orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32388crs11 36 congress can seek to reverse or modify an agencys decision either through oversight or legislative action however president may d ecide

the four general options come from d r oderick kiewiet and mathew d mccubbins the logic of delegation congressional parties and the appropriations process chicago university of chicago press 1991 pp 2738 the illustrative options come from sources including the kiewietmccubbins book and th is reports author kiewiet and mccubbins note that these four general options can sometimes impose financial and other costs on agencies 40 here the term contract is figurative and means the terms and conditions under which authority or power is delegated from the legisl ative body to an agency in delegation situation theorists see one actor the legislature as principal and the other actor an agency as an agent for the principal because the agen t can take action that is optimal in light of his or her own goals instead of th principals intended goals theorists call this situation an agency problem in response theorists often advocate establishing contract that aligns the terms and conditions of the delegation sometimes including incentives for the agent with the principals goals in order to accomplish the principals goals an agency has different views and acts accordingly congress might not have resources or time to notice the agency actions or to intervene in timely way36 granting discretion to the executive branch can also put key decisions in the power of unelected agency officials when some stakeholders might wish for more transparency and political accountability with regard to general management laws congress faced this tension between flexibility and accountability in 2002 and 2003 when considering whether to grant the departments of homela nd security dhs and defense dod discretion to determine some of the contents of th eir human resources management hrm systems through regulation37 similar situation arose in 1993 when the clinton administrations national performance review npr recommended number of ways to cut red tape in procurement policy culminating in passage of the federal acquisition streamlining act of 1994 fasa 108 stat 324338 the tension is perhaps most common in the regulatory arena management policy options in considering situations when congress weighs whether to give discretion to an ag ency and if so to what extent scholars have noted four general options that can be used alone or in combination by congress to address delegation situ ations and help balance flexibility with accountability39 contract design40 congress can set the conditions for delegation of authority to better ensure that its intentions will be carried out byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32388crs12 41 for presidential appointments that require th advice and consent of the senate hearing questions often relate to nominees skills and reputation the executive branch as well as reduce risk of adverse consequences for example congress could establish goals sanctions probation periods or suns ets require the use of pilot projects or establish profitshar ing relationships ie establish incentives for agencies to behave in ways that benefit both the agency and the government as whole for example an agency might be allowed to re tain 50 of unspent f unds after the end of fiscal year thereby providing an incentive against endoftheyear use it or lose it spending behaviors screening and selection mechanisms to avoid delegating authority to an agency in way that could risk poor onthejob performance with given task program or management initiative congress can try to look beforehand for signals or other information that indicate whether the executive branch agency and its officials will likely do the work effectively for example congress could convene hearings to determine whether the agency rigorously analyzed problem and its potentia l solutions or look for evidence that the agency has organizational capacity and management skill to do the job41 monitoring and reporting requirements to increase accountability and transparency fo r given activity or program congress can require agencies to report their actions taken milestones they have reached and an information the agencies have obtained during their activities the rationales might be to monitor agency actions that are difficult to oversee and b make available information that is difficult for congress and outside stakeholders to access the adve nt of information technology and the web may enable such reporting to be close to realtime and more frequently updated however so commentators argue that proliferation of repor ting requirements can be burdensome and that reports to congress are not always used institutional checks when authority is delegated to an agency congress can ensure that one or more additional agencies or entities can veto or block the delegate agencys actions for example congress could involve another agency in the promulgation of regulations such as the dhs pe rsonnel system which requires that regulations be prescribed jointly by dhs and the office of personnel management opm require noti ce and comment before an agency is allowed to proceed with certain actions provide sequential funding within an appropriation that is contingent upon

to be used after the supreme courts ruling in ins v chadha 1983 which struck down the legislative veto for more on committee vetoes see louis fisher congress as comanager of the execu tive branch in james p pfiffner ed the managerial presidency pp 306308 and louis fisher the legislative veto invalidated it survives law and contemporary problems vol 56 4 autumn 1993 pp 273292 43 an unqualified opinion indicates that an auditor found that an agencys financial statement presented variety of measures of the agencys financial condition fairly in all material respects and in conformity with specified accounting principles 44 however congress left some discretion to the president by allowing the office of management and budget to exempt very small agencies issue or use committee vetoes42 to prevent certain actions absent congressional committee approval standardization vs customization should the management laws under which agencies operate be standardized with rules that apply uniformly to many di fferent agencies or should some or all agencies have agencyspecific laws that ar customized to each agencys internal and external environments or should there be mix of these two approaches this tension between standardiza tion and customization arises frequently for congress with respect to management of the executive branch where varying degrees of standardization and customization can exist in general management laws authorizing statutes or appropriations three general approaches many experts believe standardization can help improve executive branch transparency and accountability for example the administrative procedure act enacted in 1946 was intended to establish basic requirements across the executive branch for agency rulemaking with regard to another functional area fina ncial management congress introduced standardization in stages the chief financial offi cers cfo act of 1990 104 stat 2838 as amended by the government management reform ac t of 1994 gmra 108 stat 3410 required 24 major executiv departments and agenci to prepare audited financial statements coveri ng all their accounts this requirement contributed to many agencies receiving unqualif ied clean opinions in fy200243 in 2002 congress further amended the cfo act to extend similar requirements to most other executive agencies with passage of the ccountability of tax dollars act 116 stat 204944 standardization can also promot accountability by putting the burden of proof on agencies to demonstrate wh or if exceptions are necessary by contrast customization can also be beneficial for effective management customization can help align an agencys management with both the agencys internal environment eg culture size d ecisionmaking processe s and its external environment eg economic conditions ev ents stakeholder and client needs congress regularly uses authorizing statutes appropriations and accompanying reports to require or direct specific actions or prohibiti ons for agencies but congress also builds customization into general management laws for example until recently small agencies were not genera lly required to prepar audited financial statements similarly when the department of homeland security dhs washttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32388crs14 45 the 108th congress is considering legislation h r 2886 s 1567 that would if enacted include dhs among the cfo act agencies 46 see the title 5 usc chapter 97 and chapter 99 entries in the compendium for more on this subject the 108th congress is considering legisla tion s 610 hr 1085 that would provide flexibilities for the national aeronautics and space administration nasa other titles of the united states code also contain personnel laws as the beginning of the compendiums section viia title 5 the federal civil service describes 47 this approach is somewhat akin to what management writers thomas peters and robert waterman described as simultaneous loosetight properties see thomas j peters and robert h waterman jr in search of excellence lessons from americas bestrun companies new york warner books 1982 pp 318325 for an overall assessment of peters thinking see micklethwait and wooldridge the witch doctors pp 7992established by the homeland security act of 2002 116 stat 2135 at 2145 the new agencys cfo position was not subject to cfo act requirements45 another example comes from the hrm area in the last two years dhs and the dod were granted authority to customize several significant but not all aspects of their hrm systems apart from the standardized laws of title 5 of the united states code 46 third possibility is to mix the two pproaches the examples described above move toward standardization or customization but also represent varying degrees of mixed approach balancing standardization with cu stomization under mixed approach general mana gement laws are applied to all or most agencies but congress can nevertheless make exceptions to smaller or larger extent or allow some flexibility within the laws broader requirements47 an example of the mixed approach is the government performance and results act of 1993 gpra 107 stat 285 which required most executive branch agencies in consultation with congress to develop strategic plans however gpra provided only general framework within which agencies were required to comply without prescribing detailed format or contents advantages and disadvantages each of these approaches standardization customization and mixed can bring advantages and disadvantages alongside the advantag described above standardization can sometimes be too rigid stifling initiative or creativity in turn customization can sometimes reduce transparency or accountability if agencies do not report in real time on the nature and status of their customized efforts or if oversight and analytical resources are too scarce or distracted to support monitoring how well customized law is working customization can also lead to different entities working at cross purposes for example if agencies gain pay flexibility but then were to begin bidding war for certain types of employ ees the budgets of each agency would come under pressure mixed approaches can ffer from all these problems therefore in addition to the three general approach outlined above congress also has policy options for avoiding these problems management policy options generally the decision to use one of these approaches is highly contextual dependi ng on the nature of the problem to be solved as defined differently by numerous stakeholders the problems history the actors who are involved and host of other factors nonethele ss one overall optionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32388crs15 48 the fragmentation exists among several different titles of the united states code and within title 5 exists across multiple agen cies including dhs dod and th internal revenue service irs 49 as discussed previously in the management literature functions refer to business areas that require related bundles of skill or groups of people with similar skills and performing similar tasks such as human resources financial management and information technology this usage of the term function is different from two others in title 5 of the united states code and in budgetary accounting 50 the internal revenue service irs restru cturing and reform ac t of 1998 112 stat 685 continuedis to examine regularly whether increased customization or standardization in general management law is necessary for improved transpar ency accountability efficiency or effectiveness analytical support in weighing the evidence can come from variety of sources including agency management agency program evaluations inspectors general the ge neral accounting office gao and outside scholars and evaluators another overall option in situations wher customization is widespread eg human resources related laws is to reduce the analytical burden for congress and other stakeholders in their efforts to monitor the situation by requiring the executive branch to maintain comprehensive realtime descriptions of the current state of affairs and maintain updated comparisons showing an differences across agencies as illustrated by the compendiums introduc tory profile of title 5 human resources laws section viia title 5 the federa l civil service increasing fragmentation of civil service laws may increase the difficulty of monitoring comparing and analyzing governmentwide developments in general areas like pay performance management and adverse ac tions and appeals for di fferent agency and bureau workforces48 establishment of reporting requi rements in areas of widespread customization may help reduce the analy tical burden for congress and the public in examining the extent of customization nd standardization or exploring possible changes if customization does not produce the desired outcomes such reporting might be possible on realtime basis on the web central management agencies like the office of management and budget omb opm the general services administration gsa the financial management service fms of the treasury department or others could be candidates to report how certain management policies are customized and thereby facilitate g overnmentwide analysis and comparisons however such requirements would likely entail costs for the reporting agencies functional silos vs integrated general management it is coincidence that the genera l management laws can be grouped into functions such as fina ncial management human re sources and procurement most organizations in the private and public sectors manage themselves to greater or lesser extent with functional orient ation or functional structures49 for example even when an organization is structured according to customers or as in the case of the internal revenue service taxpayer groups functional perspectives still reside within business or administrative units shared services and headquarters50 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32388crs16 50 continued at 689 pl 105206 required the irs to orga nize itself by taxpayer groups but irss new organizational structure created specialist f unctional organizations throughout the agency the organization design literature has reached consensus that one type of organizational orientation or structure by function geography client cust omer product matrix etc is necessarily best instead recurrent theme is that an organization s structure should flow from its strategy for accomplishing its goals even then however different organizational structures have different sets of advantages and disadvantages for discussion see jay r galbraith designing organizations rev san francisco josseybass

ed homewood il irwin 1993 pp 136141 52 the silo metaphor comes from an image of vertical silos on an organization chart that do not communicate with each other horizontally to illustrate the same point some commentators use the synonymous term stovepiped organization see schermerhorn core concepts of management p 120 53 here the term general management has different meaning from the definition offered previously in the current case general management corresponds to the integration of multiple functional perspectives into one holistic or general perspective previously general management referred to laws that apply across multiple agencies both of these senses of the term general management can be helpful when grappling with management issues two perspectives on management functional perspective is considered important because it can boos t efficiency through specialization and ensure centralized control over strategic decisions however if the functional orientation becomes too inwardlooking organizationwide coordination and decisionmaking can become problema tic and an organizations internal development of general ma nagers can be inhibited51 thus borrowing term from the management literature various functions can tend to operate as functional silos in isolation from each other this can create problems for the organization as whole or cause opport unities to be missed52 management literature acknowledges the continuing importance of functional perspectives but only within the br oader context of an integrated general management perspective53 an excerpt from one business schools website explains this perspective all of us come to problem opportunity or decision with set of assumptions that are based on our backgrounds and expe riences for example someone who has spent years in finance function concentrating on say managing cash flow raising capital and budgeting will have particular point of view that is different from someone whose experience has been in marketing focusing on product development segmenting customers pr oduct positioning etc two implications arise from this 1 each person will have only limited view of the whole story and may be driven to define problem as finance or marketing problem because this is what their expe rience tells them and 2 each person may be correct but only partially the solution is to develop general management perspective the general management perspective seeks to integratehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32388crs17 54 see httporacle wwwdartmouthedudartgrouchotuck _mba_programsyllabusp_idagm visited jan

potentia l toolbox of options for addressing executive branch management problems many of the genera l management laws focus on improving the executive branchs management fundament als in individual

challenges in its oversight of executive branch ma nagement especially regarding how to ensure executive branch agencies improve their management practices by complying with general management laws and how or whether to measure agenci progress in improving their management practices management literature generally holds that measurement can be strong motivator to action and frequently quotes industrial psychologist mason haire what gets measured gets done if you ar looking for quick ways to change how an organization behaves change the measurement system61 while measurement systems can motivate action and commitment they can also create perverse incentives in some situations to use an analogy from the private sector if companys employees are rewarded only on the basis of short term profits and not longterm research and development that would keep the company profitable in the future employees may show less interest in longerterm performance62 n illustration more applicable to the federal government may be the achievement of unqualified financial audits where clean audits of an agencys financial systems look like sign of good fiscal manageme nt but not if they are achieved

executive branch nongovernmental organizations80 or congress have endeavored to in fluence agencies to improve their management practices by measuring compliance with general management laws for decades agency igs and gao have focu sed in detail on specific problems within agencies as described earlier omb and gao also created high risk programs to focus on particularly troubl esome management areas moreover some especially in congress have undertaken measurem ent efforts to make assessments about specific general management laws and functional areas that are comparable across agencies for example for several years representative stephen horn issued letter grades to evaluate agency financial management and information security performance representative adam putnam has continued that practice for information security in evaluating agency compliance with the federal information security management act of 200281 senator fred thompson similarly issued grades for agency annual performance reports requi red by the government performance and results act82 management policy options in light of this overview one could again ask the questions that began this section what options are available to congress to ensure that executive branch agencies improve their management practices by complying with the general management laws furthermore if it is possible to measure agency progress through crossagency comparisons that are easily understood and that motivate action by political appointees and senior careerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32388crs25 83 an observer recently

22 2004 hard copy is available from the authors files officials how could congress measure or monitor the extent to which agencies improve their management prac tices some options include maintain current efforts congress could continue to use existing oversight tools and institutions including gao and agency igs to monitor progress selectively in the executive branchs efforts to improve agency management practices while preserving executive branch discretion in the scope and intensity of these efforts this option would arguably involve little add itional cost and would not constrain the activities of the executive branch more than currently critics argue however that congress does not use these tools effectively or frequently enough independent verification and validation congress could ask or direct gao and agency igs to more systematically verify and validate pma stoplight scores and the corresponding agency actions taken either governmentwide or in selected agencies this option could increase congressional confidence in executive branch measurements and determinations but would likely involve costs and could be perceived negatively by the executive branch as micromanagement or redundant with current activities transparency congress could secure from omb or the agencies access to final pma stoplight worksheets similar to what omb currently provides for the part this option could further open executive branch management problems to public discussion but the executive branch might argue that such requirement would increase costs and managerial workloads independent measurement congress could direct gao or igs to develop measures and systematically measure agency progress in improving management practices in way that could be compared easily across agencies along functional lines or for specific general management laws83 this option coul d make management improvement measurement more systematic so that it would survive the transition from one presidential administration to another but could increase workload and cost s for gao igs and agencies httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32388crs26 84 in the 105th congress the house passed legisla tion hr 2883 that would have among other things required an agency to describe major management problems affecting the agency and the specific goals strategies and performance measures to resolve those problems however further action occurred on the bill beyond referral to the senate committee on governmental affairs gpra allows but does not necessarily require agencies to establish managementrelated g eneral goals and performance goals by contrast ombs fy2005 guidance fo r complying with gpra omb circular a11 available at httpwwwwhitehousegovombcircularsindexhtml visited jan 22 2004 states that agencies may establish manageme ntrelated general goals but could also be interpreted as saying that agencies should treat managementrelated goals and indicators as means and strategies rather than performance go als or indicators per the circular section 516 through 517 means should be descri bed briefly and strategies should be highlighted which could result in meager attention by agencies in these documents 85 inspector general positions were established at the department of health education and welfare now health and human services by pl 94505 1976 and at the department of energy by pl 9591 1977 before passage of the inspector general act of 1978 chief financial officer position was established at the department of veterans affairs by pl 100527 1988 before passage of th chief financial officers act of 1990 measurement through gpra congress could amend gpra to require agencies formally and explicitly to address major management problems and highrisk areas in their strategic plans annual performance plans and nnual performance reports this might be done for example by requiring the establishment of milestones and timelines for improvement both in addressing the problems and in building agency management capacity eg identifying whether where and to what extent management capacity needs to be improved for an agen cy to make adequate progress84 congress could also require the president to address these issues in the governmentwide performance plan required by 31 usc 1105a28 depending on congressional preference this option could make manageme nt improvement measurement statutory or more systematic or both but could increase workload for agency and omb personnel agency chief officers and interagency councils fifth and final major

fought for resources within their agencies and sought to beco more independent furthermore the pcie was roundly endorsed as tool for both enhancing the lobbying power of the igs and building the informal networks that support organizational learning91 the pcie established standing committees in areas where igs found benefits from sharing ideas or cooperating on projects according to an ig who was asked what he thought about the pcie in hearin g before the house committee on government operations in 1988 i think the pcie has been an extraordinarily positive innovation it has permitted us to work together and to come together we develop our own work plan it has provided mechanism i think is unique in government were all very close colleagues and friends because of the fact that we can work together we have mechanism to go across the government on fraud waste and abuse issues i cant overstate the valu of that particular vehicle of the council92 however the pcie was also criticized

management has only modest resources at his disposal but he has trem endous leveraging opportun ities through the many interagency councils he chairs that pproach is clearly working with the cfo council which can serve as model for other interagency efforts98 after the cfo council was established nd running congress established three additional chief officer councils th cio council in 2002

concur that these three chief officer positions the ones with longest track records are important and have been successful to greater or lesser extents in bringing focus to their functional perspectives100 nonetheless as the entries in the compendium mention observers have iden tified some difficult challeng that face these officers in their efforts to improve agency mana gement practices including high turnover among cios potential difficulties with change management as agency financial reporting requirements continue to accelerate and performance measurement more broadly

perspective at the expense of more integrated general management perspective with regard to interagency councils of chief officers observers have noted periods of more and less effectiveness as discussed above however observers generally agree that interage ncy councils have been bene ficial public management scholars in recent years have paid incr easing attention to the potential benefits of interagency collaboration102 as noted in the compendiums entry for chapter 14 of title 5 united states code congress received testimony from former omb official that councils can play an importa nt role in improving federal management i think the chief human capital offi cers council is important because more and more academic research on how organizations work well suggests that setting up networks of people to share knowledge share best practices share information share approaches is very important thing in getting organizations to perform well so i think having situation where the different human capital officers in the different parts of the federal government meet regularly get to know each other talk to each other can be very valuable103 within the management literature and in many companies and government agencies considerable attention s been devoted to this knowledge management perspective104 however management theorists are everwary of the possible allure of seeing agencies problems primarily from the perspective of only one function which they argue should be avoided if that functional perspective becomes too narrow and runs the risk of doing violence to other functions or the agency overall in addition some scholars and practitioners have empha sized instead that the problem of improving federal executive br anch management requires rethinking of the structure and role of omb within the executive office of the president105 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32388crs34 105 continued more than ever paper presented at the na tional academy of public

information security creating these positions might bring more integrated approach to security and risk management at federal agencies many federal agencies however may already have established systems and processe s to address these issues in addition in view of the increasing number of chief officers some observers might argue that requiri ng an additional type of chief officer for agencies would be excessive chief program evaluation officers many observers have asserted that agencies frequently do not adequately evaluate the performance or results of their pr ograms or integrate evaluation efforts across agency boundaries po ssibly due to lack of capacity management attention and commitment or resources110 congress could establish chief program ev aluation officer cpeo positions in major agencies to bring more attention to this function if it deemed these to be serious problems because programs can differ considerably and the field of program evaluation is highly interdisciplinary evaluation methods differ from program to program111 proponents might argue that establishing these chief officer positions could create seat at the table for program evaluation in agency senior management teams helping agency efforts to improve performance or coordinate programs with overlapping missions however critics might argue that establishing another type

appointed positions under current law some positions are required to be political others are required to be career and some are left to an agency heads discretion in recent years there has been discussion of these differences in congressional testimony regarding the proposed chco positions witnesses cam down on both sides of the question112 political appointees can get seat at the table with the agencys leadership to ensure that given functional perspective is considered however career offi cials can provide continuity and institutional memory from one presidential administration to another while by contrast politi cal appointees turn over frequently similar arguments were voiced with regard to caos113 in enacting the cfo act congress reflected both of these perspectives the cfos were political while the deputies were career chief officer reporting relationships as illustrated by table 1 cfo and cios by law must report directly to the agency head while igs must report to the agency head or to the official next in rank however the reporting re lationships of chcos and caos are left to each agency heads discretion are these reporting relationships still appropriate in view of agency management needs and progress or lack thereof in addressing ma jor management problems one argument made fo r direct reporting relationship to the agency head is to ensure that the chief officer who brings his or her functional perspective gets personal access to the agencys senior leadership however agen cy heads frequently have large number of people reporting directly to them ie direct reports an additional direct report could cau too large span of control for the heads of some executive branch agencies the ig councils with regard to inte ragency councils potentially important option for congress to cons ider is whether to make the ig councils statutory by codifying th mandates of the pcie and ecie into law versus the status quo of allowing the two councils to
