primarily due to an increase in utility costs employee benefits and additional decommissioning costs the increase in decommissioning costs of approximately 364 million was virtually offset by miscellaneous income recorded from realized gains on assets in nuclear decommissioning trust we suggest that alliant energy review with its bankers or other appropriate advisors the impact of the esi

esi is currently generating significant margins purchase accounting determining which entity is the acquirer for accounting purposes and the value of the acquiree are important decisions that affect the accounting for the transaction the criteria for determining the acquirer for accounting purposes and the value of the acquiree are included in the detail section of this report for purposes of determining the acquisition value the stock price of the acquiring company few days before and after the announcement date is used for purposes of assigning fair value to net assets the measurement date is when the transaction closes as opposed to the announcement date solely for the information and internal use of alliant energy corporation and not to be relied upon by any other person or entity 2 draft merger acquisition services deloitte touche llp accounting standards require that the acquired companys net assets be written up to their fair value which would include the atc investment energy contracts and certain other assets such as land and the synfuel investment additionally the writeup to fair value would remove deferred gains from wpsrcs financial statements income from the synfuel investment and land sales would be significantly reduced in post merger earnings all these items will affect reported earnings after the transaction closes accounting rules for regulated utilities do not require the regulated net assets to be written up to fair value however there may be some net assets in the regulated business that would be required to be written up to fair value for example excess land or net assets that are disallowed for regulatory purposes any costs associated with plan to exit an activity of wpsrc would be reflected as component of purchase

matters that based on our discussions with you we believe would be of significance or interest to you or might require further consideration this memo may not encompass all the schedules or other materials sent or verbal comments previously made to you other factors not discussed or referred to in this memo should be considered in evaluating the merits of the transaction including the consideration to be paid our observations described in this memo are based on financial information through june 30 2004 unless otherwise noted although our analyses and inquiries may have covered certain financial data subsequent to june 30 2004 the availability of only limited financial information precluded further investigation beyond this date the analyses and inquiries that we performed through october 1 2004 are detailed in appendix 1summary of due diligence services and can be summarized as follows read and analyzed publicly available information in the companys sec filings and on its web site materials provided in the data room and additional information we requested and received from the company solely for the information and internal use of alliant energy corporation and not

considered upon the acquisition of wpsrc are described below we understand that definitive purchase and sale agreement is not currently available and the terms of the transaction have not been finally negotiated however we wanted to provide you with accounting guidance that should be considered to determine the appropriate purchase accounting treatment the first step in purchase accounting is to determine the accounting acquirer in the transaction in accordance with fas 141 the entity that issues the equity interests is generally the acquiring entity commonly the acquiring entity is the larger entity however the facts and circumstances surrounding business combination sometimes indicate that smaller entity acquires larger one in some business combinations the combined entity assumes the name of the acquired entity thus in identifying the acquiring entity in combination effected through an exchange of equity interests all pertinent facts and circumstances shall be considered in particular the relative voting rights in the combined entity after the combination all else being equal the acquiring entity is the combining entity whose owners as group retained or received the larger portion of the voting rights in the combined entity the composition of the governing body of the combined entityall else being equal the acquiring entity is the combining entity whose owners or governing body has the ability to elect or appoint voting majority of the governing body of the combined entity the composition of the senior management of the combined entityall else being equal the acquiring entity is the combining entity whose senior management dominates that of the combined entity senior management generally consists of the chairman of the board chief executive officer chief operating officer chief financial officer and those divisional heads reporting directly to them or the executive committee if one exists the terms of the exchange of equity securitiesall else being equal the acquiring entity is the combining entity that pays premium over the market value of the equity securities of the other combining entity or entities once the terms of the transaction are defined we can offer more guidance as to which entity is the acquirer for accounting purposes assuming that wpsrc is the acquired company for accounting purposes the value of wpsrc for purchase accounting should be determined as follows solely for the information and internal use of alliant energy corporation and not to be relied upon by any other person or entity 10 draft merger acquisition services deloitte touche llp in accordance with fas 141 paragraph 22 the fair value of securities traded in the market is generally more clearly evident than the fair value of an acquired entity thus the quoted market price of an equity security issued to effect business combination generally should be used to estimate the fair value of an acquired entity after recognizing possible effects of price fluctuations quantities traded issue costs and the like the market price for reasonable period before and after the date that the terms of the acquisition are agreed to and announced shall be considered in determining the fair value of securities issued eitf 9912 defines the reasonable period of time as the securities should be valued based on market prices few days before and after the measurement date determinedbut that the measurement period would not include any dates after the date the business combination is consummated for purposes of assigning the fair value to the acquired companys net assets the fair value of the individual assets and liabilities is determined when the transaction closes as opposed to the announcement date for utility property plant and equipment ppe subject to traditional costof service regulation and statement 71 depreciated original cost is typically equal to fair value for other utility assets and liabilities under the same conditions book value is typically equal to fair value if an amount paid for utility ppe exceeds its original cost depreciated and that higher amount is recoverable through future rates the fair value of ppe has been increased and an acquisition adjustment should be recorded as component of utility plant if the excess payment is not included in future rates that amount typically represents goodwill because the fercs uniform system of accounts does not have an account for goodwill many utilities have recorded goodwill in the acquisition adjustment account for regulatory reporting an appropriate reclassification is necessary for gaapbased financial statements the fercs accounting policy staff issued guidance in july 2003 which states that amounts so allocated to utility plant in excess of depreciated original cost at the date of acquisition should be an acquisition adjustment in account 114 and the excess of the cost of the acquired company over the sum of the amounts assigned to all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed should be recorded as goodwill in account 186 miscellaneous deferred debits in accordance with eitf 953 cost resulting from plan to exit an activity for example severance or relocation of an acquired company should be recognized as liability assumed as of the consummation date of the acquisition only if the cost is not associated with or is not incurred to generate revenues of the combined entity after the consummation date and it meets either of the following criteria solely for the information and internal use of alliant energy corporation and not to be relied upon by any other person or entity 11 draft merger acquisition services deloitte touche llp the cost has future economic benefit to the combined company is incremental to other costs incurred by either the acquired company or the acquiring company in the conduct of activities prior to the consummation date and will be incurred as direct result of the plan to exit an activity of the acquired company the notion of incremental does not contemplate diminished future economic benefit to be derived from the cost but rather the absence of the cost in either companys activities immediately prior to the consummation date the cost represents an amount to be incurred by the combined company under contractual obligation of the acquired company that existed prior to the consummation date and will either continue after the plan is completed with economic benefit to the combined company or be penalty incurred by the combined company to cancel that contractual obligation any such costs associated with plan to exit an activity of wpsrc would be reflected as component of goodwill it is not appropriate to account for exiting alliant energy activities as acquisition costs rather these costs should be expensed as incurred wpsrcs investment in eco 12 ie the synfuel investment should be recorded at fair value which will eliminate the 80 deferred gain recorded on the balance sheet as of june 30 2004 and the recognition of the deferred gain in the income statement after the transaction closes also the higher fair value assigned must be amortized against earnings wpsrc is also recognizing interest income on notes receivable attributable to this investment the interest rate on these receivables should be adjusted to current rates in purchase accounting wpsrc owns land that will be required to be written up to its fair value future sales of land recorded at fair value would reduce the gains currently being recognized by wpsrc 0 1 wpsrcs contracts will be required to be recorded at fair value whether or not the contracts are derivatives for accounting purposes which would affect the profitability of the nonregulated business after the transaction closes additionally an allocation to intangible assets may be required for these energy contracts which would increase amortization expense for example if pdi has power sales contract with terms that are favorable compared to market that contract is recorded as an asset at its fair value at closing and that amount is subsequently amortized to earnings solely for the information and internal use of alliant energy corporation and not to be relied upon by any other person or entity 12 draft merger acquisition services deloitte touche llp the atc investment will likely have significant write up to fair value the higher fair value could result in subsequent impairment charge to earnings if the value subsequently declines the combined company will likely continue the equity method of accounting for the atc investment as the combined company will only have two of the five voting shareholders of atc management inc and atc would not likely be treated as variable interest entity also refer to the discussion above regarding utility purchase accounting as atcs activities are currently 100 covered by fas 71 the excess of fair value over wpss carrying amount would likely be assigned to nonamortizable goodwill as part of the equity method of accounting 2wisconsin river power is currently owned 50 by wps and 50 by alliant energy alliant energy will consolidate this investment in its financial statements after the transaction closes also refer to the discussion above regarding utility purchase accounting 1 as indicated in the 2003 form 10k wpsrcs regulated operation is the plan sponsor for the qualified retirement plans and the postretirement plans benefit plans covering both regulated and nonregulated employees can cause complex allocation determinations if valuation allowance is required for wpsrcs significant tax credit carry forwards any subsequent reduction of the valuation allowance does not increase earnings but instead will decrease goodwill if change in the valuation allowance occurs for the alliant energy deferred tax assets at the acquisition date this change would be recorded in the combined companys income statement in the quarter the transaction closes 3 under new accounting rules eitf 041 that are under consideration and could be in effect by the time the transaction closes all preexisting contracts between wpsrc and alliant energy would be accounted for at closing as if the contracts settled the fair market value this settlement could require either gains or losses to be recorded in alliant energys financial statements prior to applying purchase accounting alliant energy has joint plant rail car leases that have not been accounted for as leases once the transaction occurs this accounting treatment may change and could require the plant rail leases to be recorded as capital leases on the balance sheet after the acquisition solely for the information and internal use of alliant energy corporation and not to be relied upon by any other person or entity 13 draft merger acquisition services deloitte touche llp 42 the goodwill arising from this transaction will be allocated to both the regulated and nonregulated business there is potential risk of subsequent goodwill impairment if for instance goodwill is assigned to the energy trading unit and the market for energy trading businesses declines in addition in prior small acquisition by wpsrc wpsrcs regulator allowed recovery of some of the premium over book value in rates while alliant energy may not request such rate treatment if allowed that portion of goodwill or acquisition adjustment would be amortized to earnings 2 pdi power plants have emission allowances as part of the acquisition these emission allowances are considered separate intangibles assets should be recorded at fair value and amortized against earnings as used solely for the information and internal use of alliant energy corporation and not to be relied upon by any other person or entity 14 draft merger acquisition services deloitte touche llp 2 although the definitive agreement is not currently available we wanted to provide you with accounting guidance regarding push down accounting ie basis of accounting of purchased assets and liabilities in the acquired companys financial statements this will impact the separate financial statements of wpsc as we understand wpsc is expected to continue to file as separate registrant after closing 5 2 the sec staff believes that purchase transactions that result in an entity becoming substantially wholly owned establish new basis of accounting for the purchased assets and liabilities when the form of ownership is within the control of the parent the basis of accounting for purchased assets and liabilities should be the same regardless of whether the entity continues to exist or is merged into the parents operations therefore it is the sec staffs view that companys cost of acquisition should be pushed down ie used to establish new accounting basis in the acquired companys separate financial statements related question concerning the sec staffs view is if the acquired company has public debt or preferred stock outstanding the sec staff recognizes that the existence of significant outstanding public debt or preferred stock might affect the parents ability to control the form of ownership although encouraging its use the staff generally does not insist on pushdown accounting in these circumstances although the sec staff has adopted policy of requiring pushdown accounting for subsidiaries in certain circumstances such policy has not been adopted by the fasb thus pushdown accounting is not required for nonsec registrants that are subsidiaries of other companies but which issue separate financial companies however if these companies ultimately fall within sec jurisdiction or the public debtpreferred stock is eliminated in the case of an sec registrant they will have to adjust their financial statements retroactively to give effect to their parent companys acquisition price also pushdown accounting is acceptable for non sec registrants in those circumstances that under sec policies would lead to pushdown accounting adjustments when options regarding purchase and pushdown accounting exist as result of business combination the accounting tax regulatory financial and economic consequences that result from such alternatives should be identified analyzed and evaluated the company should specifically consider the implications of the wisconsin commission orders addressing wisconsin gas companys use of push down accounting after its acquisition by wisconsin energy corporation open need to obtain the wpsrc debt agreements which were not available in the data room solely for the information and internal use of alliant energy corporation and not to be relied upon by any other person or entity 15 draft merger acquisition services

was partially offset by the effect of cooler weather in 2003 gas rate increases the gas utility segment revenues increased 935 million primarily due to an increase in the average cost of natural gas

silver lake reservoir owned by wps was breached silver lake is located in michigans upper peninsula near marquette michigan it is the uppermost impound of the dead river hydroelectric project and is used by wps to store spring runoff of regulated releases and power generation late in the year as result of heavy rain experienced in the area the fuse plug that had been recently installed at silver lake was activated releasing sustained flows to the fuse flow plug spillway channel these sustained flows ultimately led contrary to design expectations to the erosion of the entire fuse plug
