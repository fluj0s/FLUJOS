selected quotes from audio file opirgmp3818 aaron leewudrick if its possible if in one fell swoop to take over the board of directors of opirg i think that it would be pretty impressive and youd be hero to the conservative movement if you can pull that off1403 ryan oconnor you create your spin about what is the real issue and its nothing else its not an ideological bone the conservatives are picking1420 ryan oconnor so how do you address pirg pirg is doing something on your campus its cause that maybe you and your friends in the tory club dislike its always the tories and wpirg every two years something happens1520 ryan oconnor were just using this as an issue to attack the pirg youve got to grasp onto something thats salient in the eyes of the campus community it was just three tories having beer at the pub one night saying what are we going to do about this1700 ryan oconnor sometimes you cant attach the tory name to it and you have to be sensitive to that1726 aaron leewudrick if norman finkelstein comes to campus ﬁnd your allied groups get the jewish students association involved if its radical feminist whos very prochoice your allies are going to be the prolife people on campus2235 ryan oconnor pretend the campus coalition for liberty is large organization we had branches at ﬁve campuses yeah we had ﬁve people one at each of ﬁve campuses and theyre all tories i founded chapter of the campus coalition for liberty it was guy with computer and press release2417 kevin wiener so um how about instead of necessarily ﬁghting them we just get our own nonproﬁt corporation that receives student fees and just have our own student funding to ﬁght them or the alternative if you can get student government which in some places you can because opirg is nonproﬁt and not club or charity just amending the student funding rules like in order to receive funding you must be club or charity and then bam theyre just not eligible to receive fees2727 ryan oconnor get them off the fee statement which should be the ultimate objective3453 aaron leewudrick find out what those rules are for fee referendums and in some cases thats preissue for you to worry about so lets say there are rules you can the year before say you had threeyearplan the next year you could without mentioning anything about pirg get referendum process in place which says if you are able to collect three percent of all signatures of the student body then you can trigger referendum very few people in the abstract would oppose that because theyd say oh thats great idea and then couple of years later use it to bring forward the issue3635 aaron leewudrick you will be surprised at what people will sign if you put it in front of them especially if you put it in benign terms3710 aaron leewudrick i say we because even though ryan oconnor was the forced neutral as student president and as the tory president it was all orchestrated obviously behind closed doors and it actually worked out well because it looked like different groups of stakeholders like im the outsider coming in and you guys were just the responsible student government and we had other members of council guy he appointed to council he got speaking rights but he wasnt an elected member but just as another voice at the table it made it look like there were all kinds of different corners where in fact we were all on the same team4214 aaron leewudrick campus radicals for action on zimbabwe yes or something like that they were great shell group feel free to use campus coalition for liberty thats ours so we have logo and everything you can use it now and it would be like established in 2002 we joke about these shell organizations and some of you might think well isnt that little bit disingenuous arent you just inﬂating your numbers isnt that kind of underhanded and sneaky my answer to that is not really because that is exactly what the left does im just trying to level the playing ﬁeld4518 aaron leewudrick use groups that might be jealous of what opirg gets thats how you pitch it just look up the president of the chess club and say hey how come you dont get money wouldnt it be fair if we all did and build allies that way5005 ryan oconnor when aaron was doing the petition campaign which i knew nothing about i was printing them in my frickin ofﬁce in student government of course i knew about it of course we were behind it i couldnt take public position on that issue because although i wasnt running for reelection this was three months before the end of my mandate thats sort of the picking your battles if we had made them an issue tory would ever get elected to student government again5418 ryan oconnor lot of people arent involved in partisan politics and they dont know about messaging they dont know about get out the vote they dont know about things that you guys are exposed to on regular basis whenever we have to campaign for the legislature or parliament we were doing things that we learned from our involvement in politics take those lessons and apply them on campus5834 ryan oconnor all the tory student councillors were all voting the same way and all had the same speaking points it was really hilarious and really transparent but you have to do what you have to do we had game
