prudent to caution the bolivian people that the matter will be decided by the us congress the ambassador told the vice president that president bushs support is an example of our desire to improve

002 of 005 greenlees advice to the gob on atpdea saying that he hoped that the ambassador would continue in the same vein reinforcing the message please lower the tone 4 c the ambassador told garcia linera that the best way forward for the gob would be to not only lower but to improve its public discourse toward the united states he cautioned that president morales antiamerican remarks may damage bolivias chances for an atpdea extension the ambassador explained that before his arrival at post he participated in counternarcotics certification conversations in which he said there were serious questions about recertifying bolivia if we hadnt certified the ambassador said we wouldnt be talking about an atpdea extension now the ambassador told the vice president that he offered the president the minister of the presidency and the foreign minister the same counsel that the gob needs to lower its tone he said the usg cannot compartmentalize its foreign policy but looks at the overall relationship the ambassador said that by accusing the usg and the embassy of conspiracy and assassination attempts the gob had fallen well below the accepted norms of diplomatic and political discourse 5 c garcia linera attempted to defend morales antiamerican rhetoric saying that the presidents history with the united states was one of distance and conflict he said the gob wants to turn the page but that the history is still there although each time less the vice president said the gob wants to close the era of mistrust definitively saying that morales trip to the united states for the united nations general assembly was big step forward in this regard he said the trip enabled morales to see the human side of our country and that it was important for morales to see the united states as an open pluralistic society he said the president was excited when he returned energized by the personal contact with americans he had had in the united states the vice president said he celebrated morales trip and described the bilateral relationship following it as closer friendlier garcia linera said he hopes that morales will visit the united states again soon the visit aside garcia linera said he could not guarantee that morales would not suffer rhetorical relapse but promised to try he said that he had asked ambassador greenlee for good dose of patience and asked ambassador goldberg for the same as very personal request garcia linera said the gob is not looking for confrontation or tension he said that once in while fissures will open things surface but we want to expand and improve relations choose your friends carefully 6 c along the same lines the ambassador cautioned garcia linera that bolivias relationship with other countries may have consequences he said bolivias relations are bolivias business but that the gob should be aware that they can impact its relations with other countries including the united states the ambassador offered the example of recent antiamerican speech by the venezuelan ambassador with morales at his side the ambassador added that one in the diplomatic corps seems to have met the venezuelan ambassador signal that raises questions about the venezuelans activities here garcia linera said he understood and said we dont need those consequences likewise the ambassador suggested that the gob be careful not to interfere in the democratic processes of neighboring countries citing press report that morales and ecuadors paz 00002910 003 of 005 legitimate president rafael correa would speak at an october 26 event supporting bolivias revolution septel the ambassador said respect for ecuadors democratic process could only help bolivias international image garcia linera appeared to take the ambassadors comment on board responding that the gob was not funding the conference you can talk to 7 c the vice president said he hoped the ambassador would rely on him as an instant messenger for any communications with the gob in order to avoid missteps in the relationship garcia linera said dont doubt as channel for anything he encouraged the ambassador to pass him criticisms and observations and to call him at any hour or to ask for meeting with him or the president on short notice garcia linera referred to recent gob experience with bad intelligence presumably on the subject of us students in bolivia whom the gob alleged were undercover us military operatives saying that if similar situation presents itself the president would like to call the ambassador to confirm the information garcia linera lamented that at the time of that incident the gob didnt have bridge to the embassy leading the president to keep the information to himself and then to speak about it publicly garcia linera admitted that was their mistake and that they have to work against susceptibility to certain types of information 8 c the ambassador thanked the vice president for his offer and agreed to contact him with any questions or concerns he also encouraged garcia linera to call him particularly before publicly accusing the usg of any wrongdoing the ambassador stressed that the usg has not reacted publicly to morales accusations because of our desire to improve relations in turn garcia linera said he would welcome the ambassadors counsel on how the gob could improve the bilateral relationship the vice president admitted the gob had been skeptical about former ambassador greenlees advice in this regardand had even debated about whether greenlees advice was good garcia linera said in the end they had accepted the embassys advice in good faith and had been pleasantly surprised military relations vp wants to strengthen 9 c in response to the ambassadors stated desire to improve milmil relations despite article 98 restrictions garcia linera said he hoped to remove the f10 counterterrorism matter and the manpads issue from the bilateral agenda although he said the missiles transfer would continue to be an internal issue garcia linera said bolivian forces are longer using the f10 arms and that plans are underway to transfer them to permit us access the ambassador said he was optimistic about resolving that issue and hoped that we could do the same with the missiles transfer despite the political complexities of that issue garcia linera said that while he understands the us position the pending internal investigation of president rodriguez and other gob officials would not be resolved quickly 10 c the ambassador also said that we would like to do more in the area of military education and exchanges garcia linera welcomed the overture adding that he would like to take up the full range of military cooperation prohibited by article 98 later the ambassador gently reminded

the subject with the ministries of defense presidency and foreign relations counternarcotics an initial conversation 11 c on counternarcotics the ambassador said of course the usg would like to see the gobs voluntary eradication program work but said the gob would have to show quick results the ambassador said that while he realized coca is sensitive topic domestically it is in both countries interest to work together to fight drug trafficking he told garcia linera that it would be impossible for the usg to support the gobs coca ideology eg industrialization and legalization suggesting instead that the two governments focus on their common interest in stopping the flow of drugs he also told the vice president that president morales illinformed statements on us drug use were not helpful the ambassador told garcia linera that the united states has worked hard to lower drug consumption but that consumption is up in europe and is growing problem in brazil and bolivia garcia linera described eradication as complicated but noted that the morales government is eradicating in many new areas garcia linera made subtle pitch for increased us counternarcotics assistance saying the gob needs additional eradicators if not he said we will see an increase in narcotrafficking the ambassador suggested they discuss counternarcotics strategies in depth soon and noted that the october 28 arrival of inl deputy assistant secretary christy mccampbell would present an immediate opportunity for further dialogue united public front 12 c following the meeting the ambassador and the vice president held joint press conference at the ambassadors urging the first of its kind since morales took office in january like the meeting the tone of the press conference was warm the vice president publicly thanked the ambassador for his visit describing it as cordial garcia linera said he and the ambassador had discussed steps forward on many issues of mutual interest and cited the gobs will and his own personal commitment to expand and improve relations with the united states particularly in order to promote democracy and fight poverty and drug trafficking comment starting new

bolivian children note garcia linera said the president was delighted to give the children toys because he had played with sheep bones as child in eocnomicallydepressed oruro end note garcia linera
