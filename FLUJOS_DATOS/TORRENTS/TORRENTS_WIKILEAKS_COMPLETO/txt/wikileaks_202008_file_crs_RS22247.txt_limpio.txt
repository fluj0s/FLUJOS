political situation bulgaria is parliamentary democracy that has held generally bulgaria basic facts free and fair elections since the overthrow of the communist regime land area 110550 sq km slightly larger than in 1989 bulgaria held its most tennessee recent parliamentary elections on june 25 2005 the winner of the population 73 million 2007 estimate vote was coalition led by the left ethnic composition 839 bulgarian 94 ofcenter bulgarian socialist party turkish 47 roma 2001 census bsp which received 82 seats in the 240seat national assembly gross domestic product 3907 billion 2007

centerright groups won the remaining seats the union of democratic forces 20 democrats for strong bulgaria 17 and the bulgarian national union coalition 13 in an effort to boost turnout the government introduced lottery in which voters could win televisions cars and other prizes nevertheless turnout was only 55 the lowest since the end of communism crs2 all parties pledged to exclude ataka from the government nevertheless analysts were concerned about the groups electoral success which shows significant public dissatisfaction with bulgarias political class experts note that it has been common phenomenon in central and eastern europe that when former communist party such as the bsp moves to the center often as part of european integration efforts its place in the political spectrum is often taken over by populist and nationalist groups the process of forming new government proved difficult in part because of the scattered distribution of the vote and personal animosity among party leaders including within the centerright portion of the political spectrum the stalemate was finally resolved on august 15 when the parliament approved new coalition government it is composed of the bsp mrf and nmsp with bsp leader sergei stanishev as prime minister critics claim that stanishev is relatively weak leader and that real power rests in the hands of party barons particularly in the bsp and mrf this situation they say has hindered reform implementation and the fight against corruption despite the defection of some nmsp deputies to the opposition in 2007 the government retains majority and appears determined to stay in power until 2009 when httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22247 new elections must be held new party citizens for the european development of bulgaria cedb is not currently represented in parliament but could win large number of seats in new elections the cedb led by sofia mayor boiko borisov espouses pro eu and prolawandorder policies the current coalition could face serious challenge if number of small centerright parties in the current parliament can form an alliance with the cedb president georgi purvanov backed by the bsp won reelection in 2006 although purvanov is one of bulgarias most popular political figures most political power is held by the prime minister and government the bulgarian presidency is relatively weak economic situation bulgaria is one of the poorest countries in europe according to the world bank its per capita income is only 56 of that of the eight central and eastern european countries that joined the eu in 2004 as in many other transition countries sofia and other urban areas are more prosperous than rural ones which have suffered an exodus of young people bulgaria is also battling rapidly shrinking and aging population due partly to low birth rate and partly to the emigration of large numbers of young bulgarians to betterpaying jobs in western europe mistakes and fitful reforms made by previous governments culminating in disastrous policies pursued by previous bsp government in 19951996 were serious setbacks however bulgarias economic situation has improved substantially since 1997 when the countrys currency was pegged to the euro under currency board arrangement which gives the bulgarian central bank little discretion in setting monetary policy from 1998 through 2005 bulgaria has had an average economic growth rate of more than 5 per year gross domestic product gdp grew by just under 6 in the first three quarters of 2007 unemployment has fallen from 181 in 2000 to 78 in 2007 bulgaria ran government budget surplus of 35 of gdp in 2007 the central bank is working to restrain rapidly expanding commercial bank lending in order to crs3 maintain stable growth however inflation remains high average consumer price inflation was 84 in 2007 persistent inflation is likely to delay bulgarias efforts to adopt the euro as its currency for few years at least due to strong import demand bulgaria had large current account deficit of 20 of gdp in 2007 on the other hand bulgaria has seen surge of foreign direct investment fdi in recent years fdi amounted to 84 billion in 2007 or nearly 20 of gdp bulgaria is attractive to investors because it can supply not only cheap labor but qualified experts in such fields as computer science organized crime and corruption are very serious problems in bulgaria powerful organized crime kingpins continue to operate in bulgaria with relative impunity and dozens have died in contract killings and gang shootouts in the past few years organized crime groups are involved in such activities as trafficking in persons drugs and weapons money laundering counterfeiting optical disc piracy and credit card fraud highlevel corruption is also critical issue powerful politicians are perceived as operating their ministries as corrupt fiefdoms with relative impunity one of bulgarias biggest challenges is longdelayed judicial reform the bulgarian system remains weak corrupt and sometimes politicized1 experts believe that bulgaria must also overhaul its httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22247 education and health care systems foreign policy bulgarias foreign policy in recent years has focused on joining nato and the european union bulgaria joined nato in april 2004 in part due to strong us support bulgaria has deployed over 400 troops to afghanistan as part of the natoled international security assistance force isaf they are stationed in kabul and in the southern afghan city of kandahar bulgaria is considering providing training to afghan security forces bulgaria has deployed 42 soldiers to kfor the natoled peacekeeping force in kosovo as well as to sfor the former natoled peacekeeping force in bosnia sfor has been replaced by an euled force in which bulgaria is also participating with 152 soldiers2 bulgaria has supported extending membership invitations to albania croatia and macedonia at the nato summit in bucharest on april 24 2008 bulgarian officials say the move would strengthen peace and stability in the region bulgarian officials say that military modernization has proceeded slowly in part because of the costs of participating in overseas deployments in april 2005 gen nikola kolev chief of general staff of the bulgarian army said that it will take at least 10 years for bulgaria to achieve full integration in the alliance citing in particular the need for new equipment he said that bulgaria was focusing on preparing at least one mechanized brigade for use in the full range of natos missions as well as several smaller specialized units totaling over 5000 men in all some observers have expressed concern that some of the soviettrained officers holding senior positions in the bulgarian military and intelligence services may continue to have links with russian intelligence agencies 1 economist intelligence unit country report bulgaria october 2006 2004 state department country reports on human

denied nato security clearances3 bulgaria joined the eu in january 2007 but under stringent conditions it must provide regular reports to the eu commission on its progress toward specific benchmarks in several areas including the fight against organized crime and corruption and judiciary reform the eu may apply sanctions suspending judicial cooperation for example against bulgaria if the benchmarks are not met in february 2008 the european commission released report on bulgarias progress it recognized progress in judicial reform and fighting corruption on bulgarias borders but noted shortcomings in such areas as corruption in local government healthcare and education the report particularly stressed the need to make stronger efforts in fighting highlevel corruption and organized crime4 sanctions have been taken against bulgaria yet but the eu has suspended funding for some projects in bulgaria due to irregularities in how the money has been spent including corruption concerns russia and bulgaria have traditionally had good relations due to longstanding historical and personal ties however some analysts have expressed concern about httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22247 russias dominance in bulgarias energy sector bulgaria is almost entirely dependent on russia for its oil and natural gas needs russian firms own major oil refineries key commercial natural gas distribution company and many retail gasoline stations in bulgaria as in other countries in central europe some analysts are concerned that russia could use this control and its links with some politicians particularly in the bsp and business leaders to manipulate the country bulgarianrussian energy relations became closer in january 2008 when president putin won bulgarias support for russias south stream natural gas pipeline bulgarias position on the black sea may make it an important transit point for oil and natural gas supplies from russia and the caspian sea region to western europe routes through bulgaria would avoid turkeys crowded bosporus and dardanelles straits south stream which would run though bulgaria and the balkans to western europe may increase europes dependence on russian energy by reducing the prospects for the us and eu sponsored nabucco project nabucco is intended to supply central asian gas to europe without transiting russia russian and bulgarian leaders also signed agreements on proposed oil pipeline from the bulgarian city of burgas to the greek port at alexandropoulos on the aegean sea and on building two russian nuclear reactors in bulgaria5 3 judy

states and bulgaria have excellent bilateral relations in april 2006 the united states signed defense cooperation agreement with sofia on use of military bases in bulgaria even before the agreement the united states was already using bulgarian bases for joint exercises with bulgarian and other troops as well as for us forces in transit to iraq and afghanistan the bulgarian government eagerly sought such bases viewing them as an economic stimulus and as useful in cementing strategic bonds with the united states the bases involved include the bezmer and graf ignatievo air bases and the novo selo training range about 2500 us troops are expected to be deployed to the relatively spartan facilities at the bases at any one time each group staying for only few months 6 in february 2008 the united states signed additional agreements needed to implement the 2006 accord including on customs procedures taxes and other issues bases in bulgaria are likely to be less expensive than bases in western europe and subject to fewer constraints on training and exercises bulgaria is also closer geographically to the middle east than western europe at the same time bulgarias infrastructure is inferior to that of countries such as germany httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22247 bulgaria contributed 450 troops to usled coalition forces in iraq despite the deployments unpopularity among bulgarians according to opinion polls bulgaria suffered casualties in iraq 13 soldiers have died in march 2005 bulgarian soldier was killed in friendlyfire incident involving us troops in may 2005 with the

the elimination of trafficking but is making significant efforts to do so the report said that bulgaria improved its victim assistance infrastructure and continued to demonstrate increased law enforcement efforts however bulgarias national antitrafficking commission could not effectively monitor and improve national and local efforts due to inadequate staffing according to the report in
