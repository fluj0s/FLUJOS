defense and trade division june 12 2008 abstract us and eu policymakers are likely to face the task of how to manage the increasingly complex bilateral economic relationship in ways that maximize beneﬁts and keep frictions to minimum including developing new frameworks for members during the second session of the 110th congress it could mean weighing the beneﬁts of greater economic integration

economic relationship is the largest in the worldand it is growing the modern useuropean economic relationship has evolved since world war ii broadening as the sixmember european community expanded into the present 27 member european union the ties have also become more complex and interdependent covering growing number and type of trade and financial activities in 2007 15628 billion flowed between the united st ates and the eu on the current account the most comprehensive measure of us trade flows the eu as unit is the largest merchandise trading partner of the united states in 2007 the eu accounted for 2473 billion of total us exports or 213 and for 3547 billion of total us imports or 182 for us trade deficit of 1074 billion the eu is also the largest us trade partner when trade in services is added to trade in merchandise accounting for 1676 billion or 367 of the total in us services exports and 1441 billion or 429 of total us services imports in 2007 in addition in 2007 net 1758 billion flowed from us residents to eu countries into direct investments while net 865 billion flowed from eu residents to direct investments in the united states policy disputes arise between the united states and the eu generating tensions which sometimes lead to bilateral trade disputes yet in spite of these disputes the useu economic relationship remains dynamic it is relationship that is likely to grow in importance assuming the trends toward globalization and the enlargement of the eu continue forcing more trade and investment barriers to fall economists indicate that an expanded relationship would bring economic benefits to both sides in the form of wider choices of goods and services and greater investment opportunities but increasing economic interdependence brings challenges as well as benefits as the us and eu economies continue to integrate some sectors or firms will lose out to increased competition and will resist the forces of change greater economic integration also challenges longheld notions of sovereignty as national or regional policies have extraterritorial impact similarly accepted understanding of competition markets and other economic concepts are tested as national borders dissolve with closer integration of economies us and eu policymakers are likely to face the ta sk of how to manage the increasingly complex bilateral economic relationship in ways that maximize benefits and keep frictions to minimum including developing new frameworks for mbers during the second session of the 110th congress it could mean weighing the

the european union eu is the largest such relationship in the worldand it is growing1 it is relationship forged over several centuries since the european colonization of north america the modern useuropean economic relationship has evolved since world war ii it has broadened as the sixmember european community expanded into the present 27member european union the ties have also become more complex covering growing number and type of trade and financial activities that intertwine the economies on both sides of the atlantic into an increasingly interdependent relationship for members of congress and other policymakers the eu remains significant participant in the us economy and major factor in policy considerations for example the eu and its members are influential members of the world trade organization wto the organization for econom ic cooperation and development oecd the international monetary fund imf and the world bank these countries together with the united states play decisive roles in developing and implementing the missions of those institutions despite the tightness of the bilateral relationship policy tensions arise generating tensions within the relationship sometimes leading to bilateral trade disputes 2 the issues that arise are becoming more complex reflecting the growing integration of the us and eu economies yet in spite of these disputes the useu economic relationship remains dynamic and one within which trillions of dollars of economic activity transpire this report provides background information and analysis of the useu economic relationship for members of the 110 th congress as they contemplate the costs and benefits of closer us economic ties with the eu it examines the economic and political framework of the relationship and the scope and magnitude of the ties based on data from various sources in addition the report analyzes the implications these factors have for us economic policy toward the eu the report will be revised as events warrant g23g495g21g495g561g11g151g157g142g155g142g156g157g156g561 the united states has been strong advocate for the construction of close economic ties among the west european countries since the end of world war ii during the cold war the european community served us foreign policy and national security interests as force of stability that drew former enemieswest germany and francecloser together and that helped to build western europe into an economic bulwark against the soviet bloc the formation of an economically unified europe has served us economic interests as well by accelerating european economic growth and development which has opened trade and investment opportunities for the united states many studies have concluded that the formation of the eu has had net positive economic impact on the world as whole because it has led on balance to more trade creation than diversion of trade from other countries 1 the eu consists of austria belgium bulgaria cyprus greek czech re public denmark estonia finland france germany greece hungary ireland italy latvia lithuania luxembourg malta netherlands poland portugal romania slovakia slovenia spain sweden

formation of the european monetary union comprising 12 of the 27 members of the eu and their adoption of common currency the euro these developments have already had an impact on useu trade ties g22g145g142g561g8g155g138g150g142g160g152g155g148g561g152g143g561g23g495g21g495g556g7g23g561g7g140g152g151g152g150g146g140g561g22g146g142g156g561 useu economic relations exist within framework of economic political and security factors some of these factors have promoted closer economic relationships while others have created tensions that have at times threatened to undermine the relationship the useu economic relationship dominates the world economy by the sheer size of their combined economies the combined population of united states and the eu members approaches 800 million people who generate combined gross domestic product gdp that is roughly equivalent to 57 of world gdp in 2007 3 combined eu and us world trade accounts for over half of all world trade in other words the useu economic relationship has clout the united states and the eu member countries are of roughly equivalent levels of economic development and are among the most advanced in the world as group they include the worlds wealthiest and most educated populations the ited states and the members of the eu with few exceptions are major producers of advanced technologies and services as result useu trade tends to be intraindustry trade that is trade in similar products such as cars and computers dominate twoway trade flows furthermore the united states and the eu have advanced and integrated financial sectors which facilitate large volumes of capital flows across the atlantic these capital flows account for significant portion of the bilateral economic activity the dominance of security and defense matters is another factor influencing useu ties twentytwo of the eu27 are members of nato and represent an overwhelming majority of natos 26 members nato members must deal wi th number of issues that pertain to foreign trade such as defenserelated government procurement product standardization controls of exports of dualuse technologies and related products and economic sanctions national security and foreign policy concerns strongly dominated the useuropean relationship during the cold war 4 the 152member wto and its predecessor the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt is critical part of the euus bila teral economic framework the wto provides the principles and rules under which the us and the eu conduct much of their trade the basic principles of mostfavorednationmfn or nondiscriminatory treatment and of national treatment of imports of goods and services and of foreign investments along with wto rules on 3 cia world factbook 2008 httpwwwciaorg 4 but even the dominance of national security concerns did not prevent at least some major disputes to surface between the united states and the eu for example in june 1982 the united states imposed controls on exports to the soviet union of oil and gas equipment technology that was produced by usowned firms in foreign countries the restrictions were in response to soviet support of martial law in poland and to hamper the construction of natural gas pipeline that would deliver soviet gas to western europe the measures led to an open confrontation with the european community which argued that the united states could not apply us controls outside the united states the united states rescinded the controls in november 1982 featherstone kevin and roy h ginsburg the united states and the european community in the 1990s partners in transition st martins press united kingdom 1993 p 179 180

remedy practices antidumping and countervailing duties and safeguards are the foundation of us and european trade and investment policies the wto also provides the mechanism by which the united states and the eu resolve many of their bilateral trade disputes to lesser extent the oecd is an important element in the useu framework largely consisting of fully industrialized countries the 30member oecd coordinates economic policies and reviews economic conditions and polices of its members and those of some nonmembers the oecd also has some rules and guidelines for trade and investment practices of its members for example the oecd arrangement on official export credits curbs the subsidization of exports eu and us policies and practices form another element of the bilateral economic framework the united states and the eu share commitment to open trade and investment the united states and european countries were largely instrumental in establishing the postworld war ii foundation for an open international economic system this commitment has played large role in the strong economic ties between them yet the two sides differ in some significant policy areas for example the eus common agricultural policy conflicting competition policies and the us extraterritorial application of economic sanctions against cuba and other countries these policy differences have been source of significant bitterness and controversy g23g495g21g495g556g7g23g561g22g155g138g141g142g561g146g151g561g9g152g152g141g156g561g138g151g141g561g21g142g155g159g146g140g142g156g561 the eu as unit is the

with the eu however since 1993 the united states has been incurring growing trade deficits with the eu 1074 billion in 2007 economists attribute the growth in the us trade deficit with the eu to among other factors differences in us and economic growth rates and the weakening of the dollar compared to the euro among the top us exports to the eu have been aircraft and machinery of various kinds including computers integrated circuits and office machine parts large share of us imports from the eu has consisted of passenger cars mach inery of various types including gas turbines computers and components office machinery and parts and organic chemicals within the eu germany the united kingdom and france are the leading us trading partners followed by the netherlands and italy the eu is the largest us trade partner when trade in services is added to trade in merchandise in 2007 the eu accounted for 1676 billion or 363 of the total in us services exports of this amount 287 billion derived from receipts for various travel services 73 billion from payments for passenger fares and 173 billion for other transportation fees freight and port services another 271 billion were in receipts for

interdependent and significant useu bilateral economic relationship it is relationship that is likely to grow in importance as advancements in technology and other forces of globalization plus the future enlargement of the eu force more trade and investment barriers to fall the expanded relationship is widely seen as bringing economic benefits to both sides in the form of wider choices of goods and services and greater investment opportunities but increasing economic interdependence brings challenges as well as benefits useu trade ties have been plagued by disputes that at times have reached the highest levels of policymaking while these disputes have covered range of sectors and issues the most contentious and public have been related to trade in agricultural and agriculturalrelated products the united states has taken the eu to task for its ban on hormoneenhanced beef imports and for its policy regarding banana imports yet the agriculture sector accounts for very small portion of not only useu bilateral trade but also for the total world trade of the two entities in 2007 agriculture accounted for 40 of total us exports to the eu and for 55 of total imports from the eu similarly in 2007 agriculture accounted for 83 of total us world exports and for 61 of total eu world exports 14 it is beyond the scope of this report to analyze this contrast between us and eu trade

attention received by these disputes at the official level as well as from the press reflects the domestic political salience of these issues to much further extent than their overall commercial or economic significance greater economic integration also challenges long held notions of sovereignty as national or regional policies have extraterritorial impact for example the us use of foreign policy trade sanctions against such rogue states as cuba and iran affected eu firms and investors and caused sharp useu friction similarly accepte d understandings of competition markets and other economic concepts are tested as national borders dissolve with closer integration of economies us and eu policymakers therefore continually face the task of how to manage the increasingly complex bilateral economic relationship in ways that maximize benefits and keep frictions to minimum for members of congress it means weighing the benefits and costs to constituents of greater economic integration and placing this calculation in the context of overall us national interests g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g156g561g561 crs report rs22547 europe s new trade agenda by raymond j
