is approx imately 13 higher than the fy2007 appropr iated level with the bulk of the proposed change co ming from increases for the department of defense dod the space vehicl development program of th national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the conti nuation of the american competitiveness initiative aci which was first announced for fy20073 the president proposed the aci in respons to growing concerns about americas ability to compete technologically in the globa l marketplace as part of the aci the president called for doubling over 10 years th aggregate funding of the national science foundation nsf the departme nt of energy doe office of science and the core programs of the national ins titute of standards and technology nist the main focus of the increases would be to support basi c research in the physical sciences and engineering the fy2008 request would increase funding for nsf by 512 million for the doe office of science by 601 million nd for nist core programs by 101 million relative to fy2007 ppropriated levels despite the presidents tinued support for the aci to tal federal support for basic and applied research would decrease by 21 under the administr ations request for fy2008 although some agencies would see in creases these would be more than offset by decreases at other agencies while th president proposes decreasing the amount of research funding funds for development would increase by 29 this increase in support for development more than offsets the decrease in support for research thus total rd funding would increase under the

robert keith 6 pl 11092 sec 104 7 see for example peter c ohn dem strategy on omnibus designed to put onus on gop congress daily december 6 2007 8 the white house statement by white house office of management nd budget director jim nussle press release december 8 2007 9 past continuing resolutions have sometimes pr ovided increases to cover some inflation costs for example the fullyear continuing reso lution for fy2007 provided increases over fy2006 levels to cover statutory pay increases for civil servants pl 1105 sec 111since the beginning of fy2008 on oct ober 1 2007 funding has been provided through three continuing resolutions the first pl 110 92 provided funding through november 16 2007 the second division b of pl 110116 extended the duration of pl 11092 through december 14 2007 the th ird hjres 69 extended the duration of pl 11092 through december 21 2007 and pr ovides current funding for the agencies covered under the eleven regular ppropriations bills still outstanding for all agencies that have not had an ppropriations bill for fy2008 signed into law the continuing resolution provides funding at the same level they received in fy2007 funds are provided on prorated basis for the duration of the continuing resolution the continuing resolution also generally prohibits agencies from using these funds to initiate or resume any project or activity for which appropriations funds or other authority were not available during fiscal year 20076 according to press reports congress is considering using an omnibus bill to address appropriations for fy20087 such an approach would bypass the remaining eleven appropriations bills according to the direct or of the office of management and budget the president might veto such an omnibus bill depending on the contents of the bill8 if so agency funding might need to be pr ovided by further continuing resolutions the current status of fy2008 funding for rd is summarized in table 1 issues for congress if the federal government continues to operate under continuing resolution most existing rd programs would continue to r eceive funding at the fy2007 level to some extent this funding mechanism is likely to cau federal agencies to continue to support existing rd priorities rather than shifting to new ones since only existing programs retain funding in addition because of infl ation even funds provided at the fy2007 level may represent reduction in actual purchasing power9 for rd programs in some agencies fy2007 funding was determined by previous continuing resolutions based on the fy2006 level for these programs the ss of purchasing power and the difficulty of adjusting policy goals and priorities may be more challenging in the case of new rd programs planne d for fy2008 most would not be allowed to start even after appropriations for fy2008 become law allowing new programs tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22774crs4 begin agencies may have difficulty meeting their projected rd milestones and goals also agency plans for purchase of major in struments and equipmen t may be delayed or prevented under the continuing resolutions for example agency plans for new rd programs in the first quarter of fy2008 are likely to be achieved as the first quarter is already almost complete another issue for new programs is whether agencies will be able to obligate whatever new appropriations they receive most agency appropriations for rd expire at the end of the fiscal year for which they are appropriated because most new programs cannot be started under continuing resolution even if appropriations for them are eventually receive d agencies will have less time than the full fiscal year to establish them and obligate the funds for these programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22774crs5 table 1 estimated
