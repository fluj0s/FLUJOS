organizational units of the department of ho meland security4 section 9701b3d provides that the human resources management system may not waive modify or otherwise affect specified provisions of title 5 us code5 chapter 71 of title 5 which governs federal labormanagement relations is not among those provisions that may not be wa ived modified or otherwise affected this chapter identifies who may engage in collective bargaining and defines appropriate subjects of bargaining for example 5 usc 71022 provides that each employee shall have the right to engage in collective bargaining with respect to conditions of employment through repres entatives chosen by employees under the chapter the term employee is defined in chapter 71 to not include supervisor or management official6 the phrase conditions of em ployment is defined to not include policies practices and matters to the extent such matters are specifically provided for by federal statute7 pay rates established by chapter 53 of title 5 are generally not negotiable section 9701b4 provides that new human resources management system shall ensure that employees may organize bargain collectively and participate through labor organizations of their own choosing in decisions which affect them subject to any exclusion from coverage or limitation on negotiability established by law8 to the extent that the new system permits waiver of chapter 71 it would seem that restrictions on who may engage in collective bargaining and limitations on what may be negotiated contained in or flowing from chapter 71 could be made inapplicable to the employees of the ne w department under section 9701b4 it appears that employees could organize bargain collectively and participate in all decisions which affect them section 9701e

10 days after the president has submitted to congress written explanation of the reasons for such determinationhomeland security and director of the office of personnel management must provide written description of the proposed system or adjustment to each employee representative must give each representative at least 30 days to review and make recommendations and must give any reco mmendations full and fair consideration in deciding whether and how to proceed with the proposal9 although the secretary and the director are not obligated to accept the recommendations they would be required to meet and confer with any re presentatives who made recommendations for not less than 30 calendar days in an attempt to reach agreement on whether or how to proceed with the parts of the proposal for which recommendations have not been accepted10 moreover the secretary and direct or would be required to develop method for each employee representative to pa rticipate in any further planning and development11 the precise timing for the creation of new human resources management system is not clear administration officials have offered timetable for establishing the system once homel and security proposal is enacted12 officials have indicated that federal unions and thei r collective bargaining agreements would move intact to the new department13 however after year or so it is expected that the secretary and the opm director would begin to consider the question of union rights and representation14 hr 5710 would refine the presidents ability to exclude transferred agency or subdivision of an agency from coverage under chapter 71 of title 5 under section 842a1 an agency or subdivision coul d not be excluded unless its mission and responsibilities have ma terially changed

collectively if the agen cy or subdivision has primary function of intelligence counterintelligence investiga tive or national security work and application of the labormanagement rela tions provisions of the csra cannot be applied in manner consistent with national security requirements and considerations similar exclusionary language appeared in two executive orders that preceded the passage of the csra and in th civil service reform bills passed by the house and senate prior to the enactment of the csra in 1962 executive order 10988 established the first federal labormanagement relations policy17 executive order 10988 provided mo st employees of the federal government with the ability to form join and assist any employee organization or to refrain from any such activity18 the order sought to allow unions to organize in cooperative fashion rather than creat an adversarial relationship between the unions and management in the federal sector19 executive order 10988 included an exclusion for certain agencies this order shall not apply to th federal bureau of investigation the central intelligence agency or any other agency or to any office bureau or entity within

maintained the basic principles embodied in executive order 10988 but also established the federal labor re lations council central authority that made final deci sions on policy questions and created new procedures for resolving negotiation impasses like executive order 10988 executive order 11491 excluded certain agencies from its application22 in 1978 the federal labormanagement relations policy veloped by the executive orders was codified by the csra prior to the enactment of the csra the house and senate passed bills that included exclusionary language that resembled the language in the executive orders hr 11280 the housepassed version of the csra included exclusionary language that is identical to the language that currently exists23 the language was offered as part of substitute to the bill that was reported by the house committee on post office and civil service the reported bill would have allowed the federal bor relations authority flra to exclude any agency or any unit of an agency from the application of the labormanagement relations provisions of the bill if the agency or unit had primary function of intelligence counterintelligence investiga tive or security work24 the reason for authorizing the president rather than the flra to exclude agencies from these provisions is not certain neither the sectional analysis that accompanies the substitute language nor the debate surrounding the adoption of the substitute provide any insight into the change25 s 2640 the senatepassed version of the csra included exclusionary language that resembled the language in executive order 1149126 in the senate report that accompanied s 2640 the senate committee on governmental affairs referred specifically to executive orde r 11491 the language specifies

chambers came to adopt the exclusionary language as it appeared in the housepassed version of the csra while the house and senate filed separate conference re ports for the csra neither report explains how the chambers resolved the differences in the exclusionary language28 if enacted hr 5710 would seem to refine the presidents ability to exclude agencies under 5 usc 7103b1 with respect to an agency or subdivision transferred to the new department the president would have to determine that the mission and responsibilities of the agency or subdivision have materially changed and that majority of the employees of the agency or subdivision has primary job duty of intelligence counterin telligence or inve stigative work directly related to terrorism investigation under existing law the finding of such majority is not necessary however the waiver language included in section 842c of hr 5710 does allow the president to avoid making the determinations otherwise required of him thus the presidents ability to remove collective bargaining rights for agencies and subdivisions of agencies would seem to be only mildly affected by section 842b1 successorship the socalled successorship doctrine defines the rights of employees and the obligations of employ ers with respect to union representation when an entity changes ownership when reorganization occurs in the federal government the flra determines succe ssorship resolving issues concerning whether new employing entity has duty to recognize and bargain with union that represents transferred employees in naval facilities engineering service center port hueneme california the flra established threefactor test to determine whether gaining entity is successor employer29 in port hueneme the flra considered the question of successorship after the naval civil engineering laboratory ncel was disestablished and the naval facilities engineering service center was established nfesc the first factor of the flras test identifies three requirements first at least portion of recognized bargaining unit must be transferred to the new entity second the posttransfer unit must be an appropriate bargaini ng unit under 5 usc 7112a1 and third the transferred empl oyees must constitute majority of the new unit the flra noted that the post transfer unit may be found appropriate even if it has expanded to include employ ees other than those transferred30 however because union is entitled to act as unit s exclusive representative only if it hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31520crs7 31 port hueneme 50 flra at 373 32 port hueneme 50 flra at 375been selected by majority of employees the new unit must consist of majority of transferred employees who would ve previously selected the union the second factor of the flras test requires that the gaining entity have substantially the same organizational mission as the losing entity with the transferred employees performing substantially the same duties and functions under substantially similar working conditions in the gaining entity the flra will not require that the missions of the gaining and losing entities be identical rather the flra will consider the totality of the circumstances to determine whether this part of the test is satisfied31 in finding the nfesc to be the successor to the ncel the flra concluded that the reorgani zation had little effect on the working conditions of the former ncel employees32 the former ncel employees still performed the same type of work as they had prior to the inte gration of functions that occurred after the establishment of the nfesc the third factor of the flras test considers whether an election is necessary to determine representation if an electi on is not necessary the flra will find the third factor met in port hueneme the flra concluded that an election was not necessary to determine representation following the establishment of the nfesc although hr 5710 does not provide exp licitly for the continued recognition of existing labor organizations the admin istrations statements concerning the recognition of federal unions and their existing collective bargaining agreements suggest that successorship may not be sign ificant issue however if hr 5710 was enacted and the new departme nt refused to recognize existing labor organizations the flras threefactor test would likely be administered to determine whether the department is successor employer fo r purposes of collective bargaining
