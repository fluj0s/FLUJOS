congress addressing passenger vehicle fuel economy in general and the cafe program speciﬁcally the bills are compared on various policy options including but not limited to the types of provisions identiﬁed above the report also compares provisions in bills that would establish greenhouse gas emissions standards for passenger cars out side of the cafe structure such emissions standards would likely also have the eﬀect of increasing fuel economyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33982 order code rl33982 corporate average fuel economy cafe comparison of selected legislation in the 110th congress

divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33982corporate average fuel economy cafe comparison of selected legislation in the 110th congress summary the rise in crude oil and gasoline pri ces since the winter of 2006 has renewed the focus on us fuel consumption in the transportation sector wider concerns over greenhouse gas emissions and clima change have contributed to interest in reducing fossil fuel consumption and improving the efficiency of the us transportation sector possible changes to the federa l corporate average fuel economy cafe standards are one policy op tion to address the issue cafe standards are fleetwide fuel ec onomy averages that manufacturers must meet each model year currently separate cafe standards are established for passenger cars and light trucks which include sport utility vehicles suvs vans and pickup trucks veral bills have been introduced in the 110th congress to modify the cafe program senate energy legislation hr 6 passed that body on june 21 2007 the bill includes language on cafe on august 3 2007 the house passed energy legislation hr 3221 241170 and hr 2776 221189 but these bills did not include cafe provi sions two house bills addressing cafe hr 1506 hr 2729 were circulated as possible amendments but neither were debated on the house floor this report provides sidebyside comparison of these and other bills in the 110th congress addressing passe nger vehicle fuel economy in general and the cafe program specifically the bills are compared on various policy options including but not limited to the types of provisions identified bove the report also compares provisions in bills that would establis h greenhouse gas emissions standards for passenger cars outside of the cafe structur such emissions standards would likely also have the effect of increasing fuel economy one issue in the cafe debate over the years has been whether congress should set cafe standards or delegate that aut hority exclusively to nhtsa for passenger cars the original epca legislation established specific targets for model year my 1978 and my1985 and required that the secret ary of transporta tion set standards for the interim years some of the curre nt proposals would also set specific targets in the future others would require annua l improvements in cafe by some specified percentage in some instances both appr oaches are used those proposals would establish mandated cafe by certain date and require subsequent annual percentage increases some bills would also require nhtsa to set the maximum feasible interim standards another key question is the form cafe standards should take one bill would require that the cafe standard be expr essed in grams per mile of carbon dioxide emissions co2 in addition to miles per gallon states are preempted from establishing their own cafe standards but are permitted to set clean air requirements this has generated controve rsy and some belie ve requirement to report fuel economy as function of co2 emissions is intended to have some bearing on the differing treatment of the states between cafe and emissions standardshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33982contents background establishment of the cafe

also grante d nhtsa the authority to establish cafe standards for other classes of vehi cles including lightduty trucks2 nhtsa established fuel economy standards for light trucks beginning in my1979 for passenger cars the current standard is 275 miles per gallon mpg for my2007 for light trucks the standard is 222 mpg for my2007 under epca the secretary of transporta tion has the discretion to adjust the passenger car standard within range from 260 to 2 75 mpg any increase above 275 mpg or below 260 mpg requires the secr etary to issue an amendment to the standards that amendment would be in force unless either chamber of congress disapproves however this onehouse veto could be judged to be unconstitutional3 the secretary has much broader discretion with respect to setting light truck fueleconomy standards referred to in the regu lations as nonpasse nger automobiles this includes the authority to establish different standards for different classifications of these vehicles recent cafe regulations in april 2006 nhtsa promulgated new ca fe rules for light trucks after my2007 light truck manufactur ers may voluntarily comply with new reformed standard based on the size of each specific manufacturers vehicles starting in my2011 all light truck makers will be subject to th reformed standards which nhtsa estimates will be equi valent to about 240 mpg under the old system epca gives nhtsa the authority to modify the light truck standards as it sees fit including setting standards based on vehicle attributes in this case size epca does not grant similar flexibility in application of the passenger car standard policy options policy options within cafe several bills would amend the current cafe program to increase cafe standards change testing procedures andor grant

feasible fuel economy attributebase d standards credit trading carbon dioxide emissions and other key provisions none of these policy options is mutually exclusive and any or all options could be adopted together each of these options is discussed below combined passenger carlight truck standards one criticism of the current cafe program is its separate trea tment of light trucks and passenger cars when epca was first enacted most light truc ks were used solely as work vehicles and they constituted relatively small percentage of the lightduty vehicle fleet since that time light trucks which include sport utility vehicles suvs and vans are used more and more as passenger ve hicles currently light trucks make up roughly half of the new lightduty vehicle market as consequence some argue that the distinction between the two fleet s should be eliminated critics also allege that specifications for some carlike vehicle models may have been designed purposefully to qualify those vehicles for the lower mpg standard that applies to the light truck fleet definition of automobile and light truck passenger car and light truck standards could be comb ined by simply expanding the definition of passenger automobile to include light trucks up to 8500 pounds some proponents of tighter standards argue that light trucks shoul d be treated as passenger vehicles further some light trucks are too h eavy to be included under the current cafe standard therefore some proposals w ould expand the definition of automobile or light truck to incl ude all vehicles up to 10000 pounds gross weight current standards cover vehicles up to 8500 pounds gross weight other proposals would expand cafe standards to some heavier ve hicles eg suvs and passenger vans but would exclude work trucks g pickups and cargo vans mandated numeric increase in cafe standards some analysts argue that price volatility in oil markets sends inconsistent signals to prospective new car purchasers and that the only way to avoi d these mixed signals would be to mandate higher cafe standards some legi slative proposals would require nhtsa to establish new cafe standards set at fi xed mpg target in given year various proposals would mandate incr eased standards for passenger cars light trucks or both mandated percentage increase in cafe standards while some bills would mandate an increase in the cafe sta ndards to specified levels others would require nhtsa to set rules to increase fuel economy by set percentage every year in most cases the bills mandate an annua l cafe increase of 4 from the previous year the bills vary on whether the increase would cover passenger cars light trucks or bothhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33982crs4 4 49 usc 32902fregulatory flexibilityauthority as was mentioned above nhtsa currently has limited authority to modify the specific mpg target or the general design of passenger car cafe sta ndards some legislative proposals would significantly broaden nhtsas authority to amend the program including allowing nhtsa to set higher passenger car standards than epca currently allows currently any increase above 275 mpg or below 260 mp g requires the secretary to issue an amendment to the standards that amendment is to be in force unless either chamber of congress disapproves other proposals would allow nhtsa to extend the current singleyear compliance period to multiyear periods ch proposal for example might allow nhtsa to require manufacturers to meet set cafe average for my2011 through my2013 instead of requiring that the cafe average be achieved in each model year expanded considerations for maximum feasible fuel economy current law requires nhtsa to consider various factors in determining maximum feasible average fuel economy nhtsa must consider technological feasibility economic practicability the effect of other motor vehicle standards of the government on fuel economy and the need of the united states to conserve energy4 some of the bills would add further d imension costeffectiveness and stipulate weighing of several factor s in assessing the costeffectiveness of any proposed changes in the standards among these factors are value to consumers economic security national security foreign policy and the impact of oil use on various other national policy concerns attributebased standards as noted above nhtsa has established size based cafe standards for light trucks but does not have similar authority for passenger cars some propos als would allow nhtsa to tablish multiple levels of passenger car cafe standards for given m odel year the levels could be based on variety of vehicle attribut including size andor we ight the senatepassed hr 6 would require attributebased standa rds hr 6 would also require that after enactment the secretary of transportation would initiate study toward developing fuel economy program to raise the vehicl fuel efficiency of medium and heavy duty trucks credit trading for each model year automakers must meet separate cafe targets for three new vehicle fleets domestically produced passenger cars imported passenger cars and light trucks in any year that manufacturer exceeds the cafe standard for one of these given fleets th at manufacturer may bank credits for use in meeting future year requirements c onversely in any year that the manufacturer comes up short it may borrow credits from an anticipated surplus in future years under the current cafe program banked or borrowed credits may be used only for the fleet in which they originated for example if an automaker generates credits for its fleet of imported passenger cars those credits may not be applied to its fleets of domestic cars or light trucks similarly automakers may not trade credits with other automakers however some of the legi slative proposals would allow manufacturer to move credits between fleets andor trade credits with another manufacturerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33982crs5 5 gasoline is only one part of oil consumption albeit the largest and thus 20 reduction in gasoline consumption translates to sma ller reduction in overall petroleum consumption 6 as of february 22 2007 member has spons ored and introduced the administrations proposal 7 for more information on climate change bills see crs report rl33846 climate change greenhouse gas reduction bills in the 110th congress by larry parker and brent d yacobuccicarbon dioxide standards one bill hr 2927 would require that new cafe standards be expressed in grams per mile of carbon dioxide co2 in addition to miles per gallon under epca states are preempted from establishing their own cafe standards but the clean air act permits states to set their own clean air requirements this has ge nerated controversy and so believe requirement to report fuel economy as function of co2 emissions is intended to have some bearing on the differing treatment of the states between cafe and emissions standards some of these matters are currently being litigated bush administration proposal in his 2007 state of the union address president bush outlined goal of reducing gasoline5 consumption by 20 from projected levels in 2017 of that 20 reduction the president proposed that 15 co from the increased use of renewable and alternative fuels and that 5 come from increased vehicle fuel efficiency it has been estimated that an annual 4 increase in cafe standards would lead to 5 reduction in projected gasoline consumpti on in 2017 the bush administration has not proposed legislation that would ma ndate an increase in cafe standards on february 6 2007 nhtsa submitted draf t legislation to the house energy and commerce committee on the bush administrations cafe proposal6 the administrations proposal would not require an increase in fuel economy standards but would grant nhtsa broader regulato ry authority the draft would allow nhtsa to establish attribut ebased standards for passeng er cars and would allow for cafe credit trading noncafe policy options in addition to bills modifying the cafe program several other bills have been introduced that would likely increase vehi cle fuel economy thr ough other measures for example several bills requiring reductions in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions have been introdu ced of those bills two would require permile emissions reductions from passenger vehicles while such emissions standards would not techni cally constitute change in fuel economy standards automakers and others contend that there is way other than fuel economy increases to reduce
