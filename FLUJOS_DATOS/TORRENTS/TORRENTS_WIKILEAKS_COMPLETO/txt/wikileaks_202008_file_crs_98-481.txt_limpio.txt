reform act of 1986 for technical service workers s 1924 marie b morris legislative attorney american law division summary in threeparty employment situations involving technical service workers companies that use the workers and firms that supply or broker the services of workers the common law rules and only the common law rules apply to determine whether or not the workers are employees of the placement firms section 530 of the revenue act of 19781 permits many firms to use more liberal set of rules to determine the employment status of their workers among other things section 530 prevents the internal revenue service from challenging an employers misclassification of worker as an independent contractor if the employer has reasonable basis for treating the worker as an independent contractor and certain other requirements are met including consistent treatment of the worker and similarly situated workers section 1706 of the tax reform act of 1986 bars certain firms from claiming the protection of section 530 section 1706 took away the statutory safe harbor for firms that place technical service workers engineers designers drafters computer programmers systems analysts and similarly skilled workers with the companies that use the workers services s 1924 105th congress would repeal section 1706 of the tax reform act of 1986 which is section 530d of the

classification independent contractor provisions in the taxpayer relief act of 1997 pl 10534 background although workers and the firms for which they work can have any number of arrangements for providing services and being paid for the services for tax purposes workers are either employees or independent contractors and the firms are either employers or not each status carries specific tax and legal obligations on the part of the workers and the firms there are advantages and disadvantages to each classification for workers for firms there is fairly strong incentive to classify workers as independent contractors prior to 1982 the combined total of employer and employee taxes for social security and medicare was more than the selfemployment taxes imposed on independent contractors of course firm could avoid paying any employment taxes if the workers were independent contractors the firm only incurred employment tax obligations for employees after 1982 the combined social security and medicare tax burden approximated the selfemployment tax burden but the advantage to firm of classifying workers as independent contractors remained the irs had fairly strong revenue incentives to assure that workers who were misclassified as independent contractors were reclassified as employees big problem for the firms was the statute of limitations provisions if taxpayer has filed return the statute of limitations is normally three years if the taxpayer failed to file return the statute of limitations never starts to run if an employer treated workers as independent contractors the employer would not have filed employment tax returns consequently the irs could potentially assess the employer for taxes back to the effective date of the social security and medicare that could be heavy burden for what may have been goodfaith mistake in the 1970s and 1980s when the irs stepped up enforcement efforts in the employment tax areas taxpayers sought legislative relief in 1978 congress provided statutory relief by enacting section 530 of the revenue act of 1978 pl 95600 section 530 did three things 1 it terminated any retroactive employment tax liability for employers who had treated workers as independent contractors before january 1 1980 unless there was reasonable basis for not treating the worker as an employee 2 it spelled out reasonable bases for classifying worker as an independent contractor requiring consistent treatment of the worker and similarly situated workers as independent contractors and reliance on judicial or administrative precedent past irs audit or long standing industry practice 3 it prohibited the irs from issuing regulations or revenue rulings addressing the status of workers as employees or independent contractors for employment tax purposes originally section 530 was intended to be temporary legislation to retain the status quo while congress took time to figure out what the correct solution should be in the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of 1982 pl 97248 section 530 of the 1978 act was extended indefinitely again to give congress time to decide whether different statutory design would be desirable in addition congress designated qualified crs3 real estate agents and direct sellers as statutory independent contractors since large number of pending employment status controversies involved those occupations the 1982 act provided real estate agents and direct sellers with an immediate solution to their classification problems it also took the pressure off congress to develop new statutory worker classification system in section 1706 of the tax reform act of 1986 pl 99514 which originated as senate floor amendment subsection d was added to section 530 of the revenue act of 1978 the provision barred technical service placement firms from claiming the protections of the section 530 safe harbors this meant that placement firms could rely only on the common law as defense for their classification of the workers and it meant that the irs was not prohibited from issuing regulations or rulings relating to the employment status of technical service workers in threeparty situations empowered by section 1706 the irs promptly issued revenue ruling 8741 19871 cb 296 the ruling spelled out the types of arrangements where the irs would treat placement firm as the employer of technical service employees basically if the placement firm retained the right to control the worker either by supervising performance or hours worked or guaranteeing the quality of the work of the worker to the client then the relationship was an employeremployee relationship if the placement firm simply acted as broker with guarantees about performance of the worker and supervision of the workers hours or relationship to the client then the worker was an independent contractor and the firm was not the workers employer although there was dissatisfaction with the revenue ruling on the part of workers and firms who could not arrange for their desired employment classification the ruling had the advantage of providing clear standards for technical service workers in threeparty situations since section 1706 was enacted congress has held number of hearings2 on employment classification none of the hearings focused specifically on section 1706 but at each of them there has been testimony both for and against the repeal of 1706 those in favor of the repeal argued that section 1706 makes the technical services industry the only industry that cannot benefit from section 530 they pointed out that section 1706 was enacted without hearings they noted that the march 1991 treasury study entitled taxation of technical services personnel section 1706 of the tax reform act of 1986 found that technical service workers are at least as compliant with tax requirements as those in other industries they argued that there is justification for singling out the technical services placement industry for special treatment they noted that company that contracts directly with technical service worker gets the benefit of section 530 if it can qualify but that placement

the repeal argue that section 1706 does not cause true independent contractors to be classified as employees they claimed that repeal would set dangerous precedent by encouraging those who concede they cannot meet the common law test for independent contractor status to claim they are independent contractors anyway they argued that the law is relatively clear and the industry is able to distinguish employees from independent contractors they quoted the march 1991 treasury report to the effect that section 1706 presents relatively few administrative problems especially in comparison with section 530 they believed that the years since the passage of section 1706 have been profitable for the information technology and technical services industries in part because of the relative stability of the work force they complained that before the enactment of section 1706 taxpayers that consistently misclassified their workers were entitled to relief under section 530 while taxpayers who diligently followed the law would not be entitled to relief because of the consistency requirements they felt that the repeal of 1706 would place them at competitive disadvantagethey asked for consistency in tax policy to avoid financial disruptions s 1924 s 1924 would repeal section 1706 of the tax reform act of 1986 which is section 530d of the revenue act of 1978 entitled the technical workers fairness act of 1998 s 1924 105th congress was introduced on april 2 1998 the bill would be effective after the date of enactment the bill would prospectively restore the benefits of section 530 to placement firms that serve the technical services industries it is not clear that the bill would actually benefit existing placement firms since they would still be bound by the duty of consistency contained in section 530 if existing firms have been treating workers as employees since 1987 it is unlikely that section 530 would permit them to treat those workers as independent contractors even if s 1924 is enacted if existing firms have been treating workers as independent contractors then enactment of s 1924 would probably make such choice less likely to be challenged by the irs there appear to be two possible benefits from enactment of the bill first there may be an intangible benefit to the workers there is anecdotal evidence that workers who believe that they are independent contractors cannot convince the placement firms or the companies that ultimately receive their services to treat them as independent contractors the workers believe that the repeal of section 1706 will make the placement firms and the companies more receptive to treating them as independent contractors whether that will be the result cannot be determined if the placement firms and companies have strong preference for the status quo enactment of s 1924 may not change anything if the technical services community regards s 1924 as green light to classify technical service workers as independent contractors then s 1924 may provide the workers with the ability to determine whether they want to be employees or independent contractors second enactment of s 1924 may decrease the perception of unfairness to the technical services industry even though section 1706 applies only to technical services placement firms there seems to be belief that the whole technical services industry is being unfairly targeted for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98481
