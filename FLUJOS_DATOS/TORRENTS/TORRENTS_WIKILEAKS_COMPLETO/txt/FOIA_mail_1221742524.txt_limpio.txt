pjonesueaacukkbriffaueaacuk dear all jacquie had sounded very positive about this back in august but it sounds like cserge are as stretched as much as people in cru im afraid its looking like were not going to be able to get anything together on this unless rob is able to take lead but i think that we would still be lacking the interdisciplinary research team that axa are stressing clare ps rob sorry not to have been in touch with you sooner about this but i didnt know until tuesday that you were interestedhad been approached subject re axa research fund launch of new call for projects date

alexander jan dr env agnew maureen dr env harpham colin dr env busby simon mr env subject re axa research fund launch of new call for projects dear jacquie im afraid that ive not had time to do anything about this call since returning from holiday the deadline is rapidly approaching 3 october and after this week im away at meetings until after the deadline i also have two arcc proposals and dcms tender to get sorted out this week so i am not going to be able to take any kind of lead on this even if we think its worth trying to get last minute proposal together noone else from cru has time to take leading role but colin and maureen are interested colin has been working on the cru weather generator which will be an integral part of the ukcip08 user interface and maureen has broader impacts perspective and is lead author on the climate chapter in the forthcoming cii report simon busby might also be interested and has good experience of working with climate model outputs although for rather different purpose one task for cru would be to extend some of the validation work of the ensembles rcm runs i should also be able to read and comment on material and provide some short draft sections of text eg on ensembles prudence mice and stardex i will have at least sporadic email access while away i hope but i think this is only going to be viable if somebody from cserge or the decisionmaking group is able to coordinate things and we dont have the capacity for hydrological modelling in cru so again this would need input from others though there is also the requirement in the call to assess the quality of flood modelling tools currently licensed by insurers about which i know nothing if it would be helpful to have quick meeting this week iet know best wishes clare at 1630 12082008 you wrote dear clare many thanks for this i think it would be an excellent opportunity for cru other parts of the school response i know jan alexander has already got european bid through to second stage on floods we could certainly put something together with the environmental decisionmaking components too lets discuss when you get back from holiday best wishes jacquie

prof env osborn timothy dr env agnew maureen dr env harpham colin dr env subject fwd axa research fund launch of new call for projects dear jacquie cru is interested in putting in proposal under this call as you can see as well as the climate science aspects there is also need to work on economic issues so this could be good opportunity for putting in joint proposal with people in cserge or other parts of env there are also additional collaborators on the climate and flooding aspects that we could involve both in the uk and germany im away from tomorrow for couple of weeks but the cru people copied in on this email are also all interested in potential proposal though currently were not sure which if any of us has time to lead on this at least immediately best wishes clare subject axa
