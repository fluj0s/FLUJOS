g343g561g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 to better confront the military demands of postcold war world as well as to reduce costs of maintaining excess military infrastructure congress authorizes the department of defense dod to realign or close military bases1 following an examination of its military forces and installations the department compiles list of recommended base realignment and closing brac actions this proposed list of base closures and realignments is presented to an independent brac commission which reviews the proposed actions and sends the list to the president with any recommended changes after the president reviews and approves the list it is sent to congress the recommended list is automatically enacted unless congress passes joint resolution disapproving the list as whole and sustains it over potential presidential veto following the actual base closings and realignments the dod carries out an environmental remediation plan to enable the conveyance of surplus federal land to other entities 2 four separate brac rounds were initiated in 1988 1991 1993 and 19953 in total 97 bases were closed or realigned under these rounds by 2001 the dod had implemented the recommendations from the previous rounds althoug h significant environmental remediation and asset transfers remain unfinished in many of the affected communities congress authorized fifth round of military base realignments and closures for 2005 through the national defense authorization act of 2002 pl 107107 pr imary objective of the 2005 brac round was joint activityintegration and realignment of crossservice functions in such areas as industrial supply and storage facilities technical training headquarters and support activities the list of recommended actions to achieve these objectives was presented to the brac commission on may 13 2005 the report became law on november 10 2005

undertaking assumptions and supporting statistical reasoning may lead to predictions that are in hindsight at least inaccurate for example multiplier effectswhich measure the rate at which direct effect eg base job losses creates indirect effectsare central elements in estimating the impact of base closing or realignment if for example one assumes that base job has large indirect employment multiplier eg 2530 then for each di rect job lost employment indirectly related to the base job within some defined geographic area is also predicted to be lost as result similarly an income multiplier allows one to estimate the total income generated by military base and the resulting income loss or gain within region assumptions about the extent to which base incomes are spent within community can lead to very different assessments of the impacts from the loss of that income 1 10 usc section 2687 authorizes the base realignment and closing brac process for military installations at which at least 300 civilian personnel are authorized to be employed or the realignment of any military installation where at least 300 civilian personnel are authorized to be employed and where it is intended to reduce the work force by more than 1000 or by more than 50 of the number of civilian personnel authorized to be employed at the installation 2 for detailed examination of the brac process see crs report rs22061 military base closures the 2005 brac commission by daniel h else and david lockwood 3 military bases were also closed between 1960 and 1987 but not under the brac process as authorized by congress httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22147g15g146g149g146g157g138g155g162g561g4g138g156g142g561g5g149g152g156g158g155g142g156g497g561g21g152g140g146g152

g344g561a shift to smaller employment multiplier will show much reduced total employment loss from closure using data from military base closings between 1971 and 1994 one 2001 study estimated multipliers of less than one and concluded that employment impacts were mostly limited to the direct job loss associated with military transfers out of the region on average the study found that per capita income was little affected by the closures4 base closings in communities that have been declining economically for some time however may produce impacts different from and possibly more severe than those of base closings in communities where growth and economic diversification are more in evidence the relative strength or weakness of the national or regional economy also can strongly influence the magnitude of community effects from base closure or realignment and the length of time for economic recovery evidence from earlier base closures suggests that the impacts can be less than expected because unlike many other major employers military bases may be relatively isolated economic entities purchasing base needs outside the community and spending income on the base rather than in the local community 5 local communities are also concerned about the fiscal impacts borne by local governments especially rural governments revenue from property taxes sales tax licenses and permits and state and federal aid are influenced by population gains and losses with population loss and related changes in local income base closures can affect the ability of local governments to raise revenue and support existing services similarly with significant population increases community may find greater demand for public services eg transportation schools public safety water and sewerage without the necessary revenue to support the added the added demand even where added revenue can contribute to mitigating the impact of base expansion the planning and adjustment costs impose other burdens on communities and residents local government expenditures and services can also be affected by closure and realignment depending on the extent to which the military base is integrated into the communitys fiscal planning here as well statistical assumptions can lead to significant differences in estimated impact for example an economic development analyst estimated that the closure of hanscom air force base would mean the loss of about 200 million in defense contracts to massachusettss firms another analysis estimated the same losses at 3 billion 6 general review of impacts on local government revenue and expenditures however generally confirmed that these impacts were like those impacts affecting the economy not as severe as had been originally anticipated7 the

g345g561realigning military installation military bases in many rural areas for example provide an economic anchor to local communities even where the local and regional economy is more diversified military bases provide strong social and cultural identification that can be shaken by the announcement that base is closing or bein g downsized not only can there be an immediate impact from the loss of military and civilian jobs but local tax revenues can decline leaving counties and communities less able to provide public services school districts with high proportion of children from military families can experience significant declines in enrollment with these effects can come related reductions in state andor federal funding with the importance given to joint service activity in the 2005 brac round some bases are seeing their functions moved to other bases other bases however are expanding and creating impacts on schools housing traffic and local government services eg fort belvoir virginia dods office of economic adjustment has identified 20 cations where expected growth as result of force realignments in fy2006fy2012 will adversely affect surrounding communities 8 communities have until 2011 to adjust to the changes and plan for transfer of the base to the community for redevelopment while it is predictable that communities will react to news of bases closing with concern and anxiety evid ence from past brac rounds shows that local economies are in many cases more resilient after an economic shock than they expected some worstcase scenarios predicted for communities did not occur perhaps because they were based in part on assumptions about economic multipliers the perceived versus actual role of base in the local economy and overgeneralization from individual cases where there was significant economic dislocation many communities that developed comprehensive and realistic plan for economic redevelopment were able to replace many of the lost jobs and restore lost income the dod programs for assisti ng communities with base redevelopment eg the office of economic adjustment are also likely to have played role in mitigating some of the effects of base closure some communities came to regard the closing as an opportunity for revitalizing and diversifying their economies other communities found they were in stronger economic shape after several years than they thought possible on first learning their bases were closing coping with the closure in the short term and revitalizing communities over the long haul can nonetheless be daunting tasks not all communities recover and for those that do the recovery can be uneven 9 the government accountability office gao foun d that many communities in 2005 were still recovering from prior closures rural areas in particular can find the loss of base and the revitalization of their communities especially difficult challenges10 the effects on individuals may also vary for example persons who lose jobs in closure may not have the kinds of skills that are needed by the economic activity generated by the redevelopment individuals may relocate to other regions where the jobs they find may not match the wages of 8 see governmental accountability office gao defense infrastructure dod funding for infrastructure and road improvement surrounding growth installations gao08602r april 2008 9 the government accountability office gao has monitore d the brac process since 1988 part of that effort has been to assess how communities fared since base was clos ed or realigned using da ta on the number of jobs recovered unemployment rates and per capita income the gao concluded that nearly 70 of jobs lost to base closings between 1988 and 1995 had been recovered by 2004 see government

base shares similarities with other closed industrial facilities such as steel mills oil refineries or port facilities research and previous economic development experience suggest that converting closed military base into source of new competitive advantage is major community effort some bases closed in earlier brac rounds have been successfully redeveloped into manufacturing facilities airports and research laboratories eg charleston south carolina bases also may hold certain advantages for redevelopment that are not shared by other industrial sites pricing for the closed bases might be steeply discounted and liability for environmental protection indemnified federal grants and incentives also exist to aid community redevelopment efforts 12 once base is slated for closing consideration of property transfer mechanisms the extent of environmental cleanup necessary and realistic base reuse plan for the transferred property become central elements in organizing the economic development process establishing local redevelopment authority lra with power to ssume ownership of the transferred land is necessary initial step in the economic redevelopment process 13 the lra must be approved by the dod before property can be transferred th dods office of economic adjustment oea is resource available to communities seeking assistance in managing the impact of base closing or realignment14 the oea awards planning grants to communities and also provides technical and planning assistance to local redevelopment authorities by 2002 cumulative 19 billion in dod and

g347g561might be applied to almost all cases however is that the sooner economic redevelopment can begin after base closure the better for local communities base closure can be economically very difficult for community but closure with long lag in which the closed base is essentially hole in the local economy is worse while many factors can delay the economic redevelopment of closed base the most common may be the need for environmental cleanup of the closed property g7g151g159g146g155g152g151g150g142g151g157g138g149g561g5g149g142g138g151g158g153g561 except for limited circumstances property from closed military base must be cleaned of environmental contamination before being transferred for redevelopment the degree of cleanup and the timetable for completion however is left to dod which is operating under the appropriations approved by congress because of the extent of contamination and magnitude of costs involved once funds are allocated environmental cleanup times can be lengthy 17 approximately 10 of property from bases closed in prior brac rounds has yet to be cleaned for transfer18 complicating factor in the cleanup process can be the different levels of cleanup that might be completed land intended for use as housing or schools for example must be cleaned to greater degree than land intended for industrial use dod however is not legally required to clean land past the point needed for industrial use when community desires an ultimate land use that would require greater level of cleanup than that done by dod this may result in property being left vacant until either another use is found or until additional cleanup is done in general previous base closures suggest that communities face many specialized challenges but there is little strong evidence that the closing of base is the definitive cause of general economic calamity in local economies 19 on the other hand many rural areas may experience substantially greater and longerterm economic dislocation from base closing than urban and suburban areas rural areas with less diversified local economies may be more dependent on the base as key economic asset than urbansuburban economies communities where bases are recommended for significant expansion can also find the effects of growth major challenge over the five to sixyear phasing out of base however successful property transfers to local redevelopment authority environmental cleanup and widespread community commitment to sound base reuse plan have been shown to be crucial elements in positioning communities for life without military base 17 government accountability office military base closures opportunities ex ist to improve environmental cleanup cost reporting and to expedite transfer of unneeded property
