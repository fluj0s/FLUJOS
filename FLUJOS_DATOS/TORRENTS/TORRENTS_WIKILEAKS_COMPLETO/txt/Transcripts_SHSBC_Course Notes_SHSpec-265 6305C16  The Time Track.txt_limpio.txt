6305c16 shspec265 the time track some of the data in this tape is contained in hcob 15may63 the time track and engram rum ing by chains bulletin i and hcob 8jun63 bulletin ii handling the time track one basic tenet has never changed you have never successfully audited anything but the time track there is nothing to audit but the time track there is grand key to the release of things but the time track locks valences machinery etc are all phenomena of the time track the time track is the continuous record of time of the individual from the first moment he began to experience on through until now an interrupted threed fiftytwo perception movie things happen to that movie it gets grouped and becomes unavailable to the pc for various reasons eg his inability to confront the fact that it can get grouped etc all that auditing ever does is to straighten out the time track make it available and asis it the track gets collapsed and looped by chains which consist of related incidents until you get solid wad of experience which is unavailable to the pc and thus has command value over him there are only two classes of things involved in the time track 1 the mechanical things the matter energy space and time that is the time track 2 the significance of it people who cant confront the track at all eg psychologists and psychiatrists conceive it to consist of thought only the time track is not imaginary and shouldnt be treated as imaginary it has mass in the physical universe brick wall is the product of various people and forces where it all come from neednt be investigated for practical purposes the time track has remained undiscovered and undescribed by mental health practitioners because they have lacked the confront to get past certain mechanisms that make it unavailable nothing is holy to scientologist there is nothing that should not be investigated nothing is unavailable although psychiatrists think so they dont know that the time track is real they have fallen for the first trick that the time track employs to make itself unavailable the idea that there is nothing in the mind but thought that is trick of debarment the consideration is anybody who says that he is looking at brick building in the mind isnt looking as brick building and it must therefore be imaginary so therefore he is living in the field of illusion or delusion so therefore he must be slightly mad insane people must be mad because they are seeing things says the psychiatrist then he compounds the insanity by saying you are not seeing these things he makes the time track less available the direction of sanity lies in the capability of confronting the time track and the pt environment for any individual existence consists of the physical universe pt and everything that is in it at this exact precise pt instant and the time track which consists of everything that has been and that is the total isness as far as this thing called reality is concerned archeology studies suppositional reality but it is not outlawed for that reason you can take some ruin and say what has it been but that is not the isness it is suppositional reality subject to error however archeology is not outlawed as science for that reason furthermore all futures are suppositional if they are suppositional enough they come true lrh used to tell fortunes by looking at persons facsimiles and mocking something up the future is always enforceable with altitude and authority this is just trick method of making postulate stick it is still suppositional reality there is isness and there is suppositional isness the time track often gives people the feeling that the was can return it can be quite solid when there is extra awareness jammed into particular moment you also have to look at borderline phenomenon creating someone says he will build building and he does his saying he will nearly puts it there but creation is suppositional reality until it is actually created at which point it becomes an isness and remains an isness for whatever period of time it endures part of the thought of reality is the adjudication of whether it is good bad or whatever thought is not separate from reality it is woven solidly into reality and is part of the isness of reality one can establish the isness of reality at time by asking about it some people cant even confront that here lrh recounts an anecdote about the cia or the police following students and pcs around for weeks as they ran union station an outdoor objective process command was you invent way of destroying that indicated person see hcob 6feb58 hgc clear procedure outline of february 6 the process was done to take over destructive automaticities they were trying to find out what the scientologists were doing without ever taking the trouble to ask it never occurred to them to establish an isness they couldnt even view the thought in the isness this is even worse than only being able to view the thought in the isness so there is descending gradient of ability to confront an isness 1 able to confront or view an isness 2 able to confront or view only the thought in an isness 3 unable to confront or view the thought in an isness or even to ask about it opinions are there are thoughts and opinions abroad in the world that we may not agree with but which are part of the isness wrought iron fence is thought woven into the physical universe as to some degree is all else when someone creates something in the physical universe part of its isness is the expression of his thought thought is expressed by the formation of the mest so thought is to some degree part of the physical universe likewise the time track is composed of matter energy space time and thought so both the physical universe and the time track are composed of mest and thought added onto these are many complexities such as suppositional isnesses befores and afters purposes and aesthetics the degree that an individual is on suppositional kick measures directly his confrontingness how much suppositional isness is added to actual isness critic says the artist should have the should have measures the amount of nonconfront the critic is doing this is also true of pcs who typically say well it looks as if there might have been there could possibly have been wreck of some kind here at one time or another maybe i think it was an airplane it turns out that it was building the pc is very suppositional he doesnt give the isness of it someone who criticizes anything is doing supposition about how something should be they are not confronting the isness the time track straightens out and erases in direct ratio to the amount of isness confronted by the pc and that is how sane and capable he gets it is measured directly by the amount of isness the individual is able to confront in view of the fact that he pcs track is in terrible condition there are two factors at work 1 the pcs own feelings of incompetence 2 the unrecognizableness of the track these combine to give you cats breakfast an extreme form of this problem is seen in the pc who supposes all sorts of horrible things who thinks it is so uncomfortable that he doesnt even show up for session thetans state is not really pinned mechanically by anything he is not made less of thetan or more by mest but when you surround him as intimately as the time track does with tremendous amount of suppositional unconfrontability he is enforced into state of low morale where he doesnt think that he can do anything and the isness then is that he cant the pc supposes that the time track is not confrontable that the auditor is not going to be able to do anything for it that he wont be able to handle it etc all the time hes supposing hes not confronting he knows what will happen he has had all these unconfrontable experiences and his attention is still fixed on something and he knows he mustnt take his attention off of it he also knows that if he doesnt take his attention off of it he will go to pieces then he has forgotten that he has his attention on it he feels degraded by all this in addition the state of his track is horrible it is scrambled shredded snarled up the thetan in the middle of it all is convinced that if he moves or looks at any of it something horrible will happen all of it has command value over him yet at the same time it is valuable to him it has become his havingness its all the old tin cans hes got its all his knowingness hes like somebody who has become totally dependent on the record department and then the record department has been bombed he cant even find out his own name rank and serial number without it that dependency and the why of it is also in the record department the great savants who have remained ignorant of the time track have just q and ad with its unconsciousness by remaining unconscious of it and unwilling to approach its pain the time track is unavailable to the being so the savant supposes that it is unavailable to him but the auditor mustnt do this q and the only real tragedy of life i suppose is that absolute unconsciousness and absolute unknowingness are unobtainable the fact that thetan cant remember at first what happened in an engram doesnt mean that he was unconscious at the time if absolute unconsciousness and unknowingness were possible we would probably be all right dont underestimate the violence that is there on the time track and dont force the pc into it but if you get the earliest moment of the earliest gpm it runs like hot butter even though theres as much charge on it as there is on later one the difficulty you hit with the later one is that it has the charge of all the earlier ones in addition to its own so it is far harder for the pc to confront it is important not to give the pc loses early on you should know the mechanics of engrams and the time track be sure your commands mean what you intend them to mean through the incident does not mean through the incident to the end and if you just say move to the end the pc wont go through the incident the bank follows the you think you are there so you are there mechanism of the thetan so the difference between to and through is very important use to in scouting and through in running engrams and dont mix them up lrh found that some pcs cant run gpms until they have run an early engram also if you can run the overt engram that relates to these gpms as an engram fantastic amount of charge will come off the implants themselves and they will run like hot butter here is datum that particular implanting outfit was located down towards the center of this galaxy and was founded 52863010 654079 years ago it was destroyed 38932690862933 years ago by the 79th wing of the 43rd battle squadron of the galactic fleet it was wildcat activity they used to drag magellanic clouds out of the center hub of the galaxy let them follow lines of force and come over system and then send planes in with speakers the place would be caved in for thousands of years as result of radioactive clouds you are not likely to find any implant earlier then or even near 52 trillion years ago or closer to pt than 359 trillion years ago any other kind of implant is different kind or dramatization of it someplace else the helatrobus implanter had the dream of everyone in the universe being good they used the ice cube see history of man pp 645 this is the implant that really keyed in the time track
