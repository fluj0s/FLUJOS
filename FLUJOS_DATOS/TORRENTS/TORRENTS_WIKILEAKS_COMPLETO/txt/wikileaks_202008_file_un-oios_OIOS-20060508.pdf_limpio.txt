personnel auditors krishna menon stefan helck united nations nations unies office of internal oversight services unhcr audit service audit of retrenchment benefits for unhcr implementi ng partner project personnel ar200516207 executive summary in october 2005 oios conducted an audit of the pay ment of retrenchment benefits for unhcr implementing partner project personnel these are l umpsum payments made on redundancy either voluntarily by employers through collective agreements or mandated under statutory provisions unhcrs policies and guidelines on this topic were selected for global review as oios had observed few country operations notably pakistan and sudan where unhcr has been committed to pay retrenchment benefits amounti ng to millions of us dollars oios audit included review of international conv entions that could have bearing in the subject and other available literature as well as horizo ntal assessment of the current practices and procedures adopted by some unhcr country operations draft of the report was shared with the division of operational support dos the division of finance supply management dfsm and the office of the director of the sudan situation doss in december 2005 subsequently meetings were held with dos and dfsm to discuss the audit findings to clarify issues and to discuss the feasibility of implementing the recomme ndations the formal comments which were received in march 2006 are reflected as appropria in this final report main audit findings and recommendations unhcrs provisions on the remuneration and benefit s made for implementing partner personnel are mentioned in the subproject agreeme nt in oios opinion clearer and more concise guidelines are required in the absence of this unhcr has been exposed to excessive retrenchment benefit payments some country operati ons have resorted to agreements with partners that do not adequately safeguard unhcrs i nterests in oios view therefore there is potential risk of further disputes andor unus ual type agreements being entered into if the matter is handled inconsistently by country operati ons from unhcrs perspective there is firm legal lia bility to pay retrenchment benefits for implementing partner personnel nonetheless unhcr has often paid these on the grounds of moral obligation or in the interests of maintaini ng good relations with the partner often the governmental partner for example oios estimated that financial implications to pay retrenchment benefits to implementing partner perso nnel in pakistan could reach us 1 million and for the commissioner of refugees cor in sudan it could reach us 5 million the formulation applied in sudan far exceeded that legally mandated in national law and the longterm agreement was entered into with cor witho ut seeking advice from headquarters as of march 2006 it has been agreed in principle to reopen the ne gotiation process at the representation level with cor conventions adopted by the international labour org anization on the termination of employment widely recognise the right of employees for financial compensation to offset or mitigate the adverse effects of loss of employment large number of national systems also acknowledge that in certain circumstances retrenchm ent benefits are to be paid on loss of employment oios noted that international partners typically ve well defined personnel policies that generally contain provision for retrenchment bene fits however there was lack of clarity with reference to those for local partners where provision in their employment contracts for retrenchment benefits was often absent the main co ncern is with government partners where as civil servants they have an expectation that re trenchment benefits will be paid on separation such provisions are normally clearly ou tlined in the local employment law oios recommended that unhcr management take correct ive action by issuing clear guidelines and establishing procedures for the paym ent of termination benefits to implementing partner personnel this should include procedures t ensure the legal and financial ramifications including future potential liabiliti are thoroughly reviewed and considered prior to unhcr embarking on any formulapolicy and entering into any subsequent locally signed agreement dos has agreed to clarify the relevant clauses in t he subproject agreement to further guide managers through the steps of its negotiation plan ning and signing highlighting clauses related to personnel and unhcrimplementing partner legal liabilities instructions issued would also highlight that in principle special agreements or commitments apart from those already authorized should be entertained by field perations without the prior approval of

for the payment of retrenchment benefits for implementing partner project personnel the audit was conducted in accordance wi th the international standards for the professional practice of internal auditing 2 retrenchment benefits for implementing part ner project personnel have been reviewed by oios as part of its audits of unhcr cou ntry operations also in june 2005 oios conducted review of the retrenchment b enefits for unhcr implementing partner staff in pakistan that culmina ted in several recommendations that were accepted and are under implementation th is is the first time however that retrenchment benefits have been subject to compre hensive and global review 3 unhcrs main guidance with regard to partne r project personnel is outlined in the subproject agreements wherein it is stated under article 6 agency personnel shall not be considered in any respect as being unhcr staff members or as having any other contractual link with the office also the agency shall at its own expense comply with all laws and regulations f its country of residence or operation if different and assume all liabilities and obligations imposed by any law or regulation with respect to its performance under this agreement clause 156 of appendix1 refers to the contract between the imple menting partners and their staff and requires that the government or agency shall stablish contracts with personnel recruited or seconded under the subproject governe d by the unhcr agreement in accordance with the applicable regulations includi ng inter alia description of duties and functional responsibilities and remunera tion including applicable benefits and employment termination indemnities furthermor unhcr programme budgeting cycle warrants that any retrenchment of s eparation payments be budgeted for and expensed in the year of retrenchment unhcr does not provide for an accumulated provision for such payments 4 the findings and recommendations contained in this report have been discussed with the officials responsible for the au dited activities during the exit conference held on 28 october 2005 draft of this report was shared with the division of operational support dos the division of finance supply management dfsm and the office of the director of the sudan situation doss in december 2005 subsequent to this meetings were held with d and dfsm to discuss the audit findings to clarify issues and to discuss th feasibility of implementing the recommendations the formal comments which were re ceived in march 2006 are reflected where appropriate in the report ii audit objectives 5 the main objectives of the audit were to identify key definitions relevant to the retrenchme nt of employment review selected country operations with reference t liability for retrenchment benefits assess if unhcr complies with the applicable regula tions rules and legally 2 binding documents with regard to retrenchment benef its including the applicability of international conventions assess if other agencies pay retrenchment benefi ts to implementing partner project personnel assess if unhcr is liable to pay retrenchment benef its to personnel of implementing partners identify any areas where there is lack of detaile d rules and procedures for implementation iii audit scope and methodology 6 the audit focused on unhcr policy aspects as well as review of selected country operations where retrenchment benefits had been paid from 2001 to 2005 the operations included bangladesh greece kenya pakistan sudan syria and sierra leone oios also conducted detailed research which included an examination of international conventions that could have bear ing in the subject as well as available literature the audit conducted horizon tal assessment of the current practices and procedures in unhcr for the payment f retrenchment benefits for implementing partner project personnel including review and assessment of policies relating to retrenchment benefits oios held discus sions with the legal affairs section and other relevant sections units and pers onnel analysed applicable data and reviewed available documents and other relevant rec ords iv audit findings and recommendations definition 7 retrenchment benefits also called severanc pay are lumpsum payments made to redundant employees either voluntarily by the employer through collective agreements or as mandated under statutory provision s the burden of these payments is usually borne by the employer oios examination highlighted that the definition and terminology used for retrenchment benefits vari ed considerably within unhcr in pakistan and bangladesh the term retrenchment benefits is often used to indicate the amounts payable when employment had been discon tinued in sudan the terms gratuity and after service benefits were applie d to specify the sums owed to the employee other countries use the expression termi nation benefits for end of service payments 8 oios is using the term retrenchment benefi ts to denote the amounts if any payable by the implementing partner to its personne l for loss of employment resulting from reductions in the workforce it should be clea r that retrenchment benefits are compensation for loss of employment and do not cons titute reward for years of service 9 the terms and conditions of employment for implementing partner project personnel are generally stipulated in contractual relationship between the employee and the organisation this contractual relationship operates within the legal framework as set out in the respective national leg islation the obligation to pay 3 retrenchment benefits generally arises from contrac tual arrangements between the organisation and employee legislative requirements industry practice and business practice retrenchment benefits could include s tatutory endofservice payments the levels of which are set out in legislation and where applicable b compensation amounts as negotiated as per collective bargaining agreements including ex gratia severance payments b international conventions on retrenchment benefi ts 10 in the absence of supranational standards the international labour organisation ilo has published conventions on ret renchment of employment such as 116 and 158 by publishing these international c onventions considerable progress has been made in the adoption of new international standards there is general trend to acknowledge employer responsibilities in this re gard in accordance with the termination of employment convention 1982 adopte d by the general conference of the ilo in june 1982 article 3 of the 1982 conv ention states for the purpose of this convention the terms termination and termination of employment mean termination of employment at the initiative of the employer 11 article 12 of the 1982 convention further provides that worker whose employment has been terminated shall be entitled i n accordance with national law and practice to severance allowance or other separation benefits the amount of which shall be based inter alia on length of servic and the level of wages and paid directly by the employer or by fu nd constituted by employers contributions or b benefits from unemployment insurance or assistance or other forms of social security such as oldage or invalidity bene fits under the normal conditions to which such benefits are subject or c combination of such allowance and benefits 12 the 1982 convention reflects the cornersto ne of modern employment law and lays down in clear terms an employees right t to be unfairly or unjustifiably dismissed from service the right not to be unfairl or unjustifiably dismissed is encompassed in most national legal systems sometim as constitutional right but mostly as statutory right and occasionally as r ight secured by collective agreements typically retrenchment payments are mor prevalent in lowincome countries where low wages and absence of credible social security programmes is the norm modern jurisprudence therefore commonly recog nises the right of an employee to financial compensation to offset or mitigate the adverse effects of loss of employment c practices followed by other international organi sations 13 the audit showed that international organi sations have in general not been held liable for the payment of retrenchmenttermina tion benefits to implementing partner personnel or staff of other cooperating org anisations at unon where they have contractual arrangements with implementing par tners oios reviewed the 4 guidelines for its standard memorandum of understa nding mou and letters of agreement loa and noted those that are widely us ed as means for executing specific activities do not contain any provision f or the payment of retrenchment benefits the agreements unesco enters into with im plementing agencies at nairobi also did not make any reference to any kind of retr enchment or endofemployment benefits either 14 moreover in pakistan oios reviewed and co mpared unhcrs governing clauses with those of other international organisat ions including ilo unicef undp and wfp and observed that these agencies did n ot pay retrenchment benefits the wfp agreement with the international rescue com mittee in pakistan also did not mention retrenchment benefits taking this into co nsideration it was unclear why unhcr among all the international agencies was sing led out in pakistan to be held liable for such payments possible explanation wa s that the projects implemented by other agencies were mostly oneoff projects whi unhcrs association or involvement with refugee assistance was protracted and implemented over an extended period d retrenchment benefits and unhcr subproject agre ements 15 unhcrs guidelines with regard to retrench ment benefits for implementing partner personnel are not in oios opinion clearl outlined in the subproject agreements concluded with implementing partners and this may be one of the reasons that they are inconsistently interpreted and variou s formulae have been developed for the payment of retrenchment benefits at the field l evel as outlined in the following paragraphs pakistan 16 unhcr funded retrenchment benefits during two distinct periods from 1991 to 1996 and again from 2003 to 2005 the method of funding and implementation as well as the actual beneficiaries were substantially different in the periods concerned in the former period benefits were paid under spec ifically formulated projects while in the latter period retrenchment benefits were pai d from project savings in care and maintenance projects erroneously however in the fi rst period benefits were paid even to project personnel who were not retrenched r separated and only from 2003 onwards benefits have been limited to project pers onnel actually retrenched 17 oios could not establish legal liability to pay retrenchment benefits for unhcr pakistan or its implementing partners the st andard unhcr governing clauses that exclude such liabilities were includ ed in the subproject agreements oios could not ascertain the applicability of the w est pakistan industrial and commercial employment standing orders ordinance 1968 or any other available pakistan labour case law to unhcr or its partners and neither the representation in islamabad nor its partners could provide documen tary evidence or otherwise demonstrate unhcrs liability or that of its partne rs unhcrs local legal adviser though not able to legally demonstrate such liabili ty either was of the opinion that the pakistani national laws governing commercial tities equally applied to international ngos and other nonprofit organisatio ns and that the implementing partners and unhcr were thus liable to pay retrench ment benefits 5 18 the representation strongly felt that unhcr had m oral responsibility to pay such benefits and that this was in the interes ts of maintaining good relations with the government and partners stressing that decis ion not to pay could impede the work of unhcr and perhaps compromise the safety of unhcr staff and property as assessed by the representation the financial im plications of the payment of retrenchment benefits for partner staff could reach us 1 million b sudan 19 the laws and practices relating to retrenc hment benefits payments have undergone substantial changes in the last decade i n 1995 the policy established by unhcr made clear distinction between unhcrs impl ementing project personnel who resigned and those whose services were terminat ed or were made redundant the 1995 formula for the commissioner for refugees cor and other partners was that terminated personnel were entitled to one month gro ss salary for every completed year of service up to maximum of six months sal ary personnel who had worked for more than 6 years would receive in addition 20 per cent of their monthly gross salary for the 7 th and subsequent years until recently 2004 this formula was used to calculate the retirement benefits to terminated sta ff of other partners such as benevolence international and the sudanese red cros s this formula was quite conservative and the resulting retrenchment benefit s did not add substantially to unhcrs financial burden 20 the 1995 formula was used until 2004 even though the national laws underwent farreaching changes in 1997 the 1997 l abour code of sudan stipulates that i any worker who has spent period of continuous service with his employer of not less than three years shall be enti tled to full severance pay to be calculated as follows 1 if he has completed period of not less than th ree years and not more than 10 years he shall be entitled to one mon th basic salary for each year of service 2 if he has completed more than 10 years he shall be entitled to one and half months basic salary in respect of each year after the succeeding five years and if he had completed more than 15 years he shall be entitled to one and three qua rters of months basic salary for each additional year of service p rovided that the gratuity shall not exceed thirty months basic salary ii the gratuities are calculated on the basis of the l ast monthly basic salary 21 despite the clear provisions in the law i n september 2003 unhcr agreed to pay retrenchment benefits to cor project personn which differed from sudanese law the new formulation was developed by cor and w as excessive in comparison to national law and did not take into account the b enchmarks envisaged 22 the decision to select cors methodology w as taken by joint technical committee composed of staff of unhcr and cors fina nce director three 6 formulations were presented and deliberated upon by the committee from cor unhcr and ilo the ilo formula resulted in the low est payment followed by unhcr with the highest presented by cor despite b eing the highest cost an agreement was signed with cor to pay retrenchment b enefits in accordance with its formula the decision by the technical committee an d the subsequent agreement signed by cor and endorsed by the unhcr representat ive was sent to headquarters in july 2003 as this was after the agreement had been signed it was therefore fait accompli the technical committees agreement contained an unusual clause stipulating that the formula agreed would apply to all personnel separations without any alterations in future t he mou was signed thereafter in september 2003 without headquarters approval 23 oios reviewed and assessed unhcrs financi liability by signing the mou according to the agreed formula all project p ersonnel would receive three months gross salary for each year of service plus lump sum of seven months gross salary 24 oios calculations showed that the 2003 co r formula was 4 to 6 times more generous than the 1995 unhcr policy and about 25 to 35 times more than the 1997 sudanese labour code it is also important to note that the sudanese law envisages cap of 30 months basic salary as the ma ximum amount payable while the cor formula was open ended without any maximum limi ts furthermore the cor formula is indexlinked to the last salary drawn an d therefore any increase in salary would trigger corresponding increase in benefits based on the agreement unhcr paid us 600000 in 2004 to 101 staff with additio nal retrenchments expected over the next few years oios estimated that the total f inancial implication of the mou was about us 5 million 25 in oios opinion considering the financia l value of this separation package the bureau should have been involved in such discus sions and negotiations from the outset advice of the legal affairs section should also have been sought considering that the mou committed unhcr to significant potenti liabilities it was not clear who authorized the representation to enter into suc h longterm commitment for unhcr in the view of oios unhcr should determine the acc ountability of those staff members responsible for committing unhcr to n openended and substantial liability over and above the national law 26 oios understands that in 2005 cor requeste d an increase in salary for project personnel which would further increase the cost of future retrenchments since the formula is indexlinked oios emphasized in its june 2005 audit report on sudan operations that unhcr should not accept any i ncrease pending resolution of this ongoing issue with cor following oios recomm endation made in its audit report present unhcr management at the representat ion tried to renegotiate the formula at that time these efforts were not succe ssful and cor did not agree to any modifications 27 while it would be problematic for unhcr to repudiate signed agreement oios believes that it is still worthwhile pursuing the matter even marginal reduction in the variables involved would yield sub stantial financial savings taking into consideration that cor has some 800 personnel funded by unhcr also in article iv clause 2 of the cor agreement payment is subject to the availability of 7 funds in the current context of reduced availabil ity of funds the lack of resources could also be useful argument to renegotiate the formula in addition article iv clause 3 states that the cor formula shall be of indefinite duration such clause that binds unhcr in perpetuity is flawed and ry to basic legal principles and the existence of such clause prima facie vitiates the agreement the mou does not preserve the privileges and immunities of unhcr and does not contain clause relating to resolution of disputes or other mandato ry clauses it also does not observe the sudanese labour code that places cap of 30 mo nths salary as the maximum amount payable in retrenchment benefits 28 in response to the draft report unhcr informed oio s that the director of operations for the sudan situation doss sent morandum to dated 5 january 2006 requesting their legal opinion on the formula of payment of retrenchment benefits as implemented for the cor st aff confirmed the legally binding nature of the mou signed with cor but prov ided arguments for termination of the current mou and renegotiation of the agreed formula unhcr added that on the basis of advice doss had organized sepa rate meeting with the sudanese government delegation that participated at the stan ding committee session in geneva on 9 march 2006 during which the issue of t he mou and the after service benefits formula had been discussed and the direct or of the operations had presented unhcrs arguments in favour of renegotiat ing the formula unhcr stated that the sudanese delegation had shown its u nderstanding of the unhcr standpoint and agreed in principle to reopen the negotiation process at the representation level pursuant to this decision neg otiations are currently ongoing in khartoum unhcr added that doss would provide addit ional information after the completion of the negotiation process oios is pleased to note that positive action has already been taken which may result in signifi cant future costs savings for the organization recommendation head2right the unhcr director of operations for the sudan situ ation should continue to pursue the negotiations with the commissioner of refugees on the after service bene fits formula adopted in the september 2003 memorandum of understanding between cor and unhcr with the aim to reduce unhcrs liability estimated at us 5 million rec 01 c bangladesh 29 prior to 2000 retrenchment benefits were paid to implementing partner project personnel in bangladesh by the allocation f unused funds in other sectors the payment of retrenchment benefits was on the bas is of an agreement signed on 31 october 2000 between unhcr and the ministry of dis aster management and relief mdmr this agreement however was not shared with headquarters prior to its signature but it broadly reflects bangladesh law n retrenchment it provides for the payment of thirty days wages for every completed ye ar of service or part thereof in excess of six months the agreement stipulated that payment would be made only from the year 2000 onwards and that the amounts pro vided for the purpose would be deposited into separate account from which retren chment benefits would be paid as and when required there is also specific clause that states that unhcr is not in 8 position to pay retrospectively for those who have been terminated in the past it was also clear that unhcr would monitor the funds kept in the separate bank account to ensure they are used for the intended purposes 30 the representation was unable to indicate the level of funds deposited in this separate account from 2000 until 2003 or how they h ad been disbursed mdmr did not account for them and record of how they were used could be presented in may 2005 the representation wrote to mdmr to reemphas ise that unhcr would not be in position to pay any pre2000 benefits and tha t the government should account for the funds already remitted by unhcr for retrenc hment benefits 31 meanwhile some mdmr employees who were re trenched in 2005 served the unhcr representation with legal notice statin g that retrenchment benefits had been paid and were concerned that only benefit s accrued from 2000 to 2004 and none from the preceding periods would be paid from the papers available to oios it was unclear why benefits had not been paid from the already available funds and since separate funding mechanism had been establi shed there should have been claim on unhcr it was oios view that the represe ntation seeks legal advice on the matter on the basis of the october 2000 agreeme nt d greece 32 unhcr funded retrenchment indemnity fund for an implementing partner and when the partnership was discontinued in 2002 more than us 50000 was available in the fund however due to financial crisis the implementing partner disbursed the funds on other expenses former sta ff member of the implementing partner initiated legal proceedings against the par tner and the court is expected to adjudicate in the matter in july 2005 unhcr forma lly requested the partner to return the retrenchment indemnity fund balance to u nhcr and action by the partner is awaited sierra leone 33 oios review showed that the unhcr partner s in the country resorted to various strategies in order to avoid paying retrenc hment benefits to implementing partner personnel some partners gave threemonth extendable contracts to their staff and others granted only consultancy type cont racts to avoid legal issues relating to separation partners who awarded regular contrac ts to their staff faced problems regarding retrenchment benefit payments g kenya 34 an international partner in kenya accrued severance pay on monthly basis 833 per cent of salary and paid it to the employ ee as salary for the thirteenth month even though the employee continued to be on the pay roll kenyan law requires that severance benefits be paid at the rate of 15 days s alary for each year worked oios observed that consistent policies were not followed regarding the provision of benefits 35 the above examples show that even where firm legal liability could not be established unhcr is sometimes obliged to make ret renchment benefits on moral 9 grounds or in the interest of maintaining good work ing relations with the government pakistan this was particularly the case for impl ementing partner staff that had been working on unhcr projects for long periods in some countries pakistan sudan and bangladesh retrenchment benefit issues have rfaced primarily with government partners since employees of most govern ment partners have at some point in time been civil servants they have expect ations of receiving retrenchment benefits at least based on government rules and reg ulations other matters partners lack understanding regarding retrenchm ent benefits 36 unhcr partners that are international ngos often have multiple donors and receive funding from various sources these partner s generally have well defined personnel policies setting out the salaries and ent itlements of staff which normally includes provision for retrenchmenttermination b enefits where the partners project personnel do not work exclusively on unhcr funded projects such common costs are generally allocated between donors in pro portion to the funding received oios examination of international partners in paki stan showed that there were marked differences in the manner retrenchment benef its were dealt with several partners had clearly defined severance policies some accrued these liabilities and others expensed the amounts only when the liability arose oios also noted that one partner paid such benefits from its own funding and hence did not expect unhcr to cover this cost 37 the oios audit in pakistan also showed tha t most local implementing partners did not make provision for retrenchment benefits in their employment contracts therefore they were unaware on the bas is of clause 156 of appendix 1 of the unhcr subproject agreement that employment co ntracts should include provision for retrenchment indemnities on the othe r hand most government partners were aware of such requirement and such staff exp ected retrenchment benefits on separation 38 it appears therefore that local ngo partne rs do not adequately consider or provide for retrenchment benefits even though it i s their responsibility as outlined in the subproject agreement unhcr may need to clarif its policy on retrenchment benefits when initially entering into an agreement with them b unusual practices adopted 39 from review of the practices noted oios would caution against payment of an annual 13 th salary in lieu of retrenchment benefits this so lution while apparently convenient tends to be more costly ce all implementing partner project staff benefit from such payments even if never ret renched eg staff may resign or retire before any possible retrenchment also suc h payments defeat the purpose of true retrenchment benefit which provides some fina ncial compensation due to the loss of employment therefore this approach should be avoided unless otherwise required by national law 10 c establishment of appropriate benchmarks and cle arance procedures 40 the basic benchmark for implementing partn er personnel retrenchment benefits should be what the national law mandates oios review showed that widely prevalent yardstick was one months salary f or every year of service worldwide the common approach for defining retrenc hment payments is formula based upon multiple of years of service and salar 41 issues surrounding retrenchment benefits h ave obvious legal and financial implications these are predominant both at the ini tial stage of problem definition and when options are considered as seen above some co untry offices have tended to resolve these matters locally without seeking assi stance from the available expertise at headquarters namely the legal affairs section r approval by their respective bureau the seeking of guidance and approval are of particular significance where the benefits are paid on the basis of collective agreem ents outside the ambit of national law 42 therefore it is important that prior to any formula established or agreement entered into for even with one project staff membe r precedent could be established it should be channelled to headquarter s and then to the division of operational support these submissions should detai l the legal and financial ramifications in particular future financial liabi lities delineate the potential risks and clearly lay down the respective roles and responsib ilities of the parties involved oios would also emphasise that any deviation from t he formulapolicy established by national law be justified and properly documented i n its submission to unhcr headquarters in response to the draft report dos stated that any instructions issued would highlight that in principle special agre ements or commitments apart from those already authorized by the unhcr manual instr uctive memorandums or other forms of delegation should be entertained by field operations without the prior approval of dfsm and dos at headquarters f policy development and policy clarification 43 in oios opinion the variety of policies and practices adopted by country operations for the provision and subsequent payment of retrenchment benefits emanates from the lack of clear and concise guideli nes on the subject oios appreciates that the subproject agreement provides general guideline but it does not suffice as evidenced by the inconsistency of i ts application by field offices in the absence of clear direction and consultation with he adquarters unhcr field operations have wrongly entered into agreements tha t are not acceptable financially committing unhcr to sizable future liabilities clear and common understanding needs to be established as well as standard proced ures developed for the payment of retrenchment benefits this will ensure accountabil ity the adoption of basic principles and consistent approach established globally 44 dos highlighted in the response to the draft audit report that it should be made clear that unhcr has intention to assume li ability for retrenchment benefits and legally unhcr has never been official ly liable to effect such payments on behalf of implementing partners they agreed how ever that in exceptional situations where unhcr has moral commitment to pa benefits for partners totally 11 funded by unhcr certain level of financial respo nsibility to cover ad hoc payments can be envisaged according to prevailing s ituations oios agrees with dos that ensuring compliance with national laws and or employment laws for the payment of retrenchment benefits clearly lies with the implementing partner nonetheless it needs to be appreciated that in rea lity whether directly or indirectly such payments often fall upon unhcr particularly f or partners substantially if not wholly financed by the unhcr recommendations head2right the unhcr division of operational support should fo rmulate policy regulating the payment of retrenchment benef its to project personnel of unhcr implementing partners the polic should emphasise that the benchmark for such benefits woul d be the minimum amount foreseen in the relevant national w applicable to the respective country operation eg one month s salary for each year of service any amounts exceeding the l egally mandated requirements would be the responsibility of the implementing partner rec 02 head2right the unhcr division of operational support should cl arify that retrenchment benefits shall only be paid to impleme nting partner project personnel as and when retrenched unless therwise required under national law rec 03 head2right the unhcr division of operational support should in struct all country operations not to commit to payment of retr enchment benefits without prior consultation with and cleara nce by the legal affairs section the division of operational support and the division of financial and supply management wh should assess the risks involved and consider the financia l legal and other possible implications rec04 45 dos agrees with the recommendations and will addres s these issues in the context of clarification to the relevant clauses in the subproject agreement signed with implementing partners in order to further guid the managers through the steps of negotiations planning and signing subproject greements by paying special attention to clauses related to personnel and unhcr implementing partner legal liabilities v acknow ledgement 46 i wish to express my appreciation for the assistance and cooperation extended to the auditors by the staff of the variou s divisions and bureaux at unhcr headquarters eleanor t
