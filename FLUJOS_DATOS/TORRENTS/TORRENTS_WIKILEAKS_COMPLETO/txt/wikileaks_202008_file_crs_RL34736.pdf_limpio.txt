technology policy ostp through the national science and technology policy organization and priorities act of 1976 pl 94282 the act states that the primary function of the ostp director is to provide within the executive office of the president eop advice on the scientific engineering and technological aspects of issues that require attention at the highest level of government further the office shall serve as source of scientific and technological analysis and judgment for the president with respect to major policies plans and programs of the federal government the ostp director also manages the national science and technology council nstc established by executive order 12881 which coordinates science and technology st policy across the federal government establishes national goals for federal st investments and prepares coordinated research and development rd strategies in addition the ostp director cochairs the presidents council of advisors on science and technology pcast established by executive order 13226 the ostp director also plays role in the communication of scientific and technical information by federal agency scientists and engineers an issue for congress is what should be the appropriate title rank role and responsibilities of ostps director some in the science and technology st community contend that by providing the ostp director with cabinet rank or the title of assistant to the president the individual in that office would have more infl uence within the eop others have proposed that several individuals take on the roles and responsibilities of the ostp director rather than one individual and that the ostp director play greater role in ensuring federal agency scientists and engineers are able to communicate their findings further some in the st community also believe that the ostp director and nstc should play greater role in federal agency coordination prioritysetting and budget allocation another question is who should decide the issue focus of ostp associate directors nstc interagency coordination activities and pcast congress may consider several legislative options regarding ostp first it may wish to allow the president to have autonomy over ostp currently the president maintains discretion over the policies structure and personnel of ostp nstc and pcast often through executive orders second congress may wish to evaluate whether or not ostp is still needed within the eop if so congress can continue its current ostp legislative guidance mechanisms or it can increase the intensity with which it applies those mechanisms congress annually evaluates ostp through the regular authorization and appropriations process and introduces issuespecific bills that identify actions and issues on which members of congress believe ostp should focus an alternative is for congress to increase the intensity of its evaluation by holding oversight hearings on ostp or by amending ostps authorization statute when congress evaluates the various policy options factor to consider is that the ostp directors influence in the eop may depend more on the relationship between whomever is appointed to that position and the president than legislative action on december 20 2008 presidentelect obama stated his intention to appoint dr john holdren as assistant to the president for science and technology apst ostp director and cochair of pcast and that promoting science isnt just about providing resourcesits about protecting free and open inquiry he also indicated his intention to appoint dr harold varmus and dr eric lander as the other cochairs of pcast

federal scientists and engineers or informal personal contacts7 since the early 1930s presidents have attempted to expand their sources of science and technology advice through series of advisory boards and committees these boards and committees tend to remain for discrete periods of time before being disbanded often by the next president when again faced with the need for st advice new advisory boards or committees sometimes reconstituted from previously disbanded ones would be formed during the period between world war i and through world war ii the role of the application of research to provide technology for both military and economic purposes became evident as result president franklin d roosevelt established the office of scientific research and development osrd in 1941 following world war ii the utility of science and technology to society as exhibited during the war was crystallized in science the endless frontier 1945 report by vannevar bush osrd director this report which proposed program for postwar scientific research set the stage for todays view of the relationship between the federal government and the st community regarding policy for science in his report bush indicated that scientific progress was essential for the war against disease for national security and for the public welfare as shown in the the next several presidents used variety of mechanisms to obtain st advice within the eop to enhance interagency coor dination and to receive counsel from outside advisors organizations within the eop included the office of the special assistant to the president for science and technology eisenhower and office of science and technology ost kennedy johnson examples of organizations focused on interagency coordination included the presidents scientific research board truman and the federal council for science and technology eisenhower kennedy johnson examples of external advisory committees are the science advisory committee truman eisenhower and the presidents science advisory committee psac eisenhower kennedy johnson during the nixon administration the st policy office in the white house ost was abolished and relocated within nsf in addition president nixon decided to not appoint new members to psac after its members resigned president ford supported the return of science advisory mechanism to the white house but he wished to establish it through legislation not executive order 8 he signed the national science and technology policy organization and priorities act of 1976 pl 94282 into law on may 11 1976 this act

to the president presidents have sometimes granted the science adviser the additional title of assistant to the president for science and technology apst or special assistant to the president these titles may influence the degree of access the science adviser has to the president and eop decision making see appendix for historical overview of science advisers and their titles although each president differs in how he has managed eop staff generally presumption of access to the president is accorded to cabinet members and assistants to the president14 those who hold other titles such as the director of an eo p office or special assistant to the president are presumed to have less access

congress and the ostp director and apst varies depending on the nature of the appointment if an individual serves only as apst then senate confirmation is required however congress does confirm the individual the president nominates to be ostp director while the ostp director can be required to testify before congress apsts may decline requests that they testify indicating that as an assistant to the president they would not testify due to separation of powers andor executive privilege 15 some members of congress may believe it is important to have oversight over whom is appointed as the presidents science adviser and to have an option of hearing testimony from the individual serving in that role others may believe that the role of ostp director or apst is sufficiently minor that they feel need to have oversight over that position and that they have other sources from which they may obtain st information

ostps external advisory committee is called the presidents council of advisors on science and technology pcast established through executive order 1322625 the pcast was originally established by president george h w bush and was reestablished in the clinton and george w bush administrations the executive order indicates that pcast provides mechanism for the president to receive advice from the private sector and academic community on technology scientific research priorities and math and science education26 on occasion pcast also meets with the president to discuss science and technology policy issues several presidential level advisory committees established in previous administrations have been subsumed under pcast 27 pcasts members are highlevel executives from industry education and research institutions and other nongovernmental organizations pcast conducts workshops and sometimes uses technical advisory groups to gather information fo r reports to the president on topics such as federalstate cooperation energy us competitiveness nanotechnology and information technology on november 20 2008 the members of pcast in the bush administration wrote letter to the individuals who would succeed them as pcast members28 the letter makes number of recommendations to the next pcast among these are that pcast should play more active role in advising congress on issues related to science and technology policy at the direction of the president rather than just delivering reports to congress consider more congressional activity where it is needed for the administration to implement pcasts recommendations and increase interactions of pcast as group with the president and have more frequent sessions with the office of ma nagement and budget omb and the

and at its lowest in the reagan administration some are c oncerned that this uneven funding and staffing situation leads to inconsistent provision of st advice within the eop although the white house

variety of organizations as illustrated in figure 5 both the clinton and the bush administrations relied on detailees and fellows to conduct ostps activities the detailees and fellows are not included in ostps budget request to congress each year so information regarding their number is irregular in its availability the available data however illustrate that ostp has increasingly relied on

some in the science and technology community have proposed that the ostp director have the title of apst or hold cabinet rank35 related issue is whether or not the roles and responsibilities of the ostp director should be undertaken by several appointees rather than one g22g146g157g149g142g561g138g151g141g561g20g138g151g148g561 as shown in the appendix presidential science advisers have held variety of titles since the fd roosevelt administration of the 12 administrations reviewed the most common title has been some variation of science adviser to the president five administrations followed by special assistant to the president four administrations the ostp director held the title of apst in the george hw bush and clinton administrations but not in the george w bush administration congress may be interested in two policy issues related to additional eop titles held by the ostp director first as discussed earlier while the ostp director can be required to testify before congress apsts may decline requests that they testify indicating that as an assistant to the president they would not testify due to separation of powers andor executive privilege congress asks the ostp director to testify on science and technology policy related issues on regular basis for example the bush administration ostp director testified on wide variety of topics including climate change research including concerns about political interference with this research information technology rd program oversight windstorm impact reduction women in academic science and engineering coal gasification international science and technology cooperation patents developed with federal research dollars weather satellites competitiveness and basic research and the rd budget congress may wish to ensure the availability of the ostp director to testify on issues of congressional interest some in the science and technology community so contend that if the ostp director had cabinet rank that individual would have more access to the president and other senior administration staff 36 they believe that cabinet rank status would enhance the directors authority and influence the degree to which scientific and technical viewpoint is incorporated into administration decisionmaking some members of congress may believe that incorporating 35 see for example carnegie commission on science

while others may believe this status may influence the ability of the science adviser to represent an independent perspective or overemphasizes the importance of incorporating st advice into presidentiallevel deliberations the bush administration ostp director and the longest serving science adviser dr john h marburger iii questioned whether or not he would have had more influence with the apst title he stated that holding an additional title is trivial issue and maintains he and ostp staff had at least the same degree of access as others in previous administrations 37 further discussions with ostp staff indicate that ostp director marburger attended the same senior staff meetings including cabinet meetings as his predecessors with assistant to the president titles the apst title was not granted to dr marburger they said because as ostp director dr marburger could have been required to testify before congress ostp staff indicated that the administration was concerned that confusion might arise if congress could require some administration staff with assistant to the president titles to testify but not others 38 some in the st community contend that the individual serving as apst should be able to discriminate between privileged advice to the president that should not be disclosed to congress and information appropriate for congress to know39 they also state their belief that in order to be influential the apst or ostp director should be cabinetlevel position and identified at the same time as cabinet members shortly after the election of new administration as apst the individual could begin work im mediately however undertaking the duties of ostp director would require formal nomination and senate confirmation 40 if identified early some in the st community contend the apst could provide the president with advice during important early stages of the administration in addition the apst could identify and recruit the best scientists engineers and health professionals for the approximately 100 st policyrelated presidential appointments 41 from historical perspective some experts believe that the relationship between the president and the science adviser is so unique and idiosyncratic that assumptions can be made regarding the influence of that individual on presidential decisionmaking42 another perspective is that the st advisers status and access is based on how the white house is organized43 according to 37 dan greenberg part two qa with john h marburger chronicle of higher education blog april 29 2008 at httpchroniclecomreviewbrainstormgreenbergpar ttwoatalkwithpresidentbushsscienceadviser 38 based on crs discussions with stanley sokul chief of staff ostp august 14 2008 some in the st policy community have also expressed concerns regarding the movement of ostp offices out of the old executive office building ostp staff indicated that their movement out of the old executive office building was required due to the need to structurally reinforce the building plans call for them to return to that building once this work is completed 39 see for example henry kelly ivan oelrich steven aftergood

group of white house staff members the adviser should be the apst if the cabinet is the primary adviser than the adviser should be made member of the cabinet without portfolio based on this perspective the title itself is less important than the access to the president that it signals other critics contend that rather than focusing on the title the st community should instead focus on the degree to which the presidential administration will be transparent about its operations44

cover two broad policy areasscience and technologyand also the issue areas where science and technology might influence decision making on key policies such as national security environment and energy policy today this can include almost every public policy issue second the ostp director is to provide advice to the president and key administration officials including working with omb on the rd budget third the ostp director is to manage the nstc and cochair pcast fourth the ostp director coordinates communication activities during disasters and represents the united states at international st policyrelated meetings one option might be to separate these roles into multiple positions and have several appointees undertake them for example one appointee could cover science and another technology one might focus on providing advice to the president and pcast and another on coordinating nstc interagency activities and st advice for agencies who lack the needed expertise the st community has debated for example the option of having two different individuals serve as apst and ostp director while some believe having two people serve in these roles might enhance the ability and potential of an apst to be part of the presidents inner circle others believe the potential for conflict between the two is high 45 some of these same arguments have been made regarding the option of having one appointee focus on science and another on technology in this case the concerns expressed by some in the technology community are about the potential conflict that might occur between presidential appointee focused on technology and the ostp director46 another challenge in implementing this option is that ostps budget and staff are limited two senior officials with their associated staff may be more than can be supported given these limitations possible congressional options are to request the president to appoint an apst potentially early in the administration designate th ostp director as having cabinet rank status or enhance the ostp directors eop designation w ithin the eop so that they have more political stature and authority continued george bush washington dc national

ostp associate directors are senateconfirmed presidential appointees who focus on specific areas of science and technology policy according to the act that established ostp pl 94282 ostp can have more than four associate dire ctors during the clinton administration four associate directors focused on the following issues science technology environment and national security and international affairs the bush administration reduced the number of ostp associate directors to twoone focused on science and the other on technologyand added the title of deputy director for each 47 as historical illustration the carter administration had three associate directors focused on the issue areas of national security international and space affairs human resources and social and economic services and natural resources and commercial services48 some members of congress have expressed an interest in specifying the issue focus of ostp associate directors or the assistant directors w ho report to them for example in its report srept 110124 on the departments of commerce and justice science and related agencies appropriations bill 2008 s 1745 the senate committee on appropriations recommended ostp create an associate director for earth science and application position to coordinate all federal efforts to better understand and predict changes in the earths climate and oceans49 the national nanotechnology initiative nni amendments act of 2008 hr 5940 s 3274 would require the ostp director to designate an associate director as the coordinator for societal dimensions with the

assistant director the duty of managing committee focused on science technology engineering and mathematics stem education ostp staff indicated that only two ostp associate directors were appointed because dr marburger believed that four associate directors were unnecessary to manage maximum of 40 staff51 some in the science and technology community however have expressed concerns that an

expert staff such as those employed at omb55 additional funding these reports state would provide ostp with sufficient staff and the ability to conduct special analyses on emerging issues bush administration ostp staff contended that suff icient longterm scientific and technical staff to respond to the presidents scientific and technical information and analysis needs was available at ostp and at federal agencies they believed for example that ostp staff was sufficient even when staffing is generally at its lowest point during presidential transitions56 should congress wish to enhance

review directives prd71 were issued the prds served as the basis for gathering information and policy options for the president president clinton then had this information available as he developed eight presidential decision directives pdd establishing new policy72 according to ostp the bush administration took different approach inst ead issuing executive orders or executive memoranda following nstc deliberations instead of directives73 when asked about issues such as these ostp director marburger indicated that federal agencies are tasked with these issues and that ostp already interacts with other eop agencies further stated dr marburger existing interagency coordination efforts are sufficient and the federal agencies that develop and fund those programs should take leadership role in coordinating activities74 some in the st community however believe this puts st in supportive role regardless of the issue rather than exerting the more prominent influence they believe st should have on public policy in some situations75

scientific and technical agency leadership that did not support the administration s views ostp director marburger stated that such allegations are sweeping generalizations based on patchwork of disjointed facts and accusations that reach conclusions that are wrong and misleading77 policymakers responded to concerns about bush administration involvement in the communication of scientific and technical information by federal agency scientists and engineers in several ways the america competes act pl 11069 1009 directs ostp to develop an overarching set of principles to ensure the communication and open exchange of data by federal scientists and engineers on may 28 2008 in response to this requirement ostp sent memorandum to federal agencies that sponsor research the memorandum provides guidance and the following core principle for communicati on of the results of scientific research conducted by scientists employed by federal civilian agencies robust and open communication of scientific information is critical not only for advancing science but also for ensuring that society is informed and provided with objective and factual information to make sound decisions accordingly the federal government is committed to culture of scientific openness that fosters and protects the open exchange of ideas data and information to the scientific community policymakers and the public 78 the memorandum also indicates that nasa s science communications policy should be model for other federal agencies79 the nasa policy states that in keeping with the desire for culture of openness nasa employees may consistent with this policy speak to the press and the public about their work exceptions exist for privileged and other controlled information members of congress also introduced hr 985 the whistleblower protection enhancement act of 2007 this act would enhance existing whistleblower protections for all federal employees including extending protection to sciencebased agency staff the bill would do so by including as part of the definition of abuse of authority any action that compromises the validity or accuracy of federally funded research and analysis and the dissemination of false or misleading scientific medical or technical information 80 some st policy advocacy groups have proposed scientific communication policy changes for the next administration81 among these proposals are that an executive order be issued requiring federal agency leadership to monitor scientific in tegrity within their agency and submit an annual report to ostp with their observations and actions other proposed actions are reversing 77 see for example ostp statement by president bushs science adviser and director of the office of science and technology

in the st policy community believe that pcast does not have the stature and influence it once had and pcast focuses now on narrower set of issues less likely to be of presidentiallevel interest 86 for example they state that while president george hw bush held the first pcast meeting at camp david and participated in pcast meetings presidents clinton and george w bush only met occasionally for short periods of time with the pcast chair or committee members as federal advisory committee the pcast is unusual in that the executive order creating it states it will be cochaired by the ostp director and one of its members as opposed to having an independent chair not directly associated with the administration most federal advisory committees do not have administration staff as members of their committees or as chairs if administration staff are included as part of the advisory committee it is generally in an exofficio role eg national science board the inclusion of the ostp director as both member and co chair may reduce pcasts ability to provide independent thinking to the white house and may place the ostp director in an awkward positi on if pcast members disagree with white house policy the bush administration ostp staff countered that some of the more narrowly focused topics on which pcast has written reports were in response to congressional requirements for presidentiallevel commission to examine an issue the ostp staff also asserted that the degree 82 executive order 13422 further amendment to executive order 12866 on regulatory planning and review 72

influence of pcast reports does not differ that much from the previous administration87 some st policy organizations have suggested strengthening pcast by broadening its mandate explicitly including national and homeland security issues enhancing its independence and increasing its staff significantly88 these suggestions include recommendations to make the chair of pcast solely one of its members prov iding all members with security clearances and appointing them to staggering and overlapping terms unrelated to presidential and congressional election cycles the st community also suggests that the number of presidential advisory committees be increased for example some in the community propose advisory committees focused on specific issues of st policy issues such as federalstate science and technology council to enhance dialogue with the states particularly on stem education 89 the primary challenges to implementing this recommendation are cost and federal advisory committee act pl 92463 requirements regarding justification of any new advisory committee membership and ethics rules including financial disclosure that may make it challenging to recruit committee members90 other options are to commission nonfederal advisory committees such as those of the national academies91 to address shortterm topics of interest

regular authorization and appropriation process and introduces issuespecific bills that identify actions and issues on which members of congress believe ostp should focus an alternative is for congress to increase the intensity of its evaluation by holding oversight hearings on ostp or by amending ostps authorization statute in evaluating various policy options it may be im portant to consider whether the influence of the ostp director within the eop depends more on personal relationship with the president or on legislated action another factor may be the degree to which the president believes st advice should be an important factor in decision making these options and issues are discussed in more depth below g3g149g149g152g160g561g18g155g142g156g146g141g142g151g157g561g3g158g157g152g151g152g150g162g561g17g159g142g155g561g17g21g22g18g561 given ostps presence within the eop one option is for congress to allow the president to manage ostp as he or she wishes the president with senate confirmation would continue to appoint the ostp director and associate directors determine ostps policy agenda and organize the management of the office the president could also continue to use executive orders to manage other activities such as the formation of nstc and pcast 92 some members of congress may believe that changes need to be made in ostp operations others may believe that taking legislative action regarding ostp would be neither efficient nor effective given its presence in the eop and the nature of its activities as described in this report ostp and its affiliated organizations have constantly evolved responding to the changing needs of the administration and societal needs as well as new scientific and technical challenges and opportunities this may be appropriate given the separation of powers between the legislative and executive branches inherent in the us constitution

and if so whether fulltime adviser or presidential advisory committee is needed within the eop 93 presidents and their senior advisers may believe that most of their decisions are based on issues of value or value conflicts so that their need for st knowledge is very general they may feel requirement for st adviser or related presidential advisory committee to provide opinion or build support for white house decisions from presidential perspective if the st adviser or presidential advisory committee is not committed to the presidents agenda and is not willing to represent the administrations perspective the president may believe that highlevel st advice will provide more harm than 92 note that other organizations besides ostp nstc and pcast provide analysis and advice to the white house congress and federal agencies for example congress often asks that the national academy of sciences or the national science board provide this guidance for more information on these organizations and others crs report rl34454 science and technology policymaking primer by deborah d stine for discussion of this issue see roger pielke jr who has the ear of the president nature 450347348 november 15

the st community may fear this will lead to the politicization of st and subvert the st advisers ability to provide independent advice historical review of presidential st activities since the fd roosevelt administration illustrates that presidential st adviser or advisory committee may be placed in challenging position when difference in opinion exists between the president and the majority of the st community the result may be dismissal or marginalization of st consideration from the white house inner circle 94 on the other hand an st adviser who understands these sensitivities may be an asset to the administration providing confidential advice privately and speaking authoritatively on st related issues for the administration publically the st adviser can help assess st related departments and agencies resolve competing claims among these agencies coordinate the efforts of rd agencies and the external st community in national emergencies and anticipate new and emerging st issues in addition presidential advisory committees provide an ongoing ability to engage the st community each time th president feels the need for external advice 95 an alternative approach is making ostp an independent agency rather than an agency of the eop this might lead to an ostp that is more independent and provide more optimal distance between the president and the ostp director congress might also benefit from having centralized source of independent st advice and more control over ostps interagency coordination and other activities if ostp were longer part of the eop however it might also be viewed as sufficiently distant from presidential decisions that neither the administration or federal agencies would be sufficiently responsive to its advice or requests the st community objected when somewhat similar action was taken by president nixon when he moved the precursor to ostp from the eop to nsf

congress currently holds hearings as part of the presidential appointee confirmation process part of the appropriation process and on issues of interest to given committee through the hearing process and other legislative actions such as introducing bills passing laws and writing related report language congress provides direction and guidance to ostp one challenge in undertaking these actions is that ostp might receive overlapping or conflicting instructions resolving these conflicts may prov to be difficult additionally congress may mandate actions taken by ostp but not provide additional funding in such cases ostp may be forced to choose between prioritizing the general statutory activities or specifically mandated priorities due to limited funding

issue of concern establishing such specific priorities and personnel in statute would limit agency discretion potentially reducing its ability to address other parts of its statutory mission while securing focus on specified topics in addition it may become challenging to respond to new and emerging st topics for example nanotechnology was not an issue during the reagan administration while it is an issue today g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g17g153g157g146g152g151g561g5g152g151g156g146g141g142g155g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 when policymakers consider these and other options one important factor is that the influence of the ostp director apst science adviser or technology adviser regardless of their title likely depends on the relationship between whomever is appointed to that position and the president while one president may decide to rely heavily on the advice of such an office another may decide to rely only minimally upon it another factor for congress to weigh may be th degree to which the president or other top eop officials generally are interested in st policy and the degree to which they believe st advice should be an important factor in their decision making officials who do not consider st an important factor are less likely to solicit input from the st adviser related issue is the degree to which the president believes that the role of an st adviser is to support and express the views of the administration versus to provide independent advice and judgment if the president prefers st policy adviser who views their role as primarily supporting the administrations perspective there may be fundamental differences between the st adviser and the st communityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34736 g561
