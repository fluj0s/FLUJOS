this approvals paper contains description of all significant accounting regulatory tax credit market and operational risks economic benefit the economic benefit of the transaction is derived from the fact that uklp1s pretax return from the subscriber interest represents an abovelibor return on the investment made though the majority of the income received by uklp1 will have been subject to us withholding tax at 30 it is not expected to be subject to further taxation in luxembourg bbt achieves an effective funding rate of 40 bps below libor which equates to split between barclays and bbt on

uklp2 on the same terms the retirement agreement under the retirement agreement uklp1 will agree to retire in 3 years time or earlier on i 1 business days notice by barclays if bbt were to become insolvent or the security interest in the collateral defined below is determined to be invalidly perfected ii 5 business days notice by barclays iii or 5 20 business days notice by bbt for formula price the retirement amount equal to the aggregate of i uklp1s initial capital contribution to uklp2 ie 4000m ii interest linked to the 3year usd swap rate accruing on monthly basis and iii any interest on any shortfall in expected distributions on the subscriber interest minus the aggregate of i partnership distributions made in respect of the subscriber interest ii breakage amount should the transaction be unwound by barclays within 90 days of closing and iii any interest on any excess in expected distributions on the subscriber interest 229 if barclays retires from uklp2 on 5 business days notice then bbt will have the option to borrow an amount equal to the retirement amount from uklp1 for term of 55 calendar days at preagreed rate the retirement loan after the first 25 calendar days the rate on the retirement loan will increase by spread which will economically incentivise bbt to redeem the retirement loan uklp1 will retain the collateral package set out in 2210 during this period 2210 bbt will collateralise the retirement agreement by pledging 4000m of collateral the collateral to uklp1 in support of its obligation to pay the retirement amount the collateral is expected to comprise of real estate and vehicle loans 2211 uklp1 will pledge the subscriber interest in favour of bbt in support of its delivery obligations under the retirement agreement 2212 uklp2 will lend 5318m the bbtsub3 loan to bbtsub3 the bbtsub3 loan will have 3year term and will carry fixed monthly interest equal to the 3year usd swap rate at issue 2213 bbt will enter into 3year par break interest rate swap with notional of 4000m the irs with barclays under which bbt will pay 1month usd libor and receive 3year usd swap rate on monthly basis 23 key periodic flows 231 uklp2 will receive monthly payments of usd interest on the bbtsub3 loan net of 30 us withholding tax 232 uklp2 will pay out the majority of its income to uklp1 as monthly partnership distributions on the subscriber interest uklp2s remaining profits will be distributed to bbtsub1 and bbtsub2 as holders of the uklp2 gp interest and the uklp2 lp interest respectively 6 233 uklp1 will pay out the majority of its income to lux holdco as monthly partnership distributions on the uklp1 lp interest 234 lux holdco will use all cash received to subscribe for further trust units and the trust will lend the money interestfree back to lux holdco the trust loans 235 lux holdco will place the cash received from the trust loans on deposit with external financial institutions the external usd deposits 236 barclays will borrow enough us dollars to satisfy its monthly obligations under the irs the barclays external borrowing from external sources 237 barclays will receive 1month usd libor and will pay bbt 3year usd swap rate under the irs 238 barclays will pay 1month usd libor on its funding 24 hedging arrangements 241 barclays will designate the usd deposits defined in appendix 1 and barclays external borrowing as functional currency hedge of the investment in the us dollar functional currency branch comprised of uk holdco and its subsidiaries at the solus level they will similarly be designated as foreign exchange hedge of barclays investment in uk holdco 25 maturityearly termination 251 on maturity expected to be after term of 3 years and assuming the retirement loan is not advanced the retirement agreement will complete uklp1 will receive the retirement amount from bbt uklp1 will retire from uklp2 bbt will be admitted to uklp2 the collateral will be returned to bbt the uklp1 portfolio will be liquidated uklp1 will be dissolved lux holdco and uk holdco will retain the funds in the form of usd assets lux holdco is expected to use the funds to seek alternative investment opportunities the irs will be terminated 7 3 economics and economic drivers 31 project knight will result in an enhanced return on lux holdcos indirect investment in uklp2 this is due to the fact that the pretax return on the subscriber interest is an abovelibor return on the investment made 32 though the majority of the income earned by lux holdco will have been subject to us withholding tax at rate of 30 it is not expected to be subject to further taxation in luxembourg 33 summary of the annual economics of the transaction is given in the tables below inputsbarclays

arises from the fact that it obtains sublibor funding on its borrowing this equates to benefit of 40 bps on 4000m ie 16m 4 tax analysis 41 luxembourg tax analysis 411 it is intended that the luxembourg tax treatment will be formally confirmed in rulings prior to the commencement of the transaction and this will be condition of approval 412 we have received an opinion from kpmg luxembourg confirming the proposed analysis for the transaction which is included as appendix 3 the key points of the analysis are as follows 8 corporate income tax 413 any income realised by uklp1 whether or not distributed to lux holdco or uk holdco should be tax exempt in luxembourg under luxembourg domestic principles 414 lux holdco should be fully taxable on the interest generated from the lux holdco portfolio and any interest earned on profits placed on deposit after deduction of management expenses capital duty 415 capital duty is currently payable on the creation of share capital at rate of 1 of the capital created 416 however capital duty should be limited to relatively immaterial amounts and in particular the asset contributions made by uk holdco for the lux holdco prefs should not be subject to capital duty due to the application of whole business contribution exemption see appendix 1 net wealth tax 417 net wealth tax is payable each year at rate equal to 05 of net assets 418 the uklp1 lp interest should be an exempt asset for net wealth tax purposes 419 net wealth tax on lux holdcos profits placed on deposit will be mitigated by means of the structure detailed in appendix 2 42 uk tax analysis corporation tax 421 the key points of the intended uk tax analysis are set out below and draft opinion from slaughter may confirming the analysis is attached at appendix 4 422 project knight will not require treasury consent or treasury notification 423 apportionment of the chargeable profits of any entity involved in the transaction should be required under uk cfc legislation 424 barclays should be able to deduct interest paid on the usd deposits and any net payments made under the irs for uk tax purposes 425 stamp duty should be payable in respect of the transaction 426 barclays will indemnify bbt for any uk tax liabilities arising to it from the arrangements but such liabilities are envisaged 9 5 tax risks 51 us tax risks 511 project knight does not involve barclays undertaking any direct us tax risks all us tax risks will be borne by the bbt group 512 sullivan cromwells us tax opinion confirming bbtsub3s requirement to withhold us tax on the interest paid in respect of the bbtsub3 loan is attached as appendix 5 sullivan cromwell have also confirmed that us withholding tax should be imposed on any amount due under the retirement agreement to the extent uklp1 provides properly completed irs form w8ben andor w8imy to bbt 52 luxembourg tax risks 521 as the transaction will be subject to rulings in luxembourg and this will be condition of approval it is not considered that any material luxembourg tax risks will exist 53 uk tax risks the following issues have been considered by slaughter and may in their opinion cfc 531 apportionment of the chargeable profits of any entity involved in the transaction should be required under uk cfc legislation 532 the ecj has confirmed in the case of cadbury schweppes that the uks cfc rules contravene eu law by constituting restriction on the freedom of establishment within the eu the ecj stated that such restriction would be justified only to the extent that it affects wholly artificial arrangements lux holdco will be validly established with genuine economic presence in luxembourg 533 in addition lux holdco is not expected to be subject to lower level of taxation in luxembourg as the local tax paid in luxembourg will be greater than 75 of the corresponding uk tax therefore lux holdco would not be expected to be cfc even in the absence of the cadbury schweppes decision 534 the government has recently proposed to amend the cfc rules following the ecj decision however it is not considered that the proposed changes go far enough to deal with the issues raised by cadbury schweppes we accordingly expect that there will be further changes required once the uk courts have considered the ecj decision which is due to take place later this year repatriation of profits 535 on an ultimate repatriation of the profits of lux holdco to the uk hmrc might seek to challenge the availability of credit for any underlying us withholding tax paid by the application of s804za icta 1988 accordingly it is intended that lux holdco will not repatriate profits to the uk in the form of dividends 10 13 fa 1996 23 sch 26 fa 2002 536 hmrc may contend that the usd deposits have an unallowable purpose and seek to deny deductions for debits arising in respect of interest paid on the usd deposits under 13 sch 9 fa 1996 537 as barclays would have accepted the usd deposits regardless of whether or not the transaction were to be entered into we believe that barclays cannot be said to accept the usd deposits with main purpose of securing tax advantage and that 13 cannot operate to deny relief in the above manner 538 similar arguments could be raised in respect of the irs under 23 however based on current interest rates there are expected to be nettaxable credits on the irs in 2007 and we accordingly consider this risk to be very low 6 disclosure 61 project knight is not disclosable in the uk 62 sullivan cromwells opinion confirming that the transaction is not reportable in the us is attached as appendix 5 7 accounting the accounting analysis is in the process of being agreed with finance an accounting opinion will be obtained from pwc before closing 71 ifrs analysis barclays consolidated accounting 711 full accounting analysis is given in appendix 6 summary of barclays consolidated position is given below 712 the usd deposits and barclays external borrowings will be accounted for in the usual way however sufficient borrowings to match the investment in the capital and reserves of uk holdco will be designated from time to time as fair value foreign currency hedge of the investment in uk holdco and its subsidiaries 713 the irs will be derivative for ias 39 purposes and will be carried at fair value through profit and loss 714 the combination of the acquisition of the subscriber interest and the retirement agreement will be accounted for as secured loan to bbt on the basis that the instruments were entered into at the same time and in contemplation of each other barclays will recognise its share of the gross income of uklp2 and its share of the withholding tax thereon as part of the tax charge in its consolidated profit and loss account 715 the uklp1 and lux holdco portfolios will be recognised as available for sale assets and income will be recognised using the effective interest method whilst changes in fair value will be taken through equity 11 716 for consolidation purposes it will be necessary to retranslate the dollar profit earned by lux holdco into sterling in order to achieve this the dollar result for each month will be converted to sterling at the month end rate this calculation will be performed by multiplying the dollar result for the month by the usdgbp exchange rate ie as opposed to dividing by the gbpusd exchange rate 717 in accordance with ias2145 the foreign exchange gains and losses recognised on the uk holdco prefs will not be taken to equity but will remain in profit and loss noting that the uk holdco prefs will not constitute part of the net investment in the us functional currency foreign operation because the 20 year redemption clause means that it cannot be said that settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future 72 us gaap barclays consolidated accounting analysis 721 the retirement agreement will not be derivative because it is not capable of net settlement 6 sfas 133 722 the acquisition of the subscriber interest plus the retirement agreement will not be equivalent to sale of the subscriber interest by the bbt group within the meaning of 6 sfas 140 in particular uklp1 will not be permitted to sell or pledge the subscriber interest without permission from bbt and bbt will be both entitled and required to purchase the subscriber interest under the terms of the retirement agreement accordingly the transaction will be accounted for as secured lending in the barclays group accounts 12 sfas 140 723 barclays will recognise the net distributions from uklp2 as interest on this secured lending ie it will not gross up for withholding tax 724 the irs will be derivative for sfas 133 purposes and will be carried at fair value bbt consolidated accounting analysis 725 bbt will consolidate bbtsub1 bbtsub2 bbtsub3 and ukpl2 for us gaap purposes 726 the combination of the issuance of the subscriber interest and the retirement agreement will be accounted for as borrowing by bbt secured by the subscriber interest 8 regulatory capital weighted risk assets consolidation 811 uk holdco lux holdco and uklp1 will form part of barclays consolidated regulatory group because barclays will own 20 of the votes in these entities 812 uklp2 will not form part of barclayss consolidated regulatory group due to the transfer of risks to bbt under the retirement agreement instead barclays will have an exposure to bbt which is weighted at 20 giving wras of 800m 12 813 the uklp1 lux holdco and trust portfolios are expected to be high grade us dollar denominated debt securities which attract risk weighting of 100 barclays will therefore have wras of 13m in respect of these holdings 814 the total wras marked in respect of the above exposures will be 813m it is expected that this number will be reduced significantly under basel 2 due to the collateral solus level 815 pursuant to the structure set out in appendix 1 barclays will have an exposure to bbt which is weighted at 20 giving wras of 800m 816 the 5m uk holdco ords will be deducted from the solus capital ratio ie 5m10 50m 817 the above treatments have been agreed with scm finance large exposures internal 818 absent the arrangement set out in appendix 1 barclays would have an internal large exposure of 4008m to uk holdco by virtue of the uk holdco prefs as described in appendix 1 barclays will mitigate 4000m of the internal large exposure in respect of the uk holdco prefs by having uklp1 in effect guarantee uk holdcos obligations to barclays with regards to the uk holdco prefs pursuant to cds 1 there will be right of set off between payments due under cds 1 and the call option external 819 the barclays group will mark an exposure to the bbt group equal to the maximum exposure of uklp1 to bbt under the retirement agreement ie 4000m 8110 finance have confirmed that based upon the 31 december 2006 numbers barclays will not need to seek approval from the fsa for an increase in the consolidated prenotification limit against bbt 8111 the barclays group will mark an exposure to the third party counterparties in respect of the lux holdco uklp1 and trust portfolios equal to 13m in the aggregate basel ii 8112 on introduction of basel ii it is understood that exposures to the uk integrated group will be treated as exempt 8113 as such barclays exposure to the 4008m uk holdco prefs will fall away being replaced by uk holdcos exposure to the 4007m lux holdco prefs 8114 cds 1 will fall away 8115 uklp1 will effectively guarantee lux holdcos obligations to uk holdco with regards to principal amount of the lux holdco prefs by entering into credit default swap cds 2 13 8116 barclays will assign the call option and the charge to uk holdco 8117 uk holdco will be entitled to offset any amounts due by uk holdco under the call option against any amounts due to uk holdco under cds 2 in respect of the lux holdco prefs 8118 upon introduction of basel ii the mitigation operates in the same way in that the substantive effect of the arrangements is that uk holdco never has an economic exposure to the performance of lux holdco this is because in all circumstances in which an amount becomes due under cds 2 the call option is accelerated and there is an offset between the amounts due to uk holdco under the cds 2 and the call option strike price payable by uk holdco therefore notwithstanding that uklp1 is not considered an eligible guarantor under basel ii in respect of the unfunded credit derivative constituted by cds 2 uk holdcos only exposure is to the performance of bbt under the retirement agreement 9 credit market risk 91 credit analysis of the underlying assets and security arrangements will be conducted in the normal way and approved by gfrm prior to closing 92 consistent with the accounting treatment set out in appendix 6 barclays will treat the subscriber interest together with the retirement agreement as secured loan to the bbt group the loan will therefore give rise to credit exposure equal to the retirement amount bbt is expected to pledge the collateral in support of its obligations under the retirement agreement ie satisfaction of the retirement amount 10 provision 101 it is proposed that pretax provision of 40 of the tax on the cfc apportionment be applied to the transaction 11 client engagement 111 morris marley treasurer ken daniels executive vice president hal johnson executive vice president margaret fletcher senior vice president john foreman senior vice president howard hudson associate general counsel john watson executive vice president mark livingston senior vice president ken fitchett senior vice president kathy coffield assistance vice president and melodye tomlin senior vice president of bbt have been engaged in the origination process in addition the ceo john allison has approved in principle project knight 112 the deal will be submitted for approval to the board of directors of bbt and is expected to take place on 20 february 2007 113 scm will obtain further confirmation from appropriate senior personnel within the bbt organisation but outside of the deal team that the transaction has been approved by senior management within the bbt organisation 12 materiality of deal with counterparty 121 as result of the transaction the bbt group is expected to raise net funding of 4000m and receive pretax enhancements of approximately 16m per annum 14 122 overall the bbt group will be taxed on its economic return from the transaction and as such the tax charge in its consolidated accounts will increase project knight should not however materially impact the effective federal tax rate of bbt as bbt will be subject to us federal income tax equal to 35 on the benefit generated from the transaction 123 based on the bbt financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2005 barclays investment in the subscriber interest and retirement agreement will increase the gross assets of bbt by approximately 366 ie 4000m109170m and gross liabilities by 408 ie 4000m98041m the pretax return generated from the transaction would increase the total profit before tax of bbt by approximately 065 16m2467m and increase their current federal income taxes payable by approximately 877 ie 56m638m in full year 124 in 2002 barclays entered into stars transaction with bbt which is due to mature in august 2007 pursuant to the stars transaction bbt raised net funding of 1500m and receives pretax enhancement of approximately 535m per year based on the bbt financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2005 the gross assets in respect of the stars transaction represented approximately 137 ie 1500m109170m of bbts total gross assets and the liabilities in respect of the stars transaction represented approximately 153 ie 1500m98041m of bbts total liabilities the additional foreign taxes paid pursuant to the stars transaction increased bbts foreign income taxes payable by approximately 97 ie 106m109m the ratio of federal to foreign taxes paid was 6841 for the year ended 31 december 2005 13 other 131 following the npso process recently undertaken for the set up of bcl it is not considered that further npso is required for this transaction 132 scm finance and luxembourg finance have agreed the respective responsibilities for reporting this transaction 133 based on the proposed product limit scm will need to agree an exception to the general tax risk framework for these transactions this will be taken forward separately and will be condition for approval
