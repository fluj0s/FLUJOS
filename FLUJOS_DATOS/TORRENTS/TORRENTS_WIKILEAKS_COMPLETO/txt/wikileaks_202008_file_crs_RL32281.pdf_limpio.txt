divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32281motor carrier safety oversight and reauthorization legislation summary the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa seeks to promote the safety of about 670000 fede rallyregistered truck and bus companies during the last three years fmcsa has focused much of its attention on security concerns associated with hazardous materials haz mat transportation congressional directives to audit the safety practices of new motor carriers seeking permanent operating authority and mexicandomiciled carriers entering the united states and the issuance of regulations seeking to improve the commercial drivers license cdl program and new hours of service requirements congre ss is considering legislation that would reauthorize various federal surface transpor tation programs including funding for the operation of the fmcsa and the various st ate motor carrier safety and cdl grants that it administers key questions being bated are what vel of funding should be authorized to continue these activities what programmatic or regulatory changes might improve truc k and bus safety although bout 4900 people die in roughly 420000 policereported crashes each year i nvolving large tr ucks various fatality and injury rates involving these vehicles have generally imp roved slowly but steadily ove r the long term numerous factors contribute to this trend including investment in safer equipment and drivers improved regulations and licensing procedures and the auditing and inspection work of some 10000 state and local enforcem ent officers and 1000 fmcsa employees fmcsas goal is to reduce the fatality rate of crashes involving large trucks to 165 fatalities per 100 million mile s of truck travel by 2008 fro m the latest measured rate of 23 reaching this goal would require one of largest decreases in this fatality rate ever obtained and would be difficult in vi ew of the improvement in rates already achieved the housepassed hr 3550 and th senatepassed s 1072 surface transportation reauthorization bills include similar pr oposals to enhance motor carrier safety these bills seek to strengthen the enforcement powers of the fmcsa authorize new grant program to improve state cdl efforts establish medical review board to provide advice on driver physical standards and continue funding for various state and federal informa tion systems and communication networks called cvisn that support sa fety and regulation of the industry the senate bill seeks to expedite fmcsas responses to past federal statut and congressional directives establish working group to improve the national cdl program and freeze current federal length limits of commercial motor vehicles operating on federalaid highways compared to s 1072 hr 3550 authorizes for fy20052009 slightly more funds for fmcsas adminis trative operations but less funds for mscap grants hr 3550 also authorizes substantially larg er program intended to encourage motorists to share the road safely with commercial drivers and vice versa both of these bills would author ize roughly the same amount of funds for various state safety grants and for cv isn this

primary federal agency seeking to promote truc k and bus safety fmcsas enforcement activities regulations and grants continue to receive much attention congress is considering legislation that would reauthorize various federal surface transportation programs including funding for the opera tion of the fmcsa and its various grant programs some of the key questions be ing debated are wh at level of funding should be authorized to continue fmcsa s activities what programmatic changes might be instituted to improve these activ ities and what regulatory actions might be implemented to further improve commercial vehicle safety congress is also continuing to conduct oversight regardin g the accomplishments of fmcsa and the challenges it faces the purpose of the report is twofold to provide background information useful in understanding the functions and operations of the fmcs and to analyze selected issues that are being considered in the debate over reauthoriz ation of the federal motor carrier safety program the re port considers fmcsa s mission key activities selected challenges and concerns and its current budget working knowledge of each of these topics is useful in analyzing the reauthorization issues of future funding and direction for the agency and the grants that it administers the report also presents highlights of the current reauthorization debate pertaining to funding for improvements in the commercial drivers license cdl program possible changes to truck size and weight limits in itiatives to improve fmcsas medical review and driver qua lification program efforts to reduce fmcsas regulatory backlog whether fede ral support of share the road activities to reduce passenger vehicle and truck cras hes should be continued or increased and how the program might be strengthened and opportunities to improve data and information systems critical to program imp lementation these issues are analyzed because they are the subject of congre

million miles of truck travel by 2008 as shown in table 1 improvements in normalized safety performance measures historically occur gradually over many years in the motorcarrier safety arena improvements in safety rates as measured by fa talities per 100million miles of truck travel are incremental in nature and ve averaged about 3 per year since 1996 the base year dot uses in calculating

of improvement that s not been sustained over time since 1975 and one that would be difficult to reasona bly expect based on historical rates of improvements and the progress in sa fety made in recent years nevertheless as discu ssed throughout this repor t there remain many opportun ities to further reduce death and injury associated with crashes involving commercial motor vehicles there are costs associated with each of these opportunitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32281crs5 8 during various hearings held during the first session of the 106th congress number of organizations including dots

major processes the commercial vehicle registration process nd the motor carrier safety improvement process mcsip which work in paralle l to identify motor carriers and hold them responsible for the safety of their operation the performance of unsafe carriers is improved through comprehensive system of identifica tion education awareness safety monitoring and treatment see httpwwwfmcsadotgovespañolprism_sp_mainhtmfmcsas programs also are substantially influenced by the funding levels and authorities specified in mcsia and the transportation equity act for the 21st

much of the research leading to revised safety regula tory and enforcement strategies fmcsa the newest of the dot moda l administrations is an evolving organization that faces numerous ch allenges for fy2004 fmcsa has an appropriation for about 1020 employees t only has fmcsa increased its staff size rapidly during the last few years but the agency partly in response to congressional directives has expanded the scope of its responsibilities and objectives during the last three years or so some 270 employees were added to its roster to enforce the safety regulations at the mexican border many new administrative support staff eg in the ar eas of contracts personnel and budget were added in order to allow the agency to become independent from the federal highway administration which housed motor carrier safety responsib ilities for manyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32281crs7 14 testimony of admiral james loy administrator transportation security administration us department of homeland security before the senate committee on commerce science and transportation september 9 2003 years adjusting to this rapid growth and incorporating new staff into new federal agency remains challenge as result of the events of september 11 2001 fmcsa implemented new securityoriented activities focusing on motor carriers transporting hazardous materials hazmats and providing guid ance and technical assistance regarding security measures with respect to the federal role in promoting the security of hazmat highway carriers the specific missions and objectives of the fmcsa as contrasted to those of the transportati on security agency of the department of homeland security have not been clearly delineated or formalized in memorandum of agreement moa or understanding w ith respect to the need for such an agreement admiral loy then administrator of the transportation security administration stated we cooperate extensively with dot and the modal administrations and value the degree of cooperation that we receive as we work together to secure the transportation systems we will continue to assess the need for moas for the future14 on the other hand given the role of the dhs at the border and given its role in promoting the curity of the highway transportation of hazardous materials and motor carriers in general more careful delineation of responsibilities opportunities fo r synergistic efforts nd identification of funding needs and capabilities might prove beneficial to both departments likewise the preparation for opening the southern border to allow mexican domiciled truck carriers to operate beyond the commercia l zone about 20 miles into the united states required the agency to issue several substantive rulemakings and to intensify outreach efforts to mexican enforcement officials drivers and bordering states if and when the border formally opens to allow substantially increased truck transportation beyond the commercial zone an intensified in spection and audit program targeting mexicandomiciled carriers is likely to continue for many years depending on the number of companies that actually engage in these operations congress has substantially added to fmcsas respons ibilities and thus to the challenges that the agency faces in mcsia and other statutes congress directed the agency to issue regulations that were intended to improve the state cdl programs and to revise the hoursof service regulations now that these regulations have been issued fmcsa faces the continuing challenge of ensuring that these requirements are properly implemented as discussed in appendix in mcsia congress also added new responsibilities and substantia l workload by requiring the fmcsa to conduct the new entrant safe ty assurance process new carrier audit and monitoring program any new respons ibilities and authorities specified in reauthorization statute would likely add to the management challenges facing the fmcsahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32281crs8

commercial vehicle safety programs the american trucking associations ata has noted support of the mcsap which has had an impact by improving truck condition the commerc ial drivers license cdl program has contributed by raising the bar for driv er entry into the industry and the implementation of voluntary drug testing by the industry followed by mandatory federal drug and alcohol sting program has also contributed in positive way18 however ata has stated to congress that dot has not yet established motor carrier safety advisory committee as was authorized in mcsia this organization has recommended that this advisory committee be required by statute and be authorized for minimum of at least five years recommended that congress direct the secretary of transportation to equitably apply and enforce laws and regulations designed to ensu re the safe condition of all regulated equipment including intermodal chassis and trailers recommended that fmcsa should improve its motor carrier compliance review targeting system and sought language directing the secretary to prioritize all federal driver and vehiclerelated research so that the majority of funds support research in

willhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32281crs11 increase operating costs decrease produc tivity or reduce driver income some groups assert that the rules were not design ed to reduce driver fatigue and thus fail to meet the requirements congress set for th is rule on the other hand many in the motor carrier i ndustry ge nerally support the changes made in the new hoursof service regulations especially when thes are compared to the changes originally proposed by fmcsa several years ago reauthorization legislation regarding funding for fmcsas programs and various safety issues as previously indicated tea21 includes authorization for the various motor carrier safety programs th at are conducted or overseen by the fmcsa the funding authority for these programs expired at the end of fy2003 and was extended for five months by pl 10888 through februa ry 2004 was extended for another two months through april 2004 by pl 108 202 and was extended for another two months through june 2004 by pl 108 224 congress continue s to debate the specifics of reauthorizati on bill that would set the funding level and scope and nature of various surface transportation programs for the next five to six years with respect to the federal role in motor carrier safety the reauthorization process has historically been used to accomplish several purposes to set new authorization levels for various fmcsa activities and grants to provide new policy directions regarding the federal role in commercial vehicle safety and to address various truck and bus safety concerns during hearings associated with the current reauthorization debate many issues have been raised these include how much money should be authorized for fmcsas operations and for the mcsap how much money might be authorized to help state cdl programs or more specifically to ensure that the states are able to pay for cdl program changes to m eet new requirements set by mcsia and fmcsa how could the information sy stem underpinning the cdl program be modernized and how much would that cost should federal tr uck size and weight standards be changed what might be done to address the regulatory backlog facing fmcsa and what new regulations if any might be pursued to further improve commercial motor vehicle safety how could the share the road program be improved to further reduce the frequency nd severity of truc kpassenger vehicle crashes how might mcsap enforcement strategies be changed to realize increased improvements in commercial motor vehicle safety how could the physical qualification standards and medical certification process for commercial drivers be improved what data and information system challenges does fmcsa face and how might these be met although it is beyond the scope of this report to analyze each of these issues in detail some insights into the scope and nature of each issue are presented below for each topic the key issue of concern is identified and several policy options are listed particular attention is given to how each issue is addressed in the two key surface transportation reauthorization bills s 1072 passed by the senate and hr 3550 as passed by the househttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32281crs12 20 us congress house committee on appropr iations departments of transportation and treasury and independent agencies appr opriations bill 2004 house report 108243 p 76 21 personal communication with fmcsa 2004funding of fmcsa and the grants it administers with respect to funding for the next r eauthorization cycle the key policy issue is what is the appropriate level of funding that will be authorized to pay for fmcsas administrativeoperations expenses and the motor carrier safety grants that it administers there are two aspects to this issue the existing administrative cap governing fmcsas administrative ex penses and the amount of funding for various fmcsa activities or programs administrative limitation of expenses mcsia pl 106159 specified that an amount equal to up to 1 3 of 1 of portion of the federal aid highway program could be used to finance fmcsas motor carrier safety administrativeoperations expe nses and research given the substantial growth in fmcsas staff primarily during the last few years to meet the inspection workload at the southern border and given new re sponsibilities and challenges that the agency faces staying under this limitation of contr act authority has proven difficult for the appropriators according to the hous appropriations committee this takedown mechanism has proven inflexible does not allow for coverage of fmcsas basic administrative expenses and does not allow the agency to respond to changing national needs20 fmcsa also maintains that the funding cap restricts its ability to conduct its assigned responsibilities although the cap originally was incorporated into the mcsia to limit fmcsas expenses the practical reality is that the administrative cap has been exceeded in recent years in fact this funding limitation was increased for fy2002 and fy2003 by general provision in the respective dot appropriation acts the tea21 extension acts effectively eliminated the administrative takedown for fmcsas appropriation for the first nine months of fy2004 and substituted contract authority for administrative expenses21 as part of the reauthorization proce ss it is likely that the administrative limitation or cap will be replaced by sp ecific amount of funds authorized for fmcsas administrativeoperations expenses in the senatepassed reauthorization bill the current administrative limitation or cap is eliminated and as shown in table 3 the following amounts of fundi ng authority are specified httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32281crs13 table 3 authorized funding

made in the reauthorization process at least from the vantage point of the states receiving federal grants is how much money will be authorized to promote commercial motor vehicle safety many in industry and in th enforcement community and the safety community at large favor increasing fede ral funding to better address motor carrier safety challenges for example the commercial vehicle safety alliance cvsaan international asso ciation of state provincia l and federa l truck and bus law enforcement agencies along with re presentatives from industry in the united states canada and mexicoseeks among its various objectives increased funds for several safety activities that will impact state programs this organization seeks additional funds to improve the effectiveness and effici ency of state motor carrier safety programs eg to improve training of local enforcement officers conducting enforcement to pilot test improved enforcement and compliance strategies and to strengthen the cdl program22 in contrast industry support for increased funding varies with some who assert that there is an adequate level of enfor cement already while others seek increased enforcement against noncompliant motor carriers and drivers improvements in the comme rcial drivers license cdl program and other dr iver licensing issues states issue drivers licenses for operato rs of commercial bus and trucks to avoid losing portion of their federal hi ghway funds states must follow specified federal minimum standards regarding numer ous aspects of the licensing process including testing of drivers checking of r ecords and disqualification of drivers the cdl regulations are intended to ensure that commercial drivers meet certain requirements for example cdl drivers must have only one license at time pass the skills and knowledge test requirements necessary to obt ain cdl and be subject to at least uniform set of disqualification penalties for specified serious traffic safety violations with respect to fe derallyfunded cdl activitie s key issue that congress is considering is how much mone should be authorized to help the states improve their commercial licensing programs during the last five years various re ports and audits have identified various problems with some state cdl activities and have set forth numerous recommendations to improve the administration and implementation of these activities for example concerns have been expressed that some states were not rigorously adhering to all of the federa l standards were not always carefully monitoring their programs and were not timely transmitting conviction notices of violations that can affect th status of drivers cdl partly in response to the concerns and recommendations raised congress started to substantially increase funding to improve the cdl program in cluding funds authorized in tea21 section 31106 and other appropriate d monies the fmcsas recent funding for cdl enhancement activities is as follows 11 million for fy2001 15 llion for fy2002 and 173 million in the supplemental fy2002 appropriations slightly lesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32281crs15 23 written communications from fmcsa 2003 24 beyond the 1 million per year provided for driver improvement activities 25 information on fmcsa regulations can be found at httpwwwfmcsadotgovrulesregsfmcsrhomehtm 26 state licensing officials want to ensure that the information on any driver license is correct cannot easily be forged and is based on information obtained from legally valid documents many licensing officials want to ensure that any licensed driver has license from only one state at time each driver has only one driving record and states can readily exchange information as necessary this propos to establish one driver one record one license system for all drivers one modeled af ter the cdl has been discussed for years to implement such proposal would require substantial changes to the driver licensing system in each of the states legislation was introduced in the 107th congress to encourage the states to implement steps to improve the security of licenses by preventing the manufacture distribution marketing sale procurement or use of altered or counterfeit drivers licenses and to establish the driver record information verifi cation system which is intended to provide states with instant and reliable access to driver licensing and record information for variety of purposes it remains uncertain especially given many other safety priorities whether be new funds will be made available to substantially improve state driver licensing activities pertaining to the noncommercial driverthan 11 million for fy2003 and 22 million appropriated for fy2004 and similar amount reque sted in fy200523 these funds are used for many purposes including to correct deficiencies or make improvements in state cdl programs and to reduce fraud in the cdl application proce ss not all of thes funds were provided directly to the states as grants but some funds were used to support contracts and cooperative agreements intended to result in products useful to all of the states or to help fmcsa conduct its cdl responsibilities these f unds were appropriated to fmcsa on yeartoyear basis partly because tea21 does not provide separate contract authority for speci fied cdl improvement program24 in order to improve cdl efforts and to meet the cdl programmatic requirements specified in the motor ca rrier safety act of 1999 pl 106159 as well as the fmcsa regulations issued pursuant to that act the states have requested continued financial assistance from the fmcsa25 many in the driver licensing community also seek to improve the security and accuracy of both commercial and noncommercial driver licenses26 as shown in tables 3 and 4 the senatepassed bill as well as the housepassed bill authorize the following amounts for cdl and driver imp rovement program grants 22 million for fy2005 23 million each for fy2006 and fy20 07 24 million for fy2008 and 25 million for fy2009 the administrations reauthorization proposal recommended iden tical amounts for thes years fmcsa seeks to use these funds to improve state control and oversight of licensing agencies and testing facilities operated by third pa rties nonstate employees develop management control practices to detect and prevent fraudulent testing and licensing support state efforts to conduct verification of information regarding social security numbers and information pertaining to the bureau for citizenship and immigrationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32281crs16 27 annette sandberg prepared statement before the senate committee on commerce science and transportation june 10 2003 services for cdl holders and maintain the central depository of information regarding mexican and canadian driver convictions in the united states27 these funds would be made available to the fm csa and the states on contractauthority basis thus these monies would be made available to the states unless otherwise reduced by an obligation limitation or other mechanism as part of subsequent legislative act given the strong support for improvi ng the cdl program among many in industry the enforcement community and dr iver licensing agencies there does not appear to be any substantive opposition to creation of separa grant program to assist state and federal efforts to improve the cdl program but some critics could question whether it is necessary for the fe deral highway trust fund to continue to help finance efforts to improve state cd l programs when state issues cdl or renews cdl that state typically collects fee on the other hand advocates of fede ral support to accelerate improvements in state cdl programs point out 1 dependi ng on state law or practice it may not be possible to channel these license fees back into states cdl or driverlicensing program 2 the federal gran t may indirectly help reduce costs to individuals paying cdl license fees and 3 the federal grant helps improve the uniformity and quality of the overall nati onal cdl program modernization of commercial drivers licensing information systems cdlis closely related to the previous topic is the issue of whether the commercial drivers licensing information systems cdl is which is the backbone of the cdl program should be modernized with fede ral funds the american association of motor vehicle administrators aamva owns the cdlis programming code and owns and operates aamvanet the network over which cd lis is transmitted this system links the states with each other and with central data pointer system and enables the exchange of information about commercial drivers the system was developed in the late 1980s to help implement the requi rements of the commercial motor vehicle safety act of 1986 and subse quent acts that affect the licensing of commercial drivers there is support am ong many of the state motor vehicle administrators for modernizing the cdlis this interest is driven in part by advances in computer technologies and information systems increased security concerns pertaining to driver licenses new requirements that congress and fmcsa have imposed on state cdl programs as well as interest in using an improved cdlis to be an evolutionary platform fo r an alldriver co mmercial as well as non commercial operator pointer system the proposed modernization has several components including reconfiguring cdlis using modern databa tools and improving the network infrastructure to ensure data security according to aamva in addition to making neededhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32281crs17 28 written communication from aamva 2003 29 according to the fhwa federal weight limits apply only to the interstates but federal length and width restrictions apply to both th interstates and set of roads called primary highways which the states designate as be ing capable of handling commercial vehicles the interstates and the primary highways constitute the national network of highways 30 httpwwwhousegovtransportation from hearings held on july 9 2002improvements to ensure that cdlis retains system integrity and usefulness such changes would enable better handling of the re quirements of an all driver pointer file should that system be implemented in th future total costs for development of cdl ii modernization of the cdlis are estimated by the aamva at 362 million to be allocated during the next six fiscal years28 the modernization of cdlis is only one of many objectives that might be addressed with the monies authorized fro m the separate fundi ng provision intended to improve the cdl program that is proposed in both the senate and the house passed versions of the bill as this provision is now crafted there appears to be some flexibility for either the fmcsa or for the state licensing administrators with fmcsa approval to use some of the funds authorized to begin the modernization of cdlis thus it becomes question of pr iorities as to if when and to what extent the cdlis might be modern ized using federal funds hr 3550 at section 4125 entitled commerc ial drivers license information system modernization directs the dot secretary to publish comprehensive national plandevelope d in consultation with repres entatives of the motor carrier industry state safety enforcement agencies and state licensing agenciesto modernize the cdlis the secretary is authorized to issue grants to help states improve their cdlis in manner that is consistent with the national plan that bill authorizes 6 million per year for this activity for fy2005fy2009 the senate bill does not set aside specific amount of funds for cdlis modernization but emphasizes that the secretary shall give pr iority to the use of cdl grant funds to achieve compliance with the requi rements of mcsia truck size and weight standards should current truck size and weight limits be changed should the current limits be extended to cover the national highway system federal and state regulations and laws affect truck size and weight limitations29 as detailed on the hearing briefing web page of the house transportation and infrastructure committee the regulations have important economic consequences because trucking accounts for fourfifths of expenditures on freight transportation in the united states and trucking costs are influenced by truck size and weight size and weight limits have significant impact upon highway construction and maintenance costs and the convenience and safety of highway travel the regulations affect international commer ce as well because the us limits differ from those of canada and mexico and because containers shipped in international trade often are not consistent with us regulations30httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32281crs18 31 statement of ata and aar june 25 2003 32 httpwwwcommercesenategovnewsroomprintablecfmid205587 33 see previous section of report dealing with concerns that have been expressed regarding fmcsathe american trucking associations and the association of american railroads have agreed to support conti nuation of the existing federal statutory provisions pertaining to truck weight and size specifications31 in its reauthorization proposal the administration did not propose to change existing federal truck size and weight specifications in contrast to this position some seek to extend the current federal truck size nd weight regulations to vehi cles operating on the national highway system questions of safety economic competitiveness and productivity of the motor carrier industry highway maintenance costs and states rights immediately arise when truck size and weight issues are debated many believe that current size and weight limits specified in federal law will not be changed as result of the reauthorization process given the contentiousness of the issue they point out that there is likely to be consensus on any comprehensive or far reaching proposal to change the status quo the senate bill however proposes that with certain exceptions and limitations state may not prescribe or enforce regulation of commerce that allows operation on any segment of the national highway syst em including the interstate system of restricted propertycarrying unit any tr ailer semitrailer container or other property carrying unit that is longer than 53 feet unless that ope ration is detailed on list to be published by the secretary thus this bill according to the committee would have the impact of freezing current length limits of motor vehicles operating on federalaid high ways taking away states authority to set length standards of vehicles on roads that are part of the 150000 mile national highway system32 some in industry oppose this provision in fact some want less restrictive existing standards to govern truck size and weight limitations the house bill does not propose to change federal truck size and weight limits new regulations nd the regulatory nd reporting backlog much of fmcsas substantive regulatory agenda at least for the last 15 or so years has been set by congress or has b een prompted by requests for rulemaking on various subjects or court challenges or decisions on several occasions various members of congress as well as many in terest groups have voiced concerns about the limited progress or lack thereof in so cases that fmcsa or its predecessor made in responding to some cong ressional directiv or requests33 for example critics point out that the fmcsa or its predecessor has frequently not met congressional deadlines for studies and new sa fety regulations pertaining to variety of areas on the other hand fmcsa points to bstantial number of important final rulemakings many of which were required by congress th at have been issued during the last two or three years for example during the last few years fmcsa has issued substantially revi

consistent funding source for rulemaking causes starts and stops in process that requires consistent level of effort for timely completion of new rules and their supporting analyses36 in recent budgets the agency has asked for dedicat ed funding to improve its rulemaking capabilities and medical review and cer tification program about 94 million is now included within the base ope rations account for this activity the senate bill would impose financial penalty on fmcsa if it did not make steady progress in issuing final regulatory decisions and delivering other requested reports to congress if specified num ber of backlogged regulatory actions or studies are not completed the bill requires that 3 million year for up to three years be transferred out of fmcs as administrative account fu rther the bill provides that these transferred funds would be used to pay mcsap officers to conduct additional compliance reviews it remains uncertain exactly what impact such transfer might have on encouraging the agency to issue fi nal regulations or liver requested reports by date certain progress on issuing regu lations is partly dependent on approval from entities such as the office of management and budget and the office of the secretary beyond the control of fmcsa the house bill does not address the issue of regulatory backlog both bills how ever would require fmcsa to conduct new rulemaking activities to implement various responsibilities httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32281crs20 37 during the last few years prior to fy2003 fmsca reports that it has allocated roughly 300000 to 750000 on sharethe road activities from its appropriation the amount spent by mcsap states is unknown but is believed to be small amount in fy2003 the agency did not use any funds from its appropriation for sharetheroad activities but used 500000 transferred from nhtsa for this purpose 38 peter hurst prepared statement of the co mmercial vehicle safety alliance before the senate committee on commerce science and transportation june 10 2003share the road issues almost all of fmcsas appropriati on for its administrative or operating program probably 99 or more is focused on activities that are intended to improve the safety of the commercial carrier driver or vehicle likewise almost all of the mcsap funds are allocated towards educa tional activities or forcement aimed at the safety of the commercial driver or the commercial vehicle37 given the important role that operators of passe nger vehicles play in ma ny commercial vehicle large truck and bus crashes it is worthwhile to ask should increased mcsap or fmcsa administrative funds be used to enhance public education efforts and state and local enforcement activities intended to reduce the role that passenger car drivers play in commercial vehicle crashes does the legislative basis of mcsap need to be changed to allow or ensure that more comprehensive approach is pursued so that enforcement resources are more appropriate ly allocated to all causes of crashes involving commercial vehicles some state law enforcement officials would favor the increased use of mcsap funds to enhance enforcement against ll passenger and comme rcial drivers who adversely affect commercial vehicle safety some favor this change provided that the activity is conducted under the supervision of states lead mcsap agency which oversees the entire state program and manages funds and that accountability is ensured for resources used to promote tr uck or bus safety many state mcsap managers first want to ensure that there are sufficient funds available to fund the core mcsap some without traffic enforcemen t authority may be reluctant to share limited mcsap funds with polic ing authorities who are able to pursue passenger or noncommercial vehicles advers ely affecting commercial mo tor vehicle safety with respect to this issue the commercial vehicle safety alliance recommended traffic enforcement against the passenger car around trucks is something that should be tested in pilot program to sure uniform collection of violation data and provide way to measure its effectiveness we suggest that this pilot program be undertaken in conjunction with the national highway traffic safety administration38 however the ata maintains that strong visible speed enforcement aimed at commercial vehicle drivers as well as other motorists needs to take on much greater role in the mcsap pr ogram ata asserts additionally since speeding and other unsafe driving behaviors of non commercial drivers play an even greater role in truckinvolved crashes than do the actions of the commercial motor vehicle driver the mcsap program musthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32281crs21 39 douglas g duncan prepared statement of the american trucking associations 40 transport topics august 4 20036also include traffic enforcement efforts aimed at unsafe motorist behavior this funding should be in addition to the money provided for traditional mcsap enforcement activities39 likewise according to ata president bill graves if we all insist on increased visible traffic enforcement for cars and truc ks especially for speeders then we will continue to see the numbers move in the right direction40 on the other hand there are some that would consider set aside and dedicated program to be too much federal interference in stat allocation of resources although the share the road progra m has been supported by many safety organizations some have stioned its effectiveness the current national public information and educationa l program is generally not underpinned by strong enforcement component conducted simulta neously by each state congress is considering ways to improve or redesign current federal efforts to reduce the role of passengervehicle drivers in crashes involving large trucks or buses both the senate passed bill and the housepa ssed bill would allow states to use mcsap funds to pay for the enforcement of traffic safety laws and regulations against passenger vehicle operators when necessary to promote th safe operation of commercial motor vehicles but in neither bill as part of the core mcsap is there money set aside to ensure that state mcsap officers use fe deral funds to issue traffic violations to noncommercial vehicle drivers who adversely affect the sa fety of commercial motor carriers under both bills it would be left up to mcsap agencies with perhaps some fmcsa encouragement to decide the amount of mcsap funds that would be used to enforce traffic safety regulations affecting commercial vehicle eg whether or not to use mcsap funds to pay fo r activities in whic h the noncommercial motorist is cited for failing to yield righ t of way or for aggr essively driving around commercial truck or bus operator the senate bill authorizes increased funding for the public information or educational component of the share the road program more specifically for fy2004 the bill authorizes 250000 for fmcs as share the road activities and 750000 for nhtsas work in this area in tea21 congress set aside 500000 per year to ensure that funds were spen t on helping to educate the public on how to share the road with commercial carriers s 1072 also allows the use of mcsap funds to pay for the enforcement of state tr affic regulations designed to promote the safe operation of commercial motor vehi cles including against operators of noncommercial motor vehicles when nece ssary to promote the safe operation of commercial motor vehicles hr 3550 differs from the senate bill in several ways the house bill requires each of the mcsap states to conduct co mprehensive and highly visible traffic enforcement and commercial vehicle enforcement inspection programs at high risk locations under more specified conditions the house bill also allows mcsap funds to be used to pay for the enforcem ent of state traffic regulations designed to promote the safe operation of commercial mo tor vehicles including against operatorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32281crs22 41 provided that the number of roadside safety inspections conducted in the state is maintained at level at least equal to the

the program is to prom ote enhanced traffic enforcement efforts aimed at reducing the incidence of the most common unsafe driving behaviors that cause or contribute to crashes involving commercial motor ve hicles and passenger vehicles42 if the house provisions were incorporated into the reauthorization statute it would likely prompt fmcs and nhtsa and many state or local enforcement officers to substantially increas attention to the ro of noncommercial drivers in crashes involving large trucks and buses and would authorize about an 8 fold increase in resources dedicated to addre ss this safety challenge the senate bill would authorize much more m odest effort in this area physical qualifications and medical examination of commercial drivers for many years fmcsa has issued and enforced physical qualifications and medical examination requirements for commercial drivers it is widely recognized however that there remain opportunities to improve these standards and strengthen compliance with these regulations for example the national transportation safety board ntsb has conducted numerous investigations of crashes involving commercial vehicles and has issued seri of recommendations intended to improve the medical review and certification process that now applies to commercial drivers in fact ntsb has judged these recommenda tions so important that they have been placed on its most wanted list the board has concluded that flaws exist in the medical certification process for commercial vehicle drivers43 n t s b h s recommended that fmcsa develop comp rehensive medical oversight program which ensures that qualified individua ls perform medical examinations of commercial drivers that the examiners ar educated about re levant occupational issues and that tracking mechanism be established to review prior driver applications for dical certification in its fy2004 appropriation fmcsa r eceived 65 million to undertake major changes to its physical standards and medical examination regulations and associated activities in fy2003 fmcsas budget llocated less than 1 million of contract funds for its medical program and supporte d staff of about six

funding for this activity would be continued within the base program in the fy2005 budget request at about the 65 million level hr 3550 requires the fmcsa administrator to establish fivemember medical review board to provide the agency with recommendations on driver qualification medical standards and guide lines medical examiner education and medical research s 1072 includes much the same language regarding fmcsas medical program but the senatepassed version of the reauthorization bill is more prescriptive in terms of directing fmcsas future medical review and regulatory program in doing so it appears that the senate bill seeks to implement legislatively the thrust of ntsbs recommendations in this area for example s 1072 specifies that the dot secretary shall establish review and revise medical standards for cdl applicants and holders requirements fo r periodic physical examinations of such operators and requirements for notification to the chief medical examiner if cdl applicants or holders fail to meet applicable standards in the senate bill 675 million per year for fy2004 th rough fy 2009 w ould be set aside for fmcsas medical review program data information systems and

programs is the timeliness accuracy and completeness of the inspection crash and motor carrier census data that underpin these activities fmcsa is heavily dependent on state and local data regarding inspections and crashes involving commercial motor vehicl and uses much data submitted by industry for many years fmcsa and its predecessors have recognized that there are opportunities to improve the informati on collection and processing systems which help guide the agency dots office of the inspector general recently issued report pertaining to fmcsas safetysta measurement system the report found lack of updated census data fo r 42 of active carriers inco rrect recorded information on many carriers missed reports for an estimated 13 of the large commercial

personal communication with fmcsa 2004 involved in crashes annually nd late reporting of crashes46 fmcsa states that it is unable to identify or ma tch 14 of the interstate trucks and buses involved in reported crashes with the res ponsible motor carriers fmcsas goal is to reduce to 5 the nonmatch rate fmcsa states that the percentage of fa tal crashes reported to the agency is about 8547 in order to address these and other challenges fmcsa conducts variety of programs and activities for example fmcsa is supporting various crash data improvement programs to improve data accuracy and completeness states also spend mcsap dollars trying to improve th eir data and information systems and the conveyance of data to fmcs as national data bases the funds provided in both fmcsas administrativeopera tions account as well as the mcsap grants are used to address some of the da ta and information system s issues discussed above experience shows that significant improvements in data take time often require state cooperation and often requi re substantial funds funds to improve data sy stems often have to compete against many other possible uses of these funds the amount of funds that are actually allocated to this use will have important bearing on the ability of the fmcsa and the states to address various data information systems and an alysis challenges the housepassed bill authorizes for fy2005fy2009 separate 3 million peryear program for grants to states to improve the accuracy timeliness and completeness of commercial vehicle safety data reported to dot although this is re latively small amount of money within the context of fmcsas total budg et funds used for this purpose could expedite transmission of imp roved data to fmcsa esp ecially if these funds were allocated to those states that face difficulties in this area the senatepassed bill does not specify separate allocation for data and information systems but fmcsas administrativeoperations funds and other state grant moni authorized in both the house and senate bills could also be used to improve data and information systems conclusion during the next few years fmcsa faces numerous challenges many of which would require substantial time and resources to resolve most observers would agree that these challenges include substantially improving driver physical qualification regulations and strengthening fmcsas medical review program implementing more meaningful new entrant safety ssurance program that does not adversely affect implementation of other fmcsa safe ty responsibilities helping states improve their cdl programs by wisely allo cating scarce funds to reduce numerous technological challenges and ins titutional constraints continuing to improve data and information systems that underpin fmcsa s operations monitoring and promoting the safety of mexicandomiciled carrier s going beyond the commercial zone and improving various public safety outreach and traffic enforcement programs includinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32281crs25 those seeking to reduce the frequency and seve rity of truckpasseng er vehicle crashes fmcsas ability to address these and other challenges will be heavily dependent upon the amount of funds authorized as well as the legislative directives and authorities prescribed in reauthorization statute as well as the leadership exercised by the agency and the suppor t fmcsa receives from the states and industry there are signs that an imp roved foundation for action are on the horizon key reauthorization proposals provide fo r continuation of increased funding to improve fmcsas operations and for st ateconducted commerc ial vehicle safety activities like mcsap and the cdl program many of the provisions of the senate and house bills are generally consistent w ith most of the objectives proposed in the administrations reauthorization initiative the leadership at fmcsa with dot support has been able to finalize many new rulemakings and lay the foundation for several new programs and finally although fe deralstate relati onships in motor carrier safety change over time there now appears to be relatively strong spirit of cooperation on the other hand skeptic s can doubt wh ether the r ecent pace of fmcsa rulemaking will conti nue and whether funds authorized in reauthorization bill will be adequate to ensure that all states come into compliance with the cdl requirements specified in mcsia and its implementing regulations others also may be concerned that the number of new entr ants applying for operating authority may overwhelm the auditing capabilities of the fmcsa and the states and that implementation of the new trant program may adversely affect the conduct of some other key safety responsibilities see appendix httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32281crs26 48 this section is based primarily on extensiv discussions with va rious fmcsa officials 2003 and 2004 49 for fy2004 congress appropriated 284 million for the new entrant program including 249 million for grants to the states to conduct new entrant audits 50 fmcsa data 2003appendix the new entrant safety assurance process48 as part of mcsia congress require d the secretary of transportation to establish regulations specifying minimum requirements for motor carriers seeking federal interstate operating authority this requirement which substantially increased fmcsas workload is implemented through the new entrant safety assurance process the foundation of this process is fmcsas re view of the safety practices and performance of all new entrants operating in interstate commerce the agency intends to evaluate three key areasknowledge and app licability of safety regulations safety manage ment systems and safety readinessof some 45000 perhaps as many as 50000 new carriers entering the motor carrier industry each year trying to review each of thes companies within the 18 month time limit specified in mcsia is proving to be one of the largest tasks ever pursued by the agency because this program is attracting substantial congressional interest and funding it is important to di scuss this initiative in detail49 the initial experience with the new entrant program shows that this audit process is labor intensive the conduct of an audit can typically take 2 to 4 hours during 2003 some 45500 new entrants star ted the process to obtain permanent operating authority and fmcsa working with many of the states was able to audit some 12000 new carriers50 from april 2003 when the audits began through march 2004 total of about 19300 safe ty audits were conducte d by federal and state employees thus the first year of ex perience ended with fmcsa amassing substantial backlog of new entrants th at must be reviewed within 18 months according to mcsia as explained below this backlog is expected to increase for at least few years or perhaps longer if the economy improves and vehicle miles traveled by trucks increases the number of new entrants applying for operating authority may well increase significantly the conduct of the new entrant program s also created another challenge for the fmcsa especially since the early spring of 2003 when the number of new entrant audits conducted began to increase significantly the number of compliance reviews and consequently the number of enforcement cas that were conducted by fmcsa decreased significantly in order to focus more on new entrant audits many experts consider the conduct of compliance reviews one of the most important functions of the agency or the states because this indepth onsite review of records and operations can reveal sa fety management control pr oblems and safety violations that need to be addressed httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32281crs27 51 this amount was not specifically appropriated but was administratively collected from various sources including high priority funds nd monies left over from states not using their full mcsap apportionment 52 personal communication with fmcsa 2004the new entrant audit program is viewed as federalstate cooperative activity federal employees conducted about 53 of the new entrant audits during 2003 from january 2004 through march 2004 fmcsa employees conducted 415 of the new entrant audits state participation has been limited by the availability of federal funds roughly 73 million in fy200351 the agency indicated that the fivemonth extension october 2003 throug h february 2004 of tea21 authorities did not provide sufficient c ontract authority to fully implement the new entrant program the recently passed two mont h extension march 1 through april 2004 of tea21 authorities specified in pl 108202 allowed fmcsa to obligate up to 712ths of the funds provided in th fy2004 appropriation for new entrants52 fmcsa however did not obligate funds for the new entrant program during this period congress passed anot her twomonth extension c overing the period through june 2004 after which fmcsa allocated grant funds for the fy2004 new entrant program during early may 2004 fmcs had allocated 172 million of funds to the states to conduct new entrant audits during 2003 and thus far during 2004 essen tially all 99 or more of the new entrants reviewed met the new entrant safety audit requirements successfully ie they passed the safety audit if these new carriers continue to operate safely at the end of the18month review period fmcsa will grant them permanent registrationoperating authority fmcsa is now in the process of considering major changes to its audit program with the intention of strengthening the passfail criteria to better differentiate among carriers in other words fmcsa may raise the bar on what is required to pass the audit fmcsa is considering prohibiting carriers found to have serious safety deficiencies in cr itical areas from continuing to operate under their provisional authority more specifically fmcsa is considering the option of revoking the provisional authority of such carrier and possibly pursuing an enforcement action against that carrier as the agency judges appropriate such programmatic change would be pursued th rough rulemaking activity and would convert the new entrant program into more of an enforcementoriented activity than it currently is such change would pr obably add to the value of the program in terms of promoting compliance but it also would add to its complexity and thus add to the backlog of unaudited carriers and the workload on the fmcsa especially if followup compliance reviews are conducted on those new entrants that failed the safety audit congress provided the fmcsa with safety value regarding implementation of the new entrant safety assurance prog ram section 210 of mcsia states that the dot secretary shall phase in the requirements of the new entrant program in manner that takes into account the ava ilability of certified motor carrier safety auditors fmcsa has not yet used this provision to temper its goal of auditing all new entrants within the 18month time frame specified by congress if this program becomes too resource consuming fmcsa may decide to limit the number or types of new entrant carriers that receive an audit some have suggested that it might behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32281crs28 worthwhile to conduct comprehensive asse ssment of the financia l and safety costs and benefits of the ne w entrant program both the house and the senatepassed reauthorization bills provide the authority for the secretary to use mcsap funds to encourage the states to conduct new entrant audits hr 3550 allows the dot secretary to allocate up to 15 million per year to the states to conduct ne w entrant audits s 1072 allows up to 29 million per year for this purpose in sum based on the number of new entr ant audits conducted during the first year of the program it is highly unlikely that fmcsa working with the states will be able to audit the large number of new entrants applying for permanent operating authority within the time frame specifi ed by congress and without adversely affecting the compliance review responsibility of the agency however if the states continue to conduct greater number of sa fety audits it may be possible for the federal work force to increase its compliance review activities
