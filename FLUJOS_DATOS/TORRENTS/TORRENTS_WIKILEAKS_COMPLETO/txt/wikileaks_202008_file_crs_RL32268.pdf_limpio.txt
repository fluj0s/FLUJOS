software and that others be allowed to modify the source code as they desire in contrast th source code of closed source software is proprietary not publicly distributed and subject to alteration only by the software manufacturer some concerns have arisen concerni ng the relationship between open source software and intellectual pr operty rights including copy rights patents and trade secrets although particular computer program may be designated as open source it remains possible that an owner of intellectual property may enforce its rights against open source software developers nd users some commentators have also expressed concern that open source licen ses may overreach c onverting proprietary programs into open source software even if only portion of that program was derived from an open source original ot hers have suggested that open source licenses may not be legally enforceable wh ich would allow users to obtain and assert intellectual property rights pertaining to software that was initially distributed as open source striking balance between pr omoting innovation on one hand and accommodating the demands of software deve lopers and users on the other forms an important component of contemporary software policy the possibility of intellectual property rights and their attendant license fees and royalties may provide significant incentive for firms to innovate and to distribute software however some proponents of open source software believe that these incentives are unnecessary and further hope to maintain nonproprietary environment of software distribution and development should congress have an interest in this area several options present themselves action need be taken if the current relationship between open source software and intellectual property is deemed satisfactory particularly as software publishers become increasingly aware of intellectual property and as judicial precedents may make the legal situation clearer congress might also assist individuals in identifying intellectual property that pertains to software that has been identified as open source speak to the enforceability of open source licenses and as possible more farreaching legal refo rm allow proprietary software publishers grace period for removing portions of program code that derived from an open source

the most dramatic development in the contemporary computer industry is the open source software movement the term open source refers to computer program whose source code is made available to the public for modification or improvement as individual users desire1 in contrast the source code of closed source software is proprietary not publicly distributed and subject to alteration only by the so ftware manufacturer the rise of open source software has gene rated considerable discussion in recent years proponents of open source software contend that the open source system preserves the freedom of computer user s and provides supe rior development methodology as compared to the usual proprietary model2 other commentators have expressed concerns regarding the security of open source software and whether it will operate in compatible fa shion with other programs3 intellectual property rights including copyrights patents and trade secrets present another possible set of concerns with respect to open source software although particular computer program may be designated as open source it remains possible that an owner of intellectual property may enforce its rights against open source software developers and users4 in addition open source software is ordinarily accompanied by license that requires users to maintain the program as open source5 some commentators have

issues of interface between open source software and the in tellectual property laws this report concludes with discussion of possibl legislative issues and approaches introduction to the open source movement fundamental concepts an understanding of the f undamentals of modern computer software technology will assist in an understanding of the open source movement software programmers typically write software programs using high level computer language such as basic c or java by using the words symbols and numbers that make up these highlevel computer languages the prog rammer tells the computer what to do for instance the command add x instructs the computer to add the value of the variable x to the variable computer program written in this high level language is said to be in source code form8 computers are incapable of reading the highlevel instructions of source code however rather the computer responds to binary inputs either 0 or 1 that correspond to an open or closed electrical switch the number 01001101 might tell computer to add two numbers nd save the result for example thus after writing the program in source code the programmer ordinarily uses compiler program to translate or compile the sour ce code into the corresponding 1s and 0s that the computer can read source code that has been compiled into this series of 1s and 0s is called object code9 today most computer programs are distributed in object code form this distribution system is often referred to as the proprietary software model when consumer purchases copy of for exam ple wordperfect software that program comes on cdrom into which the object code 1s and 0s have been encoded one of the reasons that software developers distribute only the object code and not

review this text in order to find out how program works as resu lt if software were distributed in source code form rival firms could readily take and reuse parts of the program in competing products as this re port discusses below11 this appropriation of the original programmers work may violate intellectual property laws however such violations may be difficult both to discover and stop di stributing software in object code form is more costefficient and effective means of preventing this infringement12 some computer users have expresse d dissatisfaction with the proprietary software model end users of proprietary software mu st ordinarily rely upon the software publisher to fix mistakes in the code and develop add itional features as free software advocate richard stallman has explained the proprietary software model keeps users helpless and divide d the inner workings are secret13 stallman further opines that computer users should be free to modify programs to fit their needs and free to share software becau helping other people is the basis of society14 loosely organized open source softwa re community has resulted from this reaction to proprietary software development15 in contrast to proprietary software the source code of open source soft ware is available to the public16 computer users are therefore able to examine the humanreadable instructions that the programmer wrote to create the software number of wellknown programs are open source including widely used in ternet server program apache popular internet programming language perl the program that routes more than 80 percent of all internet email messages worldwide sendmail the program that is the basis for the domain name system bind and the fastest growing operating system in the world

gnuorglicenseslicenseshtmlwhatiscopyleft 20 kennedy supra note 7 21 see open source initiative introductory statement 2004 available at httpwwwopensourceorgopen source software licenses it is important to note that the term open source implies more than merely distribution of source code along with the object code in such circumstances the publisher could continue to assert its intellectual property rights in the software thereby limiting the ability of others to modify the program or redistribute it even though disclosed to the public the source c ode would remain under the control of the publisher18 as result publishers of open source so ftware ordinarily do more than simply provide copies of both the source code nd the object code when they distribute computer programs to the public in additi on they establish the terms of use of the software by means of license license is contract through which the publisher allows recipients to use and modify the software subject to certain conditions specified in the license for example the license might require that anyone who redistributes the software also make th source code of that software publicly available contracts that provide users with sufficient set of privileges to access and modify the softwares source code ar deemed to be open source licenses the practice of preserving the rights of software users through set of license provisions is sometimes called copylefting this term is play on words on the term copyright19 under this system the copyri ght holder licenses the recipient of copy of the software the license permits the redistribution of further copies of the software including software containi ng modifications under the condition that those copies are subject to the same license this legal framework ensures that derivatives of the licensed work remain open if the licensee fails to distribute derivative works under the same license th he may face legal consequences in particular the licensor could terminate the license leaving the licensee without permission to copy distribute or modify the software 20 although official defin ition specifies which software licenses qualify as open source licenses an organization called the open source initiative or osi has promulgated widely fo llowed set of standards21 osi describes itself as non profit corporation dedicated to mana ging

fields of endeavor or products or limit its use with other free software 24 number of different groups have pr omulgated variety of open source licenses that osi has certified as complia nt with the open source definition among these is the general public license or gpl25 as compared to the open source definition the gpl imposes additional rest rictions upon software publishers as result license may fulfill the conditions of the open source definition but not qualify as gpl according to its s ponsor the free software foundation the gpl guarantees computer users the following four freedoms the freedom to run the program for any purpose the freedom to study how the program works and adapt it to your needsthe freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor the freedom to improve the program and release your improvements to the public so that the whole community benefits 26 it is important to note that in this context the term freedom does not mean that the software has to be sold at ch arge rather it refers to permissible user activities and in par ticular the principle that softwa re should be openly available in all of its current and future forms to all those desiring to learn or benefit from it27 the chief distinction between the open source definition and the gpl is that the open source definition effectively allows users to appropriate privately

open source in contrast the gpl requires that the source code be kept open to the public ev if the recipient of the software made changes also under the gpl the licensee cannot restrict the ability of others to build upon any modifi cations that the licensee made30 for example computer programmer may use software under license that minimally complies with the open source definition suppose further

proprietary nd open source software publishers rely upon the intellectual property laws to sustai n their chosen development model more specifically the term intellectual property laws identifies number of doctrines including copyrights patents and trade secrets that provide innovators with proprietary interests in their intangible creations31 copyright provides authors with exclusive rights in their writings visual works and other works of authorship patents relate to products pr ocesses and other useful inven tions while trade secret law concerns secret information that is of commercial value32 after briefly identifying the principal policy justifications for the copyright patent and trade secret law this report summarizes the basic workings of these legal disciplines intellectual property policy by providing individuals with exclusive rights to their inventive products and processes the intellectual property laws llows authors and inventors to secure the economic benefits of

and institutions to engage in research and development33 intellectual property rights may also facilitate market mechanisms by creating discrete welldefined property interests that are readily subject to commercial exchanges34 absent patent rights for exampl an inventor may have tangible asset to sell or license in addition an inventor might otherwise be unable to police the conduct of contracting party an technology or knowhow that has been disclosed to prospective buyer might be appropriated without compensation to the inventor the availability of patent prot ection decreases the ability of contracting parties to engage in opportunis tic behavior by lowering such transaction costs the patent system may make technologybased trans actions more feasible35 some commentators have identified natural rights as an additional rationale for the intellectual property laws and in particular the copyright law under this view individuals enjoy natural right of propert in the works they have created through their own labors36 intellectual property law may also encourage marketplace behavior that is both ethical and efficient as matter of fairness and justice this view holds one individual should not be llowed to profit from anothers labor and goodwill37 in economic terms intellectual property laws may also stimulate socially desirable activities that create wealth including i nnovation and discourage costly acts that merely redistribute existing wealth such as industrial espionage38 the intellectual property system has long been subject to criticism however some observers believe th at intellectual property ri ghts encourage industry concentration and create barriers to market entry39 others have suggested that intellectual property rights can actually slow the pace of innovation

important to note the lack of rigorous analytical methods available for determining the effect of the intellectual property rights upon the us economy as whole the relationship between innovati on and intellectual property rights remains poorly understood concerned observers simply do not know what market impacts would result from changing the patent term from its current 20year period for example42 consequently current economic and policy tools do not allow us to calibrate the intellectual property system precisely in order to produce an optimal level of inve stment in innovation copyrights under the federal copyright act of 1976 copyright may extend to any original work of authorship including computer software programs43 copyright protection arises automatically without the need of the proprietor to take any formal steps however authors who register their works with the us copyright office44 and then place notice of copyright on copies of their works45 are afforded certain advantages when enforcing their copyrights copyright confers number of exclusiv rights to the author or in some circumstances to the employer of the author46 most notable is that the copyright proprietor has the exclusive right to make copies of the protected work and to distribute it to the public47 each copyright ordinarily enjoys term of the life of the author plus 70 years48 as with the other intellectual propert rights copyrights do not enforce themselves copyright proprietors bear responsibility for monitoring its competitors to determine whether they are using the protected work

reviews these issues the alleged viral nature of open source software certain open source licenses have sometimes been described as viral in character64 some individual open source license s require that the terms of that license apply automatically to each copy of the software as well as to any modified versions65 some observers have expressed c oncerns regarding situations where programmer perhaps unknowingly incor porates some open source program code into larger software package in these circumstances the open source portion of the software could contaminate the entire pr ogram as result even though the publisher intended that the pr ogram be proprieta ry it may be instead be distributed as the open source license stipulates66 in this way the open source software component would trump any intellectual pr operty rights that the publisher hoped to claim whether particular open source software is potentially viral or not depends upon the individual terms of the accompanying open source license some commentators have stated that the free software foundations gpl is one example of potentially viral license67 under the gpl anyone who uses or modifies the software must upon further distributing th at software or modification of that software make the source code fully ava ilable to the public free of any proprietary interest68 this limitation prevents the softwa re written and distributed under the gpl from being subject to intellectual property rights as result the gpl maintains the open nature of the open source code by allowing users to modify and redistribute the software but requiring that such modifica tions be made available to anyone under the terms of the gpl notably under certain conditions the gp l allows users to incorporate open sourcederived computer programs into proprietary software packages without subjecting the entire package to the gpl69 according to the free software foundation in order to avoid the impos ition of the

sure that the free and nonfree programs communicate at arms length that they are not combined in way that would make them effectively single program70 the free software foundation offers as an example the combination of an editor program and shell program71 to expand upon this illustration suppose that an editor program executes textual commands ty ped by the user shell or user interface program might provide graphical menudriven interface so that the user doesnt have to memorize the text co mmands the editor could be proprietary program the shell might have been deve loped for individuals who did not wish to learn the text commands and distributed under the gpl as the editor can work independently of the shell in this example the proprietary nature of the editor would be maintained even though the shell was subject to the gpl72 the functional separation of proprietary and open s ource software provides one avenue for avoiding the broad applicati on of an open source license to an entire software product some observers believe however that conformity with this exception imposes substantial compliance bur dens for example attorneys james harvey and todd s mcclelland state it is therefore good practice to advise clients with respect to procedures designed to segregate software that can be licensed as proprietary from that which must be distributed under an open source license developing and maintaining procedures to implement these administrative tasks can be very difficult in complex development environments73 views differ on the supposed viral na ture of some open source licenses representatives of proprietary software fi rms have expressed c oncerns that open source is an intellectualproperty destroyer74 and have reportedl referred to open source software as cancer and unamerican75 others believe that in order for open source software to rema in open to the public all pr ograms derived from an open source original should be treated as open source as well76 and as noted above some open source licenses take an intermediate position77 although these licenses require that the original software that is distributed with the license remain open source they allow modifications and upgrades to that code to be taken private and be treated as proprietary softwarehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32268crs13 78 ira v heffan copyleft licensing collaborative works

effectively prevent individuals from asserting intellectual property rights in open source software78 this restriction only applies to individuals who have consented to these licenses however79 parties not subject to that license are therefore not necessarily prevented from enforcing their intellectual property rights against individuals who use the software as result even though one individual has distributed software that it has designated as open source another entity may possibly assert that the software infringes an intellectual property right such assertions lead to potential conflicts between the intellect ual property rights owner and individuals who believe that the software is open to the public for example suppose that computer scientist pha invents new method of sorting data useful for computer progra ms alpha then files patent application at the uspto claiming the method later programmer named beta independently writes software program that uses the same data sorting thod that alpha had claimed in his pending application unaw are of alphas pate nt application beta distributes his own software to the public under the gpl if the uspto approves of alphas application alpha coul d assert claims of patent infringement against anyone using betas software these users would be subject to legal liability even though the software was believed to be open source and even though one had knowledge of the patent infringement80 this scenario is possible not only fo r open source software but also for proprietary software so ftware publishing firm may also discover that their products infringe patent or other inte llectual property however commercial enterprises may stand in better position to consider the intellectual property ramifications of

by individuals who claim not to be subject to the license under which the software was distributed validity of open source licenses court has yet ruled on the enforceab ility of open source software licenses96 some observers have suggested that th agreements may be invalid however97 these commentators point to the doctrine of federal preemption which invalidates state laws that are inconsistent with federal laws98 under this view open source software licenses which are enforced through the mechanisms of state contract laws conflict with the federal copyri ght statute and are therefore invalid99 the rule of federal preem ption derives from the supremacy clause of the us constitution that provision states that th constitution and the laws of the united statesshall be the supreme law of the land anything in the constitutions or lawshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32268crs16 100 us constitution article vi 101 heald supra note 98 102 17 usc 301 2000 103 for an introduction to the

courts typically determine whether enforcement of state law would either directly conflict with federal law or frustrate federal purposes101 in addition section 301 of the copyright act expressly exempts st ate laws that are equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright and that apply to the types of work s protected by the copyright act102 the ongoing litigation between sco and ibm may offer court the opportunity to decide whether the open source license known as the general public license or gpl is preempted by the federal copyright law103 in that litigation ibm has in part argued that sco cannot enfo rce whatever intellectual pr operty rights sco owns in linux due to the terms of the gpl according to ibm sco distributed linux software under the gpl for many years ibm observes that the gpl stipulates that software distributed under the gpl must be made available for copying by others as result ibm has asserted that sco cannot now demand payment for use of any intellectual property sco might own in linux104 in turn sco has in part asserted that the gpl is invalid as part of its argument sco has reportedly pointed to section 117 of the copyright act105 that statute provides that it is not copyrigh t infringement for the owner of copy of computer program to make or authorize the making of another copy or adaptation of that computer program provided th at such new copy or adaptation is for archival purposes only 106 stated differently the copyright act permits users to make backup copy of their software without fear of infringement liability the gpl places limitations upon the ability of users to make copies of gpl licensed software however in particular the gpl requires that individuals receiving copies of the software also receive copies of the gpl and that persons making copies of the software be able to access the programs source code107 the gpl then states that any attempt otherwise to copy m odify sublicense or distribute the program is void and will automati cally terminate your rights under this license108 sco hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32268crs17 109 bulkeley supra note 99 110 ibid 111 ibid

property law the case against open sources stanford technol ogy law review 2001 4taken the position that because the gpl conflicts with the copyright act the gpl is preempted and therefore unenforceable109 notably sco and ibm have presented number of other arguments to the court the court may not need to address this issue to resolve their dispute110 this aspect of the scoibm litigation has nonethel ess raised concerns in the open source software community as explained by journalist william m bulkeley if scos argument ultimately wins freesoftware advocates worry it would create considerable uncertainty about the legal status of many industry products although most believe the industry c ould adapt companies that use gpl licensed software might be confronted by surprise copyright claims from software developers in addition creati on of new programs might be slowed by the confusion111 other observers believe that the possibility of court striking down the gpl is small for example lawyer james boyle member of the faculty of the duke university law school has reportedly scribed the federal preemption argument as simply ludicrous112 eben moglen law professor at columbia university believes that the federal preemption argument is overly broad in moglens view this position would effectively invalidate all software licenses even those for which people pay and even for proprietary software113 moglen believes it unlikely that court would wish to dispute this long standing industry practice114 possible legislative issues and approaches given the wide recognition that inte llectual property and the open source movement are of growing importanc in the us computer industry115 the relationship between these fields is th subject of increasing attention the policymakers of the 108th congress have ddressed the open s ource movement with respect to cybersecurity and other contex ts should congress choose to address this area directly variety of approaches are available if the current interface between intellectual property rights and the open s ource movement is considered satisfactory then action need be taken indeed gr owing awareness that intellectual property and open source software licenses can sometimes conflict may lead to morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32268crs18 116 steve d beyer searching the art behind an opinion 667 practising

source software can succeed 32 research policy 7 july 2003 1243sophisticated treatment of intellectual property by members of the open source community as well as conti nued refinement of the gove rning law in the courts another approach is to provide gove rnmental assistance to the open source movement in identifying inte llectual properties that might bear upon particular open source software product for example th us patent and trademark office could upon request by recognized open sour ce software publisher or organization conduct search of pending patent appli cations and issued patents in order to determine whether these patents might b ear upon particular open source software program this capability would allow members of the open source community to become more fully informed of intellect ual property rights it should be noted however that number of patent research firms already exist that could conduct such search for fee at least with respect to issued patents and published patent applications116 more farreaching legal reforms are also possible for example one recognized source of legal uncertainty for the softwa re industry concerns the enforceability of open source licenses117 legislative statement concerning the status of these licenses in terms of the federal preemption doctrine might allow software firms to make decisions concerning research investment and other commercial activities with more confidence the allegedly viral nature of open source software presents another source of concern one possible legislative respons is to allow proprietary software publisher that discovers its product cont ains an open source component fixed period of time to eliminate the open source component if the publisher removes the open source component within the stipulat ed grace period then the software would remain proprietary any possible legal reform would be welladvised to recognize that the us software industry is increasingly charact erized both by rapid innovation and by distinct community of knowledgeable users w ho wish to opt out of the intellectual property system the possibility of intellectual property rights and their attendant license fees and royalties may provide significant incentive for firms to innovate and to distribute software on the other nd some computer users believe that these incentives are unnecessary and furthe r hope to maintain nonproprietary environment of software di stribution and development118 these two trends have sometimes led to conflicts between exclusive intellectual property rights and open source software striking balance be tween promoting innovation on one hand and accommodating the demands of software deve lopers and users on the other forms an important component of contemporary software
