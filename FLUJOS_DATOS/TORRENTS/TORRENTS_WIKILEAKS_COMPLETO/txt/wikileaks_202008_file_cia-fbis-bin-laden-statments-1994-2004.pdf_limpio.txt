usama bin ladin denies terrorism link london alquds alarabi in arabic 9 mar 94 p 4 interview with saudi businessman usama bin ladin by ali abdalkarim and alnur ahmad alnur in khartoum date not given excerpts alquds alarabi the attempted attack on you took place after the horrific incident in the ansar alsunnah mosque what is your relationship with the ansar alsunnah group bin ladin our relationship with the ansar alsunnah group is like our relationship with the other islamic groupsa lose cordial and good relationship based on brotherhood in god it is muslims duty toward their muslim brothers alquds alarabi did you have any dealings with the afghan groups bin ladin we harbor hostility toward anyone or any afghan groups our relationship with the afghan mojahedin egan in 1399 hijra 1979 namely when we went to lahore pakistan and worked with the islamic group in pakistan to support the mojahedin against the communist invasion we have focused on helping the brothers in afghanistan since 1985 we opened camps to train young men to fight the soviet invasion we cooperated with everyone to help muslims to defend themselves and their religion especially as the enemies of islam want muslims to remain weak nd subservient our work in afghanistan which caused some pe ople to insult us was devoted to fighting the communist invasion and raising the banner that reads there is other god but god alquds alarabi in your view who is responsible for that attack reportfor official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 2 bin ladin there are external quarters at which finger of accusation could be pointed they are the quarters spitefully hostile to islam they do not accept the natural right of muslims to defend themselves our position in afghanistan caused some of is lams enemies try to obstruct our cooperation with muslims the world tends to prefer to overlook the oppression and persecution in bosnia and occ upied palestine and then sten to accuse muslims of terrorism if they defend themselves it wants to keep muslims weak and incapable of defending themselves we also know that there are contacts among diplomats all resigned to curb our movement and stop our contacts with our brothers but we say that cooperation in piety is continuing among muslims alquds alarabi what is the nature of your relationship with saudi arabia bin ladin there is disagreement because of their rejection of our cooperation with the islamic awakening support f muslim issues and opposition to their restrictions on the all aldawah and the preachers i am accused of supporting fundamentalism even though everyone knows that this stems from our eagerness to raise the banner that reads there is other god but god and support the afghan mojahedin camps to fight oppression and communist aggression i believe that all muslims adopted this position or that is what we believe was the case alquds alarabi and with egypt bin ladin the egyptian press says that usama bin ladin supports fundamentalism we know that there are domestic problems in egypt because of the states violence against islamists obviously there are bound to be reactions to this government policy like many other muslim young men some isla mists in egypt gained military experience in the afghan mojahedin amps these conditions forced some to take such positions in their countries to defend their religion and themselves the egyptians are trying to indicate that i have something to do with the reactions taking place in their country and hey accuse of posing threat to them alquds alarabi and with yemen bin ladin what i said about egypt i say about yemen which i believe is one of the best arab and muslim countries in terms of adherence to traditions and the faith nevertheless its citizens have been subjected to murder and religious persecution so it is natural for reactions to take place even if some of yemens sons do train in afghan campsthis report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 3 for official use only the accusation that we support terrorism is hostile imperialist method designed to suppress muslims determination and paralyze their movement toward one another and toward their religi on and faith

that what is happening in sudan is mixture of religion and organized crime interview with saudi dissident bin ladin london independent in english 10 jul 96 p 14 report on interview with saudi dissident usama bin ladin by robert fisk in afghanistans nangarhar province date not given fbis transcribed text usa ma bin ladin is tall slim ma n and when he walks towards surrounded by his arab mujahidin guerrillas in the mountains of afghanistan he towers over his companions huge insects fly through the night air settling like burrs on his saudi robes and on the clothes of his men bin ladins narrow eyes and long beard were familiar amid the battlefields of afghanistan where he and his guerrillas fought the soviet invasion army of the eigh ties his appearance is little changed the beard trifle greyer perhaps but the fierceness unquenched then he fought the russians now determined to overthrow the monarchy in saudi arabia and oust the americans from the kingdom he is describing the bombings that slaughtered 24 americans in riyadh and khobardhahran as symbol of saudi anger the presence of us forces as an insult to the saudi people for bin ladin the betrayal of the saudi people began 24 years before his birth when abdul aziz alsaud proclaimed his kingdom in 1932 the regime started under the flag of applying islamic law and under this banner all the people of saudi arabia came to help the saudi family take power he says as the night wind moves through the darkened trees ruffling the robes of the arab afghan fighters around us abdul aziz did not apply islamic law the country was set up for his family then after the discovery of petroleum the saudi regime found another support the money to make people rich and give them the services and life they wanted and to make them satisfied bin ladin is picking his teeth with piece of miswak wood habit that accompanies many of his conversations history or his version of itis the basis of almost all his remarks and the pivotal date is 1990 the year saddam husayn invaded kuwait when the american troops entered saudi arabia the land of the two holy places mecca and medina there was strong protest from the ulema religious authorities and from students of the shariah law all over the country against the interference of american troopsfor official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 12 this big mistake by the saudi regime of inviting the american troops revealed their deception they had given their support to nations that were fighting against muslims they helped the yemen communists against the southern yeme muslims and helped east after it insulted nd jailed the ulema 18 months ag the saudi regime lost its legitimacy bin ladin spreads his right hand and uses his fingers to list the mistakes of the saudi monarchy at the same time the financial crisis happe ned inside the kingdom and now all the people there suffer from this saudi merchants found that their contracts were broken the government owes them 340 billion saudi riyals which is very big amount it represents 90 per cent of the national income inside the kingdom prices are going up and people have to pay more for electricity water and fuel saudi farmers have not received money since 1992 and those who get grants now receive them on government loans from banks education is deteriorating and people have to take their children from government schools and put them in private education which is very expensive bin ladin pauses to see if i have listened to his careful if frighteningly exclusive history lesson the saudi people have remembered now what the ulema told them and they realise america is the main reason for their problems the ordinary man knows that his country is the largest oil producer in the world yet at the same time he is suffering from taxes and bad services now the people understand the speeches of the ulemas in the mosquesthat our country has become an american colony they act decisively with every ac tion to kick the americans out of saudi arabia what happened in riyadh nd khobar when 24 american s were killed in two bombings is clear evidence of the huge anger of sa udi people against am erica the saudis now know their real enemy is america there is dark quality to bin ladins calculations if one kilogram of tnt exploded in country in which nobody had heard an explosion in hundred years surely the exploding of 2500 kilos of tnt at khobar is evidence of the peoples resistance to american occupation did not the europeans resist german occupation in the second world war mr bin ladin asks i tell him european would accept this argument because the nazis killed millions of europeans yet the americans have never murdered single saudi surely i say such parallel is historically and morally wrong bin ladin does not agree we as muslims have strong feeling that binds us together we feel for our brothers in palestine and lebanon the explosion at khobar did not come as direct result of american occupation but as result of american behaviour against muslims when 60 jews are killed inside palestine in suicide bombings earlier this year all the world gathers within seven days to criticise this action while the deaths of 600000 iraqi children after sanctions were placed on iraq did not receive the same reaction killing those iraqi children is crusade against islam we as muslims do not this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited

arabias angriest dissident reserves some of his fury for the british i astonished at the british government he says they sent letter to through their embassy in khartoum before i left sudan saying that i would not be welcome in the uk but i did not ask to go to britain so why did they send this letter the letter said if you come to britain you will not be admitted the letter gave the saudi press the opportunity of claiming that i had asked for political asylum in britainwhich is not true but it was america that captured bin ladins anger i believe that sooner or later the americans will leave saudi arabia and that the war declared by america against the saudi people means war against all muslims everywhere resistance against america will spread in many many places in muslim countries our trusted leaders the ulema have given us fatwa that we must dr ive out the americans the solution to this crisis is the withdrawal of american troopstheir military presence is an insult for the saudi people yet did not the americans support the mujahidins war against the soviets we were never at any time friends of the americans bin ladin says we knew that the americans support the jews in palestine and that they are our enemies most of the weapons that came to afghanistan were paid for by the saudis on the orders of the americans because turki alfaysal the head of saudi external intelligence and the cia were working together so what kind of arabian islamic state does mr bin ladin wish to see would thieves and murderers still have their heads cut off for example in shariahgoverned state mr bin ladins answer is unsatisfactory all muslims would love to live under true shariah he says guilty man would only be happy if he was justly punished dissident mr bin ladin may be but moderate never bin ladin declares jihad on americans london alislah in arabic 2 sep 96 message from usama binmuhammad bin ladin to his muslim brothers in the whole world and especially in

aggression and all the false claims about human rights fell under the blows and massacres committed against muslims everywhere the latest aggression was one of the worst catastrophes to befall the

rectifying what has befallen the islamic world in general nd the land of the two holy mosques in particular we want to study the ways which could be used to rectify matters and restore rights to their owners as people have been subjected to grave danger and harm to their religion an d their lives people of all walks of life civilians military security men employees merchants people big and small school and university students and unemployed university graduates in fact hundreds of thousands who constitute broad sector of the society the same thing has befallen the people in industry and in agriculture the cities and villages and the people in the desert and the rural areas everyone is complaining about almost everything the situation in the land of the two holy mosques is like gigantic volcano about to erupt and destroy heresy and corruption whatever their source the explosions of riyadh and alkhubar were only small indication of that torrential flood resulting from the bitter suffering repression coercion great injustice disgraceful debauchery and poverty people have been greatly preoccupied with matters of their livelihood talk of economic decline high prices massive debts and overcrowded prisons is widespread and endless in society lowincome employees will talk to you about their debts running to tens and hundreds of thousands of riyals they complain about the massive and continuing drop in the purchasing power of the riyal in comparison with most other ma jor currencies major traders and contractors will talk to you about the debts owed to them by the

alert to that affliction and each group did its best to act quickly to remedy the situation everyone agrees that the country is moving towards deep abyss and terrible calamity the extent of which only god knows as one major businessman said the king is leading the country to 60 calamities god is the source of all help and power many princes share the publics concern and privately voice opposition to what is going on in the country in terms of terror repression and corruption the rivalry between princes overseeing their own personal interests has ruined the country and the regime has destroyed its legitimacy with its own hands thr ough many actions the most important being 1 its suspension of the islamic shariah ws replacing them with temporal laws and its bloody confrontation with the truthful ulema and good youthand god is above everyone 2 its failure to protect the country opening it to the nations enemies the american crusader forces who have become the main cause of all aspects of our plight especially the economic aspect as result of the unjustified heavy expenditure on them and as result of the policies they impose on the country and particularly the oil policy determining the quantities of oil to be produced and setting the prices which suit their own economic interests ignoring the countrys economic interests and also as result of the exorbitant arms deals imposed on the regime to the point that people are wondering what good then is the regime so each group has made efforts to act quickly and evade the danger they offered advice secretly and openly in verse and in prose singly and in groups and they sent petition after petition and memorandum after memorandum they left stone unturned and there was influential pe rson they did not include in their reformist moves in their writings they applied the gentle and lenient method of wisdom and good advice calling for reform and penance for the major wrongdoings and corruption that transgressed the categorical religious limits and the publics legitimate rights most regrettably however the only response they got from the regime was rejection disregard and ridicule the matter did not stop at the point of just humiliating them but that was followed by greater and greater misdeeds throughout the land of the two holy mosques therefore silence was longer appropriate and overlooking the facts was longer acceptable when the excesses intensified and went beyond the limits of simple wrongdoings and misdeeds to violation of the clear basis of islam group of ulema and religious preachers grew tired of the deafening sound of misguidance and injustice and the suffocating smell of corruption so signs of rejection appeared and voices were raised calling for reform to remedy the situation and stop the rot they were joined by hundreds of intellectuals this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 17 for official use only dignitaries merchants and former officia ls they submitted petitions nd memoranda to the king urging reform in the hegira year of 1411 during the gulf war petition signed by about 400 figures was submitted to the king calling for rectification of the situation in the country and for an end to the injustice to the public but he ignored the advice and ridiculed those who offered it and the situation got worse those who had offered the advice then sent more memoranda and petitions the most important being the advice memorandum handed to the king in the month of muharram 1413 hegira roughly 1992 which diagnosed the disease and prescribed the medicine with sound shariah approach and in sound scientific way it dwelt on the major gaps in the regimes philosophy and the main anomalies in the regimes foundations pointing to the suffering of societys symbols and leaders calling for reform such as the ulema religious protagonists tribal shaykhs merchants dignitaries and university professors who were marginalized neutralized and even pursued and harassed it also dwelt on the countrys laws and regulations and what they allowed and disallowed against gods will it discussed the state of the media in the country which became means for the advancement of individuals and relatives and for obliterating facts falsifying the truth defaming righteous people and shedding crocodile tears for the nations causes to mislead people without any serious action and to implement the enemies plans to corrupt people draw them away from their religi on and spread among the believers those who love to see scandal published and broadcast among the believers will have grievous penalty in this life and in the hereafter god knows and ye know not koranic verse it the advice memorandum discussed the peoples violated legitimate rights and the administrative situation with all its inefficiency and corruption it pointed to the states financial and economic situation and the terrible and frightful fate in store as result of the debts of usury which have broken the states back and to the waste which has squandered the nations wealth to satisfy pe rsonal wealth resulting in taxes duties and excises imposed on the public the prophet may gods prayers and blessings be upon him said about the woman who sinned repented and was dealt with accordingly she repented and if one who imposes taxes repented in the same way he would be forgiven that reflects the magnitude of the of the tax man but some are publicly and over loudspeakers applauding him and his massive and permitted usury but that is heresy reliance is on god who is the source of all power it exposed the despicable state of the social utilities in the country which became even worse after the memorandum and especially the water services the most important element of livelihood it discussed the state of the army whose small numbers poor training and inefficient command were exposed by the gulf crisis

foreign policy the memorandum exposed that policys failures and disregard for muslim causes and even support and backing for the enemies the gaza jericho agreement and the case of the com munists in southern yemen are not too distant examples and there are many others upholding temporal laws and supporting heretics against muslims are prohibited in islam as the ulema have ruled god said whoever does not rule by gods law is heretic and he said but by the lord they can have real faith until they make thee judge in all disputes between them and find in their souls resistance against thy decisions but accept them with the fullest conviction koranic verses although the memorandum submitted all that leniently and gently as reminder of god and as good advice in gentle objective and sincere way despite the importance and necessity of advice for rulers in islam and despite the number and positions of the signatories of the memorandum and their sympathizers it was of avail its contents were rejected and its signatories and sympathizers were humiliated punished and imprisoned the preachers and reformers eagerness to pursue peaceful reform methods in the interest of the countrys unity and to prevent bloodshed was clearly demonstrated so why should the regime block all means of peaceful reform and drive the people toward armed action that was the only door left open to the public for ending injustice and upholding right and justice and in whose interests do prince sultan and prince nayif plunge the country and the people into an internal war that would destroy everything enlisting the aid and advice of those who fomented internal sedition in their country and using the peoples police force to put down the reform movement there nd pit members of the public one against the otherleaving the main enemy in the region namely the jewishamerican alliance safe and secure having found such traitors to implement its policies aimed at exhausting the nations human and financial resources internally the person whom interior minister prince nayif is consulting not further identified was not tolerated in his own country because of his extreme dirt and affront to his people he was dismissed from his post but came to be received by prince nayif with open arms for cooperation on and aggression he filled the prisons with the nations best sons bringing tears to the eyes of the mothers whose sons were jailed unfairly does the regime want to pit the public ci vilians and military against one another as was the case in some neighboring countries i have doubt that that is the policy of the israeli american enemy alliance the main beneficiary of all that but thank god the vast majority of the people civilians and military are aware of that sinister plan and will not allow thems elves to be an instrume nt for strikes against one another in implementation of the policy of the main enemy namely the israeliamerican alliance through the saudi regime its agent in the country this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 19 for official use only that is why everyone agrees that crooked stick cannot have straight shadow and that there must be concentra tion on hitting the main enemy who has thrust the nation into whirlpools and labyrinths for decades since dividing it into states and statelets whenever reform movement appears in the islamic states that jewishcrusade alliance pushes its agents in the region the rulers to exhaust and abort such reform movement by various suitable means sometimes aborting it by luring it to armed confrontation for which it chooses the time and place and through which it would nip it in the bud sometimes he would set loose his men in the interior ministry who had graduated from shariah colleges to confuse and undermine the reform march and to draw the nation and the people away from that march sometimes luring some righteous men to enter into war of words with the ulema and the symbols of the reform movement to exhaust everyones energy and keep the great heresy in control of the nation misleading it and continuing the peripheral discussions while the worship of god and adherence to his shariah are absent in reality in these discussions and responses right and wrong get mixed up and often lead to personal enmities with some pe ople taking sides thereby further dividing and weakening the nation so that islamic action priorities disappear one should beware of these and similar diabolical tricks by the interior ministry the appropriate behavior in such cases is what has been advised by the ulema such as what the late shaykh alislam ibntaymiyah said namely that all muslims should join hands in warding off the great heresy contr olling the islamic wor ld while sustaining minimum damage to prevent the greater damage which is in the fact the great heresy when duties are numerous the most important takes priority it is secret that warding off that american enemy is the top duty after faith and nothing should take priority over it as decreed by the ulema shaykh alislam ib ntaymiyah said fighting in selfdefense is the strongest way of warding off harm to honor and religion and it is collective duty warding off an enemy who corrupts religion and the world is top duty after faith it is unconditional and is done according to means if warding off that aggressive enemy becomes impossible without all muslims of all walks nd ranks getting together then that is their duty and they should in that case overlook some disputed issues overlooking such disputes at this stage is ss harmful than continuation of the great heresy afflicting the countries of the muslims that is why shaykh alislami explaining that matter pointed out main and great principle which sho uld be taken into account which is that work should concentrate on warding off the greater of the two evils referring to the state of the mujahidin and muslims he sa id that if among them the re happened to be very sinful soldiers that would not justify abandoning the jihad against the aggressive enemy after discussing the case of the tatars and their change of gods laws he may god have mercy on his soul said that agreement on fighting them fully would please god uphold his word and establish his religion and obedience to his prophet if some among them muslims happen to be sinful and ill intentioned fighting for leadership or offending others on some matters and if the religious harm of not fighting them is greater than the harm of fighting them then the duty is to fight them to ward off the greater harm that is why one of the principles of the sunnah and the prophets group is to do conquest using every good as well as sinful person for god supports this in the interest of the cause of religion because as the prophet may gods prayers and blessings be upon him said if for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 20 conquest can only be achieved with the help of sinful princes or very sinful soldiers then one of two things must be done either abandon the conquest with their cooperation which means the greater harm of others taking over or proceed with the conquest along with the sinful princes and that way the greater harm is avoided and most of the rules of islam are established if not ll that would be the duty in that case and in all similar cases in fact many of the conquests which took place after the orthodox caliphs took place in that way what is necessary in such case is that everyone should do his best to incite and mobilize the nation against the aggressive enemy and the great heresy prevailing in the country and corrupting religion and life there is greater duty after faith than warding daf off that enemy namely the israeliamerican alliance occupying the land of the two holy mosques and the land of the ascension of the prophet may gods prayers and blessings be upon him the muslims are reminded that they should avoid infighting between sons of the muslim nation because that will have dire consequences the most important being 1 exhaustion of human resources as most of the casualties and victims would be from the muslim people 2 exhaustion of financial resources 3 destruction of the states infrastructure 4 disintegration of society 5 destruction of the oil industries because the presence of the crusader and american military forces in the islamic gulf states on land in the air and at sea represents the greatest danger and harm and the greatest thre at to the largest oil reserves in the world that presence is provocation to the people and an affront to their religion feelings and dignity and has driven them toward armed struggle against the occupying invaders spread of fighting in these areas would carry the danger of the oil burning which would be detrimental to the economic interests of the gulf states and the land of the two holy mosques and in fact to the world economy here we pause and urge our brothers the people the mujahidin to preserve that wealth and not to involve it in the battle because it is great islamic wealth and great and important economic power for the coming islamic state god willing we also firmly warn the aggressive united states against burning that islamic wealth at the end of the war for fear of it falling into the hands of its legitimate owners and to harm its economic rivals in europe and the far east especially japan which is considered the main consumer of the regions oil 6 partition of the country of the two holy mosques with israel taking the northern part partition of the land of the two holy mosques is considered to be an urgent demand of the jewishcrusade alliance because the existence of state of such size and with such resources under sound islamic rule which god willing is coming would be threat to the jewish entity in palestine for the land of the two holy mosques would be symbol this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited

two holy mosques is an important economic power in the islamic world because it has the largest il reserves in the world furthermore the people of the two holy mosques are linked to the history of their predecessors the prophets companions whom they see as the example to follow and the ideal to uphold in restoring the nations glory and upholding the will of god that is in addition to the strategic depth and extended manpower fighting for god in happy yemen as the prophet may gods prayers and blessings be upon him said and from aden and abyan would come 12000 who would support god and his prophet and they are among the best of us that would constitute threat to the presence of the jewishcrusade alliance in the region 7 any infighting under whatever pretext while the american occupation forces are still present would be grave danger because these forces would seek to settle the battle in favor of world heresy our brothers in the armed forces national security and security forces may god preserve you as defenders of islam and muslim protectors of monotheism and guardians of the faith successors of those who spread the light of guidance in the world grandsons of sad binabiwaqqas almuthanna binharithah alshibani alqaqa binamr altamimi and the companions who fought alongside them you rushed to join the army an d the guard merely to join the jihad for the cause of god in order to spread the word of god and to defend islam and the land of the two holy mosques against invaders and occupiers which is the highest degree of belief in religion but the regime disrupted the balances distorted the concepts humiliated the nation and disobeyed the nation although the nation still has not recovered its first qiblah and the point of the prophets midnight journey to the seven heavens alaqsa mosquedespite the promises made by the rulers over half century to work to recover it but instead the alaqsa mosque has been handed to the jews and the nations wounds are still bleedingdespite all this the saudi regime shocked the nation by bringing the women of christian armies to defend it and opening the country of the two holy mosques to the crusaders there is nothing strange about that since the saudi king has been decorated by cross the regime opened the country which is now full of the armies of the united states and its allies because the regime is impotent without their help youbetter than anyone elseare aware of this presence its scale aims and danger so the regime has betrayed the nation and allied with and supported the infidels against muslims as is known this is one of the contradictions in islam by opening the arabian peninsula to the crusaders the regime has violated the prophets will to his nation before his death move the atheists out of the arabian peninsula he also said if i live god willing i will move the jews and the christians out of the arabian peninsula the claim that the crusaders presence in the land of the two holy mosques is necessity and temporary matter aimed at defending this land is an old and obsolete story for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 22 especially after the brutal destruction of iraq and its military and civilian infrastructures this claim reflects the scale of the crusad ers and jews spite toward muslims and their children and the regime also insisted on not replacing the crusader forces with islamic forces from among the countrys sons and elsewhere besides this claim is longer valid following the statements made by the leaders of athe ism in the united states the most recent being that of us defense secretary william perry after the alkhubar blast targeting us troops he said that their presence in the land of the two holy mosques is aimed at protecting us interests shaykh safar alhawalimay god help himwrote 70page book in which he listed evidence and proofs that the us presence in the arabian peninsula is preplanned military occupation the claim is another trick by the regime but it will not fool muslims as its first tric k fooled the palestinia n mujahidin the first trick resulted in the alaqsa mosque being lost when the muslim people in palestine rose up in their great jihad against the british occupation in 1354 h corresponding to 1936 britain failed to stop the mujahidin or their jihad their devil inspired them that the armed jihad in palestine can only be stopped through their agent king abdalaziz who they believed was capable of deceiving the mujahidin and indeed king abdal aziz carried out his mission by sending his two sons to meet with mujahidin leaders in palestine and inform him of king abdalaziz pledge to guarantee the british governments promises that it would withdraw and meet their demands if they halted the jihad so king abdalaziz was behind the loss of the muslims first qi blah he allied himself with the christians against muslims and he abandoned the mujahidin instead of espousing the alaqsa mosque issue and supporting those struggling for the sake of gods cause and here is his king fahd trying to fool muslims with the second trick in order to squander our remaining holy sites he lied to the ulema who sanctioned the americans entry and he lied to the islamic worlds ulema and leaders at the world muslim leagues conference in holy mecca in the wake of the islamic worlds condemnation of the crusader forces entry into the country of the two holy mosques on the pretext of defending it he told them that the matter was simple and that the us and coalition troops would leave in few months and here we are approaching the seventh year since their arrival nd the regime is unable to move them out the regime does not want to admit to its people its inability to do so it has continued to lie to people and claim that the americans will departwhich is impossible once bitten twice shy the happy ones are those who learn from others experiences instead of pushing the army the guard and the security men to confront the occupiers the regime is using them to protect the occupiers which is the highest degree of humiliation insult and treason may god give us strength we remind the minority of people in the army police guard and security forces who are being humiliated by the regime to get them to encroach on muslims ri ghts and lives of almighty gods words in the divine hadith i declare war on those who are hostile toward holy men and also of the prophets saying man will come holding the hand of another saying god this man killed talking about the day of judgment so god will say to him why did you kill him he will reply i killed him so that gl ory would be yours god will say it is mine another man will come holding anothers hand and saying god this man killed god will say to him why did you kill him he will say to achieve glory for such and such god will tell him it glory does not belong to such and such he will be this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 23 for official use only punished for his sins the prophet is also reported to have said the murdered will come on the day of judgment clinging to his murderer so god will say why did you kill him he will say to appease such and such your brothers and sons the sons of the two holy mosques have launched the jihad for the sake of gods cause to expel the occupying enemy from the country of the two holy mosques without doubt you wish to carry out this mission in order to restore the nations glory and liberate its occupied holy sites but you are aware that this stage requires the adoption of suitable combat methods due to the lack of parity between our regular armed forces and the enemys forces namely through light and fast khafifah wa sariat harakah forces operating in complete secrecy in other words by waging guerrilla warfare in which the peoples sons other than the armed forces take part as is known it is wise at this stage to spare the armed forces the task of engaging in traditional fighting with the crusader enemys forces this is with the exception of daring and powerful operations carried out separately by individuals from the armed forces that is without mobilizing regular forces with their trad itional formations and in manner that would not reflect adversely on the army unless there ar great interests to be gained and heavy losses to inflicted on the enemylosses that destroy its foundations and rock its pillars losses that help to expel the enemy routedensuring that muslim blood is shed in the process what your mujahidin brothers and sons want from you at this stage is to provide every possible support information and the materials and arms needed for their work and they want the security menin particularto turn blind eye and deceive the enemy about their whereabouts spread false rumors among its ranks and do whatever is viable to help the mujahidin against the occupying enemy we alert you to the fact that the regime might carry out operations against members of the armed forces guard or security fo rces and try to attr ibute them to the mujahidin with view to driving wedge between them and you so the regime should be denied that opportunity while we know that the regime is fully responsible for what has afflicted the country and the people the main disease and the cause of the affliction is the occupying us enemy so efforts should be pooled to kill him fight him destroy him we should lie in wait for him until he is defeated god willing the time will come god willing for you to play your role in settling the situation in order to exalt the word of god to the heights humble the unbelievers word to the depths hit the aggressors with an iron fist put matters right and perform your true islamic duty we will have separate discussion about these issues god willing muslim brothers everywhere the ar abian peninsula in particular the money paid for us goods is turning into bullets fired at the chests of our brothers in palestine and tomorrow the chests of the sons of the country of the two holy mosques for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright

biggest importer of us arms in the world trade partner of the americans in the regionhe americans who are occupying the country of the two holy mosques and supporting their jewish brothers with money arms and men to occupy palestine and kill and displace muslims there denying these aggre ssors the huge profits they make from their trade with us would be very important help in the jihad against them it would be tantamount to moral support to reflect our anger and hatred toward them by doing that we will have contributed to ridding our holy sites of the jews and christians and forced them to leave our land defeated god willing we expect women in the country of the two holy mosques and elsewhere to play their role by boycotting us goods if the economic boycott is coupled with the mujahidins military trikes then the enemys defeat is imminent god willingand vice versa if the muslims do not cooperate with and support their mujahidin brothers by severing economic dealings with the us enemy then they are paying him money which is the foundation of wars and armies hence prolonging the war and the muslims suffering from it security and intelligence services in the world cannot force citizen to purchase his enemies goods the economic boycott of the us enemys goods is an extremely effective weapon in order to weaken and harm the enemy nevertheless this weapon does fall under the supervision of the repressive organs before concluding we have an important very important discussion with young muslims the men of the bright future of muhammads nation our discussion with the young men is about their duty at this difficult stage in the history of our nationthe stage in which one except the young menmay god protect themhave performed their duty in all directions after those who hesitated to perform their duty to defend islam and rescue themselves and property from the oppression repression and terrorism exercised by the state the young men may god protect them moved forward to raise the banner of the jihad against the usjewish alliance which occupied islamic holy sites while others as result of the states terrorism moved forward to grant legitimacy to this great treason and big disaster the occupation of the country of the two holy mosques may god give us strength the is nothing strange about this muhammads companions were young men and the young men of today are the successor of the early ones it was the young men who killed this nations tyrant abujahl this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission

said i swear by god that if i see him i will fight with him until the strongest wins god is great this is how the young companions behaved two young men asking one another about the most important target among the enemys ranks namely to killed the tyrant of this nation and the leader of the atheists in badr namely abujahl abdal rahman binawfs role was to tell them about abujahls whereabouts this is the role required from those who have knowledge and experience about the enemys most vulnerable spots they are required to guide their sons and brothers to these spots then the young men will say what their predecessors said by god if i see him i will fight with him until the strongest wins abdalrahman binawfs story about umayyah binkhalaf reflects the extent of bilals insistence on killing the head of atheism he said the head of atheism is umayyah bin khalafno life for if he survives few days ago news agencies carried stat ement by the occupiercrusader the us defense secretary in which he said that he has learned one lesson from the riyadh and khubar blasts namely not to retreat in front of the terrorist cowards we tell the defense secretary that this talk makes people laugh and reflects the scale of your fears where was that false courage in beirut after the bombings of 1403h corresponding to 1983 which dismembered you by killing 241 soldiers most of them from the marines where was that false courage in aden following two bombing incidents which caused you to depart in less than 24 hours but your great scandal was in somalia after several months of media propaganda about the united states might after the cold war and its leadership of the new world order you poured tens of thousands of international troops including 28000 americans into somalia however after minor battles in which scores of your troops were killed and us pilots body was dragged through the streets of mogadishu you left the country defeated and carrying your dead clinton emerged before the world threatening to take revenge but the threat was prelude to the withdrawal process god shamed you and you had to pull out your impotence and weakness were evident the picture of you being defeated in the three islamic cities beirut aden and mogadishu pleased every muslim and believer i say if the sons of the country of the two holy mosqueswho went to fight the russians in afghanistan the serbs in bosniaher zegovina and who are now fighting in chechnya and god has granted them victory over the russians who are allying with youand they are also fighting in tajikistanbelieve in the need to fight against atheism everywhere they have the strength and enthusiasm in the land in which they were born to defend their greatest holy sites the holy kabah the qiblah of all muslims they also know that muslims in the world portion of the text is missing at this point if pagination of fax for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material

the jerusalem wound is painful in my body it is like fire inside i have never betrayed god but states have and their grandfather asim bi nthabit said when the atheists requested him to negotiate and not to fight what do i have to losei am already too old death is truth and life is falsehoodif i do not fight you then i am foolish young men believe you apparently still addressing the united states are responsible for what your jewish brothers are doing in palestine and lebanon namely killing and making muslims homeless and violating their rights you are openly supplying them with money and weapons and more than 600000 children have died in iraq as result of the shortages of food and medicines caused by your unjust embargo on iraq whose children are ours so you and the saudi regime are held responsible for the blood of those innocent people all this causes us to revoke any treaty ahd between us as the prophet peace be upon him considered the alhudaybiyah peace null and void after quraysh helped bani bakr against the prophets allies so he fought against quraysh and opened mecca and he considered the agreement with bani qayn aqa null and void because jew from among them harmed woman in marketplace but you killed hundreds of thousands of muslims and encroached on their holy sites it is now clear that those claiming that the blood of the soldiers of the us enemy who is occupying muslim country is protected are repeatingunder compulsionwhat is dictated by the regime for fear of its oppression and in order to be on the safe side it is incumbent on every tribe in the arabian peninsula to fight for gods cause and purge their territory of these occupiers god says that it is permissible to shed their blood and seize their property and anyone who kills person the booty is his almighty god said but when the forbidden months are past then fight and slay the pagans wherever ye find them and seize them beleaguer them and lie in wait for them young men know that the humiliation inflicted on muslims through the occupation of their holy sites can onl be eliminated through the jihad and explosives they repeat the poet s words humiliation can onl be eliminated through bullets and the shedding of blood i tell the young men of the islamic wo rld who fought in afghanistan and bosnia herzegovina with their money live s tongues and pens that the battles has not ended yet i remind them of gabriels discussion with the messenger of god afte r the alahzab battle when the messenger of god arrived in medina he put his wea pon aside gabriel came up to him and said have you laid down your weapon by god the angels have not yet laid down their weapons so move with those who are with you to bani qurayzah as i will be moving in front of you rocking their fortifications and striking terror in their hearts so gabriel joined procession of angels with the prophet behind them joined by emigrants and supporters young men know that those who are not killed are going to die one day and that the most honorable way to die is to die for the sake of gods cause they repeat the saying of this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is

the stand of asma bint abibakr on the day of the migration the prophets migration to medina when she cut her belt in two and used one to tie the travel bag of the prophet may gods prayers and blessings be upon him and one to tie the bag of abubakr which they took with them on their journey to medina for which she was called the dy of the two belts they also remember the stand taken by nusaybah bintkab in defense of the prophet may gods prayers and blessings be upon him one day sustaining 12 wounds in the process one of them deep wound in her neck they remember the sacrifices of the women of the prophets companions who sold their jewelry to arm the muslim invading forces for gods cause our women in this era have set ma gnificent examples in sacrifice for god and in urging their sons brothers and husbands to declare jihad for god in afghanistan bosniaherzegovina chechnya and other places we beseech god to accept their sacrifices and to release their sons fathers husbands and brothers and to consolidate their faith and streng then their steps on that road of sacrifice so that gods will may prevail our women only eulogize and sing the praises of the men fighting for god as the following poem says extol only the lions who are brave in raging wars let die an honored death in war for glory in death is better than life itself they urge their brothers to go to jihad for god

library in one of the caves his machine gun which he said he seized in one of the battles against the soviets could be seen hanging in front of shelf of heritage books page 5 carries the text of the interview with photograph of bin ladin and atwan walking among trees among snow captioned the most prominent saudi oppositionist usama bin ladin accompanies colleague abdalbari atwan on tour in the khorasan mountains atwan based on sources close to the investigation some us newspapers reported recently that those who carried out the alkhubar operation are from the shiite hizballah of saudi arabia what is your opinion bin ladin regimes throughout the world and in the arab world tend to lay the blame on other quarters or accuse any opposition of working for foreign quarters over the past three decades we have noticed that any reformist endeavor tends to be accused of working for the united states and israel but now that it has become clear that the regions states are in one way or another agent s for the united states and israel these states have invented other means such as accusing other quarters of such actions in bid to divert attention from the truth about the legitimate opposition and also to prevent people from interacting with those who carried out the ope rations there are political objectives behind these rumors aimed at diverting attention as for the size of the opposition it includes all sectors including the security and the military whole people has been humiliated and persecuted and the group that has been humiliated most is the army on which thousands of millions of dollars have been spent only to discover later that it needs those foreign forces this is in ddition to the economic harm inflicted on the people as result of the money spent on us forces cab drivers now say that their sons are unemployed because the budget is spent on us forces and weapons atwan some people consider operations against us forces terrorism and describe you as leader of islamic terrorism bin ladin terrorismif it is against criminals thieves and banditsis legitimate thing adopted by all states in all ages the blameworthy terrorism is the kind committed by thieves against nations what happened in the riyadh and alkhubar blasts was praiseworthy terrorism because it was against th ieves not individuals but major states which went there to plunder the riches of this nation and to encroach on its greatest holy sites it is great honor for every muslim to defend his qiblah direction to which muslims turn in praying and liberate it from these aggressors who are plundering its riches with regard to their describing the mujahidin as terrorists the following proverb applies to them she found comfort in accusing of her own illnesses it is these aggressors who are committing the objectionable terrorism suffice it to point to the suffering of the muslim people in palestine and the disgraceful us stances and its use of the veto which in itself is terrorism this is addition to the qana massacre and the blockade imposed on iraq which has caused the death of over 600000 innocent children for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 30 the highest degree of injustice is what happened at the sharm alshaykh meeting the united states is using the veto against the muslim people in palestine who have been persecuted for over century but when only few scores of jews were killed world leaderssome of whose hands are stained with blood such as yeltsin whose hands are stained with the chechens bloodgot together such propaganda will not dissuade muslims from defe nding their religion by themselves atwan in your recent message you declared jihad against us forces and demanded that washington goods be boycotted and many people expected operations along the lines of the alkhubar operation but nothing has happened what is your opinion bin ladin the military are aware that preparations for major operations require time in contrast with small operations it took several months when the united states wanted to hit iraq in its brutal attack on the nation and start the occupation of the land of the two holy mosques saudi arabia if we wanted to carry out small operations it would have been easy to do so immediately after the statements even the nature of the battle requires qualitative operations that affect the adversary which obviously requires good preparation we had thought that the riyadh and alkhubar blasts were sufficient signal to sensible us decisionmakers to avert real battle between the is lamic nation and us forces but it seems that they did not understand the signal atwan what is that signal bin ladin understanding the signal means withdrawing all forces from the region because we believe that the us government committed the biggest mistake when it entered peninsula which nonmuslim nation has ever entered for 14 centuries despite the presence of imperialist forces in the region they all feared to enter the two holy mosques area and remained in the fringes such as yemen and oman the british and others respected the feel ings of more than 1 billion muslims which is why they did not occupy the land of the two holy mosques us interests had not been harmed by the us nonentry into the peninsula since oil was being sold to the united stateswe are not going to drink it nevertheless they managed to impose policy which reduced prices to an unrealistic level their entry was arbitrary and reckless action they have entered into confrontation with nation whose population is 1 billion muslims they made another mistake when they relied on reports which do not reflect the real anger of the masses in the islamic world the coming days alayyam alqaribah god willing will prove that that decision was the biggest strategic mista ke the united states has ever committed it can only be redressed by withdrawing and suspe nding all material support for the jews in our first qiblah in palestine atwan you are launching these threats from 2500 meters up in the afghan mountains 2000 miles or more from the arab region do you believe that there is something which is difficult to understand here this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 31 for official use only bin ladin that could be correct if i was talking about the country of the two holy mosques on the grounds that i am one of that countrys sons or dissociating myself from nation whose territory begins from the east of the earth to the west min mashriq alard ila almaghrib and whose lands are linked together i am talking about their all muslims qiblah which i want to liberate from the infidels this na tion is linked together like electricity i am talking about the nation as whole i am not addressing the sons of the peninsula only us interests exist throughout the islamic world the world has become small village and with gods he lp the contacts exists and the interaction is there the nation has been prevented from hearing word of truth from its sons which is why our elite ulema have been put in the jails of the islamic world especially the kingdoms jails the influence is there and we are satisf ied that the interac tion is continuing and we hope to reach the ignition point not in long time atwan you remained silent for long time and suddenly decided to surface after comfortable stay in sudan how did you move from afghanistan to sudan and what was the turning point that prompted you to shoulder this big opposition responsibility bin ladin after the saudi government harassed the ulema dismissed them from their jobs in universities and mosques and prevented the distribution of their tapes i decided that if it was going to prevent them from speaking i would begin to promote virtue and repudiate vice something which had been suspended then the state prevented the clerics from speaking so we set up the advice co mmittee and began to reveal the truth and clarify matters seeking reform and guidance for the nation and reminding people of the long time our ulema had spent working to reform society through good preaching statements were issued from s udan and when the saudi government discovered the great impact and effect of these statements it transcended all its disagreements with the sudanese regime which had exerted great efforts to rectify its relations with the riyadh government and to end the boycott but encountered lack of response and arrogance after statement 17 was issuedit was an op letter to the king on the occasion of the cabinet reshufflethe sa udi government contacted the s udanese government at the highest level requesting r econciliation on the condition that usama bin ladin and the sons of the two holy mosques accompanying him in sudan were expelled and that they stopped issuing statements atwan how did you receive the decision and did you understand their position bin ladin the sudanese government at the highest level inf ormed of its difficult position and the scale of the saudi pressure they asked to stop issuing statements on the day i was told to stop issuing statement s i sought to find an alternative land capable of bearing the word of truth so god helped and we came to the land of khorasan once again we are in an invincible has inah land which enjoys security pride and immunity against the humiliation and subjuga tion to which our brothers are subjected in our country for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 32 atwan did you go to sudan at an invitation from the government or from another quarter bin ladin i went to sudan by myself and without an invitation atwan did you expect the saudi government to request your departure bin ladin the possibility existed and we had arra nged some alternatives such as afghanistan this is why we d retained our camps there so we returned to our home the islamic world as whole is home for every muslim atwan what did the sudanese government gain from the decision to expel you bin ladin nothing significant as you have heard and us pressures on sudan have continued and increased since i left us official said that bin ladins expulsion is good step but it the sudanese government still has to do great deal to prove its good intentions atwan in your recent message you referred ambiguously to lesson you had taught the americans in yemen but you gave details can you clarify that bin ladin with regard to yemen i do not want to add anything significant however the press said that the americans left yemen in less than 24 hours and that those who hit the airport and tried to blow up us bus at aden airport did so because us forces had entered yemen by force and were heading for aden butrusghali contacted the yemeni president and told him that there was us plan to send forces to restore security in somalia and we hope that you will give it the united states base because we want to use aden airport as rear base the yemeni government was surprised by the aircraft and some young men carried out an action against them so the us forces had to leave in less than 24 hours atwan did you fight the americans in somalia bin ladin the only nonsomali group which fought the americans was the arab mujahidin brothers who had come from afghanistan the us government knew for certain that we were fighting it and it had announced that there were extremist non somali forces fighting against it and they meant us these were successful battles in which we inflicted big losses on the americans we used to hunt them down in mogadishu aidid denied any responsibility and he was telling the truth the war in which we are currently engaged with the united states is not tee first and we pray to god to grant us victory over them just as he did before atwan but the us forces in saudi arabia are wellfortified compared with those which were in somalia and they have recently been moved to the alkharj base this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 33 for official use only bin ladin things are possible with gods help their fortifications will not impede the faithful mujahidins resolve god willing we were surpris ed by the us soldiers psychological level in the somali war there was nothing for him to fight for it was just media show there is comparison between him and the russian fighters against whom we fought in afghanistan the russian soldier is more courageous and patient than the us soldier i took up arms against the soviets in afghanistan for 10 years and we believe that our batt with the united states is easy compared with the battles in which we engaged in afghanistan and we ar now more determined to continue until we meet god meaning until death atwan after the taleban moveme nt seized power in kabul it wa s reported that your presence as afghan arabs was longer considered desirable is this true bin ladin our relations with the taleban are good according to them they consider us similar to the emigrants who left mecca for medina who were received in medina by the alansar followers of the prophet mohammad it is relationship based on piety and righteousness we feel completely comfortable with cooperating with the taleban great achievements have been scored since the taleban elem ents came to the areas in which we are based especially with regard to applying the shariah spreading security and eliminating fear in their areas and the extent of the peoples acceptance of the application of islam and gods law is now clear it is also clear how the people have welcomed this shar iah and bad aspects such as the actions committed by thieves and others have disappeared interviewer if your relations with taleban deteriorate for one reason or another will you return to sudan bin ladin i can never return to sudan not because i am not interested in sudan but because the mountains are our natural place atwan what about iraq bin ladin iraq is not on the cards the choice is between afghanistan and yemen yemens topography is mountainous and its people are tribal armed and allow one to breathe clear air unblemished with humiliation atwan with or without the yemeni governments knowledge bin ladin it is the same atwan do you believe tha t that will happen soon bin ladin i am not thinking of doing that in the foreseeable future atwan some people accuse you of financing extremist jihad movements in libya egypt algeria and elsewhere what truth is there is this for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 34 bin ladin naming numerous countries of the islamic world will change nothing in the reality we deal with the islamic world as one state we cooperate with people on the basis of piety and righteousness and according to our capacity and capabilities because we are one nation with one religion and one qiblah lot of what is said by the media contains clear exaggerations atwan what is the size of your wealth is it in billions as the western media say bin ladin i praise god for granting us belief rescuing us from the darkness and moving us to the light it is our duty to spread this light in the world through the means sanctioned by almighty god he has granted us health and we praise him he has granted us money sufficient god willing to repulse the unjust attacks committed against our nation it is the duty of the nation as whole to use its money in the jihad so that gods religion will prevail atwan did you think like others of turning to european state and did you visit london secretly or openly bin ladin i would rather die than live in any european state some arab governments are circulating such rumors in bid to distort my reputation muslims are not supposed to be adjacent to nonmuslim societies it is not true that i thought about going to london or applying for visa such rumors are designed to defame they are circulated by hired newspapers which are too lowly to be responded to atwan how did you feel when us forces began to arrive in the arabian peninsula and then launch raids on iraq bin ladin it was clear that it was an occupation of the islamic countries and muslim holy sites my people or most of the peoples sons were shocked by the fatwas religious rulings issued by people in whom they had had full confidence so we had to wait until this shock disappeared right should be followed men are judged on the basis of their adherence to right praise be to god we succeeded in revealing the truth to the people and the nation in the country of two holy places now knows that their holy sites are under dual usisraeli occupation atwan it is noted that you are focusing on or giving priority to isla mic issues other than palestine many people criticize you for this what is your opinion bin ladin interest in issues is determined by their closeness to the peoples life and their sequence without doubt the afghan issue was the most recent responsibility compared with the alaqsa mosque and then came the country of the two holy mosques the event was hot issue and prompted the nations interest so god helped us to stage the jihad in afghanistan the same pplied to the two holy mosques they were occupied recently compared with the occupation of the alaqsa mosque whic h made them more important because they are the qiblah of all muslims this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 35 for official use only atwan did you fight against the secession in yemen bin ladin it is documented in south yemeni security departments that we fought the communist socialist party before the union and the union plan because they are atheist communist and oppressive socialists they oppressed the people destroyed everything attacked gods religion and sanctified their party saying nothing is louder than the partys voice i delivered number of lectures in mosques inciting muslims to fight them the socialists which prompted the saudi government to prevent from delivering any speeches but with gods grace the youths continued the jihad and we continued to cooperate with them against the heads of atheism in the socialist party atwan we noted that in your recent message you excluded british and french forces from any threat to hit them focusing instead on the us forces in the peninsula only can you explain this bin ladin the message to the europeans is clear hasten to leave the peninsula true the main forces in terms of numbers are the us forces the logical thing for the wise people in europe is to withdraw their forces before the battle blazes especially as they have nothing at all there now that the united states has seized everything we hope that they will make that decision and not delay it atwan but europe does not intend to withdraw and is forming rapid deployment force bin ladin we believe that they will withdraw the earlier the better for them their intervention is arbitrary and unjustifiable they are mobilizing their energies in the interests of the united states nd it is in control of the oil t ap or the largest oil complex in the world an action which will have negative effects on them as well atwan it is clear that the islamic moderation tide is expanding while extremism is declining are you not thinking of reconsidering your calculations and admitting the failure of extremism in algeria egypt and elsewhere bin ladin islam is moderate religion it is the religion of muhammad peace be upon him everything in it is just and right words and explanations are used to clarify the matters which can be ex plained and almighty god s sanctioned aldawah preaching this is justice and moderation with regard to the matters in which spearheads meaning weapons need to be used it is just right if some people confuse the two islam is not responsible since the error is in the application if anyone means by violence and renunciation of violence to prevent us from staging the jihad he has deviated from the right path the jihad is part of our shariah and the nation cannot dispense with it in its fight against its enemies since it abandoned the jihad the nation has been suffering the calamities of murder disposession and plunder at the hands of the crusaders and their allies led by the united states and israel for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material

great pressures have been exerted on them for the sake of my return atwan is there any mediation by the government for the sake of reconciliation and when was the most recent one bin ladin the most recent of these mediations was eight months ago they promised to return my identity card passport and money they said i can return to the kingdom dignified and respected if i say through the media that the king is muslim my reply was that we firmly believe that the regime has passed numerous laws without referring to god and appointed itself as lawmaker and colawmaker with god this is unbelief as endorsed by the ulema and the book of almighty god he does not share his command with anyone koranic verse i refer anyo ne who criticizes for this attack on the regime to thelorious verse god loveth not that evil should be noised abroad in public speech except where injustice hath been done god verily says the truth atwan it has been reported that you were exposed to an assassination attempt in sudan during the attack on mosque in omdurman in 1993 and another in your house late in shaban 1993 bin ladin we used to meet with the brother guests at 1700 hours every evening on that day and for reason known to god i was late then i heard barrage of bullets fired on the guest room which is detached from the house some bullets were fired at so i took my weapon and went to position overlooking the house to investigate the matter i gave my eldest abdallah weapon and told him to take position inside the house i thought that an armed group had attacked the guards and we prepared ourselves for clash but it was discovered that the attack was aimed directly at the guest room which was stormed by three young men who opened fire at the guests three of whom were seriously wounded they opened fire on the place where i used to sit one guest was hit in the abdomen another in the thigh and the third in the leg the brothers clashed with them there were sudanese security forces near the house so they clashed with them killing two and wounding the third some of the brothers sustained minor injuries atwan in your opinion who was behind that attempt bin ladin we believe that the regimes in our arab region are now pursuing bad policy and carrying the arrests to excess not to extract information through torture but to create wing of young men who believe in declar ing all society infide l so as to use this wing indirectly to kill any of societys groups atwan what about the second attempt bin ladin the second attempt was in the althawrah mosque in omdurman when group tried to kill while i was performing my prayers this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 37 for official use only

to the frontier with pakistan there i must wait for some one who might take to bin ladin passage omitted i have been told not to watch out and tell nobody my plans i wait for days and begin to think the intermediary will never show up but at last he arrives he says he has contacted bin ladin by radio at base 5 miles away and is trying to fix meeting bin ladin is not prepared for to interview him on film however and it is great disappointment instead i prepare questions and show my intermediary how to use my camera i want him to do the interview several nights later he returns the meeting is arranged and we are to leave immediately as we walk from my hotel he tells that the americans supplied small tracking device to terry waite before he left for negotiations in beirut i ask him what would happen if i had such device hidden in my clothes it is made cleari would not return alive nearby we are picked up by vehicle with five men inside carrying submachine guns two hours drive from jalalabad i finally meet bin ladin video shows photograph of gwyn roberts sitting with bin ladin this photograph is my record of an extraordinary meeting he tells the sa udi government wants to pretend everything is stable in the kingdom they can draw attention away from the internal problems by blaming them onto the shiah and linking them to iran days later my video cassettes are returned apparently showing the camp used by bi n ladin video shows bin ladin cutting to show stone building protected by lookout posts cutting to show tanks on an embankment my intermediary has indeed filmed bin ladin but although some of my questions are touched upon this is not my interview the cassette is clearly intended for bin ladins own followers in the middle east it has frightening implications for westerners in saudi bin ladin identified by screen caption in arabic fading into english translation the prophet has said that the people of the peninsula are duty bound to expel the unbelievers from their country when they come from abroad with their man and weapons in number and power that exceeds that of the people of the area now the oppressive occupier with its military machine and armed forces are once again threatening our muslim lands what is even worse is that the occupier has retur ned to violate th muslims greatest and holiest lands and the bombing of riyadh and alkhubar were clear indication for the crusading forces to correct this grave mistake and for them to depart before it is too late for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and

ame rican military but also demand the expulsion of civilians moreover i emphasize that this war will not only be between the two people of the sacred mosques and the americans but it will be between the islamic world and the americans and their allies because this war is new crusade led by america against the islamic nations break in recording roberts bin ladin claims it was his followers who forced american troops to leave somalia in 1993 he saves his most chilling comment for his final address to the camera bin ladin in arabic fading into english translation i confirm that all the youth and the whole nation should concentrate their efforts on the americans and the zionists because they are the head of the spear that has been pointed at the nation and delivered into the nations heart and that every effort concentra ted on the americans and the zionists will bring good direct and positive results therefore if someone can kill an american soldier it is better than wasting his energy on other matters bin ladin cited on prince sultans us visit london alislah in arabic 3 mar 97 p1 article from bulletin 48 issued by the islamic reform movement of saudi arabia irm received by fax new offer for bin ladin fbis translated text having lost hope of persuading the taleban movement to hand over saudi dissident usama bin ladin the saudi government and the parties collaborating with it abandoned the request for his extradition and asked instead for bin ladin to be silenced and his activities frozen all the parties exerted pressure to have the shaykh silenced but the movement always refused to do that and ignored the requests and the reports of delegations coming from and going to the embassy of the custodian of the two holy mosques in pakistan became jo ke among taleban circles who declared that their commitment to the shaykh is principled and cannot be backtracked on the saudi embassy recently tried to send direct message to shaykh bin ladin himself to offer not to demand his extradition in return for his stopping attacking the united states and saudi arabia the shaykhs advisers say the offer is like trying to exchange something you do not own for something you cannot do meanwhile the bureau for the study of islamic conflicts has quoted shaykh bin ladin as saying the following regarding prince sultans visit to the united states this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 39 for official use only we understand that the visit was an enthronement ceremony by the americans for sultan to declare him king of the country of the two holy mosques in place of king fahd leapfrogging crown prince abdallah the meaning of this is clear and conspicuous the united states which excluded the people of the peninsula from its political calculations has now excluded the saud from the process of choosing the countrys ruler as result of this us foolishness we expect further widening of the resistance against the us occupation of the country of the two holy mosques and also the zionist occupation of the palestinian land we are not interested much in who is in power in the country as long as he is under the protection of the us crusading occupation what we are interested in is our peoples awareness of the dimensions of the current battle and the need for them to join the mujahidin and get ready for the day of the decisive confrontation with its heavy costs in terms of money and lives everything is of little importance when it comes to defending gods religion islamic holy places and muslim countries for the sake of applying gods law bin ladin charges us involvement in china bombings islamabad the muslim in english 15 mar 97 pp 1 11 news analysis by observer bin ladin dissident

published ben ladin has accused the united states of trying to sabotage relations between china and the muslim world through the cia he charged the cia of being the brain behind the latest explosions in china categorically denying any us support for taliban ben ladin even promised action to bring about an understanding between pakistan iran afghanistan and china according to ben ladins thinking this new axis would block attempts to forge axis between india russia central asian republics china and iran speaking on afghanistan he re iterated that the afghan civil war was over and taliban are the legitimate rulers nd that on both short long term an islamic government in afghanistan would re affirm panislamism by kabul and total support for all islamic causes this would be good news for the suppressed people of kashmir and pakistan since an islamic afghanistan would provide strategic depth for pakistan the us have been hunting high and dry as published for ben ladin since washington

of taliban but his exact where about still unknown fearing his growing influence and revolutionary posture the cia planned physical liquidation for alleged involvement in aiding extreme muslim groups

head of the saudi committee of the defence of legitimate rights ayman alzawahiri of the egyptian islamic jihad and ashra alhadi of the egyptian islamic group the cia leaked reports accusing ben ladin

support to bahrain with tacit support from saudi arabia used bahrain force to occupy the qatari island of huwar believed to be rich in oil both ben ladin and qatar strongly denied any involvement in the bombings of the us military bases in saudi arabia however the cia is building its case against ben ladin even though evidences against him are only ci rcumstantial amongst evidences attributed to ben ladin are his statements and telegrams he received from some antius groups following the bombings of the us military targets in saudi arabia moreover ben ladin issued strong political statements opposing the us military presence in saudi arabia strictly from religious point of view to his mind foreign forces should be allowed to stay on the sacred soil of hijaz initially the us held out that its military presence in saudi arabia was temporary and that it would withdraw its troops once kuwait was liberated in recent interview ben ladin called for jihad against foreign troops whether us british or french this has widened the net of his adversaries and increased british french intelligence cooperation and their joining hand with the cia to counter the activities of ben ladin and his

activists in france and their handing over to the algerian military almost all those arrested by french author ities and handed over to algeria were summarily executed on charges of planning to topple the military junta ben ladin also accuses the british of supporting authoritarian regimes in the middle east in their bid to crush the islamic movements there he said that the british were in the forefront some times even ahead of the united states in advocating continued siege collective punishment and sanctions against the muslim peoples of sudan iran libya and iraq the us state department in published white paper identifies ben ladin as one of the most significant sponsors of islamic extremist activities in the world one us report divulged that the fbi was combing pakistan and arab countries including saudi arabia to trace ben ladin and his allies only recently the fbi also opened offices in israel amman and cairo specifically to trace islamists and more so ben ladin amongst us accusations is that ben ladin is fi nancing militants while syrian president hafiz assad was training them in the bekka valley in southern lebanon which is under the control of both syria and iran the

us state department contacted the taleban government in afghanistan requesting that usama bin ladin be handed over to the united states the taleban did not deny the presence of usama bin ladin in afghanistan because the united states already has documents photographs taken from satellites and other sources which prove that bin ladin is in afghanistan the taleban flatly refused to hand bin ladin over to the united states the talebans position astonished the whole western world because it was generally believed that they were being supported by the united states and that the united states is trying to counterbalance irans influence in afghanistan through the taleban after this declar ation regarding usama bin ladin we decided to meet the person who is wanted in various cases not only in the united states and saudi arabia but also in egypt and yemen usama bin ladin is not only accused of being involved in the bomb blasts in riyadh and alkhobar in which several us military

military training from usama bin ladin in afghanistan usama bin ladin has gained international importance this interview was conducted in view of his important role there was way to contact usama bin ladin in islamabad or in peshawar so i hamid mir decided to visit jalalabad along with pakistans photographer mazhar ali khan from there i reached usama bin ladin with the help of representative of maulvi yunus khalis in the dark of night we could not tell what route we took to reach usama bin ladin it was long distance quite difficult and it was dark we stayed with usama bin ladin for one night

the conspiracy we believe that the united states was behind his killing pakistan you are businessman how come you took up the kalashnikov ladin we were 25 brothers my father used to say that he gave birth to 25 sons for jihad the spirit of jihad was invigorated when the jews desecrated baitul maqdas in december 1979 we learned that russian troops entered afghanistan at that time i decided to wage jihad against russia and came to afghanistan pakistan during the war against the russian forces in afghanistan the united states and saudi arabia helped the mujahidin so why have you turned against united states and saudi arabia ladin the united states was not interested in our jihad it was only afraid that russia would gain access to warm waters the united states helped the mujahidin in order to contain russia the mujahidin st arted their resistance much earlier the united states and the head of saudi intelligence turki alfaisal used to get money from the government and give it to the cia the cia used to buy ammunition and give it to the mujahidin the cia embezzled quite bit in the arms purchases as soon as gorbachev announced the withdrawal of russian forces from afghanistan the united states and saudi arabia stopped their assistance for mujahidin the united states does not want an islamic government in afghanistan therefore an attempt was made to establish coalition government consisting of najibullah and mujahidin groups in 1992 butrus butrus ghali came to islamabad for this purpose but i made all the mujahidin groups agree on the point that an alliance with najibullah is not acceptable we were fighting against the communists and now the united states was pressuring us to cooperate with those very same communists the united states has principles to

hekmatyar had made an alliance with him but now he is left alone the taleban have to fight against dostum only rabbani masud and hekmatyar participated in jihad they played good role but it was not good that they started this infighting in afghanistan rabbani and masud started getting assistance not only from their former enemy russia but also collaborated with india it is sad that even hekmatyar joined this antipakistan lliance but now the government in afghanistan is not antipakistan pakistan the us state department considers you responsible for the bomb blasts in riyadh and alkhobar what do you say in this regard ladin only americans were killed in the explosi ons in riyadh and alkhoba saudi citizen suffered any injury when i got the news about these blasts i was very happy this was noble act this was great honor but unfortunately i did not conduct these explosions personally but i would like to say to the saudi people that they should adopt every tactic to throw the ame ricans out of saudi territory pakistan it is alleged that you were involved in terrorist action against the us troops in somalia ladin it is true that my companions fought with farah adids forces against the us troops in somalia but we were fighting against us terrorism under the cover of united nations the united states trie d to establish its bases in somalia so that it could get control over sudan and yemen every islamic country is our home the united states had forcefully entered our home in palestine and iraq it had massacred muslims but in somalia it claimed that it would provide shelter to the muslim s the united states is deceiver we waged jihad against it my associates killed the americans in collaboration with farah adid we are not ashamed of our jihad you will be as tonished that farah adid had only 300 soldiers while i had sent 250 mujahidin we got moral support from local muslims in one explosion one hundred americans were killed then 18 more were killed in fighting one day our men shot down an american helicopter the pilot got out we caught him tied his legs and dragged him through the streets after that 28000 us soldiers fled somalia the americans are cowards we made it clearto the world that we will not let americas new world order work pakistan the peacekeeping force appoint ed in somalia included pakistani contingents too were pakistani soldier also killed in fighting against your men ladin not at all us soldiers used to keep pakistani troops in front for their own safety the pakistani troops were sent to attack radio station there were landmines in that area the pakistani soldiers were killed by those landmines the islamic countries who this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without

state are both jews cooperation with united states is in fact cooperation with the jews i believe that the government of pakistan and the united states are responsible for the death of pakistani soldiers in somalia pakistan how did you go to sudan from afghanistan and then come back to afghanistan ladin after the withdrawal of soviet troops from afghanistan i went to sudan for some construction work after our jihad in somalia the united states asked sudan to expel sudan was promised that economic assistance to it will be restored so i came back to afghanistan but assistance to sudan was not restored pakistan western media have been giving an impr ession that the taleban were being supported by the united states but the taleban have refused to hand you over to the united states what is the reason for that ladin i dont believe that taleban are being supported by the united states in fact the previous government in pakistan misled the us government benazir bhutto and nasirullah babar gave an impression that they were supporting the taleban this gave the taleban bad name the taleban were definitely fighting against the enemies of pakistan but they cannot be labeled as agents of pakistan or united states the reason pakistan supports the taleban is that pakistan is sure that taleban will never collaborate with india pakistan iran says that the taleban are being supported by united states and they are fighting to safeguard us interests ladin the united states c onsiders the most dangerous threat if the taleban do not hand over to the united states then how can they be us agents in fact iran wanted to establish its influence over kabul through abdul ali mazari after mazaris murder the plan failed and misunderstanding emerged between iran and taleban the united states is the common enemy of both iran and the taleban one day relations between iran and afghanistan will improve the unite d states wants to incite conflict between china and the muslims the muslims of xinjiang are being blamed for the bomb blasts in beijing but i think these explosions were sponsored by the american cia if afghanistan pakistan iran and china get united the united states and india will become ineffective the taleban ve established the rule of allah in afghanistan the united states is opposed to the rule of allah i appeal to the muslims all over the world to support and assist the taleban differences among the muslims will be removed through their belief in one god and one book the muslim must think that the kaaba facing which they say their prayers is under the siege of jews and christians if your falls from the roof top and suffers injuries to his head and his f oot you will have to treat the head first just like that the biggest problem of the muslims

you do pakistan if i have gun i will shoot at them ladin correct this is the right method to throw america out of the gulf the united states is beefing up its forces in the gulf in bid to control the oil resources since 1973 prices of all other items have increased but oil prices did not rise much since 1973 the price of petrol has increased only 8 dollars per barrel while the prices of other items have gone up three times the oil prices should also have gone up three times but this did not happen price of american wheat has increased threefold but the price of arab oil has not risen threefold the increase was not more than few dollars over period of 24 years because the united states is dictating to the arabs at gunpoint we are suffering loss of 115 dollars per barrel every day only saudi arabia produces 10 million barrels oil per day and thus the loss is one billion dolla r per day total loss is more than 2 billion dollars in the past 13 years the united states has caused us loss of more 1100 billion dollars we must get this money back from the united states the total population of muslims all over the world is more than 1 billion if every muslim family is given 11000 dollars then the 1100 billion dollars will be repaid muslims are starving to death and the united states is stealing the ir oil it buys oil from us at low prices and then makes us buy its tanks and fighter airplane s by projecting israel as threat in this manner the united states takes all its money back pakistan but there are prous governments in all the arab countries except libya sudan and iraq how then will us influence be removed ladin russia was the head of the communist bloc with the disintegration of russia communism withered away in the eastern europe similarly if the united states is beheaded the arab kingdoms will wither away the biggest crime the united states has committed is that it has infiltrated our holy land against whom are the 120000 us soldiers fighting in saudi arabia what has happened to the muslim selfesteem cant they defend their holy kaaba themselves before the dawn of islam when abraha had invaded at kaaba god almighty had sent bir ds ababeels whic h dropped pebbles on them and made them run away now there are 1 billion muslims in the world god will not send birds muslims will have to rise themselves the muslims should be worried about kaaba rather than the white house pakistan which is your ideal personality in present age ladin shiekh salman oudah he is imprisoned in saudi jails because he had demanded expulsion of us troops from

here allahs rule will be established we are against communism as well as capitalism accumulation of wealth in few hands is islamic pakistan will women be allowed to get education under the pious caliphate ladin i know you have asked this question under the influence of western propaganda the taleban do not oppose education for women hazrat aisha was great scholar of islamic law she is the na rrator of largest number of hadith therefore we are not against the education of women but we are against creating unislamic conditions in the name of education pakistan what is the difference between the pious caliphate and the present democratic system ladin they are totally different from each other consultation is very important in islam but the consultation can be held only to appoint pious and wise person as ruler under the present democratic system such people become rulers who are not pious the parliaments make such laws which are unislamic getting military training is duty of every muslim but democratic governments hand persons like ramzi yusuf over to the united states four of my sons are imprisoned in saudi arabia on the instructions of the united states who claims to be the

the mountains of eastern afghanistan usama bin ladin regarded by washington as the wests most dangerous muslim fundamentalist enemy has warned americans of renewed onslaught against their forces in saudi arabia in an interview with the independent the 44year old billionaire saudi dissident who led an army of arab fighters against the soviet occupation of afghanistan claimed that he had now secured the support of thousands of pakistanis for his jihad holy war against us troops in the gulf he also acknowledged for the first time that his guerrillas had fought street battles against us forces during the illfa ted mission to somalia he had he said sent faxes to king fahd and all main departments of the saudi government informing them of his termination to pursue jihad against the americans he even claimed that some members of the saudi royal family agreed with his demand to expel the americans from the gulf an allegation that will only heighten us suspicions that some leading figures in the kingdom covertly support the dissident movement i spent the night in bin ladins guerrilla camp 8000 feet up frozen mountain in south east afghanistan as his arab mujahedin wearing camouflage jackets and cowled in kuffiah scarves patrolled the perimeter ridges armed with rocketpropelled grenades and automatic rifles the road to the camp had been gouged out of the cliffs and precipices by mr bin ladins followers during their earlier jihad against the soviet army few metres from 20 foot high air raid shelter cut for hundreds of metres through the rock of the mountainside provided protection against aerial bombing mr bin ladin himself dressed in white turban and green robes with kalashnikov assault rifle beside him sat on the floor of tent lit only by sputtering gas lamp he heaped praise upon the bombers who slaughtered 24americans in the saudi bombings at riyadh and alkhobar great act in which i missed the honour of participating and spoke in chilling almost

only occupiers of his country his claim of pakistani assistance in his holy war will cause deep concern to americans in saudi arabia where tens of thousands of pakistanis live as immigrant workers astonishingly in view of this previous threats against british and french troops in the gulf mr bin ladin claimed that the armies of both countries now provided only symbolic presence in saudi arabia at one point praising britain for not occupying the arabian peninsula during the first world war he claimed that european nations were now distancing themselves from us policy towards israel singling out the european vote against israel in the security council debate on the new jewish settlement on occupied arab land outside jerusalem but if british and french troops in the gulf can now sleep little easier in their beds in itself doubtful premise the americans appear to face another spate of bombings this is the first time in 14 centuries that the land of the two shrines mecca and medina has been occupied by nonislamic forces he said in the past the americas didnt meet with real resistance fro m muslims because scholars working for the saudi government misled the people by saying the americans were providing them with protection but now the muslim nation understands the truth and pakistanis have allied themselves with us to expel the americans pakistani religious thinkers are issuing fatwa against them if mr bin ladins view of america bordered on the eccentric at one point he suggested that individual us states might secede from the union because of washingtons support for israel his historical perspective was deeply disturbing we believe that god used our holy war in afghanistan to destroy the russian army and the soviet union we did this from the top of this very mountain upon which you are sitting and now we ask god to use us one more time to do the same to america to make it shadow of itself but he was confident we also believe that our battle against america is much simpler than the war against the soviet union because some of our mujahedin who fought here in afghanistan also participated in operations against the americans in somalia and they were surprised at the collapse of american morale this convinced us that the americans are paper tiger interview with usama bin ladin london the independent english 22 mar 97 p 14 report by robert

invited to travel in car out of town but this time instead of journey across the deserts and russianbombed villages of the plains we headed past the roaring waters of great river and upinto the mountains overtaking trucks and string of camels their heads turning towards our headlights in the gloom two hours later we stopped on stony hillside and after few minutes pickup truck came bouncing down the rough shale of the mountainside an arab in afghan robes came towards the car i recognised him at once from our last meeting in ruined village i am sorry mr robert but i must give you the first search he said prowling through my camera bag and newspapers and we set off up the track which usama bin ladin built during his jihad against the russian army the early 1980s terrifying slithering twohour odyssey along fearful ravines in rain and sleet the windscreen misting as we climbed the cold mountain when you believe in jihad it is easy he said fighting with the steering wheel as stones scuttered from the tyres bouncing down ravines into the clouds below from time to time lights winked at us from far away in the darkness our brothers are letting us know they see us he said after an hour two armed arabs one with his face covered in scarf eyes peering at us through spectacles came screaming from behind two rocks stop stop as the brakes were jammed on i almost hit my head on the windscreen sorry sorry the bespectacled man said putting down his antitank rocket launcher and pulling from his pocket an electronic metal detector the red light flicking over my body in another the road grew worse as we continued the jeep skidding backwards towards sheer cliffs the headlights illuminating terrifying gorges on either side still clutching the wheel the arab fighter turned to and smiled toyota is good for jihad he said i could only agree in the moonlight i could see clouds both below us in the ravines and above us curling round mountain tops the headlights now shining on frozen waterfalls and icy pools usama bin ladin knew how to build his wa rtime roads many an ammunition truck and tank had ground up here during the titanic struggle against the red army now the man who led those guerrillas the first arab fighter in the battle against moscow was back again in the mountains he knew there were more arab checkpoints more screaming orders to halt one can get to us here the driver muttered our meeting was almost an anticlimax usama bin ladin looked fatigued when he entered the tent in which i was waiting crosslegged on rough bl anket my shoes left at the entrance at times during our conversation he paused for at least minute to choose his words he was however studiously polite offering the usual arab courtesy of food to stranger tray of cheese olives bread and jam but his message was unequivocal even brutal while couched with the usual conditional clauses i am not against the american people only their government he said how ma ny times

the united states regarded him as the foremos t terrorist in the world as i suggested to him they did then if liberating my land is called terrorism this is great honour for and so we embarked on threeandahalf hour interview in which the us was damned for supporting israel but in which europe was faintly praised for its slow departure from american policy in the middle east for him there was difference he said between the american and israeli governm ents between the american and israeli armies but europe was beginning to distance itself from the americans especially france although he condemned french policies towards north africa he did not mention algeria but the name hovered over us for several minutes like ghost he gave pakistani wall poster in urdu which proclaimed the support of pakistani scholars for his holy war against the americans even colour photographs of graffiti on the walls of karachi demanding the ousting of us troops from the place of the two holy shrines mecca and medina he had he said received some months ago an emissary from the saudi royal famil who said that bin ladin would have his saudi citizenship and passport returned to him and tha t his family would receive 2 billion saudi rivals 339m pounds sterling if he abandoned his jihad declared on 23 august and went back to saudi arabia he had rejected the offer and so had his family he said the us was in saudi arabia because of its oil but more importantly because it feared along with the zionists that they and their local agents would drown in the islamic uprising of the strict is lamist taliban militia which now c ontrols threequarters of afghanistan and in whose region bin ladin now lives he said that he had struggled alongside them since 1979 we believe that taliban are sincere in their attempts to enforce islamic religious law we saw the situation here before they took over and after and have seen an obvious improvement despite these words usama bin ladin was unwilling to have taken back to jalalabad through the taliban checkpoints at midnight so i spent the night under the stars at his guerrilla camp close to the massive rockhewn airraid shelter that he built during the russian war when the arabs drove back before dawn next day they paused by the roadside to pray kneeling on rugs with their rifles beside them crying allahu akbar over the bleak landscape of rivers and snowcapped mountains and amid the pageant of stars above us great comet trailed down the sky with fiery tail unseen since the time of the pharaohs it was i learned later the halebopp comet they say that after comet there will be great war one of the arabs said to we had driven past the police barracks in jalalabad at first light but minutes later thunderous explosion tore across the road incinerating every driver within 100 metres massive blast at the local munitions store that killed at least 50 men women and children and left hundreds wounded the taliban were on the streets beating

for official use only it like locusts eating its riches and wiping out its plantations all this is happening at time in which nations are attacking muslims like people fighting over plate of food in the light of the grave situation and the lack of support we and you are obliged to discuss current events and we should all ag ree on how to settle the matter one argues today about three facts that are known to everyone we will list them in order to remind everyone first for over seven years the united states has been occupying the lands of islam in the holiest of places the arabian peninsula plundering its riches dictating to its rulers humiliating its people terrorizing its neighbors and turning its bases in the peninsula into spearhead through which to fight the neighboring muslim peoples if some people have in the past argued about the fact of the occupation all the people of the peninsula have now acknowledged it the best proof of this is the americans continuing aggression against the iraqi people using the peninsula as staging post even though all its rulers are against their territories being used to that end but they are helpless second despite the great devastation inflicted on the iraqi people by the crusaderzionist alliance and despite the huge number of those killed which has exceeded 1 million despite all this the americans are once against trying to repeat the horrific massacres as though they are not content with the protracted blockade imposed after the ferocious war or the fragmentation and devastation so here they come to annihila what is left of this pe ople and to humiliate their muslim neighbors third if the americans aims behind these wars are re ligious and economic the aim is also to serve the jews petty state and divert attention from its occupation of jerusalem and murder of muslims there the best proof of this is their eagerness to destroy iraq the strongest neighboring arab state and their endeavor to fragment all th states of the region such as iraq saudi arabia egypt and sudan into paper statelets and through their disunion and weakness to guarantee israels survival and the continuation of the brutal crusade occupation of the peninsula all these crimes and sins committed by the americans are clear declaration of war on god his messenger and muslims and ulema have throughout islamic history unanimously agreed that the jihad is an individual duty if the enemy destroys the muslim countries this was revealed by imam binqadamah in mughni imam alkisai in albadai alqurtubi in his interpretation and the shaykh of alislam not further identified in his books where he said as for the fighting to repulse an enemy it is aimed at defending sanctity and religion and it is duty as agreed by the ulema for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 58 nothing is more sacred than belief except repulsing an enemy who is attacking religion and life on that basis and in compliance with gods orde r we issue the following fatwa to all muslims the ruling to kill the americans and their allies civilians and military is an individual duty for every muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it in order to liberate the alaqsa mosque and the holy mosque mecca from their grip and in order for their armies to move out of all the lands of islam defeated and unable to threaten any muslim this is in accordance with the words of almighty god and fight the pagans all together as they fight you all together and fight them until there is more tumult or oppression and there prevail justice and faith in god this is in addition to the words of almighty god and why should ye not fight in the cause of god and of those who being weak are illtreated and oppressed women and children whose cry is our lord rescue us from this town whose people are oppressors and raise for us from thee one who will help we with gods help call on ever muslim who believes in god and wishes to be rewarded to comply with gods order to kill the americans and plunder their money wherever and whenever they find it we also call on muslim ulema leaders youths and soldiers to launch the raid on satans us troops and the devils supporters allying with them and to displace those who are behind them so that they may learn lesson almighty god said ye who believe give your response to god and his apostle when he calleth you to that which will give you life and know that god cometh between man and his heart and that it is he to whom ye shall all be gathered almighty god also says ye who believe wh at is the matter with you that when ye are asked to go forth in the cause of god ye cling so heavily to the earth do ye prefer the life of this world to the hereafter but li ttle is the comfort of this life as compared with the hereafter unless ye go forth he will punish you with grievous penalty and put others in your

the americans by prince talal brother of saudi king fahd binabdalaziz to change their view of the region so that their occupation becomes acceptable to its people bin ladin praised prince talals courage saying that this admission of the occupation of the peninsula is better than the desperate ttempts by others to conceal the shameful aspects of the occupation he also condemned the actions of some of the royal courts ulema who have gained status through the rulers money power and tyranny selling their reward in the hereafter for others lives in his statement bin ladin analyzed the reasons for what he terms the us occupation of the gulf saying we ask once again why are us forces still on our territory we get answer except some mangled words designed to confuse and we hear nothing except the americans claims concerning the protection of their ambitions in the region these claims despite the defective logic they reflect represent witness from among them the americans to this occupation exposing the liars deception and dealing strong blow to those claming to be independent franklin roosevelt admitted over 60 years ago the link between the region and us ambitions especially in the saudi kingdom for three reasons it sits on twothirds of the worlds oil reserve it controls the keys to world communication problems and there is its role in israels stability and security the views of the ame ricans leaders politicians experts nd journalists sum up all this as follows the region is the elixir of the wests industrial life as it is sitting on 70 percent of the for official use only

based on the production rates of 1410 hegira 1990 while the seven g7 industrial states including western europe possess more than 55 percent of this reserve with an expected life of more than two decades the gulf provides the lifeline for the wests industry since oil is the lifeblood of the industrial states this region represents huge consumer market especially the gulf states which import most of their necessities and nearly all their luxuries from the west and its allies there is also the zionist entity which has grown and now controls to large extent most of the wests politicians and leaders especially in the united states there is also their new enemy the islamic resurrection it must be besieged and the battle against it should be conducted on its own territory the spark that ignite d the americans spite and inf lamed their designs in the region was ramadan 1393 hegira october 1973 and the threat it posed to their ambitions in the region and the security of their allies the jews it was decided then to occupy the gulf states by seizing them di rectly the occupation was speeded up because of their fear that the islamists might seize power and that appeared at the time to be imminent throughout the region with regard to us defense policy in 1407 hegira 1987 reagan recommended the following to guarantee the ability to use vital world communication routes by taking control of them if necessary seizing the m especially with regard to transport and maritime routes to guarantee us access to strategic minerals and other vital raw mate rials whether with regard to where they are produced or the routes by which they are transported bin ladins statement went on to say lest anyone think that these ambitions disappeared years ago schwarzkopf commander of the crusade coalition forces during the gulf war said the same thing during the second gulf war in 1411 1991 and repeated it after the alkhubar incident in 1416 1996 he said it is important for us forces to stay in saudi arabia because it is friendly state and the most important state in the region it has the will the in frastructure and the financial resources to support our forces and equipment which we need to protect our interests concerning his soldiers in the gulf he said that these soldiers are defending us interests and we have to defend our interests as long as these interests are in existence so the region is occupied in the air at sea and on land the question that we put to those who dispute this axiom which is known to everyone is why did these armies come to our land seas and airspace is the aim as claimed by some naive agents to protect the weak regimes in the region from iraq this pretext has now collapsed since the leaders of the region themselves have stated that iraq longer poses any threat and all the gulf states have worked to eliminate the effects of the war and the causes of the dispute with it iraq in fact they strongly objected to the recent us threats to wage war against iraq using their territory as staging post and they demanded that the starvation and suffocation of the iraqi people be halted but the united states tr eated with contempt the views of all the gulf leaders and took notice of the slogans that it had raised earlier in order to eat up its gulf prey and it continued to increase its forces and this report may contain copyrighted

conspiracies against the islamic nation pointing out that the americans tried to fan the flames of the war in afghanistan in order to sully the image of jihad and of the mujahidin by showing them to be fighting for power bin ladin warned against richardsons mission in afghanistan and particularly against attempts to eliminate the arab mujahidin and to thwart the islamic state project in afghanistan he said that the arab afghans now spearhead the islamic rejection of us policy against the islamic nation and said that the united states is accusing them of being behind the military operations that forced it to withdraw from somalia and those that were carried out against it in yemen and in saudi arabia he revealed that us delegation visited afghanistan last month with the same mission but went home without achieving its objectives bin ladin stressed that what the united states wants from afghanistan with regard to combating islamic extremism is to prevent the taliban government from implementing the islamic shariah and to cooperate with it against the threat that the arab mujahidin pose to the united states he added however that the afghan people who have given millions of martyrs in order to establish their islamic state will not relinquish this goal and will not sell it at any price and added that the afghans will not stop championing the cause of their

vigorously entrenched in the holy land of alhijaz spreading apostasy among young people and carrying out malicious and corruptive actions they based their fatwa on number of koranic verses such as let not the believers take for friends or helpers unbelievers rather than believers ye who believe take not my and your enemies as friends and thou wilt not find any people who believe in god and the last day loving those who resist god and his apostle they also made reference to the sayings of the prophet peace be upon him including the hadith ibnabbas may god be satisfied with him said the messenger of god peace be upon him said drive the polytheists out of the arabian peninsula this is in addition to the views of the ummahs famous ulema such as shawkani who said with regard to not seeking help from polytheists and unbelievers group of ulema and this was reported by als hafii prohibited completely the idea of seeking help from polytheists they included ahmed not furthe r identified they adher ed to the statement made by aishah the prophets wife may god be satisfied with her this is also the doctrine of malik ibnalmundhir and aljawzajani maliks view is that help should be sought from atheists during invasion the group in question the afghan ulema believes that leaders of the arab islamic states should have sought help from the islamic states in the world instead of the enemies of islam because believers should help their brother believers they pointed out that all muslims in the world sacrifice their lives to protect and defend the land of alhijaz and if us forces leave the arabian peninsula now muslims should be brought in to defend it and offer their lives as sacrifice for the two holy mosques addressing muslims in the world they the afghan ulema say the enemies of islam are not limited to certain group or party all atheists are enemies of islam and they take one another as friends having made reference to number of historical events they go on to say the governments of the region have forgotten the old enmity of these atheists just as they have forgotten gods instructions and the prophets signals mentioned in detail earlier and thus the arabian peninsula has become camp for the soldiers of the enemies of islam the us army which is equipped with ground and sea weapons this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 65 for official use only they also say that the ul ema union of afghanistan re minds the islamic nation through the fatwa in question of their responsibility regarding the arabian gulf question it also alerts them that the responsibility for this question concerns not only the saudis but all muslims in the world leaders and citizen s ulema and ordina ry people the afghan ulema declare jihad based on the rules of the shariah against the united states and its followers they urge islamic governments to perform the duty of armed jihad against the enemies of islam pointing out that if muslims are lax in their responsibility the enemies of islam will occupy the two holy mosques as well just as they occupied the aqsa mosque they stress in statement ttached to the fatwa that this fatwa with the evidence and the rulings issued by early and current ulema on which it is based is not merely fatwa issued by the ulema of muslim country but rather religious fatwa that every muslim should adopt and work under usama bin ladin the saudi dissident who is re sident in afghanistan believes that this fatwa comes in response to the issue of the us forces of the country of the two holy mosques which is worsening sentence as published in statement sent to alquds arabi he said that the fatwa proves with irrefutable religious evidence that it is impermissible for these forces to enter these countries and proves the necessity to expel them from there he noted that the fatwa issued by the ulema union of af ghanistan is the same fatwa that the ulema and the sincere knowledge seekers from among the sons of the country housing the two holy mosques issued when these forces entered it eight years ago first and foremost shaykh salman alawdah and shaykh safar alhawali he pointed out that the recent sermon delivered by the imam of the prophets mosque is nothing but an example of the scale of the nations rejection of this presence he said that the mosques imam refuted the allegations that these troops came for security reasons concerning the people of the region when he said the regions security is the responsibility of the states of the region it is their right and the cause of the problems and instability in the region is the major states whic h fabricate inciden ts and then go there whenever they have fabricated an incident on the pretext of rectifying the situation or warding off danger when they are actuall the biggest danger how can wolf be shepherd having expressed his support for this

listing as good for taliban london alquds alarabi in arabic 18 may 98 p 3 unattributed report bin ladin afghanistans inclusion on us terrorism list is certificate of good conduct for taliban fbis translated text london alquds alarabi the saudi oppositionist usama bin ladin has deemed the us decision to incl ude afghanistan on the list of states sponsoring terrorism in the world certificate of good conduct for the taliban government and proof that it is not subservient to the united states as it had previously been accused of he pointed out that the united states has forgotten that some of these decisions could do more good than harm to those against whom they are issued in statement of which quds alarabi received copy the day before yesterday 16 may bin ladin said that the announcement of the us decision and the background on which the decision is based namely the taliban governments sheltering of shaykh usama bin ladin are all matters capable of refuting all the accusations against the taliban government of work ing for the united states bin ladin who has for the past two years been resident in the kandahar heights one of the taliban movements for tified locations noted that the us decision was taken after numerous visits by us envoys at various levels the most recent being the visit by us representative to the united nations bill ric hardson to afghanistan he pointed out that us efforts failed to persuade the taliban to abandon its islamic orientation in government accept the us solution to the afghan dispute and refrain from sheltering and protecting arab mujahidin he emphasized that the us motives bawaith prove the extent of the taliban governments independence adherence to its principles and decision not to bargain over these principles bin ladin whom the united states accuses of supporting terrorist islamic movements sees the us decision as an amusing political contradiction since it represents tacit recognition by the united states of the taliban government now that the united states has included it on the list of states not the list of terrorist organizations he said that us accusations of terrorism against states groups or individuals are longer of any value or credibility since everyone now knows that the united states brands as terrorist anyone state group or individual who is opposed to its imperialist policy and hegemony while it continues to practice the ugliest forms of world terrorism and support the evil of the forces of terror in the world bin ladin wondered is there any terrorism uglier or more brutal than the killing by the united states of hundreds of thousands of children women and elderly people by sentencing them to death by starvation in iraq is there any clearer sponsorship of zionist terrorism in palestine lebanon and elsewhere than the us sponsorship this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 67 for official use only he pointed out that the us decision to include the taliban government on the list of states sponsoring terrorism will not harm that government at all because it lacks credibility at the world level it also lacks the foundations for implementation inside the united states he added that the taliban government has diplomats that it the united states could expel from washington or reduce their numbers and limit their activities nor does it have financial assets that the united states could freeze in its banks concluding he said actually the taliban government had for long time been in pressing need of such us decision which clears it of the accusation that it is working for the united states and proves its adherence to its principles its own decisionmaking and its nonsubmission to external pressures including us pressure the taliban government controls twothirds of afghan territory and is engaged in conflict with the opposition forces in the north so far world states with the exception of three islamic states saudi arabia the united arab emirates and pakista have not recognized the taliban government world islamic front statement urges jihad on us israel london alhayah in arabic 19

gulf had compelled the american government to consider pulling out its troops from the kingdom another american failure he argued was its inability to form an unnatural coalition government comprising

after the end of the afghan jihad lacked leader and well thoughtout agenda the arrival of usama bin ladin saudi dissident accused by ce rtain arab and western governments of being financier of an islamic international army in afghanistan on may 18 1996 helped solve both their problems the normally fractious afghanistan based arabs not only found resourceful leader and rallying point but also someone who is very clear about his objectives this was very much evident when he recently announced the launching of an international islamic front for jihad against america and israel there are probably few hundred arab volunteers still living in afghanistan they are the leftovers of the several thousand arabs who came to afghanistan via pakistan in the 1980s to take part in the jihad against the ussrs red army and the afghan communists those left behind have nowhere else to go because they risk being caught in case they venture to return home and other country would be willing to accept them in any case presentday afghanistan continues to be their safest hideaway the ones who have returned to their countries have mostly joined the political and military struggle aimed at bringing an islamic change there known as arabafg hans these battle hardened islamists have come to be known as the most radical and dangerous of the fighters who have taken up arms against the algerian and egyptian governments it is the leftover arabs who have now rallied to the usama bin ladin banner at camp for arab fighters near the pakistan border in khost in southern afghanistan bin ladin left doubt in the minds of visiting group of journalists as to who was in command the prolonged gunfire that greeted his arrival and departure at the albadr camp made him look like hero he was tall frail and slim and walked with the help of stick and yet he commanded respect and obedience the rigorous lifestyle and the punishing discipline that the billionaire saudi has imposed upon himself has already taken its toll on his health but he remains defiant as ever his circumstances in remote borderland prompted colleague to ask him how come he is challenging the worlds only superpower and its powerful protege israel with the scant resources at his command he replied that true muslim would never be overawed by worldly power moreover he gave examples to prove that the us has been humbled

reporters he declined to be drawn into polemics concerning pakistans disputes with india even though he was categorical in condemning new delhi for exploding nuclear bombs and threatening islamabad he also complained that the pakistan government had refused to llow him and his arab mujahidin to fight in indianheld jammu and kashmir his solution for the kashmir problem was that pakistan should allow setting up military training camps for the kashmir jihad and throw its borders open to enable volunteers to infiltrate the india noccupied state and liberate it once and for all so focused was bin ladin on the real big enemy ie america that he advised china not to be drawn into conflict with its muslim minority population and instead concentrate on fendingoff the western designs against beijing the 42year old bin ladin knows the risks to his life and freedom now that he has thrown challenge to the us and israel about two dozen hooded bodyguards dressed in black cordoned him off as he moved most carried klashnikov rifles with their fingers on the trigger while few were armed with sam7 missiles he is required to shift his sanctuaries keep an eye on his own guards and screen his visitors his three wives and several children also have to be taken ca re of while living in an alien land and inhospitable terrain women and children who have lived in luxury must be finding the going tough bin ladin doesnt believe that his wealthy clan that runs construction and transport business in saudi arabia and provides services at islams holiest site masjid alharam has disowned him under pressure from the kingdoms royal family blood is thicker than water he remarked when asked whether the bin ladinfamily have declared him an outcast he gave another witt answer when asked whether he is still billionaire my heart is rich and generous he remarked when inquired about the red alert declared at the us embassy and consulates in pakistan fo llowing his call for jihad against america and israel bin ladin said the mass media must report these facts and educate the people that america is indeed vulnerable was he willing to come to pakistan why not i have lived there during the afghan jihad and have ma ny pakistani friends but i am not sure whether i can go there in the prevailing situation he replied the saudi dissident knows he has many supporters and admirers in pakistan he named some ulema and madressas which have endorsed his call for jihad against america and israel and said he was in touch with them he probably is also aware that jui leaders maulana fazlur rahman and ma ulana samiul haq tanzim nifaz shari atimohammadi chief maulana sufi mohammad and many other pakistani ulema have warned the pakistan government not to become party to american plans to nab or kill bin ladin

unaware of any new statement and interview by bin ladin obviously the taliban are in the picture as to what is happening and one could assume that bin ladin isnt doing something on his own perhaps the taliban have realised that they could put pressure on the americans and saudis to achieve certain objectives by unleashing bin ladin on them if that is true it is clever politics of which the taliban

who blessed us with the wealth of faith and islam we are pleased to express our gratitude to you and the pakistani mujahid nation we thank you for your efforts to support the mujahidins struggle to expel the us forces from the sacred land i do not need to tell you that this sacred struggle should continue until baitulmuqaddas and other holy places of muslims are liberated from the occupation of nonmuslims and the islamic shariat law is enforced on the land of god obviously for the enforcement of shariat it is essential for all muslims that they should establish an islamic system on the basis of teachings of the prophet mohammed at this moment israel and united states are dominating palestine and other holy places in such way that mujahidin are being killed and be sieged and muslims have been economically ruined therefore it is obligatory for all muslims to continue jihad by sacrificing their wealth and life as long as their holy places are not liberated from the subjugation of jews and christians this freedom is not possible until we sacrifice all our wealth and our lives as it is religious obligation for every muslim to support the mujahidin fighting for freedom of sacred places similarly they are also obligated by their religion to support the taleban government in afghanistan becaus by enforcing shariat in afghanistan taleban have established the system of god on gods land they are busy in jihad to rid the muslims of afghanistan from the tyranny of nonmuslims in conclusion i pray that may god enlighten us with the light of faith and forgive our sins and he lp

isnt the slightest change in his views about the united states and israel his tone is still bitter and he wants the muslims all over the world to stand up to the us as it was the biggest enemy of islam one couldnt have expected milder reaction from man who has been declared public enemy number one of the us and is being hunted with all the resources at the command of the worlds only superpower this was the first time he spoke publicly since may 26 when in his camp in khost he talked to group of 14 pakistani journalists who were taken to afghanistan by the pakistanbased islamic militant group harkatul ansar renamed harkatul mujahidin it was at this press conference that bin ladin flanked by his righthand man sheikh taseer abdullah and dr ayman alzawahiri leader of the islamic jihad group of egypt announced the fatwa religious decree formulated by him and several other ulema for jihad against the united states and israel the press conference and bin ladins threats to the crusaders and the jews as he likes to refer to america israel and the western allies took the taliban by surprise the supreme taliban leader mulla mohammad omar wasnt amused and he took steps to restrain bin ladin from issuing statements it seemed that bin ladin accepted the demand of his afghan hosts and kept quiet for while but the us missile attack on his base in khost on august 20 brought profound change in the situation and bin ladinand his arab lieutenants felt they must react if not in kind then verbally at least speaking on his satellite phone through dr alzawahiri who speaks fluent english bin ladin conveyed to this writer on august 21 that he and his close aides had survived the us missiles and that such aggression would not be able to dampe n his determination to carry out jihad against america and israel tell them the war has just begun the americans should now await the answer he threatened day earlier when an american attack appeared imminent after the us government decision to pull out its diplomats from pakistan and all westerners and their ngos started leaving afghanistan bin ladin had conveyed another brief message to this scribe incidentally that

reiterated on that occasion his call for jihad against all forces opposed to muslims as bin ladins threats grabbed headlines in the world media the taliban felt he had broken his promise of t talking to the press or use afg hanistans soil in pursuit of his political goals mulla omar was so angry that he declared that there cannot exist two authorities ie the taliban nd bin ladin in afghanistan that ef fectively silenced the saudi dissident and one didnt hear from him until last weeks decision by the taliban to let him speak again bin ladin had reluctantly accep ted the taliban order to keep quiet as he d little choice in view of the fact that there is hardly any ot her place in the world ex cept afghanistan for him to take refuge however he kept arguing with the taliban that he must be allowed to speak as his silence was working to his disadvantage in particular he pleaded with senior taliban leader and deputy foreign minister mulla abdul jalil who has been assigned to deal with bin din and his men for permission to talk to the international press according to bin ladin the taliban leadership thrice agreed to let him be interviewed by this scribe after the us missile att ack on afghanistan but on each occasion it backed out as it was worried his utterances would have an adverse effect and would further poison talibans uneasy relations with the us saudi arabia and other countries as an aide to bin ladin explained it was also risky to reach journalists on the satellite phone because it could be tracked down in fact the satellite phone seems to have been put off it appears that bin ladins persistence paid off certain developments contributed to the change of heart by the taliban to lift the ban on bin ladins inte raction with the press one was the speculation in the press that he wa s ill that he had cancer and was dying the taliban were thus convinced that bin ladin must be seen in flesh by reporters and shown on television to deny all such speculation it showed that even the puritan taliban who abhor television and picture of living beings could relax their rules if it suits their purpose bin ladin made the best of the opportunity and took pains to explain that he wasnt ill and daily did horseriding in the afghan desert dr alzawahiri explained that the 43 year old bin ladin was nursing sore throat and this is why he drank lots of water during the interview this was also cite d as the reason why the fasting bin ladin couldnt be interviewed in the daylight in ra mazan and would thus be unable to talkmuch due to his sore throat they may be right but one had feeling that security concerns prompted bin ladins men to arrange the interview at night in tent pitched in the afghan wilderness so alert were bin ladins aides that they erased video shot of their leader taken by this scribe with camera as he walked with the help of cane along with another shot of the group of armed men sitting in the crowde d tent as they stressed they

colleagues and taliban leaders also explained that the decision to let bin ladin be interviewed was made to enable him to clarify that he and his organisation qaeda werent involved in the bombings in kenya and tanzaniam or in other acts of terrorism anything and everything that happens anywhere in the world is now blamed on usama we thought usama and his men would be deemed guilty if he remains silent in the face of all such accusations argued dr alzawahiri the taliban leader mulla jalil agree d pointing out how man who keeps shifting his abode and has to live in mountains and deserts could pose threat to the us and sponsor bomb explosions in distant lands the recent usbritish attack on iraq also s eemed to have influenced the taliban to let bin ladin speak out and reiterate his theory that the american british and israelis could never be friends with muslims the taliban with little hope of improvement in relations with the us and saudi arabia and convinced that their government is unlikely to win international recognition also thought it was time to stop trying to appease their detractors and instead use the bin ladin card possibly to their advantage after one and half hour drive from kandahar on nonexistent unpaved road whose sideways were stated to have been mined since the soviet occupation of afghanistan one came face to face with the man whose name nowadays causes

followed bin ladin heeded the orders of his host the taliban militia that controls most of afghanistan to avoid public statements the talibans leaders evidently didnt want to complicate their budding relations with the outside world but last months us bombing of iraq evidently convinced them they had little to lose from letting bin ladin talk the exile himself wanted to deny involvement in the

highest esteem time but all those arrested are said to have been associated with you bin ladin wadih elhage was one of our brothers whom god was kind enough to steer to the path of relief work for afghan refugees i still remember him though i have not seen him or heard from him for many years he has nothing to do with the us allegations as for mohamed rashed alowha li we were informe d that he is saudi from the province of najd mamdouh salim is righteous man who memorizes the holy koran he was never member of any jihad organization the fact of the matter is that america and in particular the cia wanted to cover up their failure in the aftermath of the events that took place in riyadh nairobi dar salaam capetown kampalaand other places god willing in the futureby arre sting any person who had participated in the islamic jihad in afghanistan we pray to god to end the plight of the arrested men and we are confident they will be exonerated time if the targets of jihad are americans how can you justify the deaths of africans bin ladin this question presupposes that it is who carried out these explosions my answer is that i understand the motives of th brothers who act against the enemies of the nation when it becomes apparent that it would be impossible to repel these americans without assaulting them even if this involved the killing of muslims this is permissible under islam time how do you react to the december attack on iraq by us and british forces bin ladin there is doubt that the treacherous attack has confirmed that britain and america are acting on behalf of israel and the jews paving the way for the jews to divide the muslim world once again enslave it and loot th rest of its wealth great part of the force that carried out the attack came from certain gulf countries that have lost their sovereignty now infidels walk everywhere on the land where muhammad was born and where the koran was revealed to him the situation is serious the rulers have become powerless muslims should carry out their obligations since the rulers of the region have accepted the invasion of their countries these countries belong to islam and not to the rulers time what can

nuclear weapons how would you use these bin ladin acquiring weapons for the defense of muslims is religious duty if i have indeed acquired these weapons then i thank god for enabling to do so and if i seek to acquire these weapons i am carrying out duty it would be for muslims not to try to possess the weapons that would prevent the infidels from inflicting harm on muslims time can you describe the us air strikes on your camps bin ladin the american bombardment had only shown that the world is governed by the law of the jungle that brutal treacherous attack killed number of civilian muslims as for material damage it was minimal by the grace of god the missiles were ineffective the raid proved that the american army is going downhill in its morale its members are too cowardly and too fearful to meet the young people of islam face to face time the us is trying to stop the flow of funds to your organization has it been able to do so bin ladin the us knows that i have attacked it by the grace of god for more than ten years now the us alleges that i am fully responsible for the killing of its soldiers in somalia god knows that we have been pleased at the killing of american soldiers this was achieved by the grace of god and the efforts of the mujahedin from among the somali brothers and other arab mujahedin who had been in afghanistan before that america has been trying ever since to tighten its economic blockade against us and to arrest it has failed this blockade does not hurt us much we expect to be rewarded by god time what will you do if the taliban asks you to leave afghanistan bin ladin that is not something we foresee we do not expect to be driven out of this land we pray to god to make our migration migration in his cause time do you expect any more attacks if you stay in afghanistan bin ladin any foreign attack on afghanistan would not target an individual it would not target usama bin ladin personally the fact is that afghanistan having raised the banner of is lam has become target for the crusader jewish alliance we expect afghanistan to be bombarded even though the nonbelievers will say that they do so because of the presence of usama that is why we together with our brothers live on these mountains far away from muslims in villages and towns in order to spare them any harm time is your islamic message having an impact bin ladin winds of change

come sooner rather than later when criminal despots who betrayed god and his prophet and betrayed their trust and their nation will face the same fate time but there are many muslims who do not agree with your kind of violence bin ladin we should fully understand our religion fighting is part of our religion and our sharia those who love god and his prophet and this religion cannot deny that whoever denies even minor tenet of our religion commits the gravest in islam those who sympathize with the inf idelssuch as the plo in palestine or the socalled palestinian authorityhave been trying for tens of years to get back some of their rights they laid down arms and abandoned what is called violence and tried peaceful bargaining what did the jews give them they did not give them even 1 of their rights time america the worlds only superpower has called you public enemy number one are you worried bin ladin hostility toward america is religious duty and we hope to be rewarded for it by

s teenagers with machine guns are best not fucked with so as i watched the man arrive and his loyal soldiers discharged their weapons m ecstasy this kid was doing his best to make deaf the mountaintop in southern afghanistan was long way from home but in another way it wasnt i was almost sure tha t night that the man i had come to meet the man who was inspiring all this firepower had pres sed the

for official use only just minutes before this explosive welcome i had been told m r bin ladin will be here shortly the tall bearded man with the elaborate turban had not introduced himself by name but he seemed to be for lack of better title usama bin ladins press secretary we have prepared great welcome whenever he comes there is always celebration yellow trails from tracer bullets streaked at odd angles crisscrossing the black star crowded skies fireworks shot up and sparks fell like orange rain evaporating before they hit the ground as the gunfire continued the motorcade of three fourwheeldrives crossed the flat dirt encampment scores of bin ladins most devout followers were here all carrying chinese and russianmade machine guns several were post ed strategically with rocketpropelled grenades for months i had been trying to arrange an interview with the man now two months before the destruction of us embassies in kenya and tanzania by bin ladins truck bombs it was happening it was after midnight on this mountaintop and usama bin ladin was not yet household name in the united states still grand jury in new york had for year been hearing evidence about his role as key organizer and financier of antiamerican terrorism the fbi suspected that bin ladinor at least bin ladins moneyhad been behind everything from the world trade center bombing to the downing of american helicopters in somalia to bombings that targeted american servicemen in saudi arabia and yemen and by now bin ladin knew that his targets were beginning to wake up to the threat he posed that was the very reason i wanted to inte rview him and the reason getting such an interview would not be simple process his publicrelations apparatus is sophisticated and complex network of agents and intermediaries the first discussions took place in the old ornate jefferson hotel in washington couple of abc news producers chris isham and len tepper brought to meet with trusted contact who had good connections among islamic fundamentalists soon he sent word back we would have to travel to london and meet with some of bin ladins people bin ladin it seems has people all over two meetings both in tudorstyle homes half hours drive from central london we removed our shoes drank cider and water and made our intentions toward bin ladin known we told his people we would raise the issues that concerned him and tell his side and enough about his background so people would get broader understanding of him instead of just pounding on the terrorist on the mountain theme i told one of bin ladins agents we could frame his issues about america in such way that people might find his arguments reasonable the man smiled it may be bette r if he does not appear to be too reasonable he said from london we were to move on to islamabad and await further instructions at the marriott we had made the first cut after day in the pakistani capital man arrived and said his name was akhtar we would only ever know him as akhtar but during the next few weeks he would become the most important person in our world our passport for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material

back sw inging slightly rolling strut the walk of an urban black kid where he picked it up i never learned akhtar was afghani and spoke almost english and only little arabicjust enough so that our iraqi translator whom ill call ali could understand him akhtar told ali he would have to inspect us our rooms our gear he was such nononsense guy it sometimes just made want to laugh lesson something about being from new york or being american or hell being human makes one laugh at inappropriate times such as when in the presence of committed warriors whom your government has taken to calling terrorists good idea to check that impulse within reason also resist the urge to crack jokes especially if your hosts arent much for jokes when the knock came at my door early the next morning it was surprise akhtar and another man heavyset guy came in they just want to see you ali explained as the two men carefully looked at in my boxer shorts they looked at my open suitcase on the bed stand akhtar and the other man looked in the bathroom i was not sure what they were looking for i assumed just telltale signs that we were cia agents or something the two men left for further negotiations in alis room that night akhtar called ali at the hotel it is happening ali told when he relayed akhtars instructions be ready at 700 am and be dressed like him ali cameraman rick bennett and i immediately took cab from the hotel to rundown strip of stores and found the cash departmental store where we each purchased suit for about fifteen dollars rick went all out and got the vest suit was kneelength shirt baggy pants and ropethe white cotton belt with fringe that would hold up the one sizefitsall pants if you knew how to tie it we suspected we were going to afghanistan but none of us had the necessary visas to get into afghanistan or back into pakistan akhtar told us that his people would handle everything the next morning curt instr uctions get to the islamabad ai rport before leaving i dropped copy of my police badge and retired id card into fedex envelope to robert tucker my lawyer in new york the last thing i wanted bin ladins people to find was my old badge i could just hear myself trying to explain the police credentials i swear i was just clerk really in public relations tucker later told that when he got the badge and id with note he assumed id been killed then he said i wondered if i could have your car in time akhtar also showed up at the airport he looked us over i was wearing the light brown baggy pants and the oversized shirt that id bought the day before it seemed to be the uniform for millions in this region the outfit which was meant to make blend in at the airport and on the road was offset slightly by the white socks i wore under the sandals the armani prescription glasses and the cuban cigars id picked up in london i wasnt fitting in rick and ali wore the same outf it in light gray akhtar led us to the gate we were traveling on sealed orders as we boarded the plane we were handed tickets this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 91 for official use only we were going to peshawar the pearl of pakistan it was hazy when we got off the plane very hazy as you drive into peshawar smoke fills the air and sticks at the bottom of your throat some thing seemed to be burning almost everywhererubbish wood tires we checked into the hotel grand 1950s miami beach artdeco affair located down an lley off the main road hotel security was man in green uniform who wore red beret and carried chinesemade machine gun the very friendly clerks who signed us in made note of the odd collection of nationalitiesamerican ca nadian iraqi and pakistania nd they knew enough not to ask any of us what our business was in peshawar after we checked in akhtar strutted into the night carrying the plastic bag that held his things i went out on the fifthfloor balcony to lig ht up one of the romeo julieta churchills just what peshawar needed more smoke i imagined what this sad bustling city was like during the afghan war when it had been the stag ing area for the mujahidin this place had been worldclass hotbed of militant organizers and recruiters cia operations officers and kgb spies even now it is the b ack office of the militant islamic movement for the region i looked out at the hovels and junkyards and watched the moon come up through the smoke akhtar called the hotel in the morning and told us once again to get to the airport and again we were handed tickets in the waiting area we walke d across the tarmac to prop plane headed for bannu in northern pakistan with each stop our trip was taking us further back in time each place getting more primitive in custom and lifestyle here donkeys pulled carts and men and women carried sacks hanging from sticks across their shoulders or baskets on top of their heads in bannu we waited outside the tiny airport as vans and buses passed by after an hour van packed with locals stopped and an old man got out and greeted akhtar we all crammed into the van which was already too crowded we had been told not to speak the other passengers already knew we were westerners but they didnt need to know that some of us were american the van drove for two hours people got off more people got on at village that was nothing more than mud huts and thatched roofs loud bang came from the roof of the van young man with cloth bag tied to the end of branch scampered off the roof and ran toward the huts the van itself was the only sure reminder that we were not two thousand years in the past minor revelation for most americans included experience with the ancients is pretty much confined to the bible in th bible is world rife with plagues and pestilence world where things are worth killing and dying for world from time before kill ratios and colla teral damage and unacceptable levels of casualties world of huts world where there is such thing as losing battle in modern america we longer have the stomach for endeavors that dont seem like sure bets which can make things tricky when youre up against someone who doesnt give damn someone who is willing to risk everything and gladly at bannu it felt as if we were crossing over into that world where the ancient texts arent so ancient where martyrs are made for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 92 when the van reached small town we got into another van which took us for another hour farther north through mountains and barren valleys stopping at the last town before wilderness that leads to the afghan border the old man drove the van into the courtyard of small house and metal gates closed behind us we were to remain unseen in this village the old man said that this place had been safe house for mujahidin fighters headed for the afghan war the walls were covered with pictures of tanks and grenades pair of loaded ak47s hung from nails on the walls akhtar brought in stainlesssteel bowl filled with meat on the bone placed it on the floor and invited us to eat there was pita bread and pepsi we sat on the floor eating with our hands in two hours we were on the road again in the back of covered japanese pickup our gear hidden under bags of flour near the afghan border the truck stopped most of afghanistan is controlled by the taliban muslim fundamentalist group that believes among other things that television is evil sentiment gaining popularity in the west and that living thing should be photographed or videotaped so sneaking three american television journalists with camera equipment past taliban border checkpoint posed difficulties akhtar gave us the options we could 1 don long black veils with narrow slits for eyes and cross into afghanistan disguised as women or 2 walk over the mountains under cover of darkness and hope to avoid the talibans patrols ali had strong feelings on the subject we are not women he said indignantly we will not wear veils we will walk as men an hour into the journey ali was wheezing and barely able to continue he had not mentioned his asthma i want to go back to truck and be woman now he said before hauling himself up to walk again i lagged behind with him while rick and our two guides led the way at one point i noticed that the guides were holding hands ali i whispered as i nodded in their direction you didnt mention that this was gay terrorist group ali still very asthmatic patiently explained that among muslim men it is customary to hold hands while walking it is sign of respect and friendship it is perfectly masculine yeah i said i was joking moment passed we walked in silence save for alis wheezing would you hold my hand ali i asked he replied it was still dark when we finally made it into afghanistan truck was waiting with our gear we drove for several more hours mostly through dry riverbeds before we reached the first of bin ladins three camps we were stopped on dirt road two of bin ladins people confiscated our camera gear and drove away we stayed in hut sleeping on the floor which was covered with brown and red flannel blankets pillows lined the walls you are not prisone rs here you are our guests said one of bin ladins aides still we would prefer it if you stayed inside we dont want to advertise your presence this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 93 for official use only several of bin ladins soldiers were assigned to guard us they slept in the hut next to ours we washed from bowl water came from spigot just outside an outhouse was up the hill we spent our time reading or smoking and bullshitting with bin ladins men one of whom spoke pretty good english we would eat with the soldiers bread meat tea it was hot and dry it had occurred to us that the interview might not be for days or that after few days we could be told that there would be interview at all that is the way these things go sometimes days of waiting and then nothing most of that kind of waitingfor castro or qaddafiis done in nice hotels this was beginning to suck finally just as i began to lose track of time we hit the road an hour into this leg and suddenly gunfire it was rapidfire from machine guns i could see the muzzle flash through the tinted windows it was coming from up the hill four short blasts about thirty rounds then another thirty from the opposite side of the road my mind was racing several times during the threehour drive between camps men with guns had jumped out from both sides of the road and screamed in arabic for the truck to halt for the windows to come down those men were part of qaida bin ladins army but now who was shooting at us and why were we going to die i was trying hard to duck my head between my legs but with three of us stuck together across the backseat there was room to get our heads down my stomach was in knots now i was really thinking fuck this now its really not worth it bam bam bam bam why am i going to die to interview some asshole with radical views and lot of money bam bam bam bam for christs sake i could have done that in new york bam bam bam bam then second wave of thoughts flashed through my head i was not hearing the sound of metal being hit the shots were missing our guides were not ducking if they were not worried maybe this was okay slowly i raised my head the shooters in the road were yelling for us to halt to open the doors the gunfire had been warning shots for crying out fucking loud looking at their faces between the blinding beams of their flashlights i could see they were very young perhaps eighteen or nineteen they had apparently not received the radio message from the last checkpoint that the boys from new york were coming up it was little cold out that night but i was wiping sweat off my forehead after little tension and much talk the driver settled the problem and we were moving again we passed one more checkpointwithout incident before reaching the camp where bin ladin would meet us in the camp generators were rumbling the smell of gasoline was thick in the air rick bennett was agitated because bin ladins people had taken his camera days before and it didnt look as though he was going to get it back now they wanted to give him another camera panasonic homevideo camera bennett had not come halfway around the world to shoot home video he wanted his 65000 television camera back and he wanted it back now just then the gunfire erupted bin ladins convoy arrived now the show that was being staged for us was in full tilt and we had camera with which to record it bin ladins cameraman handed bennett the panasonic bennett started taping thats when the kid started shooting in my ear then he ran alongside bennett and was firing within an inch of his ear too as he walked backward with this crappy camera taping bin ladins arrival for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 94 into the din of gunfire he walked quickly surrounded by seven bodyguards each had an ak47 their eyes darted in every direction for any attacker this was either merely theatrical or entirely pointless because with hundreds of rounds being fired into the air it would have been impossible to pinpoint an assassin take your pick at bin ladins side was his military commander muhammad atef behind him ayman alzawahiri the leader of islamic jihad an egyptian group that has merged with bin ladins growing army bin ladin with his simple white turban and long black beard stood six three and was the tallest man in the group despite the chaos of the scene his eyes were calm fixed and steady he walked by and ducked his head to step into rectangular hut that had been set up for our meeting one of his aides waved off the gunfire the way an emcee might quell standing ovation everyone kept shooting somewhere all these bullets were falling back down to the earth usama bin ladin had made his entrance after his security detail crowded in be hind him i followed into the hut aside from his height the first thing that struck about bin ladin was his voice it was soft and slightly high with raspy quality that gave it the texture and sound of an old uncle giving good advice bin ladin settled onto bench covered with red cushions at the head of the long rectangular room with clay walls painted white sitting down he propped his own gun against the wall behind him twenty of his gunmen lined the benches on either side of the long room leaning in straining to hear whatever he might say bin ladins clothes told the story of his entangled themes he wore green army field jacket with insignia draped over the jacket was gold shawl and under the army jacket was the traditional muslim clothing that made him look like usama bin ladin has firm handshake we exchanged pl easantries in the polite but stilted manner one uses when speaking through transla tor his aides had insisted the day before that i give them list of my questions in writing as bin ladin was getting settled one of them said to i have very good news mr bin ladin will answer each of your questions then he added that bin ladins answers would not be translated on the spot you can take the tape to new york and have them translate it there if the answers are not translated now how can i ask followup questions i asked bin ladins man oh that will not be problem he told there will be followup questions at this point rick using stronger terms than one might want to with alleged terrorists demanded his camera back suddenly all his equipment reappeared looking to break the ice i said to the translator tell mr bin ladin that for guy who comes from family known for building roads he could sure use better driveway up this mountain okay so admittedly it wasnt much of joke but bin ladins interpreter appeared stricken i said dont translate never mind waving off the this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 95 for official use only remark its okay i said trying to prevent an international incide nt not funny sorry jesus there was another problem as i continued my lame attempts at small talk flies kept landing on bin ladins face and white turban sensing that this was undercutting their leaders dignity his aides asked bin ladin and the gunmen in the room to step outside so that they might spray few minutes later in cloud of insecticide we began usama bin muhammad bin awad bin ladin was born fortyone years ago in saudi arabia one of twenty sons of wealthy construction magnate muhammad bin ladin the kingdoms bin ladin group is 5 billion concern the familys close ties to the saudi royal family made it easy to get huge government contracts to build roads through the cities and deserts it is likely that usama bin ladin would have gone to school settled in london and focused on living comfortablyif history hadnt intervened on december 25 1979 the soviet union invaded afghanistan bin ladin then twenty two left for the fighting imme diately when he arrived he wasted time spending his money he financed the recruitment transportation and arming of thousands of palestinians tunisians somalians egyptians saudis and pakistanis to fight the russians bin ladin brought in his own bulldozers and dump trucks grizzled mujahidin fighters still tell of the young man who rode the bulldozers himself digging trenches on the front lines the men who follow bin ladin have all heard the stories and they pass them on to the younger men by his own account he was in the thick of the action he says he got the rifle he carries now in handtohand combat we went through vicious ba ttles with the russians bin ladin told the russians are known for their brutality they used poison gases against us i was subjected to this we lost many fighters but we were able to deter many commando attacks unlike anything before i asked him why man of wealth from powerf ul family had gone to afghanistan to live in trenches and fight the russian invaders on the front lines it is hard for one to understand if the person does not understand islam he said patiently explaining his interpretation of islam for citizen of his sworn enemy during the days of jihad thousands of young men who were welloff financially left the arabian peninsula and other areas nd joined the fighting hundre ds of them were killed in afghanistan bosnia and chechnya of course by the time of our meeting the enemy had shifted the soviet union longer existed the enemy was us and when i asked bin ladin if he was worried about being captured in an american raid he quickly dismissed the possibility turning instead to the reasons he hates the united states for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission

the same time americans defend country the state of the jews that has policy to destroy the futur of these children we are sure of our victory against the americans and the jews as promised by the prophet judgment day shall not come until the muslim fights the jew where the jew will hide behind trees and stones and the tree and the stone will speak and say muslim behind is jew come and kill him bin ladin never raises his voice and to listen to his untranslated answers one could imagine that he was talking about something that did not much concern him nonchalant he does not smile he continued looking down at his hands as if he were reading invisible notes your situation with muslims in pa lestine is shameful if there is any shame left in america houses were demolished over the heads of children also by the testimony of relief workers in iraq the ame ricanled sanctions resulte d in the death of more than one million iraqi children all of this is done in the name of american interests we believe that the biggest thieves in the world and the terrorists are the americans the only way for us to fend off these assaults is to use similar means we do not worry about american opinion or the fact that they place prices on our heads we as muslims believe our fa is set his interview technique was formidable aside from the dvantage of not allowing for simultaneous translation bin ladins approach to questions could have been taught by an american publicrelations dviser first get out your message then if you like answer the question bin ladin believes that the united states which was so heavily involved in supporting the afghan rebels misses the profound point of that exercise through sheer will even superpowers can be defeated there is lesson to learn from this for he who wishes to learn he said the soviet union entered afghanistan in the last week of 1979 and with allahs help their flag was folded few years later and thrown in the trash and there was nothing left to call the soviet union the war changed bin ladin it cleare d from muslim minds the my th of superpowers he said he was blooded hero among militant muslims with perhaps three thousand men waiting to follow him but follow him where into what battle many of these men had not been home for years by then fighting wa s all some of the m knew and there were huge stockpiles of weapons and grenades and rocket launchers many of them bought for the mujahidin rebels by the cia in december 1992 bin ladin found the battle hed been waiting for the united states was leading unsanctioned rescue mission into

quickly to rescue oilrich kuwait had come under mounting criticism for doing nothing when the marines landed in the last days of 1992 bin ladin sent in his own soldiers armed with ak47s and rocket launchers soon using the techniques they had perfected against the russians they were shooting down american helicopters the gruesome pictures of the body of young army ranger being dragged naked through the streets by cheering crowds flashed around the world the yearlong american rescue mission for starving somalians went from humanitarian effort to quagmire in just three weeks another superpower humiliated another bin ladin victory after leaving afghanistan the muslim fighters headed for somalia and prepared for long battle thinking that the ame ricans were like the russians bin ladin said the youth were surprised at the low morale of the american soldiers and realized more than before that the american soldier was paper tiger and after few blows ran in defeat and america forgot all the hoopla and media propaganda about being the world leader and the leader of the new world order and after few blows they forgot about this title and left dragging their corpses and their shameful defeat i asked bin ladin why he would kill american soldiers whose work was to restore order and allow for the distribution of food why should we believe that was the true reason america was there he replied everywhere else they went where muslims lived all they did was kill children and occupy muslim land during the two days i had waited at the camp for bin ladin some of his fighters sat on the floor of our hut and told war stories on soldier with big grin told of slitting the throats of three american soldiers in somalia when i asked bin ladin about this he said when this took place i was in the sudan but this great defeat pleased very much the way it pleases all muslims the somalia operation in some ways made bin ladin during the afghan war the cia had been very aware of him although the agency now insists it never controlled him but in somalia bin ladin had taken swing at the biggest kid in the school yard and given him black eye the next fight few weeks later would begin with sucker punch it was snowing in new york on february 26 1993 when massive truck bomb exploded at the world trade center tearing through three levels of the buildings underground garage basement and foundation at the time i was reporter for nbc as i walked through the scene i saw cop i knew from an antiterrorist unit initial reports were that it had been gas explosion or transformer that blew up theyre not saying this now he warned but this was bomb too big to be car probably truck on the lower level of for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 98 the garage there just isnt anything down there that could blow up and make hole this big six people were killed and more than thousand were injured it was the first major international terrorist attack on us soil within w eeks the fbi had tracked down four of the bombers collection of militant muslims most of whom had fought in afghanistan and had become followers of blind sheik in jersey city named omar abdel rahman the organizer of the bombing plot ramzi yousef boarded plane at kennedy airport few hours after the explosion and escaped in new york the fbi had been given two mandates find the rest of the bombers and find out whom they are working for the agents began the tedious job of tracing bank accounts that yousef had been using to buy the components of the huge bomb the money trail led from jersey city bank where yousef had used an atm card to detroit to london to pakistan and finally to afghanistan fbi agents and new york detectives on the joint terrorist task force debated was it the iranians the iraqis the libyans the consensus among the detectives was that ramzi yousef was an intelligence operative working for some hostile foreign power but instead investigators have since uncovered series of connections between yousef and groups funded by an individual usama bin ladin but bin ladin denied to that he was behind the bombing and claimed he didnt know ramzi yousef unfortunately he said with wave of his hand i did not know him before the incident next ramzi yousef was seen in manila with another of bin ladins associates afghan war hero wali khan amin shah they were busy planning to blow up dozen american jetliners over the pacific once again youse f had job but seemed to have plenty of money to finance his plans the fbi finally caught up to him on february 7 1995 in pakistan he was living in very pleasant guesthouse called the casa house in islamabad it was one of the many guesthouses that bin ladin had set up to quarter his fighters government sources say that khan is now cooperating with the fbi the sources tell that khan had been very busy moving around the world setting various bin ladin plans into motion he told the agents he went to mail drops and fax machines to receive coded instructions from bin ladins bases in the sudan and afghanistan and that he was in manila to set up training camps for terrorists when he was ordered to survey the routes that president clinton would be using during an official state visit to the philippines last winter khan wearing brightoran ge jumpsuit sat in closed room in the metropolitan correctional center in lower manha ttan patiently explai ning to the feds that the mercury found in his apartment in manila was not for bomb making but was rather to be placed inside the bullets that would be used to shoot president clinton that way khan said if the shot didnt kill him he would die by poisoning this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 99 for official use only sitting in the hut on bin ladins mountain in afghanistan i asked bin ladin if he had tried to kill clinton as i said every action elicits similar reaction he explained what does clinton expect from those that he killed assaulting their children and mothers but he was quick to sidestep the question of his culpability very careful not to implicate himself he wasnt in somalia but he liked what he saw he didnt blow up american bases in saudi arabia but those who did are martyrs he didnt pay for the world trade center bombing or the plot to kill clinton but they were good ideas for the future bin ladin told his first pr iority is to get the american military out of saudi arabia the holiest of nds in islam every day the americans delay their departure they will receiv new corpse already us forces have been dealt devasta ting blows there nineteen servicemen were killed in the 1996 bombing of the airforce barracks in dhahran and five us military personnel were killed in similar bombing in riyadh in 1995 investigators believe bin ladin is tied at some level to both attacks bin ladin said that the american military would leave saudi arabia regardless of the fact that the saudi royal family welcomes the american presence it does not make difference if the government wants you to stay or leave you will leave when the youth send you in wooden boxes and coffins and you will carry in them the bodies of american troops and civilians this is when you will leave civilians we do not differentiate between those dressed in military uniforms and civilians they are all targets in this fatwa bin ladin ar gued that american outrage at attacks on american civilians constitutes great double standard american history does not distinguish between civilians and military not even women and children they are the ones who used bombs against nagasaki can these bombs distinguish between infants and military america does not have religion that will prevent it from destroying all people bin ladin believes that what we consider to be terrorism is just the amount of violence required to get the attention of the american people his aim is to get americans to consider whether continued support of israel is worth the bloodshed he promises so we tell the americans as people bin ladin said softly and we tell the mothers of soldiers and american mothers in general that if they value their lives and the lives of their children to find nationalistic government that will look after their interests and not the interests of the jews the continuation of tyranny will bring the fight to america as ramzi yourself and others did this is my message to the american people to look for serious government that looks out for their interests and does not attack others their lands or their honor and my word to american journalists is not to ask why we did that but ask what their government has done that forced us to defend ourselves for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is

interview when it was over i went looking for him so do we have story i whispered when i found him please tell it wasnt just an hour of praise allah bullshit ali said we have very good story i asked ali what bin ladin had said that would make this news he was looking right into your face ali said and he was saying that youyou people the americanswould be going home from the middle east in coffins and in boxes he said that i asked excited and while he was saying this what was i doing ali looked at bit oddly and said you were nodding like you agreed with his plan during the hourlong interview bin ladin assuming correctly that i did not understand word he was saying had taken to looking at his translator as he gave his answers clearly he did not understand the basic conventions of the american television interview imagine that so to keep his responses directed toward our camera to make it seem like we were rocking along together i engaged him in knowing eye contact and nodded thoughtfully so ali youre telling hes promising genocide and im nodding like an asshole yes ali said smiling but we had our little story and few week s later in few minutes of footage usama bin ladin would say hi to america not many people would pay attention just another arab terrorist bin ladin was once again surrounded by his men leaving the way he came in it was past two in the morning as the gunfire started again this time rick shot the whole scene but as we packed our gear bin ladins press aide and his security chief came over to inspect our tape looking carefully at each scene of bin ladin arriving and leaving they ordered any face not covered with kaffiyeh to be erased when i objected they said the deal was simple if we did not lete the faces we would not leave with the tape and so into the night they played and rewound played and rewound over each face the two would confer he travels one would say to the other and wed have to delete that second or two of footage according to the fbi last summer group of these men traveled for bin ladin to kenya and tanzania on august 7 two truck bombs destroyed the american embassies in both countries two hundred thirteen dead in kenya twelve of them were americans in tanzania none of the eleven killed were americans most were africans many of them were muslims this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination

had vanished at the afghan border on our trek in was among those cheering 9mm in his shoulder holster as bin ladin came and went akhtar travels too he very obligingly escorted us out of afghanistan and drove us all the way back to islamabad meanwhile bin ladins reach has now been docum ented among albanians fighting the serbs in kosovo wherever muslims are in trouble it seems usama bin ladin will be there slaying enemies real or perceived modern nightmare reallya bigscreen villain freelancer with the resources of state but without all the nasty obligations sort of ford foundation for terroristsor freedom fighters depending on whom you ask after the american cruisemissile attacks intelligence sources told that bin ladin had been intercepted talking on satellite phones trying

against soviet invaders that presaged the fall of the soviet empire itself the experience was revelation to bin ladin and the first of several critical junctures in his evolution from wealthy intimate of arab princes and potentates into revolutionary with panislamic virulently antiamerican political message hes guy who has combined number of obsessions into comprehensive package that has given him what i consider to be real strategy and mission for his life said prof thomas gouttierre director of the center for afghan studies at the university of nebraska in omaha that mission includes purifying the lands of islam from western culture he views as corrupting especially ejecting us troops from saudi arabia bin ladin would also expand muslim theocratic rule into the newly opened regions of central asia that were part of the soviet union afghanistan is the launching pad for both gouttierre said until 1979 the year of the soviet invasion the future revolutionary and terrorist showed scant interest in politics the 17th of 52 children sired by muhammad bin ladin saudi arabias wealthiest construction magnate bin ladin concentrated on his ducation until his graduation that year from king abdul aziz university with degree in civil engineering bin ladin also claims to have studied economics his family says ali ahmed saudi dissident and human rights activist was not just rich they were filthy rich his father was so close to the saudi royal family that he was chosen to build the modern mosques in mecca and medina the most sacred sites of islam of which the saudi royal family is custodian bin ladins father died in 1968 when he was 10 leaving the boy with reported personal inheritance of some 40 million to 80 million yet for all his familys closeness to saudi royalty

afghan and arab fighters bin ladin reportedly rranged compensation for their families later he transported bulldozers and other heavy construction equipment on unmarked transport planes behind mujahedeen lines to build defensive tunnels and storage depots for the guerrilla fighters bin ladin also founded group which would become qaeda that recruited muslim fighters from around the world to the war in afghanistan he was involved in at least one major battle but sources dispute whether he was in any other combat i think thats been little lionized beyond reality said gouttierre afghans who know him say he was at times interested in going out and engaging in combat but he was mostly involved in support services he offered his resources and engineering skills to meet their supply and logistical challenges nonetheless says ahmed the saudi dissident bin ladin was hardened by the fighting when he finally left afghanistan after the soviet retreat in 1989 turning point when he returned to saudi arabia he began to see his own government differently even as he worked to expand his stake in the family business bin ladin was disaffected by the corruption of the saudi regime family members and royal friends such as prince turki the chief of saudi intelligence reportedly tried to cool off bin ladins rising anger and opposition to the government but in 1990 iraqs invasion of kuwait jolted saudi arabia into inviting us troops onto its soil for the fight against iraq that was the turning point for bin ladin from his viewpoint us troops desecrated muslim holy land meant to be free of kaffirs or nonbelievers the saudi government expelled bin ladin in 1991 for his political activities soon after they froze his bank accounts and his 350 million share in the family business the exile settled in sudan where he found common cause with the radical islamic government there headed by hassan alturabi bin ladin appears to have had the best of all worlds in suda n with the

darkness frustrated after they had caused great commotion about the new world order with regards to reports among muslims that usama is threatening to kill civilians then what are they killing in palestine they are killing children not only civilians but children as well our enemy the target if god gives muslims the opportunity to do so is every american male whether he is directly fighting us or paying taxes american history does not distinguish between civilians and military and not even women and children they are the ones who used the bombs against nagasaki therefore you do not have the right to object to like trea tment at the sa time our primary targets are military we find that jews have the first word in the american government which is how they use america to carry out their pl

arab mujahid usama bin ladin had been living in afghanistan for the last few years he has devoted his life to jihad and is supporting muslims wherever in the world they are carrying it out the united states is the biggest enemy of usama bin ladin it attacked his headquarters after failing to arrest him this interview with usama bin ladin was held on 26 may last year before answering the questions usama deliv ered short speech which is translated below at present we have got into trouble which is very dangerous and unfortunate by this trouble i mean the presence of christian forces in arab lands they are constantly trying to establish their full control in this region this is the first time since the annunciation of the holy prophet mohammad peace be upon him that our sacred places including the kaaba house of god the nabavi mosque and the aqsa mosque are under the open and covert control of nonmuslims it has become obligatory for muslims throughout the entire world to start their str uggle to oust the infidels from our sacred places mecca is the place where god sent divine revelation to the prophet mohammad peace be upon him there has never been such an unfortunate time in kaaba as there is now it has been surrounded on all four sides by us forces there is only distance of seventy kilometers between jeddah and kaaba and the us forces are also present in tabook and other big cities muslim scholars of the world and saudi arabia have issued fatwa religious decree for jihad against these forces that have dared to occupy our sacred places the holy prophet peace be

tobiyan and sheik nasir omar who have been imprisoned in riyadh eminent scholars from pakistan and afghanist an have also declared jihad against the presence of these forces in the arab lands it is very unfortunate to have christians and jews present in such sacred places sheikh ali bin abdur rehman the imam of the nabavi mosque has also issued fatwa which states that muslims should sacrifice their lives and resources to expel the infidels from mecca we pray to god that he may provide courage to muslims to rise for jihad the united sta tes is helping the infidels and the christians and jews have established control ove r one third of the muslim nation something which we aim to halt there was time when superpower like russia tried to occupy afghanistan we supported our brothers in afghanistan and russia which was proud that it never retreated from anywhere in the world was defeated by us and then disintegrated i announce that geographical boundaries have importance for us we are muslims and wish to be martyred we have discrimination on the basis of color and race we support every oppressed muslim and we pray to god to provide us with help and to enable us to help every oppressed muslim after this brief and comprehensive spe ech by usama bin ladin the audience was allowed to ask questions the expressions on usamas face were very affectionate and warm i couldnt believe i was sitting in front of the grea t mujahid only at distance of two or three feet this was the time when india had conducted its nuclear explosions and there was great pressure on the pakistani government to conduct nuclear explosions usama bin ladin is with muslims of the whole world and he wants to share the sufferings of muslims my first question to him was in the context of the nuclear explosions 1 india which is an enemy of muslims s conducted nuclear explosions and has tried to intimidate the muslim world do you think pakistan should also conduct nuclear explosions how can you help pakistan in this regard usama was probably not expecting this question but he was keen to answer it his smile turned into seriousness and he said the alliance between i ndia and israel was big threat to the muslim world the christian powers are bu sy in conspiracies against the muslims india has conducted nuclear explosions with the consent of the united states and israel i believe that at present the pakistani nation should unite and should end the sectarianism provoked by its opponents if pakistanis do not get united it will not be possible for them to face this difficult situation it is important for them to strengthen their nuclear power and demonstrate it with full strength the government of pakistan is liable to do what the pakistani nation wants it should take every possible step to defend it from the enemy it is the responsibility of the brotherly islamic country of pakistan to examine the situation and give stern reply to india one way or the other if there is risk of any loss in case of this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 113 for official use only conducting nuclear explosions it should adopt any other way to demonstrate its power but it must show its power to india at any cost this was the voice of mujahid he strongly wished to answer the enemy tit for tat but at the same time he was so considering the profit and loss to pakistan he asked how is it possible to keep pakistan deprived of nucl ear arms when india already has them two days after this interview pakistan conducted its nuclear explosion 1how should practical form be given to the jihad you are talking about usama smiled as he loves to spea k on the jihad against the united states he said the jihad has already started in practical form in saudi arabia modern arms are used against the americans the first incident took place in riyadh and the second in alkhobar in these bomb blasts 19 americans were killed and more than one hundred wounded with every passing day resistance to the united states is increasing and young men are being recruited agai nst the united states that is why the united states had to decide to reduce its forces in saudi arabia the united states had cl aimed that it wants to reduce its forces in saudi arabia from 35000 to 20000 but we know that these figures are not correct the number of us forces in saudi arabia is much more than this it can be between 7080000 two months back the saudi government confiscated sizeable quantity of arms used by our mujahidin including seven rockets and stinger missiles the americans were shocked to see the type and size of the arms they wondered what would have happened if those arms had been used against them fear of the mujahidin has overtaken the americans and they are being defeated by the mujahidin everywhere usama said meaningfully that the jihad would continue against the united states until it vacated saudi arabia and other countries of the region in pakistan also muslims are supporting us in the jihad and the united states is also confused in pakistan in the coming days the united states will anyway have to vacate the muslim countries 1 why did saudi government confiscate the weapons from the mujahidin it was not possible for such large quantity of arms to be seized without insider information eight hundred and twenty mujahidin have been arrested in saudi arabia since the first of ramadan and the americans took away their arms the majority of these mujahidin were arrested from mecca some mujahidin were arrested in police raids while they were shifting arms from one car to other 1 do these mujahidin have any connection with you usama smiled and said these are the people who agree with my views and who want the us forces to get out of saudi arabia they are not my men but have the same views as mefor official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying

arrest you did you feel any kind of fear while you came here life is only in the control of god and human being can do anything about it god can give life or death to anybody he wants it does not matter if you are superpower or not if god wants to live even ten countries like the united states cannot kill but when god wants to die even an ordinary person would have difficulty killing it is my faith that the united states cannot do anything to and i am not afraid of it at all my life and death are in the hands of god we are fighting for the truth the united states is plundering our resources and wandering about our sacred places it may do anything it wants but it can never harm us because god is with us it has been nine years since we have been struggling against the united states and i am alive in front of you despite all its attempts to kill us in these nine years we have inflicted considerable damage on the united states in different places and will continue to do the same in the future in response to question from chinese journalist mr ching about the muslims of china usama replied we have good wishes for all muslims in the world i often hear about chinese muslims but since we have direct connection with people in china and member of our organization comes from china i dont have any detailed knowledge about them the chinese government is not fully aware of the intentions of the united states and israel these two countries also want to usurp the resources of china the united states is country which does not even refrain from destroying the human race in its own interests it was the united states that dropped the atomic bomb on japan so i suggest the chinese government be more careful of the us and the west china must use its force against the united states and israel and should be friendly towards muslims i request the chinese muslim brothers to be united to prot ect their rights and try to contact as soon as possible since they are living very far away from the islamic world they need to study islamic history more they should also extend their relations with the organizations of other muslim countries 1how far has the jihad succeeded in ousting the us forces from saudi arabia are you also struggling against the saudi government or kings in this regard we have focused our attention on israel and the united states first we want to expel them after which muslim state will be established and those who are forcefully ruling the people will be given severe punishments 1india conducted its nuclear explosions few days ago it is hurling different kinds of threats against pakistan with regard to kashmir what should we do in response and how can you help us in this regard i could see expressions of affection appearing on usamas face every time he heard the name of pakistan he calls pakistan his second home he said you should carry on your this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited

shariah islamic law should be enforced in the country religious scholars and other leaders should announce jihad against india they should set up military camps to provide military training to people jihad against india has become obli gatory for the muslims of pakistan 1 do you have connections with any organizations in pakistan which personalities do you think would rise for jihad on you advice god has regarded jihad as the most sacred act mujahid is the second person dear to god after the holy prophet although we dont have strong relations with any party in pakistan relating to jihad pakistanis did pa rticipate in the afghan jihad russia had to retreat at the hands of the mujahidin despite being superpower we wanted to go to kashmir for jihad after the afghan jihad ended but the peoples party government in pakistan did not allow us but rather it arrested lot of our mujahid brothers from peshawar and other places and handed them over to the governments concerned on the instruction of the united states some of our arrested mujahidin ar still imprisoned in jails while some have been kille d we could not take part in jihad in kashmir but we believe that muslims have full rights to defend their countries we will provide every possible help to the mujahidin in pakistan not only in pakistan but wherever mujahidin are fighting against the enemies of islam we will help them we will support pakistan in its war against india when the jihad in afghanistan ended i went to sudan to help the muslims of sudan against the united states the americans were not happy at our activities therefore they tried to kill but by the grace of god failed in their objective the united states thought we would surrender because of their efforts but we never did that when the muslims of sudan also started their struggle against the united states we decided to help them the mujahidin of sudan perplexed the americans so much that they were forced to run aw ay from sudan this shows how weak the united states is the united states again tried to have expelled from sudan and continued to mount pressure on the government of sudan then i felt that the government of sudan could not afford to bear the pressure any more i didnt have any place to go to after sudan but god helped and mollah omar opened the doors of his country to he had not forgotten the mujahidin who participated in the afghan jihad and remembered that thousands of mujahidin were martyred during the jihad saudi arabia and the united states pressurized mollah omar not to allow into his country but he did not listen to anybody he was pressurized into extraditing to the united states but this brave man refused to do that 1 the war which is going on inside afghanistan at present is synonymous with civil war this cant be declared jihad what is your opinion in this regard at present the situation is not very clear so we have decided not to interfere in this matter we have left it up to them to decide but after establishing their government the taleban have established peace and restored the confidence of the public we are on the side of the taleban muslims all over the world should convince

afghanistan and asked them not to become part of any conspiracy of the united states to divide their country for the implementation of its plan the united states sent general benon sevan deputy secretary general of united nations to afghanistan and then mr boutrous ghali himself visited afghanistan but the afghan leaders refused to accept any plan as far as we are concerned we work with the cooperation of muslim scholars and muslims of the whole world the united states wanted to set up military base for us soldiers in yemen so that it could send fresh forces to somalia the arab mujahidin related to afghan jihad carried out bomb explosions in two hotels in yemen to warn the united states causing damage to some americans staying in these hotels the united states received our warning and gave up the idea of setting up its military bases in yemen the united states sent 30000 soldiers to somalia where the forces including 5000 pakistani soldiers were already present other countries

muslims abu abdullah usama bin ladin has sent letter to certain places in pakistan from an unknown place in the letter usama bin ladin is said to have told the high level places as published that pakistans silence on the problems between them usama and his men and the united states especially when they usama and his men are in the right is not agreeable unacceptable as published contrary to the opinion of all pukhtoons and muslims and unlikable but despite that usama bin ladin is said to have written that pakistani people are muslim and mujahid nation who have supported the oppressed people of afghanistan in defeating the soviet union in the region usama bin ladin said that every government of the day especially the government of prime minister mohammad nawaz sharif has always played an exemplary role in afghan jihad and have also stood up against the infidel especially the communist countries for the true faith of islam this usama bin ladin said forces him not to st ay impartial on the kashmir issue he said that kashmir is an islamic problem and it is necessary to resolve it through armed jihad by keeping in mind faith in allah usama bin ladin is said to have written in the letter that he believes that pakistani people are muslim nation according to the true spirit of islam and have defended him usama in every difficult time because of their islamic responsibility therefore usama bin ladin said he also announces support to the independence of kashmir and the people of kashmir on the basis of islamic opinion and the order of the muslim people of pakistan as published he said that kashmir has taken almost the same turn as afghanistan usama bin ladin is said to have said in the letter that if conditions are made favorable the mujahidin who are ready to sacrifice their lives have the power to create problems for india not onl on the frontline but also inside india he has urged all religious scholars to shun differences and unite until the

holy grand mosque in mecca and are the real soldiers to defend it usama bin ladin said that the muslim countries should accept their position and openly defend them because prophet mohammad has said that all muslims are brothers and it is binding on them to support muslims against the infidel if the leaders of the muslim countries fail to do so it means they are turning blind eye on their usama bin ladin and his men being right he said he said that their leaders of the muslim countries silence may imply that now they do not like their usama bin ladin and his men empty pockets and like the artificial ex pansion process of mecca which is often initiated by king fahad they leaders of the muslim countries are not only looking for way out but also hiding the fact in the hope of getting some financial help from king fahads stuffed pockets and they are also ready to bow before evil he said usamas contact with some antiindia plac as published in pakistani was expected some time ago and has perhaps now been established because usama is alive and lives somewhere on the face of earth as published it is not necessary to identify the place from where he has made this contact usama is truthful and loyal person and wherever he is and despite the fact tha t he stays away from issuing sta tements and activities he still responds to certain things as he did in this case the indian atrocities on kashmiris might have rekindled islamic feelings that he could not control description of source wahdatnewspaper reporting mainly on afghan issues including reports on conflict in af

blessed him and bestowed on him an honor that other contractor has known he built the holy mecca mosque where the holy kaabah is located and at the same time because of gods blessings to him he built the holy mosque in medinah for our prophet gods prayers be upon him then when he found out that the government of jordan announced tender for restoration work on the dome of the rock mosque he gathered engineers and asked them to estimate the cost price only without profit they said to him with gods help we will be awarded the project and make some profit as well he said to them calculate only the cost price of the project when they did they were surprised that he god have mercy on his soul reduced the cost price in order to guarantee that gods mosques and this mosque in particular are

age on roads in my fathers company may god have mercy on his soul my father died when i was 10 years old this is something brief about usama bin ladin as to what he usama bin ladin wants what he wants and demands is the right of any living being we want our land to be freed of the enemies we want our land be free of the americans god equipped these living creatures with an instinctive zeal and they refuse to be intruded upon for instance if an armed military man walks into chickens home wanting to attack it the chicken will fight back and it is only chicken we are demanding right given to all living creatures not to mention the fact that it right for all human beings and right for muslims in particular there was an attack on the countries of islam especially on the holy shrines and on aqsa mosque the prophets first kiblah and then the aggression continued with the crusaderjewish alliance being led by the united states and israel now they have taken the country of the two holy mosques

highest word of all sadaldin ibrahim journalist and social sciences professor at the american university of cairo with regards to bin ladin he is the exception that proves the rule because he is the youngest child and because hi s family despite its considerable wealth is still considered marginal one in saudi arabia originating from hadramaut which is why he was not fully accepted in saudi

former egyptian president jamal abdalnasir who were not very popular among the saudi royal family and who rebelled against the royal family the system and their class as result of attempts to marginalize them abdalbari atwan editor in chief of the londonbased alquds alarabi newspaper i found him to be man who is very modest in nature he believes in every word he says he does not lie he does not exaggerate he does not complement anyone he does not even try to hide anything he expresses everything he feels he is very enigmatic his voice is calm and wellmannered i spent whole day with him and i truly sensed his charm his refined manners and true modesty not exaggerated or with fake modesty he is man who seeks the afterlife and who truly feels that he has lived more than enough you feel that there is sadness inside him which he did not express that he was not martyred when he was fighting the soviet or the communists or the heathens you feel like he is saying why am i alive larry johnson expert on terrorism and former us intelligence officer in english with superimposed arabic translation it is clear he has killed and wounded more american citizens than any other group involved in terrorist attacks in the past seven years individual or group has killed as many americans or foreigners for example if we were to count the number of victims per attack we find that usama bin ladin and his followers have killed about 125 victims per attack while hamas islamic resistance movementwhich is number two on the list has killed six victims per attack this difference shows that bin ladin is not doing the ordinary but rather has taken it upon himself to carry out clear mission he believes that the united states is desecrating the cradle of islam in saudi arabia and has thus di rected his war against american interests fortunately his capabilities are limited afterall he is only human he is not giant he is not superman nor can he tell the future or read minds but he is still threat he has pledged to kill people and has acted on it i think that he is man of his word he made threat and we should not just consider him an idiot we should take his threat seriously najm usama bin ladin is the man that the united states has declared war on and who has declared war in return an attempt to assassinate him has cost several hundreds of millions of dollars that fell in the form of cruise missiles on his camp in khoft mountain in afghanistan it is the same camp that the united states called the base the story does not start here the afghan war was just starting after

unless the soviets withdraw their troops within month from afghanistan the olympic ga mes will be moved from moscow to an alternate site or multiple sites or postpone d or cancelled najm the resistance movement began the mujahidin were fighting communist atheism while the united states was fighting the progress of soviet influence and for the first time in centuries the banner of jihad in the name of islam and the war on the soviets in the name of jihad was raised there are those who say that this holy war was launched in the name of the united states and with its support were the mujahidin us agents who turned against washington when it turned on them usama bin ladin this is us attempt to distort things praise be to god who made their plots backfire on them every muslim who sees discrimination be gins to hate the americans the jews and christians this is part of our religion and faith since i become aware of things around i have been in war enmity hatred against the americans what they claim has never happened saying that they supported jihad or fighting it became clear to us that this support was from the arab states particularly the gulf states for pakistan to encourage it to support jihad this support was not for the sake of almighty god but out of fear for their thrones from the soviet advance at the time time carter was the us president he could not say anything significant until after some 20 days in 1399 hegira corresponding to 20 january year not given he said any russian interference in the gulf region will be termed an aggression against the united states this is because he occupies this region and its oil this is why he said we will use military force if this interference takes place the americans are lying when they say that they cooperated with us in the past and we challenge them to show any evidence of this the truth of the matter is that they were burden on us and on the mujahidin in afghanistan there was agreement on this we were doing our duty in support of islam in afghanistan although this duty used to serve against our desire the us interests this situation was similar to the muslims fight against the romans we know that fighting between the romans and the persians has always been strong so wise man can say that when the muslims fought the romans first at the mutah battle they were agents to the persians but interests met at this point in other words your killing of the romans which is duty for you used to please the persians however after they finished with the romans they began to fight the persians so the conversion of interests without agreement does not necessarily mean relations or agentry in fact we have been hostile to them since then praise be to god we gave lectur during those days in hejaz and najd on the need to boycott the us goods and to attack the us forces and the us economy this was more than 12 years ago najm the united states has always tried to belittle the size of the role it played there however it admitted that it extended aid in the us capital washington larry johnson former us intelligence employee is still doing his job of training government quarters on how to combat

several foreign powers before the russians went into afgha nistan the british went to afghanistan and tried to control its people the br itish and the russians failed i do not think that there is anyone who can control afghanistan other than its people however saying that the united states went there and trained the mujahidin how to use rifles or plant explosives this is nonsense did we do this yes we went and helped in training and we provided them with aid which helped them in expe lling the russians however this was not phenomenon that was created by the united states this practice has been going on there for centuries and we should realize this najm at the beginning of that war the arabs used to flow into afghanistan mujahidin and journalists jamal ismail aljazirah correspondent used to study there at the time he was acquainted with wealthy youn g man who was full of enthusiasm of jihad against the infidels usama bin ladin was in peshawar ismail i was first introduced to shaykh usama binmuhammad bin ladin when he used to visit the pakistani city of peshawar during the afghan jihad against the soviet occupation of afghanistan at the time i was student at peshawar university i used to visit the arab relief aid offices to report news to those interested at the time i knew him first in 1984 when he established services center it was called the mujahidin services center msc i knew him in the city of peshawar in 1984 when the msc was established in cooperation between shaykh usama binmuhammad bin ladin and the palestinian shaykh abdallah azzam who was killed in peshawar in 1989 at the time usama bin ladin used to finance the biggest part of the msc budget and some arab preachers or mujahidin at the afghan front s however he was not permanent resident in peshawar or on the afghan territories he used to come to these areas once every three or four months most of the time he used to come to pesha war to acquaint himself with the situation and to meet with the afghan mujahidin leaders shaykh abdallah azzam and others he used to visit the internal afghan fronts later things developed for him so he financed the establishment of the first camp for the arab mujahidin in 1986 or at the end of 1986 this camp began to prepare and train arab fighters in an areas in afghanistan and close to the pakistani border it wa s called the geiji golbbuddin hekmatyar leading afghan leader usama bin ladin came to afghanistan when many states used to encourage th eir youths to go to afghanistan to take part in the battles the re the united states also did not object to this number of muslims used to come from the united states too they participated in the battles during the russian invasion of afghanistan usama bin din also came at the same time the saudi government also did not object to this he stayed in afghanistan najm however the losing party in this war had another viewpoint general valenkov commander of the soviet land forces in afghanistan laid down his arms and became member of the soviet parliament however several years ago when the war was at its peak the general was at the frontline fighting the mujahidin then he withdrew valenkov the united states played really decisive role since we sent our forces into afghanistan the americans knew about our decision which was very well known for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 124 however the americans kept silent they did not show any stand for fear that we might change our opinion they wanted us to go there but when we entered afghanistan they did their utmost to fully support the afghan opposition materially technologically and ideologically they exploited the presence of afghan refugees in pakistan and iran they provided every material need to establish military camps training centers arsenals and bases some other countries also contributed to this including pakistan for clear purpose namely preparing the afghan refugees in the best possible way obviously we called those who constituted armed factions gangs but they were real armed groups they used to dispatch arms convoys to afghanistan through pakistan they knew that they had definite tasks and tha t they were fighting not only for religion or cause but for the substantial amounts of money they were receiving the mujahidin had direct financial interest in fighting and this is very important najm during the battles that raged in afghanistan between the government forces and the mujahidin usama bin ladin visite d afghanistan several times during these visits his participation in the operations with the mujahidin developed from one level to the next usama bin ladin this military camp was called the alansar lions den or the arab camp in 1987 it was exposed to land and air attacks from the soviet and afghan communist government forces against the arab camps at the time the afghan fighters who were there withdrew when the battles the air attacks and the landing of paratroopers began the arab fighters led by shaykh abdallah azzam and usama binmuhammad bin ladin and group that as far as we knew did not exceed 35 persons held their ground for two weeks of fierce fighting then the socalled legend of bin ladin or the arab fighters in afghanistan was born and began to develop gradually especially sentence incomplete voice fades out najm this was usama bin ladins experience that was accumulated in years of fighting an experience of which he is proud because he believes it ended with victory over the soviets an experience he used to est ablish training camp which was attacked by the united states with missile s the united states called this camp the base camp najm two main characters were the driving force behind receiving and organizing arab fighters and then sending them to the battlefield they were shaykh abdallah azzam

may god have mercy on his soul is man worth nation after his assassination muslim women proved to be unable to give birth to man like him the people of jihad who lived that epoch know that islamic jihad in afghanistan has not benefited from anyone as it has from shaykh abdallah azzam he instigated the nation from the farthest east to the farthest west during that blessed jihad the activities of shaykh abdallah azzam may god bless his soul as well as the activities of our brother mujahidin in palestine particularly hamas increased his books particularly his book the verses of the merciful began to enter palestine and instigate the nation for jihad against the jews the shaykh proceeded from the narrow regional and often city atmosphere that was familiar to islamists and shaykhs to the larger islamic world and began to instigate this islamic world we and the shaykh were in one boat as is known to you together with our brother wail jalidan plot was concocted to assassinate all we were very careful not to be together all the time i often asked the shaykh may god have mercy on his soul to stay away from peshawar in sada due to the increasing plot s especially since one or two weeks earlier bomb was discovered in the mosque where the shaykh lived in sab allayl the jews were mostly harmed by shaykh abdallah azzams movement it is believed that israel together with some of its arab agents were the ones who assassinated the shaykh as for this accusation i think that it is being promoted today by the jews americans and some of their agents however this is not worth re sponse it is illogical for person to chop off his head and the one who was in the field knows the extent of the strong relationship between and shaykh abdallah azzam this accusation is silly and baseless there was competition between and him shaykh abdallahs field was that of call dawah and instigation while we were on the baktia mountains in the interior he sent us young people as well as directives we did what he ordered us we pray that god will accept him and his two sons muhammad and ibrahim as martyrs and to compensate the nation by giving it one who can carry out the duty he used to perform ibrahim this was phenomenon that was considered healthy by all those opposing occupation and colonialism even if this coloni alism was by frie ndly state like the soviet union at that time when the soviet occupation of afghanistan came to an end large number of the volunteer s maintained fighting as part of their lifestyle they diverted their attention from fighting nonmuslim foreign occupier to an attempt to topple regimes in arab and islamic states which they did not c onsider sufficiently islamic those arab nationals were called the afghan arabs or arab afghans some of them returned to algeria egypt yemen and other states and tried to do so they originally came from middleclass society and had some degree of knowledge and education they had an ambition to be something in this lif through public service educational excellence or vocational prominence when they faced obstacles to the attainment of their ambition which i think was legitimate they either left their country in search of other opportunities abroad or began to question the legitimacy of the regime which does not allow them to fulfill this legitimate ambition valyenkov commander of russian ground troops in

people were tearful of course this was not the sentiment of all afghans for those who were hurt by the war or suffered setback as result of it had completely different sentiments nonetheless most af ghans had fears about the repercussions of our withdrawal from the country they even tried to obstruct this withdrawal if we are to talk about afghan leaders they did not want this at all i am talking about najibullah and others video footage from archives shows hostilities in the afghan war najm the soviets left they withdrew after it had become clear that afghanistan was quagmire that drowned the soviet union in stagnant political and military waters the entire soviet empire was about to collapse the mujahidin felt victorious and proud because they felt that they brought the greatest military power on earth to its knees they waged the war and won it an enemy was vanquished while another is still to be overcome usama bin ladin nowadays jihad needs to be waged by the nation the obligation to engage in jihad may be dropped if people suffer from disability but we believe that those who participated in the jihad in afghanistan bear the greatest responsibility in this regard because they realized that with insignificant capabilities with small number of rpgs with small number of antitank mines with small number of kalashnikov rifles they managed to crush the greatest empire known to mankind they crushed the greatest military machine the socalled superpowers vanished into thin air we think that the united states is very much w eaker than russia based on the reports we received from our brothers who partic ipated in jihad in soma lia we learned that they saw the weakness frailty and cowardice of us troops only 80 us troops were killed nonetheless they fled in the heart of darkn ess frustrated after they had caused great commotion about the new world order jamal ismail aljazirah correspondent who conducted an interview with bin ladin until the year 1989 he bin ladin was in peshawar or in afghanistan in general he used to frequent peshawar afterwards he left for the kingdom of saudi arabia on visit he was denied travel for domestic reasons however the former pakistani government said that this had something to do with the pakistani government which asked that he be deported from pakistani territory najm short while after his return to sa udi arabia the region was boiling with change the following year the earthquake occurred video shows footage from the archives of the iraqikuwaiti crisis former us president george bush in english were here to protect freedom were here to protect our future and were here to protect innocent lives but we wont pull punches we are not here on some exercise this is real world situation and we are not walking away until our

felt in several arab capitals which pointed finger of accusation at them regarding many operations which extremist islamic groups were accused of in algeria in egypt in saudi arabia and many of them appeared in the united kingdom ismail after the second gulf war the war of kuwait usama bin ladin was given passport by the saudi governmentand at the time he was not permitted to have passportwith an exitonly visa the following day he left for the pakistani city of peshawar at the time his movement and activity was engulfed with some secrecy in fear of being exposed to assassination especially since shaykh abdallah azzam was assassinated in peshawar with his two sons muhammad and ibrahim two years earlier usama bin ladin we were in deep grief during the dispute between these factions and the parties of the mujahidin but god almighty was gracious to the arab nations by giving it the taleban movement which came to rescue this jihad from the us scheme which supported najib najibullah and was pressuring the mujahidin through pakistan to form secular government fifty percent of its members would be former communists and some of those who had studied in the west and the rest would be from the seven afghan parties praise be to god we were blessed with the coming of this movement it came at time when things came to head and people got sick and tired of bandits of which there were becoming more and more unfortunately the americans and their allies managed to divide afghanistan to five small states you in pakistan doubt are watching this there was state in the east which is called hawzat sharq jalalabad they are ningirhar lughman and kunar there was state and president of state their leader was haji qadir in the west there was another state there was state and president of state led by haji qadir in the west there was another state hawzat gharb muhammad ismail khan and he ruled over three to four provinces between hirat farah and numrouz and that too was virtually independent government from afghanistan in the north there was the state that was supported by the communists in the past and it was led by dostum he had provinces there in the north and the center there was government ruled by ahmad shah masud and najib and sayyaf what is shocking is that every time muslims are deceived how can we believe that government can be established in kabul and in one neighborhood we have najib the communist who killed more than 70000 muslims and right next to him there is ahmad shah masud how can we belie ve that they had joint gove rnment in the full sense of the word and that the former comm unist president najib sign s the state budget then we are told we are not communists and we do not support the communists in reality it was joint government being supported by foreign parties and najib was part of it the southern part was state for the taleban it consists of the provinces of qandahar zabol and hilmend so there were five governments in this small state not to mention the bandits who were considered small states with the states for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited

depict them but it was rather pulling force from the inside people had become sick and tired of road bandits and from paying taxes and protection money so any tribe that had students of religion who had connections with the taleban they the taleban would ask the students to come to this or that province this is why we see that engineer hekmatyar was on the borders of kabul for four years he had the public support of pakistan and was trying to move forward few meters to seize kabul but he could not it is known that the islamic party led by hekmatyar is the best afghan party in terms of power organization and deployment in afghanistan he could not move forward on the other hand it is also known these students of religion are generally young and many of them had not participated in fighting but because of the popular support after the people had reached state of despair from previous events they were successful hekmatyar i honestly think that this war was forced on us just like these wars were imposed on all the muslims in the world i ask you why are all the wars taking place in the muslim world why are muslims being killed and their houses destroyed why are the problems in europe nd the united states easily solved while simple issues in the muslim world ignite vicious wars why the problems in algeria palestine and kashmir i think that the hizbe is lami is the underdog unf ortunately the muslim world does not know how this war was imposed starting with the war that the coalition government in kabul declared against the hizbe islami and later the taleban movement why does the us state department say we are the ones who did not permit hekmatyar to enter kabul the us defense minister said we cannot allow the hizbe islami to rule kabul while cia official tells cnn we have decided to destroy the hizbe islami this is what they say but there are people who do not know how the war started who is funding it and why it is being launched against the hizbe islami or why the coalition government and later the taleban movement are waging war against the party the united states was behind this war just to prove to everyone that jihad is failure if an islamic government was formed by the mujahidin after the collapse of the soviet union the united states be lieved that this type of government will spread to the rest of the rest of the region they thought to themselves we must strike at this movement and not allow the mujahidin to form an islamic g overnment they consequently imposed this war on us ismail in 1991 and 1992 i interviewed him bin ladin more than once to find out some details at that time i was correspondent for londonbased alhayah newspaper and he was the head of reconciliation committee between the afghan factions that were at war in some stat he was chosen by these factions as neutral party that is supportive of afghan jihad in general after 1992 when the mujahidin parties entered the afghan capital kabul and were at war with each other which stunned all observers especially the muslims usama bin ladin along with number of arab islamic activists who were in peshawar and other arab countries exerted intensive mediation efforts between hekmatyar masud and rabbani but all these efforts this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 129 for official use only failed so he moved to sudan in mid1992 and stayed there until may 1996 when the sudanese government was forced to ask him to leave according to the afghan information minister in the taleban government deal was made between the united states and sudan to drive usama bin ladin out to afghanistan because afghanistan has means of communication in return for this the sanctions and economic and political pressure on suda n was to be eased off atwan he bin ladin told about attempts to tempt him to stop his jihad and the money he was offered he said and he was telling the truth that he was offered hundreds of millions of dollars and he refused them he named the mediators who visited him whether in sudan or even in afghanistan to talk him into going back and he refused he used to affirm tha t he will stick with this appro ach until the end and that he has dedicated his life to the cause of god and islam he was saying this without hesitation he told about his days in sudan and the challenge he faced when arab aid to sudan stopped and how he was able to survive with limited local resources he told about the agricultural projects he carried out in the aljazirah area in sudan he told that this country can feed the whole world if it were allowed to be properly invested he told about how he was able to produce record number of sunflowers his agricultural projects were many and included cotton farms he wished he could have stayed in sudan and continued his projects but he was forced to flee back to afghanistan najm in 1994 we saw the first attack against us targets in the middle east begin the target was riyadh the headquarters of the us mission which was training the saudi national guard in 1996 an attack was carried out in alkhubar the headquarters of the us marine force some reports linked both with usama bin ladin who made every effort to praise the men who carried out the attacks usama bin ladin these were popular reactions by young men who willingly offered their lives seeking the satisfaction of almighty god i hold in great esteem and respect these great men because they removed the brand of shame from the forehead of our islamic nation whether those who carried out attacks in riyadh or those who carried out bombing attacks in alkhubar and east africa and other places i also view with great esteem our brother cubs in palestine who are teaching the jews lessons in faith and the pride of the faithful regrettably after these daring operations in palestine the worlds infidelity was gathered it is cause of sa dness that they gathere d on the soil of egypt they gathered their agents from the rulers of the region the arab rulers who had been deceiving the islamic nation for more than half century whenever president and king met they used to say that they discussed the palestinian cause fifty years later the clear picture emerged namely they met not only to betray the muja hidin in palestine but to denounce these cubs whose fathers and brothers were killed imprisoned and tortured in defense of their religion and for endeavoring to evacuate th infidels from their land the proverb says clear things are impossible to explain for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 130 abdalbari atwan chief editor of the londonbased arabic daily alquds alarabi following the attacks on the us forces in alkhubar and in riyadh he bin ladin expressed unusual sympathy with those who carried out the attacks he was very close to saying that they were from among his supporters he was close but he did not say this you sense pride in his eyes that these real men as he told were capable of implementing these two successful operations najm however the real turning point which drew the attention of the united states was the issuance of fatwa religious edict usama bin ladin the previous fatwa says that in our religion we have divisions that are different from what they claim even if they claim something and act in the opposite way we differentiate between the man the woman the child and the old people the man is fighter whether he carries arms or helps kill us by paying taxes and by gathering information he is fighter with regards to reports among muslims that usama is threatening to kill civilians then what are they killing in palestine they are killing children not only civilians but children as well the united states has an advantage mediawise and has great media power that varies its standards according to its needs our enemy the target if god gives muslims the opportunity to do so is every american male whether he is directly fighting us or paying taxes you may have heard these days that almost three quarters of the us people support cliftons strikes on iraq they are people whose president becomes more popular when he kills innocent people they are people who increase their support for their president when he commits some of the ven cardinal sins they are lowly people who do not understand the meaning of principles as i said we are pursuing our rights to ve them the american s evicted from the muslim world countries and to prevent them from dominating us we believe that the right to selfdefense is to be enjoyed by all people israel is stockpiling hundreds of nuclear warheads and bombs the christian west is largely in possession of such weapons hence we do not regard this as charge but rather as right we do not accept to see anybody level charges against us in this regard it is as if you were accusing man of being courageous knight and fighter it is as if you were denying him this only man who is not in his right mind would level such accusations this is right we supported the pakistani people and congratulated them when god was gracious enough to enable them to acquire the nuclear weapon we regard this as one of our rights of muslim rights we disregard such wornout us charges let us say that there are two parties to the c onflict the first party is world christianity which is allied with zionist jewry and led by the unite d states britain and israel while the second party is the muslim world in such conflict it is unacceptable to see the first party mount attacks desecrate my lands and holy shrines and plunder the muslims oil when it is met by any resistance on the part of the muslims this party brands the muslims as terrorists this is stupidity peoples intelligence is being belittled we believe this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 131 for official use only that it is our religious duty to resist this occupation with all the power that we have and to punish it using the same means it is pursuing against us the us claims are numerous if we presume that they are true we are not concerned by them these people are resisting the forces of wo rld infidelity that occupied their lands why should the united states get angry when the people resist its aggressions its claims are baseless however if it means that i have something to do with instigating them i would like to say that this is obvious i have frequently admitted to having done so i admitted that i was one of those who cosigned the fatwa re ligious edict that urged the nation to engage in jihad we did so few years ago thanks be to god many people responded favorably to our fatwa of these people were the brothers whom we regard as martyrs they were brother abdalaziz almithim who was killed in riyadh brother muslih alshamrani brother riyad alhajiri and brother khalid alsaid the only strength is that bestowed by god we beseech almighty god to accept them all during interrogation they admitted to coming under the influence of some of the statements and circulars we issued to people in these statements and circulars we communicated the fatwas issued by clergymen regarding the n eed to engage in jihad against these us occupiers atwan i felt that the man had his own vision and special strategy this strategy is based on his concept of the region the first point in this strategy is that the us administration or the us forces whic h he considers occupation forces in the gulf and arabian peninsula are prelude to comprehensive israelijewish hegemony over the region with the aim of looting its wealth nd humiliating its muslim pe ople one senses this as the essence of his creed and strategy therefore he believes that expelling these us forces from the arab world is top priority he believes that the regimes should be reformed or more correctly changed the regimes immune to reform should be changed the shariah should be applied properly and just islamic system should be set up in the islamic and arab states particularly the gulf states this is summary of his strategy currently he does not want to fight the re gimes that is what he told he wants to fight the americans who are protecting these regimes najm although usama bin ladin insists in all his statements that his role is confined to the issuance of fatwas and instigation he almost stated in the interview conducted with him by our correspondent jamal ismail that he was aware of all aspects of the us embassy explosion in nairobi usama bin ladin it was painful blow they the americans had not sustained such blow since the blowing up of the marines in lebanon the nairobi us embassy was actually six embassies combined in one the brutal us invasion of somalia kicked off from there some 13000 from among our brothers women and sons in somalia were killed under the banner of the united nations reports corroborated by photographs said that our somali brothers were grilled as if they were sheep it is only god who bestows strength they did not speak about the scope of brutality or aggression and so forth and so on muslims are always reproached when they defend themselves for the past few decades plots have been hatched to partition sudan from there these plots are hatched for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 132 in nairobi as is widely known the us embassy in nairobi is the agency that is doing this the greatest cia center in eastern africa is located at this embassy thanks to gods grace to muslims the blow was successful and great they deserved it it made them taste what we tasted during the massacres co mmitted in sabra shatila dayr yasin qana hebron and elsewhere najm the united states did not make do with the bombardment it issued an arrest warrant against usama bin ladin and pr omised 5 million prize to whoever provides information leading to his arrest it tr ied to freeze his financial assets usama bin ladin began his odyssey in afghanistan when he was 22 years old now he is 42 years old he was the paramount arab afghan the number of arab afghans in afghanistan is diminishing those who met him sa id that he is longer the same man atwan i believe that the nairobi and dar salam bombings changed bin ladin he was aware that the american s were targeting him but not with this intensity there was not single piece of evidence that he was behind the alkhubar and riyadh bombings he may have been wanted by the americ ans but there was powerful evidence incriminating him i think tha t the situation now is different non etheless even prior to these two incidents the man took all the necessary security precautions for example i know that he built camp in the open air to give the impression that it was his base when he was interviewed by cnn it was not base i am aware of this he did not allow the cnn team to bring its own camera the team left for the camp and found the camera waiting for it it was bin ladins camera he asked the team members not to bring anything with them the cnn team members were inspected pur sued and monitored indirectly to make sure that they were neither followed nor monitored by the us intelligence service the man knows how to take care of his security concerns i hope that he will be successful in his efforts in this regard he is taking his own precautions i know that he is now in secure place that his moves are banned not because taleban wants to restrain his moves but because it wants to protect him taleban officials have strong convictions that the press and press men are the trap that could track his whereabouts and bring about his liquidation ismail it goes without saying that he feels that is under siege he as well as the afghan talebanled government have admitted that his moves in afg hanistan are not restrained nonetheless he is banned from engaging in any action originatin g in afghan territory against any country whatsoever regardless of whether or not it has recognized the talebanled government all that he is currently doing on afghan territory is confined to addressing appeals engaging in mediarel ated activities and issuing fatwas along with group of afghan or other clergymen promoting fighting which taleban cannot ban or restrain because this is enshrined in koranic verses and traditions of the prophet najm the base was destroyed but bin din survived he is trying to mobilize more supporters even though he has fears that their number may shrink in the future usama bin ladin when jihad was obscured for long time we saw the emergence of generation of students who did not experience the heat of jihad they were affected by this report may

of the worlds we praise him and we seek his help and we seek his forgiveness we seek refuge from allah from the evil in ourselves and the vile consequences of our actions whomsoever allah guides there is none to lead him astray and whomsoever allah leave to go astray there is none to guide i testify to the fact that there is nothing in the heavens above nor the earth below which deserves to be worshipped except allah he is one he has partners likewise i testify to the fact that muhammad ibn abdullah is his last prophet and messenger we thank allah abundantly for this great blessing alislam this is great blessing which allah has used to rescue us from the darkness of disbelief to the light of iman faith allah has blessed us in that he has sent onto us the most noble of his creation muhammad saw he his mercy onto us allah has sent him to us after raising him up from among us he allah has revealed unto muhammad saw the most sacred book and he has chosen the closest angel jabril as to transmit this book unto muhammad saw you should understand that mankind any person who does not follow the holy quran and the sunnah of our beloved prophet muhammad saw not only is he astray but he should lead wretched life because man was created weak as allah has said in surah 428 he doesnt know what is beneficial for him or what is harmful onto him however by follwing the divine example of the holy prophet muhammad saw he will achieve success by entering into the dise by the will of allah taala so concerning the life of this world the prophet saw has made it clear to us whats the way to inherit the paradise noone can deny that the most noble soul to set foot on the face of the earth was the prophet muhammad saw and he is the most noble both in this life and the hereafter he is the seal of the prophets and the last messenger he is their imam as he led them in salah at jerusalem he will be given the great intercession on the day of judgement when all the prophets will refuse to intercede and with all this what was his aim what was his objective with all this he wished to always be mujahid and nothing else but except mujahid he saw wished to always be shaheed person who died on the battlefield fighting fo r allah he saw said in hadith by allah in whose hand is my life it is my desire to wage jihad fisibilillah and slain then i come back and slain and he said this as much as ten times this is the gr eat shahaada the great martydom which the holy prophet saw constantly yearns for hence the happy person is the one who makes the holy prophet saw his role model in life in seeking martydom for allahs sake not the man who piles up wor ldly incumberances and material things in this dunyia and he comes to the hereafter with nothing to show in regards to worship nothing to show in regards to sacrifice nothing to show in regards to jihad and martydom this is the purpose of life so we dont waiver to the right side or the left side but our only goal is straight forward shahaada dying for allah fighting for allah dying for allah to make his word ilaha illallah the highest the slogan of allah ilaha illalla h the highest and the kalama the slogan of kuf far the lowest of the low then he read the poetry the hi gh blow may be many times the high blows are many but the short and swift blow which cause the enemy to bleed are the best of blows this report may contain

since not seen in this ummah since the coming of our beloved prophet saw and this calamity is that the holiest lands of isla m are being occupied by the jews and the christians this disgrace never occurred before in the islamic peninsula not even in the days of the mushrikeen call to mind abraha the christian king of ethiopia came with his army of 60000 strong to destroy the kabah before islam the arabs even though they were pagens they stood up with whatever forces they had to repel the aggression of abraha and his christian army man called abu ragal volunteered to be his guide to lead him to the kabah the house of allah taala and allah taala destroyed him killed him on his way between tahif and makkah upon reaching makkah the elephants refused to go forward out of reverence and respect for the kabah the house of allah but the christians of ethiopia did not take heed ev after they saw the ephants refuse to go forward they did not take heed from the sign so they marched forward and proceed forward towards the kabah upon marching forward allah taala sent against them birds pelting them with bake clay so allah said didnt you see how we dealt with the companions of the elephant didnt we cause their evil strategy to go to waste and we sent against them birds pelting them with stones of baked clay pelting with baked clay so that they became like vegetables squashed up this was great miracle this year is called the year of the elephant this is the year the prophet muhammad saw was born when abraha came with his army of 60000 strong chritian men to demolish the house of allah swt today history has repeated itself there is new abraha in our midst today and new abu ragal in our midst today who wish to demolish the house of allah taala abu ragal who wish to lead the jews and the christians towards the sacred sight of alislam who wish to let the jews and the christians enter the holiest land of islam here are the men of this deen the men of islam one is coming forward to rescue allahs deen to rescue allahs house to purify allahs holy land to purify the sanctuary of allah as muslims we should all implement the hadith of the prophet muhammad saw we should all implement his commandment when he was on his dying bed he said drive out the jews and the christians fro m the islamic peninsula drive out the pagans from the islamic peninsula two religions must be found in the islamic peninsula so even in this book islamic fatawa regarding women p36 when sheikh bin baz was asked the question about allowing nonmuslim maid to come and work in the islamic peninsula his response was swift it is not allowed to have nonmuslims maid it is not allowed to have nonmuslim male or nonmuslim male servant or worker who is nonmuslim for anyone living in the islamic peninsula this is because the prophet muhammad saw ordered the jews and the christians to be expelled from that land he ordered that only muslims should be left there hew decreed upon his deathbed that all polytheists must be expelled from this peninsula furthermore hiring disbelieving men and women is very dangerous for the muslims their faith their behavior and the upbringing of their children for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 140 therefore such must be prevented in obedience to allah to glorify and his messenger saw and to prevent source of evil and immorality and allah is the one who provides guidance so it is known of islam by necessity that two religions must be allowed in the islamic peninsula and if one female nonmuslim kafir female was not allowed based upon this fatwa how can we allow half million american troops in the islamic peninsula so the american troops today christians jews crusaders prostitutes lesbians homosexuals atheists all these people are walking in the holy land where allah taala has chosen to reveal the alquran where allah taala has chosen to reveal the deen where makkah and madina is placed so this house the kabah allah holds it in great respect and reverence salah is accepted from anyone unless he faces that house the kabah whenever you make hajj your hajj is not accepted unless you face that house the kabah so the question is what will be your excuse on the day of judgement how can you exhonerate yourself what will be your excuse when you stand in front of allah and you are asked what did you do to drive out the jews and the christians from the islamic peninsula how can you allow kafirs jews and the christians to occupy the holiest land of islam what will be your excuse when you stand in front of allah on judgment day when you will be asked this question today there is ev british consulate in makkah although british is the greatest enemy to islam and muslims the british was responsible for destroying the caliphate system they are the ones who created the palestinian problem they are the ones who created the kashmiri problem they are the ones who put the arms embargo on the muslims of bosnia so that two million muslims were killed they are the ones who are starving the iraqi children today and they are continuously dropping bombs on these innocent children of iraq yet they have an embassy in makkah in the holiest lands so what will be your excuse when ou stand in front of allah and you are asked what did you do to cleanse the islamic peninsula from jews and the christians these occupying powers the kafirs occupy makkah and madinah and even alquds hence the first wajib compulsory act upon you after your declaration of faith ilaha ilillah muhammadan rasoolullah saw is for you to fight and kill the americans and the jews and drive them out of the islamic peninsula takbir allahu akhbar takbir allahu akhbar takbir allahu akhbar then and only then will you be helping isla m then and only then you will be cleansing the holy places to help this deen and to remove your sins which you have committed by carrying out this great path of allah alhumdulillah thuma humdulillah all praise is due to allah who s made jihad compulsory upon all of us and who has made it the peak of the matter so

collected by attirmidhi the hair of this matter is islam and its pillar is salah and the peak of this ma tter is jihad jihad was compulsory upon us brothers and sisters to liberate muslim territories from kufr from jews and christians nd their allies the allies of the jews and the christians meaning socalled muslims who ve apostated and have beco allies of the enemies of islam we have to liberate our lands from jews and christians and their allies their helpers and their stooges some may ask the question whats compulsory upon regards to this deen and how can i fight and kill the americans the jews nd the christians and dr ive them out of the holy land we say to you the sahaaba migrated they abandoned and they immigrated so what did they abandon and where did they migrate to they abandoned their land they abandoned their homeland they abandoned their families they abandoned their properties and they migrated to madinah almarwa but the link that holds the muslims together the bond that bonds us together is the bond of iman which is the strongest bond so they left their country and established almadinah at the holy hands of the holy prophet muhammad saw so its incumbent on all the muslims to ignore these borders and boundaries which the kuffar have laid down between muslim lands the jews and the christians for the sole purpose of dividing us so the border between afghanistan and pakistan we do not recognize that the border between yemen and the islamic peninsula we do not recognize that the border between egypt and sudan we do not recognize that the border between syria and jordan palestine iraq we do not recognize that because the bond that binds us as muslims this ummah is ilaha ilillah muhammadan rasoolullah saw allah does not look at your skin color he doesnt look at your bodies nor does he pay attention to your nationalities but instead he looks at your heart and these muslim hearts are shining with revelation which is inside of them shining with the quran shining with the sunnah of the prophet muhammad saw the sahaabas came from all places left their land and came and one said how can i left yemen so the companions of the prophet saw came from all places they left their lands their homes their properties and they all made hijra to madinah this concept never came across their minds because of their strength in iman they did not say how could i left the comfort of our homeland to fight alongside the propeht saw at the battle of ahzab against the kuffar who marched from all over to demolish the islamic state of madinah they didnt say this but they struggled over valleys over mountains over hills until they all reached madinah so today after the whole world was sunken in darkness of kufr sins oppression and jahiliya ignorance all these darknesses lamp emerged shining lamp in this darkness and that lamp is afghanistan for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without

commanding us to fight them even when they are in their own countries and allah taala has even commanded to us in another ayat where allah taala says fight them who are closest to you and let them find harshness in you so if you were commanded to fight them even when they are in their own countries how can you have them in the holiest land of islam this land where allah taala has chosen to reveal the holy quran inside of this land is makkah the land of holy revelation the land of the prophet saw where is musk is and where is grave is it is incumbent upon us muslims to remind the believers of the importance of killing these kafirs fighting them and killing them and reminding them that they are our enemies brother and sisters let remind you that all of you will die except the

almalazz neighborhood in riyadh in 1377 hegira 1957 or 1958 depending on the month in which he was born then god was gracious to us as we went to holy medina six months after i was born for the rest of my life i stayed in hejaz moving between mecca jedda and medina as it is well known my father shaykh muhammad binawad bin ladin was born in hadramaut he went to work in hejaz at very early age more than 70 years ago then god blessed him and bestowed on him an honor that other contractor has known he built the holy mecca mosque where the holy kabah is located and at the same time because of gods blessings to him he built the holy mosque in medina for our prophet gods prayers be upon him then when he found out that the government of jordan announced tender for restoration work on the dome of the rock mosque he gathered engineers and asked them to estimate the cost price only without profit they said to him with gods help we will be awarded the project and ma ke some profit as well he said to them calculate only the cost price of the project when they did they were surprised that he may god have mercy on his soul reduced the cost price in order to guarantee that gods mosques and this mosque in par ticular are well served he was awarded the project because of gods graciousness to him sometimes he prayed in all three mosques in one single day may god have mercy on his soul it is not secret that he was one of the founders of the infrastructure of the kingdom of saudi arabia afterward i studied in hejaz i studied economy at jedda university or the socalled king abdalaziz university i worked at an early age on roads in my fathers company may god have mercy on his soul my father died when i was 10 years old this is something brief about usama bin ladin as to what he usama bin ladin wants what we want and demand is the right of any living being we want our land to be freed of the enemies we want our land to be freed of the americans god equipped these living creatures with an instinctive zeal and they refuse to be intruded upon for instance if an armed military man walks into chickens home wanting to attack it the chicken will fight back and it is only chicken we are demanding right given to all living creatures not to mention the fact that it is right for all human beings including the muslims this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination

kiblah direction to which muslims turn when praying and then the aggression continued with the crusaderjewish allia nce being led by the united states and israel now they have taken the country of the two holy mosques the only source of strength is allah we seek to instigate the nation to get up and liberate its land embark on jihad for the sake of god and to make the islamic law the highest law and the word of god the highest word of all ismail recently there was joint usbritish attack on iraq first how do you view this attack second the popular and official arab and islamic reactions were reportedly below the required level of resistance or below the ir aqi peoples expectations what is your position on this bin ladin the latest attack on iraq few days ago was led by the united states and britain the attack underscored many important and serious facts we are not talking about the material or human losses inflicted on our muslim brothers in iraq but about the implications of this attack the united stat accuses iraq of using toxic gases against the kurds and against its people it also accuses it of using lethal weapons against iran what draws attention and what people should consider is the fact is that the united states did not talk about iraq at that time it supported it through its brokers and agents in the region when iraq turned into power to be reckoned with in the region and even became the biggest arab power in the region that threatens jewish security and the security of the israeli occupation of the land from which our prophet gods peace and blessings be upon him made his journey to heaven the united states began to dig up these things and claim it wants to take it to task for them it admits that israel possesses lethal and mass destruction weapons but says it does not use them iraq didthis argument is flimsy and rejected the united states is the one which possesses these weapons and is the one which attacked nations in the farthest east in nagasaki and hiroshima after japan had surrendered and the world war was drawing to conclusion nevertheless it insisted on striking at nations including children women and elderly people in fact we must consider israel the real perpetrator of any attack today on any state in the islamic world however for fear that people might wake up and huge popular movements would emerge to topple the agent regimes which failed to support islam and muslims or the sake of maintaining their seats and the feelings of these nations were somehow anesthetized toward the united states the jews managed to employ the christians the americans and british to carry out the duty of attacking iraq the united states claims to be taking iraq to task what is true howeve r is that the israeli and jewish authority is influential within the white house as is clear to people the defense secretary is jew the secretary of state is jew cia and nati onal security official s are jews other senior officials are jews they led the christians into breaking the wings of the islamic world the target is not really saddam husayn but the emerging power in the islamic and arab world they attacked the iraqi people and earlier besieged libya because it had for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 160 chemical factory they also attacked the alshifa pharmaceutical factory in sudan one should note these things another implication of these incidents is that they emphasized clearly and explicitly that muslims and all sensible people should not go to the united nations according to islamic law muslims should not appeal to these atheist temporal regimes but we also urge the nonmuslim wise men not to do so take north korea for example will any wise man even if he is an infidel go to court where the judge sentence incomplete as heard if sentence is issued against us we will be painfully beaten up under what is falsely called international legitimacy if we are judged right the united states will use the veto accordingly muslim should go there because this conflicts with faith likewise wise person even if he is an infidel should go there those who keep talking about the united nations and its resolutions are either ones who do not understand their religion or want to anesthetize the nation by pinning hopes on what is ismail do you think the usuk attack on iraq will increase the popularity of and support for the antius organizations or subjugate and terrorize them against any military or nonmilitary action against the united states and its interests bin ladin in response to this question and what preceded it i would like to say it is time for the islamic nation to realize after these attacks that the states of the region are nonsovereign states our enemies are moving freely in our seas lands and space they strike without seeking anyones permission this time the united states and britain were not able to rally support for this flagrant and exposed conspiracy the present regimes are longer capable of doing so these regimes are either colluding or having lost the ability to do anything against this blatant occupation the muslims particularly those in power and people of good judgment true ulema faithful merchants and tribal chiefs should emigrate for the sake of god and seek place where they can raise the banner of jihad and mobilize the nation into safeguarding their religion and worldly affairs otherwise they will lose everything they should learn lesson from what was inflicted on our brothers in palestine the palestinian people were well known for their activity and agricultural crops citrus fruit textiles and soap which they use d to export the palestinian people who are our brothers are now displaced and expelled everywhere finally they became laborers em ployed by the colonialist jews who would allow them in or deny them entry whenever they want and at the cheapest of wages the situation is serious if we do not move now that the old house the qiblah direction to which muslims turn in prayer the kabah in mecca saudi arabia of 12 billion muslims was encroached upon when will people do so this is significant matter that needs to be addressed deluded are those who think that the current circumstances frighten the islamic movements we the muslims believe that the instant of deat h was fixed the moment we came to existence in our mothers wombs it moves neither forward nor backward our livelihood comes from the almighty god it is god who

agencies cited you or your representative as sayi ng that you will reply to the attack but we have not heard of any reply will there be practical reply if there is new us attack on afghanistan how will the reply be bin ladin our duty and we carried it out is to rouse the nation for jihad against the united states israel and their supporters for the sake of god we continue to move in the direction of instigating people the popular movement of the past few months gives hope it is step in the right direction to force the americans out of the islamic countries due to the circumstances surrounding us and due to our inability to move outside afghanistan to closely pursue this we did only what we could by the grace of god we together with large number of our brothers formed the world front for jihad against jews and crusaders alsalibiyin we believe matters are proceeding well with many of them brothers they are largely active we hope god will help them uphold religion and take revenge from the jews and americans ismail this world islamic front was formed or announced seven or months ago thus far we have not heard anything from it othe r than the statement to which you referred or the news conference you held in the city of khost last summer do you think the front is now practically frozen bin ladin it is not frozen its members are of diverse nationalities and have large margin of movement they should not necessarily announce their actions these months cannot be considered much in the effort to rouse the nation and resist the biggest enemy in the world ismail the united states warned its nationals in the gulf states and the region in current month of ramadan how serious are these warnings and do you target the us nationals in general or the us forces in the gulf and some othe r islamic areas bin ladin i heard this few days ago on radio stations it delighted as it heralded the emergence of the nation thanks to almighty god as for the seriousness of threats i regrettably do not know who undertook this blessed effort we pray to the almighty god to grant them success and bestow on them victory over the infidels americans and others the previous fatwa said that in our religion we have categories that are different from what the infidels claim although they claim something and act differently we differentiate between man woman child and elderly people the man is fighter whether he carries arms or helps us in our struggle by paying taxes and by gathering information he is thus fighter with regard to reports disseminated among muslims

it uses different standards at different times according to its needs with gods help the target or enemy of muslims is every american man who is directly fighting us or paying taxes you may have heard these days that almost three quarters of the us people support clintons strikes against iraq they are people whose president becomes more popular when he kills innocent people they are people who increase their support for their president when he commits cardinal sins they are lowly people who do not at all understand the meaning of values ismail the us pentagon published reports on your health it attributed them to pakistani intelligence they said you have developed an inc urable disease and may not live long they said you will live only five or six months at most first how true are these reports second what is the purpose of publishing these reports now after issuing warnings to us nationals against possible operations by you and your supporters bin ladin i enjoy very good health praised be god whom we always thank as you can see we are living in the mountains we endure this bitter cold we also endure the summer heat praised be god i continue to practice my favorite hobby which is horse riding thanks to god i still can ride horse for 70 km without stopping these are tendentious rumors possibly intended to affect the morale of muslims sympathizing with us they may also be intended to dispel the americans fears that usama might do something what is true is that things do not hinge on usama this is nation of 12 billion muslims which absolutely cannot leave gods old house to the malicious jews and christians the nation god willing will continue along this path we are confident that they will continue jiha d and continue to deal painful blows to the united states and its supporters god willing ismail when the united states bombed afghanistan on 20 august it was reported that you were attending meeting in the khost area which was the ta rget of the us missiles it was also reported that the missile attack was timed to coincide with your presence at that meeting was there meeting and were you present there it was also said that you received message from neighboring country namely pakistan asking you to immediately leave that place because it could possibly be attacked what is your relationship with pakistan nd what is its attitude toward you do you think pakistan will cooperate with the united states in dealing blow to you bin ladin praised be god the americans apparently had wrong information i was not in khost i was not anywhere in the bektiya province i was few hundred kilometers away from that place as for what was said about information reaching us we with the help of god found in pakistan sympathetic and generous people their sympathy exceeded all our expectations ma god bless them we get information from our beloved ones and supporters of jihad against the americans for the sake of god the people of pakistan gave clear indication of how much they hate the us arrogance against the islamic world there are groups in pakistan that sympathize with islam and this report may contain copyrighted material copying and

with the americans the nations enemies ismail do you mean on the official level bin ladin i mean the government groups within the government ismail some arab and foreign newspapers published reports on your attempt to possess nuclear chemical or biological weapons particularly via some merchants from central asian states or former soviet republics how true are these reports especially since the us administration recorded these accusations in the list of 235 charges leveled at you it says you are seriously seeking to possess such weapons bin ladin as i said we are demanding our right to ve them the amer icans evicted from the islamic world and to prevent them from dominating us we believe that the right to selfdefense is to be enjoyed by all people israel is stockpiling hundreds of nuclear warheads and bombs and the christian west is largely in possession of such weapons hence we do not regard this as charge but rather as right we refuse to see anybody level charges against us in this regard it is as if you were accusing man of being brave knight and fighter it is as if you were denying him this only man who is not in his right mind would level such accusations this is right we supported the pakistani people and congratulated them when god was gracious enough to enable them to acquire the nuclear weapon we regard this as one of our rights of muslim rights we will not pay attention to these wornout us charges ismail is this confirmation of the charge s that you are seeking to possess such weapons bin ladin these are not charges it is the duty of the muslims to possess them the united states knows that with the help of almighty god the muslims today possess these weapons ismail the us administration levele d accusations at you on issues they said related to terrorism and the support extended to terrorist groups and others are you ready to counter these accusations and stand trial in neutral court in another state bin ladin there are two parties to the conflict world chr istianity which is allied with jews and zionism led by the united states britain and israel the second party is the islamic world in such conflict it is unacceptable to see the first party mount attacks desecrate my land and holy shrine s and plunder the muslims oil when muslims put up resistance against this party they are branded as terrorists this is stupidity it is an insult to peoples intelligence we believe that it is our religious duty to resist this occupation with all the power we have and to punish it using the same means it is pursuing against usfor official

hard evidence is presented by any state or quarter on the charges leveled at you will you agree to stand trial according to the islamic law which is being applied by taliban bin ladin we left our country to undertake jihad for the sake of almighty god god has honored us with this blessed emigration out of our desire to apply the shariah islamic law this is what we left for country where there is religious court that applies the islamic shariah away from pressures and personal whims this is our aim and demand we are ready at any time to appear before any religious court in which both the plaintiff and defendant stand if the plaintiff is the united states we will also sue it for many things and cardinal sins it committed in the land of islam when the americans god fight them asked taliban to hand over they refused to apply the shariah they said we demand one thing that is to hand over usama bin ladin they deal with people as if they were their slaves or servants this is due to their arrogance may god disgrace them ismail regarding the bombings against the us embassies in east africa in nairobi and dar salaam charges were made against you based on the confessions published in some pakistani and world newspapers they were attributed to muhammad sadiq huwaydah who was arrested in pakistan and handed over to the united states and kenyan authorities he claimed that you ordered him to carry out the bombings what is your opinion about these bombings and what is your relationship with muhammad sadiq huwaydah bin ladin with the grace of almighty god they bombings delighted muslims in the islamic world those who followed world press and media reports saw the extent of the islamic worlds sympathy with the strikes against the americans although people regretted the death of some innocent people of that country what was clear was the mammoth wave of joy that swept through the islamic world this is so because they believe that the jews and the united states have gone too far in their tyranny and scorn of muslims peoples failed to ma ke the islamic states move to defend them or their religion therefore these were purely popular reactions by young men who willingly offered their lives seeking the satisfaction of almighty god i hold in great esteem and respect these great men because they removed the brand of shame from the forehead of our islamic nation when they carried out the bombings in riyadh alkhubar east africa and elsewhere i also view with great esteem our brother cubs in palestine who are teaching the jews great lessons in faith and pride of the faithful regrettably after these daring operations in palestine the worlds infidelity gathered it is cause of sadness that they gathered on the soil of egypt they gathered their agents from the rulers of the region the arab rulers who had been deceiving the islamic nation for more than half century whenever president and king met they said they discussed the palestinian cause fifty years later the clear picture emerged namely they met not only to betray the mujahidin in palestine but to denounce those cubs whose fathers and brothers were killed imprisoned or tortured for trying to defend the ir religion or expel the infidels from their this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 165 for

and the united states ismail yes but the united states says it is confident and has evidence on your involvement in these operations it has not yet revealed this evidence it was reported that investigations revealed that person one of your group or your supporters confessed many things to the us intelligence about your organization and your connection with operations including the bombing of the world trade center bin ladin the us claims are numerous if we presume that they are true we are not concerned about them these people are resisting the forces of world infidelity that occupied their land why should the united states get angry when the people resist its aggressions its claims are base less however if it means that i have something to do with instigating them i would like to say that this is obvious i have always admitted this i admitted that i was one of those who cosign ed the fatwa legal religious ruling that urged the nation to engage in jihad we did so few years ago praised be god many people responded favorably to our fatwa of these people were the brothers whom we regard as martyrs they were brother abdalaziz almithim who was killed in riyadh brother muslih alshamrani brother riyad alhajiri and brother khalid alsaid the only strength is that bestowed by god we beseech almighty god to accept them all during interrogation they admitted to being influenced of some of the statements and circulars we issued to the people in these st atements and circulars we communicated the fatwas issued by clergymen regarding the n eed to engage in jihad against these us occupiers the buddhists north koreans and vietnamese fought against the americans this is legitimate right what right do the arab and islamic media have to criticize the mujahidin who emulated and were inspired by prophet muhammad gods peace and blessings be upon him the prophet was quoted as saying by him in whose hand is my soul i love to invade and get killed then invade and get killed again and then invade and get killed it is our wish to embark on jihad for the sake of god i had earlier told some western media that we missed great deal of honor for not participating in killing the americans in riyadh these accusations are baseless in part and parcel unless they meant instigation true i together with many of my brotherly islamic scholars instigated the nation to embark on jihad ismail muhammad sadiq huwaydah claimed that he received training in your camps and that he personally knew you how true are his claims and the statements attributed to him by some news media bin ladin what i know is that more than 15000 young men mostly arabs received training in the camps of jihad in afghanistan god has bestowed his grace on us and helped us open these camps during the jihad against the soviet union some trainees for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 166 were brothers from the islamic world i firmly believe that the claim that i asked him to carry out the bombing is falsehood fabricated by the us government it has evidence on this even if we suppose that brother huwaydah said this he must have said this or made this confession under torture the torture methods in pakistan or east africa are well known ismail but muhammad sadiq huwaydah also claimed that you ordered the assassination of shaykh abdallah azzam in peshawar in 1989 and that there was struggle over the leadership of the arab afghans or arab mujahidin in afghanistan between you and shaykh abdallah azzam who chaired the services bureau how true are these claims and how do you describe your relationship with shaykh abdallah bin ladin shaykh abdallah azzam may god have mercy on his soul was man worth nation his assassination clearly showed how sterile the muslim women are for not giving birth to man like him the people of jihad who were in the fi eld and lived that era know that the islamic jihad in afghanistan did not benefit from anyone as much as it benefited from shaykh abdallah azzam he prodded the nation for jihad from the farthest east to the farthest west during the blessed jihad he worked with our brother mujahidin in palestine particularly hamas his books particularly his book the verses of the most merciful began to enter palestine and urge the nation to undertake jihad against the jews he began to break out of the narrow regional circle observed by islamists and shaykhs and open up on the islamic world to prod for jihad we were in one boat as is known to you along with our brother wail jalidan plot was concocted to assassinate all we were very careful not to be together all the time i often asked shaykh abdallah azzam to stay away from peshawar due to the increasing plots especially since week or two ago bomb was discovered in the mosque where the shaykh lives in sab allayl the jews were mostly harmed by the movements of shaykh abdallah it is believed that israel along with some of its arab agents were the ones who assassinated the shaykh the jews americans and some of their agents are spreading this accusation that bin ladin ordered the killing of azzam these days it is illogical for someone to behead himself those who were in the field knew how strong my relationship with shaykh abdallah azzam was these are falsehoods said by some and they are baseless there was competition between us shaykh abdallah s specialization was in the field of call and instigation we were in the bektiya mountains he sent us young men and we observed his directives and instructions we pray to god to accept him as martyr together with his sons muhammad and ibrahim and to make up for his loss by sending someone who can carry out the duty he used to carry out ismail following the us missile attack on afghan istan the us president ordered an economic or financial war against you and the commercial institutions you are running of dealing with it is said that the stage of drying up your financial resources has begun wouldnt this cause you financial problems and lead to the dispersal of your supporters in the coming stage this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 167 for official use only bin ladin war has its ups and downs we either win or lose the united states exerted extremely strong pressures on our activities at an early stage this affected us some of the states in which we have funds and property responded they ordered us to stop antagonizing the united states but we believe it is our duty to instigate the nation we continued the instigation with the help of the almighty god we continued and now we have been doing so for several years the us pressures did not actually begin with the latest bombardment some arab countries put economic pressures on us denying us our rights and even preventing our people from paying us our money they are thus following the footsteps of abdallah binsalul the leader of the hypocrites about whom god said they are the ones who say spend nothing on those who are with gods apostle to the end that they may disperse but to god belong the treasures of heavens and the earth but the hypocrites understand not koranic verse the almighty god has punished them and they now live in hardship worse then the restrictions they imposed on us as our prophet gods peace and blessing be upon him said the one who is secure among his people sound in his health and capable of earning his livelihood will possess all the world by god we feel that the whole world is with us money is perishable we call on muslims to spend their money on jihad and be with the jihad movements which have devoted themselves to fighting the jews and crusaders ismail you declared jihad against christians and jews especially americans in the fatwa issued last february but that fatwa coincided with decision by several islamist groups which once engaged in armed struggle to suspend this struggle as is the case now in egypt and algeria and in some arab countries we have also seen these islamist groups engaging in parliamentary life or what is termed the democratic game dont you think that by calling for jihad now that you are moving against the general trend taken by these islamist groups bin ladin we believe that jihad is duty for the nation today but we have to distinguish between jihad as duty and the ability to carry it out any country that has insured the necessary requirements for jihad number and equipment muslims there should embark on jihad against the great infidel now in some countries people may think that they have insured the requirements but discover after while they have not in such case they are exempted of that duty but who defines the requirements is it those who went after worldly affairs or those who do not have enough juristic or military knowledge so the correct thing here is that although jihad is duty it could be ruled out due to lack of ability but preparation to insure the number of equipment cannot be ruled out there is frequent talk among muslims this is not the time for jihad now this is incorrect if not properly documented some scholars also say this is not the time for jihad this is really wrong if documented but if they say that jihad is duty today and we are striving with all the means in our power to insure the number equipment and other necessary requirements this is correct islamic scholar ibntaymah may god be pleased withim says on this point the one who issues the ruling on jihad must be one who is conversant for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is

the nation for while there emerged generation of religious scholars who had experience in jihad they fell under the influence of the us media that invaded the islamic countries and were thus defeated psychologically even before engaging in military action they say we cannot go for jihad true jihad is necessary but we cannot do it but the correct thing is that those on whom god bestowed the grace of jihad as afghanistan bosnia and chechneya god has also bestowed this grace on us can with gods help fight against the enemies of is lam especially the outside great enemy the crusaderjewish alliance i wish to point out here that some youths may god preserve and bless them are influenced by the hesitati on of their elders they think that these revered elders would not have hesitated had they not known the interests of the nation but facts have shown that this is not the case at all it is not necessary for the hesitation of the revered ones stem from their awareness of the general interest when reading the holy koran we find that righteous ones may god be pleased with them were rebuked by god for their hesitation so if the chaste righteous leaders may god be pleased with them had suffered from this disease of hesitation over jihad how could we claim that our present day righteous ones were hesitant over jihad for the sake of the general interest in the holoy koran sura of alanfal god says addressing his prophet may the peace and blessings of god be upon him and the badr battle fighters who were among the most righteous may god rest their souls in peace just thy lord ordered thee out of thy house in truth even though party among the believers disliked it disputing with thee concerning the truth after it was made manifest as if they were being driven to death and they actually saw it if this description d applied to the badr battle fighters the most righteous ones it is only natural to apply to us as well kaab ibnmalik may god be pleased with him says in long tradition in the book of the prophet traditions bukhari wa muslim i hesitated to join the tabuq conquest although i was in good health and had two camels i tried to get ready but the day passed without being able to prepare myself the prophet may the peace and blessings of god be upon him also called for that jihad around harvest time when i wanted to harvest my crops the human being is always subject to world ly interests yet this man was among the vanguards in fact he was among those who signed the great blessed aqaba allegiance accord that launched the state of islam in medina still he stayed behind without any reason in that long tradition kaab said that three men stayed behind this was also mentioned in the holy koran the story says that those who left for the tabuq conquest were 33000 what is 3 compared to 33000 this number is insignificant today for any army this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 169 for official use only commander the absence of 3 out 33000 is an insignificant number but due to the great committed god almighty from the seven heavens mentioned this in the holy koran so as to be taken point against these three men to doomsday kaab may god be pleased with him said i felt so grieved and went to my cousin abuqatadah who was closest to and asked him abuqatadah by the name f god dont i love god and his prophet what strange question but kaab wanted to make sure of his greatest possession in life his love for god prophet to him there was meaning to our life without the love for god and the prophet kaab said my cousin did not reply i appealed to him the second and third time but abuqatadah could not confirm his love for god and the prophet how could he prove it when he stayed behind with others for it wa s said that the romans were getting ready to attack islam in tabuq the prophet left in the heat of the day to defend islam while kaab stayed behind how could he confirm his love for god and the prophet abu qatadah could not confirm or deny his love for god and the prophet but finally said god and his prophet would know kaab shed tear his closest friend could not confirm this great thing the lesson here is that jihad is duty for the nation the unable may not have to go for jihad but we believe that those who waged jihad in afghanistan performed great duty they managed with their limited resources of rpgs antitank mines and kalashnikovs to defeat the biggest legend known to mankind to destroy the biggest war machine and to remove from our minds the socalled big powers we believe that the united states is great deal weaker than russia we have learned that from our brothers who fought in somalia they saw wonders about the weakness feebleness and cowardliness of the us soldier hardly 80 of them were killed when they fled in the dark of the night despite the uproar that was created worldwide about the new world order this is our belief if people fear god and think that they can go to jihad then they should do so and if they think that their present circumstances call for further preparations then they should do so god is allknowing ismail the us administration has allocated the sum of 5 million for your capture or for information that could lead to your capture some people think tha t this sum could attract one of your followers and make him reveal information about you or betray you dont you fear betrayal by anyone bin ladin god be praised you have come and seen what we have these youths and we pray to god to bless them and those who fell martyrs among them throughout this blessed jihad have abandoned worldly life and come to these mountains and land they left their families fa thers mothers and univers ities and came here to face the shelling by us cruise and other missiles some of them were killed as you have learned from our brothers six arab brothers nd one brother turk were killed may god accept them all as martyrs they included our brother alsiddiq from egypt our brother hamdi from for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited

brother zayd salah mutabbaqani from medina these men left worldly affairs and came for jihad the united states which worships money thinks that people here are like it i swear to god that we have not shifted anyone from his place despite this propaganda we do not suspect our brothers still god is our judge ismail on your relationship with the afghan government or taliban movement what is the nature of this movement are you part of this movement or are you working independently in afghanistan bin ladin god has blessed this movement it is now 14 years since the beginning of the jihad that was waged by the former mujahidin the taliban had role in that jihad and helped with the defeat of the soviet union those who raised the flag of jihad at that early stage were blessed by god and made them defeat the largest country in the world and the biggest military power regrettably however the taliban did not capitalize on that victory there was also disagreement in which the united states and some prous arab states had hand they caused sedition between the mujahidin and this led to fighting which everyone regretted this increased the suffering of the muslim people in afghanistan what is regrettable now is that many of the benevolent have stopped their support for afghanistan on the pretext of internal fi ghting this is wrong because the widows and orphans whose husbands and fathers were killed in the war continue to suffer the benevolent among muslims should have come here to patronize these orphans and widows but the satan made them give up support for muslims who defended islam here and in the whole islamic world especially the gulf states whoever looks at the map will know that afghanistan was not the real the target but passageway for the soviet forces having achieved great gains in worldwide at the time the russians thought of dealing final blow to the west seize the strait of hormuz occupy all gulf states and seize the largest oil reserves in the world this explains why some gulf states in fact all of them considered backing th afghan jihad an act of self defense they were partners in that battle but when the russians were defeated they turned their back on the afghans in fact gulf news media began attacking jihad and mujahidin and some gulf states actually colluded in creating sedition among the mujahidin god blessed muslims with the arriva l of taliban rule this was not the result of push by outside forces as portrayed by the western crusader news media but by pull from inside forces people got sick and tired of bandits and the levying of duties and taxes any tribe that had religious scholars linked to tali ban asked the moveme nt to come to its region thus we find that engineer hikmatyar spent four years outside kabul with open this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 171 for official use only pakistani support without being able to venture single step in the direction of the city yet the islamic party led by hikmatyar was the best among the afghan parties in terms of strength order organization and deployment within afghanistan still he could not advance on the other hand the taliban are young and many of them did not take part in the fighting against the russians but due to the internal pull from the people who got desperate with previous actions god made them triumph we advice muslims inside and outside afghanistan to back taliban we also advise muslims abroad that any efforts that are exerted outside the state of islam will not achieve the desired results our prophet spent 13 years preaching in mecca but the outcome was only few hundred followers but with the establishment of the state of medina despite its small size amid the big the persian and roman empires and the warring arab tribes of abs and tibyan that gnawed at this small state right triumphed in the end we call upon muslims to back afghanistan with all their capabilities thoughts alms and funds afghanistan today carries the banner of islam god willing any attack by the united states against afghanistan today would not be against afghanistan itself but against afghanistan the bearer of the flag of islam the true islam that fights for the sake of god god be praised our relationship with them is very strong it is an ideological relationship that is based on faith ra ther than political or commercial inte rests many states have tried to pressure the taliban through temptation and intimidation but god strengthened them ismail but what is the truth about the reports that spoke about the readiness or the possibility of taliban movement or g overnment delivering you to any country in the case of official charges backed by evidence bin ladin as you have heard the taliban have denie d this talk it is incorrect talk as far as we know but god is allknowing ismail you spoke about while ago about your participation in the afghan jihad you said that some states especial ly the gulf states encouraged the mujahidin and in fact aided them among the countries that aided the mujahidin against the soviet union at the time was the united states western and world news media said that you were linked to the us administration or intelligence during the jihad against the soviet union how true was that re lationship if it existed and what is your position on it and is it true that the americans had role in developing our activities against the soviet union at that time bin ladin let go back to point in your previous question on whether we work here independently actually we are not working here independently we are in state with an emir of the faithful we are legally bound to obey him in whatever that does not violate gods words we are committed to this state and call on people to support it we also warn as we said against the confusion created by the united states it wants to for official use only this report may contain

ladin but this will not do as far as we are concerned we have come out here while knowing our course right from the beginning us missiles would not scare us god willing but we warn them that any attack against this people would be an aggression on the state of islam due to certain circumstances in afghanistan the taliban have expressed the view that we should not operate from within afghanistan against any other state this was the decision of the emir of the faithful as everyone knows but we continue to rouse the nation god be praised we feel confident that the nation is taking earnest steps toward jihad against the united states this is the duty of all muslims as i said ismail world news media spoke about us support for afghan jihad against the soviet union and you took part in this jihad personally and with your funds the media also said that you were in contact with the cia and that the agency used to finance your activities and back you in the jihad against the soviet union how true are these claims and your link with the unite d states at that time bin ladin it is an attempt at distortion by the americans praised be god for turning their plots against them every grown up muslim hates americans je ws and christians it is part of our belief and religion since i was boy i have been at war with and harboring hatred for the americans what they are saying did not occur at all regarding their support for the jihad or fighting that support was actually from the arab states especially the gulf states for pakistan in order to back the jihad that support was not for the sake of god but out of fear of their thrones from the russian advance carter who was us president at the time did not utter single word until 1399 hegira corresponding to 20 january year given when he said that any russian penetration into the gulf region would be considered an aggression against the united states since he occupied that region and its oil sources he said that he would use military face if this penetration took place the americans are lying in their claim that they cooperated with us at any time we challenge them to produce any evidence in fact they were burden on the mujahidin and us in afghanistan there was agreement we were just performing duty to support islam in afghanistan although this duty crossed with us interests without our consent when the muslims fought the romans it was known that romans and persians were always at war but sensible person could say that the muslims fought the romans in mutah battle because they were agents for the persians only the interests crossed one another the muslims f ought the romans as part of their duty still this pleased the persians but once they finished with the romans the muslims turned against the persians the crossing of interests without an agreement does not mean any link or subservience we have been against them since those days god be praised we delivered lectures in hijaz and najd on the need to boycott us goods and strike at us forces and the us economy 12 years ago this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the

are these reports bin ladin we are linked to the whole islamic world this includes yemen pakistan and others we are part of single nation god be praised those who are convinced of and enthusiastic about jihad are increasing in number every day we have supporters in yemen and elsewhere we have old and strong ties with yemen god be praised besides our roots go back to yemen ismail how do you describe your relations with other islamic organizations in the arab world and what is the true stand of the islamic jamaah visavis the world islamic front and has it withdrawn from this front bin ladin god be praised our re lations with the islamic jamaah in the islamic wold are good we cooperate with them through piety and godliness for the sake of this religion we call upon muslims especially those who work for islam to rise above secondary issues unfortunately the satans especially the crusaders have managed to preoccupy the states and the small groups in them with regional problems thus you find that egypt has problems with libya and saudi arabia with yemen the groups also face problems while the great infidelity the uscr usader alliance mutilates the islamic world and cancels the decisions of the muslims in an unprecedented manner what is the second part of the question ismail the islamic jamaah in egypt and whether it has withdrawn from the world islamic front bin ladin we have strong ties with the jamaah since the days of the jihad we used to fight in the same trenches against the soviet union they maintained an honorable and supportive stand by signing the fatwa that calls for spilling the blood of the americans and the jews they signed the fatwa but there was confusion on an administrative matter pertaining to the issuance of the fatwa the issuance of the fatwa coincided with the date of the establishment of the front so people were confus ed that the islamic jamaah was part of the islamic front so the jamaah was compelled to explain its position it signed the fatwa but it is not part of the world islamic front ismail what are the final aims that you have set for yourselves and what is the message you want to address to the arab world and islamic world in general bin ladin god be praised as i said we firmly believe sentence incomplete i am saying this due to the strong campaign by the regimes and the media against us they want to deprive us of our manhood we believe that we are men muslim men who must defend the greatest place in existence the holy kaaba we want to have the honor of defending it we do not want american women soldiers including american jewish for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 174 and christian women soldiers defending the grandchildren of muslim leaders sad muthanna abubakr and omar had god not honored us with islam our grandfathers in the preislamic jahiliyah period would have rejected the arrival of these women and red infidels under such claim this claim longer deceives even children the rulers in that region said that the americans came only for few months they lied at the beginning and at the end our prophet may the peace and blessings of god be upon him said that three men would not be seen by god on the day of judgment one of them he said is liar king the months passed and then the first and second year we are now in the ninth year while the americans are telling lies to everyone saying we have interests in this region nd we will not move out until we ar reassured of them an enemy enters and steals your money you tell him you are stealing but he says this is my interest they deceive us with words the rulers in that region have been deprived of their manhood and they think that the people are women by god muslim women refuse to be defended by these american and jewish prostitutes our aim is to work according to gods shariah and to defend the holy kaaba this great and ancient house god has made the existence of mankind on this land based on the belief of the one god through worship and the highe st form of worship after faith is prayer as the traditions of the prophet say prayer is the backbone and jihad its apex god almighty would not accept our prayer if we did not face in the direction of the kaaba god chose for this holy place the noblest of people the father of the prophets ibrahim may peace be upon him after our prophet may peace be upon him and his ismail our aim is to liberate the land of islam from inf idelity and to apply gods shariah until we meet with him and gain his pleasure all those brothers are still waiting for an improvement in conditions before taking any serious action the americans have tried to bribe us into silence the united states and some of its agents in the region have tried to bribe into silence more than 10 times they said keep silent and we will give you back your passport funds and identity card but keep silent they think that people live in this world for the sake of worldly things they forgot that there is meaning to our existence if we did not strive to gain gods pleasure this chart shows the density of population according to age children from birth to 11 years constitute the largest sector in muslim societies the nation would depend on them for the next 60 to 70 years in this age the sector that wants to make sacrifices for the sake of religion especially jihad is fed up as we know person between birth and the age of 15 is not duty bound for jihad and not fully aware of its demands and 25 years onward person will have been involved in family obligations he will also have graduated and become committed to duties toward his job wife and children he becomes mentally mature but his ability to ma ke sacrifices becomes weak he would say where do i leave the family and who would spend on them this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 175 for official use only but if we thoroughly examined the issue we will find that the sector between 15 and 25 years is the one that has ability for jihad and sacrifice this was what we observed in the jihad in afghanistan most mujahidin were from this age when the americans came in the month of muharram 1411 hegira the young ones were not aware of the event unfortunately fatwas were issued by the state the gulf states helped in pressuring the state into issuing these fatwas they claimed that they would be temporary some ulema that we trusted such as muhammad binsalih aluthaymi told us in his council and residence we did not issue any fatwa but when the state introduced the americans they gathered us and said we must issue fatwa otherwise the youths would fight the american forces i spoke with him at length on the need for the council of senior ulema to issue fatwa on the eviction of the americans he told very clearly and may god be my witness usama it is not our right in the council of senior ulema to issue fatwa out of own free will but if it is referred to us by the highest authority as he said we will issue it this is our situation very unfortunately when the people remained silent one knew about this sector from 15 to 25 years nine years have passed since the invasion this entire sector except those who are 16 years old arrived here their age is now 34 years they entered into the sector that matured mentally and could longer make sacrifices and with regard to the young sector that can make sacrifices now nothing is done to prepare the situation for them if we kept silent our situation would be like that existed in andalusia some 10 years would pass and the mentality would then gradually become indolent this is serious people must do all they can to rouse the nation with all the means in their power with their tongues pens and persons with the grace of god we performed our duty and we continue in this duty until we meet god almighty finally i would like to advise all muslims that they should read the holy book it is the one that salvaged us from the rotten backwardness jahiliyah in those dark ages our remedy is in the holy book and the prophets traditions when one reads the koran he wonders why many people are reneging dont they read the koran or do they read it but not ponder it god says ye believers take not the jews and the christians for your friends and protectors they are but friends and protectors to each other and he amongst you that turns to them for friendship is of them verily god guideth not people unjust holy koran he is of them meaning that he becomes infidel like them god says in the next verse those in whose ears is disease thou seest how early they run about among them saying we do fear lest change of fortune bring us disaster ah perhaps god will give thee victory or decision to his will then they will repent of the thoughts which they secretly harbored in their hearts i hope that my brother muslims would read the koran and also read the interpretation of these verses there are many verses in the holy book where god warns us against loyalty to infidels they should read the interpretation by ibnkathir and the abridged interpretation by sha ykh muhammad muslim alrifai i say that the world is for official use only this report may contain

nations have been called up against us god almighty taught us how to reply to those who make excuses in order to delay the jihad god says when at length the order for fighting was issued to them behold section of them feared men as or even more than they should have feared god they said our lord why hast thou ordered us to fight wouldst thou not grant us respite to our natural term near enough say short is the enjoyment of this world the hereafter is the best for those who do right never will ye be dealt unjustly in the very least whoever believes that the enjoyment of this world is short and the hereafter is best and more lasting then he is the one who will respond to gods order in the previous verse which says ye believers take not the jews and the christians for your friends and protectors ibnkathis may god rest his soul in peace explains that the muslims discovered the hypocrites the day they defended and supported the baynuqa jewish tribe today the arab rulers are openly loyal to jews and christians and people are praising the enemies of islam and muslims god forbid there must be serious and sincere pause from which we seek gods mercy for the life of this world is but goods and chattels of deception koranic verse every muslim who can volunteer should do so and inquire about the places of jihad and preparation so he would meet gods pleasure i rouse the faithful and myself after all these great disasters by citing the poet who says get ready for struggle for matters have gone beyond sweet words i will dress up and defend the nation with the edges of spearheads and swords do you abandon us when the many infidel wolves gnaw at our flesh the infidel wolves are turning evil men against us from all parts of the world where are the free men from among our coreligionists to defend women with weapons death is better than humiliated life as shame cannot be erased i pray to god almighty to help muslims return to their religion and to gr ant victory to the youths who went out for jihad for his sake and pleasure god give us patience strengthen our position and give us victory over the infidels god who runs clouds reveals the book and vanquishes enemies vanquish them and give us victory over them god give us grace in this world and in the hereafter and save us from hell god give us victory over the americans israel and their supporters for

in karachi were killed while they were expressing their opposition to the aggression of the forces of crusader america and its allies against the muslims territories in pakistan and afghanistan we beseech almighty god to accept them as martyrs and place them among the prophets the sincere lovers of truth the martyrs and the benevolent people who are the best companions grant their families patience and solace bless their children and property and reward them on behalf of islam those who left children behind them their children are mine i will be their caretaker god willing wonder that the muslim nation in pakistan has rushed to defend their islam pakistan is the first line of defense of islam in this region as afghanistan was on the front line of defending itself and pakistan against the russian invasion more than 20 years ago we hope that these brothers would be the first martyrs in islams battle in this age against the new jewish crusade that is being led by the biggest crusader bush under the banner of the cross this battle is one of islams immortal battles we incite our muslim brothers in pakistan to deter with all their capabilities the american crusaders from

us karachi ummat in urdu 28 sep 01 pp 1 7 exclusive interview with usama bin ladin by unidentified ummat special correspondent the us should search attackers within itself place and date not given first paragraph is ummat introduction fbis translated text kabul prominent arab mujahid holy warrior usama bin ladin has said that he or his alquaida group has nothing to do with the 11 september suicidal attacks in washington and new york he said the us government should find the attackers within the country in an exclusive interview with daily ummat he said these attacks co uld be the act of those who are part of the american system nd are rebelling against it and working for some other system or usama said this could be the act of those who want to make the current century century of conflict between islam and christianity or the american jews who are opposed to president bush ever since the florida elections might be the masterminds of this act there is also great possibility of the involvement of us intelligence agencies which need billions of dollars worth of funds every year he said there is government within the government in the united states the secret agencies he said should be asked as to who are behind the attacks usama said support for attack on afghanistan was matter of need for some muslim countries and compulsion for others however he said he was thankful to the courageous people of pakistan who erected bulwark before the wrong forces he added that the islamic world was attaching great expectations with pakistan and in time of need we will protect this bulwark by sacrificing of lives following is the interview in full detail ummat you have been accused of involvement in the attacks in new york and washington what do you want to say about this if you are not involved who might be usama in the name of allah the most beneficent the most merciful praise be to allah who is the creator of the whole universe and who made the earth as an abode for peace this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 179 for official use only for the whole mankind allah is the sustainer who sent prophet muhammad for our guidance i am thankful to the ummat group of publications which gave the opportunity to convey my viewpoint to the people particularly the valiant and momin true muslim people of pakistan who refused to believe in lie of the demon i have already said that i am not involved in the 11 september attacks in the united states as muslim i try my best to avoid telling lie neither i had any knowledge of these attacks nor i consider the killing of innocent women children and other humans as an appreciable act islam strictly forbids causing harm to innocent women children and other people such practice is forbidden ever in the course of ba ttle it is the united states which is perpetrating every maltreatment on women children and common people of other faiths particularly the followers of islam all that is going on in palestine for the last 11 months is sufficient to call the wrath of god upon the united states and israel there is also warning for those muslim countries which witnessed all these as silent spectator what had earlier been done to the innocent people of iraq chechnya and bosnia only one conclusion could be derived from the indifference of the united states and the west to these acts of terror and the patronage of the tyrants by these powers that america is an antiislamic power and it is patronizing the antiislamic forces its friendship with the muslim countries is just show rather deceit by enticing or intimidating these countries the united states is forcing them to play role of its choice put glance all around and you will see that the slaves of the united states are either rulers or enemies of muslims the us has friends nor it wa nts to keep one because the prerequisite of friendship is to come to the level of the friend or consider him at par with you america does not want to see anyone equal to it it expects slavery from others therefore other countries are either its slaves or subordinates however our case is different we have pledged slavery to god almighty alone and after this pledge there is possibility to become the slave of someone else if we do that it will be disregardful to both our sustainer and his fellow beings most of the world nations upholding their freedom are the religious ones which are the enemies of united states or the latter itself considers them as its enemies or the countries which do not agree to become its slaves such as china iran libya cuba syria and the former russia whoever committed the act of 11 september are not the friends of the american people i have already said that we are against the american system not against its people whereas in these attacks the common american people have been killed according to my information the death toll is much higher than what the us government has stated but the bush administration does not want the panic to spread the united states should try to trace the per petrators of these attacks within itself the people who are part of the us system but are dissenting against it or those who are working for some other system persons who want to make the present century as century of conflict between islam and christianity so that their own civilization nation country or ideology could survive they can be any one from russia to israel and from india to serbia in the us itself there are dozens of wellorganized and wellequipped groups which are capable of causing largescale destruction then you cannot forget the american jews who are annoyed with president bush ever since the elections in florida and want to avenge him then there are intelligence agencies in the us which require billions of dollars worth of funds from the congress and the government every year this funding issue was not big problem till the existence of the former soviet union but after that the budget of these for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 180 agencies has been in danger they needed an enemy so they first started propaganda against usama and taliban and then this incident happened you see the bush administration approved budget of 40 billion where will this huge amount go it will be provided to the same agencies which need huge funds and want to exert their importance now they will spend the money for their expansion and for increasing their importance i will give you an example drug smugglers from all over the world are in contact with the us secret agencies these ag encies do not want to eradicate narcotics cultivation and trafficking be cause their importance will be diminished the people in the us drug enforcement department are encouraging drug trade so that they could show performance and get millions of dollars worth of budget general noriega was made drug baron by the cia and in need he was made scapegoat in the same way whether it is president bush or any other us president they cannot bring israel to justice for its human rights abuses or to hold it accountable for such crimes what is this is it not that there exists government within the government in the united sates that secret government must be asked as to who made the attacks ummat number of world countries have joined the call of the united states for launching an attack on afghanistan these also include number of muslim countries will alquaida declare jihad against these countries as well usama i must say that my duty is just to awaken the muslims to tell them as to what is good for them and what is not what does islam says and what the enemies of islam want alquaida was set up to wage jihad against infidelity particularly to encounter the onslaught of the infidel countries against the islamic states jihad is the sixth undeclared element of islam the first five being the basic holy words of islam prayers fast pilgrimage to mecca and giving the poordue every antiislamic person is afraid of it alquaida wants to keep this element alive and active and make it part of the daily life of the muslims it wants to give it the status of wors hip we are not against any islamic country nor we consider war against an islamic country as jihad we are in favor of armed jihad only against those infidel countries which are killing innocent muslim men women and children just because they are muslims supporting the us act is the need of some muslim countries and the compulsion of others however they should think as to what will remain of their religious and moral position if they support the attack of the christians and the jews on muslim country like afghanistan the orders of islamic shariat jurisprudence for such individuals organizations and countries are clear and all the scholars of the muslim brotherhood are unanimous on them we will do the same which is being ordered by the ameerul momineen the commander of the faithful mulla omar and the islamic scholars the hearts of the people of muslim countries are beating with the call of jihad we are grateful to them ummat the losses caused in the attacks in new york and washington have proved that giving an economic blow to the us is not too di fficult us experts admit that few more such attacks can bring down the american econom why is alquaida not targeting their economic pillars this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 181 for official use only usama i have already said that we are not hostil to the united states we are against the system which makes other nations slaves of the united states or forces them to mortgage their political and economic freedom this system is totally in control of the american jews whose first priority is israel not the united states it is simply that the american people are themselves the slaves of the jews and are forced to live according to the principles and laws laid by them so the punishment should reach israel in fact it is israel which is giving blood bath to innocent muslims and the us is not uttering single word ummat why is harm not caused to the enemies of islam through other means apart from the armed struggle for instance inciting the muslims to boycott western products banks shipping lines and tv channels usama the first thing is that western products could only be boycotted when the muslim fraternity is fully awakened and organized secondly the muslim companies should become selfsufficient in producing goods equal to the products of western companies economic boycott of the west is not possible unless economic self sufficiency is attained and substitute products are brought out you see that wealth is scattered all across the muslim world but not single tv channel has been acquired which can preach islamic injunctions according to modern requirements and attain an international influence muslim traders and philanthropists should make it point that if the weapon of public opinion is to be used it is to be kept in the hand todays world is of public opinion and the fates of nations are determined through its press ure once the tools for building public opinion are obtained everything that you asked for can be done ummat the entire propaganda about your struggle has so far been made by the western media but information is being received from your sources about the network of quaida and its jihadi successes would you comment usama in fact the western media is ft with nothing else it has other theme to survive for long time then we have many other things to do the struggle for jihad and the successes are for the sake of allah and not to annoy his bondsmen our silence is our real propaganda rejections explanations or corrigendum only waste your time and through them the enemy wants you to engage in things which are not of use to you these things are pulling you away from your cause the western media is unleashing such baseless propaganda which make us surpris but it reflects on what is in their hearts and gradually they themselves become captive of this propaganda they become afraid of it and begin to cause harm to themselves terror is the most dreaded weapon in modern age and the wester n media is mercilessly using it against its own people it can add fear and helplessness in the psyche of the people of europe and the united states it means that what the enemies of the united states cannot do its media is doing that you can understand as to what will be the performance of the nation in war which suffers from fear and helplessness for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the

alquaida or other jihad groups with the grace of allah quaida has more than three such lternative financial system which are all separate and totally independent from each other this system is operating under the patronage of those who love jihad what to say of the untied states even the combined world cannot budge these people from their path these people are not in hundreds but in thousands and millions alquaida comprises of such modern educated youths who are aware of the cracks inside the western fi nancial system as they are aware of the lines in their hands these are the very flaws of the western fiscal system which are becoming noose for it and this system could not recuperate in spite of the passage of so many days ummat are there other safe areas other than afghanistan where you can continue jihad usama there are areas in all parts of the world where strong jihadi forces are present from indonesia to algeria from kabul to chechnya from bosnia to sudan and from burma to kashmir then it is not the problem of my person i am helpless fellowman of god constantly in the fear of my accountability before god it is not the question of usama but of islam and in islam too of jihad thanks to god those waging jihad can walk today with their heads raised jihad was still present whe n there was usama and it will remain as such even whe n usama is longer there allah opens up ways and creates loves in the hearts of people for those who walk on the path of allah with their lives property and children believe it through jihad man gets everything he desires and the biggest desire of muslim is the after life ma rtyrdom is the shortest way of attaining an eternal life ummat what do you say about the pakistan government policy on afghanistan attack usama we are thankful to the momin and valiant people of pakistan who erected blockade in front of the wrong forces and stood in the first file of battle pakistan is great hope for the islamic brotherhood its people are awakened organized and rich in the spirit of faith they backed afgha nistan in its war aga inst the soviet union and extended every help to the mujahidin and the afghan people then these are very pakistanis who are standing shoulder by shoulder with the taliban if such people emerge in just two countries the domination of the west will diminish in matter of days our hearts beat with pakistan and god forbid if difficult time comes we will protect it with our blood pakistan is sacred for us like place of worship we are the people of jihad and fighting for the defense of pakistan is the best of all jihads to us it does not matter for us as to who rules pakistan the important thing is that the spirit of jihad is alive and stronger in the hearts of the pakistani people this report

and disgrace and if you find emigration and the carrying of swords difficult back us and do not let us down the least that you can do is to back us by your words forge the glories of your nation with

country that steps into the same trench as the jews has only herself to blame referring to an earlier warning made by sheikh sulaiman abu gaith spokesman for alqaida bin ladin adds that if the sheikh specifically targeted britain and america this war is not confined to them it served as an opportunity for other nations to revise their stance he then proceeds to draw parallels between the war on terror and the crusades of the 12th and 13th centuries this war is similar to the previous crusades led by richard the lionheart king frederick barbarossa of germany and louis ix of france in the present age they rally behind george bush he says shortly after becoming king of england in 1189 richard i set out on the third crusade and in 1191 captured acre in what is now israel his most notorious act was ordering the execution of 2700 muslim prisoners another part of the film features images of several alqaida martyrs believed to have been killed in fighting in kandahar intelligence

months only but that period has extended to this day in which we enter the 13th year of the violation of the land of the two holy mosques by the infidels doubt this initiative is clear attempt to save

dictionary of the sharia this is apostasy by supporting infidels against muslims in our religion this is considered one of the ten greatest sins in islam that lead to disbelief the muslim whoever he

those who follow him for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 206 the us crusade that the us president has declared and in which he led coalition of more than 90 countries against afghanistan began on these days one year ago with the passage of one year since the start of the crusade against afghanistan the united states is today preparing for new round in its crusade against the muslim world it is this time against the iraqi muslim people and its aim is to complete its scheme of fragmenting and ripping apart this nation looting its resources and wealth and preparing for the establishment of the greater state of israel after expelling the palestinians from it we want on this occasion to underline number of things in the following points first the failure of the us campa ign to achieve its main objectives the us campaign has failed to achieve any of its main objectives regarding the elimination of the jihad leaders it has failed to kill or arrest any of the taliban or qaida leaders or any of the other mujahidin leaders regarding the achievement of security nd stability in afghanista n the united states has failed to achieve its promise of uniting the country under one central government and forming unified army to maintain security and eliminate the military militias control the most noticeable success of the us campaign was that unequalled success in repartitioning the country into torn and fragmented cantons where the warlords and former drug dealers are feuding with each other regarding human rights the best example provided by the us campaign here was the burning of hundreds of tied prisoners in jangi fort in mezare sharif with usmade cluster bombs and napalm shells which they claim ar internationally banned and the killing of thousands of other prisoners from thirst and asphyxiation in the death containers in which they were transported under the us forces supervision this is in addition to the thousands of civilians women children and old people who were killed equally by the us smart and idiot bombs regarding the elimination of drugs as promised by the united states and which it made one of the wars objectives it suffices for us to know that the afghan opium crop this year has set an unprecedented record figure all under the supervision of the us and international forces in afghanista n as the united nations has stated the same thing is said about the failure of the dream of rebuilding the country and other such honeyed us promises second the us quandary in afghanistan the us forces of invasion in afghanistan and all their equipment and personnel have now started to sink in the afghan quagmire an unusual paradox is that these crusader forces that came to protect the ruling re gime in kabul from the mujahidins strikes are this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 207 for official use only now themselves in need of the regimes forces to protect them as they are coming under the mujahidins constant attacks who is protecting whom the us and international forces that have come to maintain security have become the biggest burden on security as an american commentator said the us infinite justice operation in afghanistan has turned into the infinite failure and frustration operation the us occupation of afghanistan is not going to have better result than the soviet one god willing and this is fact that the us ad ministration has started to realize and is now seeking to cover up its failure in afgh anistan and divertin g attention from that failure by beating the drums of the war on iraq third we do not forgive or give up the mujahidin with the grace of allah still maintain their pledge they do not forgive or give up they are maintaining their pledge to allah to continue the jihad in his cause their pledge to their nation to sacrifice everything that is dear for the sake of liberating it from all forms of injustice and oppression and all forms of subservience and occupation until there is more tumult or oppression and there prevails justice and faith in allah altogether and everywhere surah alanfal all the tribulations and suffering to which the mujahidin have been subjected have only made them with the grace of allah more resolute along the course more determined about the objectives and with stronger belief in the policy and more certain of victory allah has promised to those among you who believe and work righteous deeds that he will of surety grant them in the land inheritance of power as he granted it to those before them that he will establish in authority their reli gion the one which he has chosen for them and that he will change their state after the fear in which they lived to one of security and peace surah alnur fourth an appeal to the nation in these dangerous circumstances through which our nation and even the whole world are going today we address an appeal to this great nation which is the greatest of nations to the victorious and benevolent nation that still has goodness and good people in it until the day of judgment to this nation that is the best of all peoples evolved for mankind to this nation where victorious section in it is s till fighting for justice until the day of judgment and which is not hurt by those who have let it down or opposed it nation of islam you who have believed in allah as your god islam as your religion and muhammad may the peace and blessings of god be with him as your prophet the issue now is not anymore whether the nation is targeted totally and comprehensively with distinction between the so called moderates and extre mists or between allies and enemies the enemy has spared us the task of revealing this truth with his covert and overt statements in which he has revealed some of his hostile intentions rank hatred has for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 208 already appeared from their m ouths what their heart s conceal is far worse surah imran the issue now is how do we confront this blatant aggression and defend our creed honor and dignity and therefore earn the honor of this world and win the hereafter if we want allah to assign victory to us and achieve for us this triumph in this confrontation then we must be armed by several things foremost of them 1 return to allah the first thing we should do is to turn to allah with sincere repentance true repentance by devoted work honest intentions and dedication to justice and by letting shariah rule all aspects of our work and dealings of every minor and major detail of our lives we must admit that the enemys dominance over us is partially the result of what our hands have wrought allah says whatever misfortune happens to you is because of the things your hands have wrought and for many of them he grants forgiveness surah alshura 2 hold fast all together by the rope of allah if it is axiomatic that dispute and diff erence are one of the most important causes of the failure and loss of power from which our nation is suffering today then it is also axiomatic that unity consensus and holding fast to the rope of allah is the key to victory and triumph and the door to sovereignty and leadership ordering unity and consensus allah said and hold fast all together by the rope which allah stretches out for you and be not divided among yourselves warning against division and dispute he said and fall into disputes st ye lose heart and your power depart and be patient and persevering for allah is with those who patiently persevere surah alanfal the unity to which we are calling the muslims today does not necessarily need putting an end to disputes over all small questions and minor issues an end cannot be put to such disputes and their existence is not damaging the unity we are demanding is the unity of the constants of the creed the dogmatism of religion and the schools of shariah 3 mobilizing and unleashing the nations resources our nation is rich with many resources and capabilities and the absolutely most important resource is the muslim person who is the battles fuel and the conflicts motor we do not mean by the person here only the sc holars and propagators who are committed to and working for islam and the sons of the is lamic awakening and movements but also the muslim peoples and all their general and particular groups if the particular groups have their role that others do not undertake then the general groups are the real fuel of the this report

and the one with most capabilities and resources that have been exploited for decades to serve the enemies and conspire against the brothers there are the massive military capabilities that abound in the islamic countries and which have rusted in the arsenals and warehouses years and years have passed without them being used for parade or for defending land but they have remained nightmare towering over the peoples and dagger in the brothers side there are many and many of the nations resources and capabilities that the time has come for them to be liberated and unleashed and for them to rebel and find their way toward defending the targeted creed the desecrated dignity the violated honor the usurped land and the looted resources if the nation has its collective duty and its total role that it must carry out collectively then there are groups who have special role that they should carry out in particular way topping these groups are the scholars and propagators who are the

determination you are the ones who have incited and motivated and before then reared all the men who fought the jihad in palestine lebanon afghanistan and chechnya you are the ones who brought forth the band of heroes in the new york and washington conquests if we do forget we will not forget the heroism of the muslim palestinian woman in the sacred land and her great stands that many men could

enemies of how heavy is the invoice of blood and the heavy losses that they will pay as the price for the ir continued ggression against our nation and their looting of our wealth and resources the heroic kuwait operation also underlined the magnitude of the danger threatening the us forces in whatever islamic country they land the political bureau will issue two separate statements about the two operations and their significance 2 we reiterate our support for our brothers who are holding the live coal around bayt almaqdis in palestine and the mujahidin and the ones standing fast in

despots 3 we assert that the timing of the strike on military target as important as the marines in kuwait the bombing of an economic target of the oil tanker size in yemen and the issuance of udio and written statements by the taliban and alqaida leaderships whose destruction the united states has banked on was not coincidental at all but clear and strong message to ll the enemies and friends

explain the motivation behind our fight against the united states of america and others who have the blood of muslims on their hands these articles have generated number of replies from spectrum of people with variety of sources from which they quote some explanations have been made based on islamic law ye t some quite clearly have not here we outline our reply to two questions addressing the americans q1 why are we waging jihad against you q2 what advice do we have for you and what do we want from you the answer to the first question is very simple because you attacked us and continue to attack us you attacked us in palestine palestine is place that has been suffering from military occupation for more than 80 years the british handed over palestine with your help and your support to the jews who have occupied it for more than 50 ye ars the jews attacked the palestinians viciously sparing method including killings crimes punishments and destruction the creation nurturing and protection of israel is great crime and you are the leaders of this crime and of course there is need to explain and prove the degree of american support for israel the creation of israel is crime and it has to be erased each and everyone who has polluted him or herself with this crime has to pay for it and pay for it heavily the absurdity of your claims brings us to t ears as we see that you have still not become bored of your fabricated lies saying that the jews have historical right to live in palestine as it was promised to them in the torah anyone who tries to challenge you on this argument is given your historical sam reference this fabricated lie is one of the most faulty ones the arabs of palestine are pu re arabs and are the real sams from the prophet sam muslims are the followers of musa peace be upon him and it is the muslims who have inherite d the real torah that has not been changed muslims believe that all the messengers and prophets are from allah including ibrahim abraham musa moses isa jesus and muhammad peace and blessings of allah be upon them all so when those who say that the torah mentions that the followers of musa should live in palestine do they not also see that the muslims are the best suited for this position the blood pouring out of palestine must be treated with revenge of equal quantity and you have to know that the palestinians are not crying alone you must be aware that the women are not becoming widows alone you must be aware that their sons are not becoming orphans alone this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 215 for official use only you attacked us is somalia you ve been silent towards and at times even encouraged russian atrocities against us in chechnya you have clearly supported indian butchery against us in kashmir and the world has been witness to ur relentless assistance to several jewish attacks including killing us in lebanon under your supervision and instructions your agent countries continue to attack us and hunt us on daily basis hence the policies employed in these countries stop our nation from establishing the islamic shariah thereby causing great harm to this ummah the policies employed in these countries makes all of us taste this insult and places us inside the prison of fear the policies employed in these countries steel our ummahs wealth and fortunes and sells them to you for cheap price so that few of the elite may indulge themselves whilst the general population starves to death the policies that are employed in these countries happily surrender to the jews and have been handing over to them most of palestine even allowing the existence of jewish settlements so the removal of these policies is an individual obligation upon us so as to make the shariah the supreme law and to regain palestine our fight against theses policies is the same as fighting against you so it is clear that it is essential that we remove these policies to make the shariah law of allah the supreme law and that we heal the wounds of palestine as you are the chief designers and sponsors for these policies that are causing immeasurable harm to this ummah nation our fight against these policies is the same fight against you you ransack our lands stealing our treasures and oil simply because of the pressure you exert via your international influence and military threats this theft is indeed the biggest theft ever witnessed in the history of the world your forces occupy our lands spreading your ideology and thereby polluting the hearts of our people you have laid siege on our holy places moc king the sanctity of our mosques you have done all of this to protect the jews and safeguard your pillage of our treasures you have starved the muslims of iraq where each passing hour sees new grave dug for yet another iraqi child killed by you it is deplorable that 15 million children have been killed by you and your siege without anyone saying anything yet when 3000 of your people died the entire world woke up and stood to fight and to date have not stopped their fight against us you have agreed with the jews that jerusalem is the capital of israel and have set up your embassy there and it is with your help and support the israelis are planning to destroy the alaqsa mosque you even aided sharon with guards for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 216 so that he was able to enter the alaqsa mosque preparing to capture and destroy it the examples here are only few amongst an ocean of oppression injustice slaughter and plunder carried out by you on our islamic ummah it is therefore commanded by our religion that we must fight back after all how can you expect that after you have attacked us for more than half century that we will then let you live in peace what you wish for is irrelevant what you must be made aware of is that you should expect nothing less from us than jihad and resistance you may then ask why we are attacking nd killing civilians because you have defined them as innocent well this argument contradicts your claim that america is the land of freedom and democracy where every american irrespective of gender color age or intellectual ability has vote it is fundamental principle of any democracy that the people choose their leaders and as such approve and are party to the actions of their elected leaders so in the land of freedom each american is free to select their leader because they have the right to do so and as such they give cons ent to the policies their elected government adopts this includes the support of israel manifesting itself in many ways including billions of dollars in military aid by electing these leaders the american people have given their consent to the incarceration of the palestinian people the demolition of palestinian homes nd the slaughter of the children of iraq the american people have the ability and choice to refuse the policies of their government and even to change their government yet time and time again polls show that the american people support the policies of the elected government the tax paid by the american people is spent against us building planes to bomb our homes in afghanistan building tanks to strike and destroy our homes in palestine to finance the armies that occupy our lands in the arabian gulf and the fleets surrounding iraq these tax dollars are given to israel so that it will be bette r equipped to attack us and penetrate our lands so the american people are israels financial source and through the elected american leaders this money is spent on little else but killing our families in our lands further the american army is part of the american people it is these very same people who are shamelessly helping the jews fight against us this is why the american people are not i nnocent the american people are active members in all these crimes in our religion allah the lord of the worlds gave us the permission and the option to take revenge and return to you what you gave us anyone who tries to destroy our villages and cities then we ar going to destroy their villa ges and cities anyone who steals our fortunes then we must destroy their economy and anyone who kills our civilians then we are going to kill their civilia ns the american government and press still cannot answer why we hit them in new york and washington if according to your president sharon is man of peace then we are also men of peace since its inception america has illustrated that that it does not und erstand the language of love and manners this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 217 for official use only so we are using the language they understand now lets answer the second question what advice do we have for you and what do we want from you the first thing that we are inviting you to is islam the religion of tawheed and association with allah this is an invitation to the love of allah complete submission to his orders and the discarding of all the opinions orders theories and religions which contradict with allahs orders this is the religion tha t allah has chosen to be the prophets peace be upon him religion islam is the religion of all the prophets without any difference we call you to islam the last religion that has replaced all the previous religions the religion of good manners sincerity mercy fear of allah kindness to others justice between people giving the rights to people who deserve them protection of people from oppressors and unjust acts the religion which calls upon its followers to amr bil maroof enjoin the good and nahi an almunkar forbid the evil with hand tongue and heart this is the religion of jihad in the way of allah so that allahs word and religion are made supreme this is the religion of obliga tion to allah demanding its followers to act with justice and equality between people without differentiating between their language sex or color this is the religion that has the quran the book that has not been changed like the other books the quran is the living miracle until the day of judgment allah has challenged anyone to bring book like the quran or even ten versus like it to date this challenged has not been met will not and can not be met as the quran is the uncreated speech of allah we ask you next to stop your unfair acts lies immorality and debauchery we regret to tell you that you are the worst civilization in the history of mankind you are the nation who rather than ruling by the law of allah choose to implement your own inferior rules and regulations thus following your own vain whims and desires you run society contrary to the nature of mankind by separating religion from your policies so much so that people believe that even if they commit adultery theft and other wicked acts as long as they go and confess everything will be okay you are the nation who allows riba interest on money even though all the religions including christianity have forbidden partaking in riba interest on money yet you build your economy and investments on riba interest on money as result of this the jews controlled your economy and then your media and now control all aspects of your life making you their servants and achieving their aims at your expense which is what binyameen benjamin franklin warned you against for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 218 your nation encourages drinking alcohol in all its shapes and forms ie production trading and usage on the one hand you have made selling and using some drugs illegal yet you so often turn blind eye to this vice is it any surprise that your country has the largest drug addiction problem your nation allows immoral acts and you assume that these are part of personal freedom all whilst you continue to move towards this hell without any concern even your policies and rules show concern for these things who can forget your previous presidents immoral acts committed in the oval office after that you did not even bother putting him on trial and instead allowed him to wriggle himself out of the situation without reprimanding him in any way history will remember you for all of this your nation endorses gambling in its all forms your companies practice this as well resulting in the investments becoming active and the criminals becoming rich your nation exploits women like consumer products or advertising tools calling upon customers to purchase them you use women to serve passengers visitors and strangers to increase your profit margins you pla ster your naked daughters across billboards in order to sell product without any shame you have brainwashed your daughters into believing they are liberated by wearing re vealing clothes yet in reality all they have liberated is your sexual desire after all this you say that you are the nation that supports womens freedom you promote immoral acts in all their forms directly and indirectly with the help of this you open the door for your tourists encouraging them to join you in these immoral acts spreading filth upon whoever comes into contact with you and because of all this you have been described as the nation of all kinds of different diseases diseases that had never existed in the past so you have to be proud of yourself because your evil acts have spread aids all around the world especially to the poorest countries in the world killing many millions you are the biggest nation that destroys our natural surroundings and pollutes it with industrial waste you then refuse to sign the kito agreement so that you can continue to profit from these industries whilst leaving world barely inhabitable for our children your law is the law of the rich and wealthy people behind you there are the jews who are controlling your policies media and economy the most unique thing about you is your use of weapons and power everywhere not for defensive purposes but for destructive ones it is you who dropped nuclear bomb on japan even though japan was ready to negotiate an end to the war so what is left on the list of the most heinous evil and unjust acts that you have not done and you call yourself the nation of freedom and justice this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 219 for official use only let us not forget one of your major characteristics which is your duality in both manners and law your manners and policies have two categories one for you and one for the others you claim freedom and democracy for yourselves but for others you impose your monstrous policies and governments calling the tter your american friends of the american friends which of them applies the democracy and freedom that you so cherish when the islamic party in algeria wanted to practice democracy and when they won the election you instructed your friends the algerian army to crush them teaching them lesson from the american book of democracy b your policy on prohibiting and forcibly removing weapons of mass destruction only applies to those countries which you do not want possessing these weapons however for israel they can keep and use them for their self defense anyone else who you suspect might be manufacturing or keeping these kinds of weapons you call them criminals and you have to take military action against them c you are the last ones to respect the resolutions and policies of the yet you claim to want to selectively punish anyone else who does the same israel has for more than 50 years been pushing resolutions and rules against the wall with the full support of america d you search for and imprison war cr iminals yet when it comes to your own war criminals you demand that they are granted immunity however history will not forget your killings in japan afghanistan somalia lebanon and iraq this is disgrace which will be attached to you forever it would be enough to mention some of your recent war crimes against the muslims in afghanistan in which densely populated innocent civilian villages were destroyed bombs were dropped on mosques causing the roof of the mosque to come crashing down on the heads of the muslims praying inside you are the ones who broke the agreement with the mujahidin when they left qunduz bombing them in the qila janghi fortress killing more than 1000 people because of suffocation and thirst allah knows best how many people have died under your torture and torture by the hands of your agents your planes are still looking for anyone remotely suspicious to them bombing their homes and killing their women and children you have claimed to be the vanguards of human rights previously your ministry of foreign affairs used to issue annual statistics of those countries violating human rights however all these things vanished when the mujahidin hit you and after that you became of the chiefs of the human righ ts violators even though previously you had publicly cursed such policies so in your country you started capturing the muslims and arabs placing them into custody without any reason any court trial or even checking their name some of the victims of your human right violations are in guantanomo bay which is real historical embarrassment to america screaming at your faces you hypocrite what is the value of your signature on human rights agreement for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 220 our third piece of advice is that you should be honest with yourself even as i say this i doubt whether you will for if you did honestly look at yourself you would discover that you are nation without principles or manners however you are also people who impose certain values and manners on other people but believe you are above all of that 4 we also advise you to stop supporting israel end your support of the indians in kashmir the russians against the chechens and to also cease supporting the manila government against the muslims in southern philippine 5 we also advise you to pack your luggage and get out of our lands we want you to have successful and happy life so dont force us to send you back in coffins in cargo planes 6 bring to an end to supporting your agents in our countries dont interfere in our life education and politics leave as alone or else you will find us in new york and washington 7 it is better for you to deal with us and interact with us on the ba sis of mutual interests and benefits you have been warned not to continue your policy of stealing our treasures and supporting the jews because this will result in more disasters for you if you fail to respond to all these conditions then prepare for fight we are the nation of islamic monotheism tawheed and we trust and depend tawakkul on allah and we do not fear anyone except allah the quran calls to us do you fear them allah has more right that you should fear him if you are believers fight against them so that allah will punish them by your hands and disgrace them and give you victory over them and heal the breasts of believing people and remove the anger of their believers hearts allah accepts the repentance of whom he wills allah is allknowing allwise quran 9131 we are the nation of honour and respect but honour power and glory belong to allah and to his messenger muhammad peace be upon him and to the believers quran 638 so do not become weak against your enemy nor be sad and you will be superior in victory if you are

we are the nation of islam the nation that was able to dismiss and destroy the previous evil empires like yourself the nation that rejects your attacks on her wishes to remove your evils and fight against you you are well aware that from the very core of our soul we despise you if you refuse to listen to our advice then be aware that you will lose this crusade bush began just like the other previous crusades in which you we re humiliated by the hands of the mujahidin fleeing to your home in gr eat disgrace your nd will be like the soviets who fled from afghanistan after suffering

bin ladin it is dated 14 december 2001 and bears the signature of the alqaida organizations leader the will consists of four pages written on the computer and signed personally by usama bin ladin it is obvious that the alqaida leader wrote it while in position fraught with dangers from every corner and at the peak of the us bombardment of his organizations positions in afghanistan he says allah praise and glory be to him commended us that when death approaches any of us that we make bequest to parents and next of kin and to muslims as whole who are in the illomene d age like parents and next of kin what grieves them grieves and what saddens them saddens and allah praise and glory be to him is witness to what i say it becomes clear in another part of the will that bin ladin felt he was certainly going to be defeated by the western attack on his positions addressing all the mujahidin he says put your trust in allah for allah loves those who put their trust in him ask for his forgiveness and repent to him for he has let us down because of our sins and evil actions and our defeat by him is trial we praise him in prosperity and adversity for allah has power over all things he adds in another paragraph i have chosen road fraught with dangers and for this sake suffered from hardships embitterment betr ayal and treachery if it was not for treachery the situation would not be what it is now and the outcome would not be what it is now this shows that bin ladin was expectin g his death in case he was killed to be the result of betrayal and treachery from those around him this impression is bolstered by his remark in another paragraph as he talks bitterly about what had happened after the us attack my mujahidin brothers and i were grieved when we saw our nation in the east and west watching the united states the head of unbelief afflicting the worst of torment on the oppressed men women and children while the nation watched the painful scene as if it was watching an entertainment movie he then adds the situation was overturned as we saw the co ward crusaders and the humilia ted jews remain steadfast in the fighting while the soldiers of our nation lifted white flag and surrendered to their enemies like women may alla h give us strength only very few from the students of religion he meant taliban remained steadfast the rest surrendered or fled before they encountered the enemy in addition to this the will includes the usual thing in alqaida hardline policy such as bin ladins attacks on what he called the cleanshaven clerics accusing them of issuing

the verses of the sword permeated every cell in my heart and fight the pagans all together as they fight you all to gether how many times did i wake up to find myself reciting this holy verse if every muslim asks himself why has our nation reached this state of humiliation and defeat then his obvious answer is because it rushed madly for the comforts of life and discarded the book of allah behind its back though it is the only one that has its cure and deliverance in the fleeting nd after life the jews and christians have tempted us with the comforts of life and its cheap pleasures and invaded us with their materialistic values before invading us with their armies while we stood like women doing nothing because the love of death in the cause of allah has deserted the hearts my mujahidin brothers and i were grieved when we saw our nation in the east and west watching the united states the head of unbelief afflicting the worst of torment on the oppressed men women and children while the nation watched the painful scene as if it was watching an entertainment movie the principal cause of our nations ordeal is its fear from dying in the cause of allah the situation was overturned as we saw the coward crusaders and the humiliated jews remain steadfast in the fighting while the soldiers of our nation lifted white flag and surrende red to the enemies like women may allah give us strength only very few from the students of religion remained steadfast the rest surrendered or fled before they encountered the enemy today the nation has failed to support us and support the loyal ones from the students of religion who established the first islamic state in afghanistan that applied allahs shariah the evidence of this is americas hatred for the students of religion and their fundamental laws it in collusion with its agents in the northern alliance nd other governments who mobilized their intelligence services to serve the united states britain and the infidel west repealed the fundamental laws that the students of religions government had enacted it repealed the laws on veils and growing beards and restored the practices of imitating the infidels the nation is guided to the strai ght path by its clerics our disease today is that the nations clerics have turned away from their mission of guiding the nation their aberrance and misguidance have reached level that the muslim does not believe they for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 224 came to afghanistan to deter its clerics from destroying the buddhist statues but the virtuous students of religions clerics sent them back empty handed the argument of shaykh and his companions was the need to satisfy the jews christians and their public opinion they forgot allah almightys words never will the jews or the christians be satisfied with thee unless thou follow their form of religion these clerics betrayed their mission of serving the nation and its causes championed its enemies and became hostile to its mujahid vanguards that inflicted on the united states the first defeat in its history and which allah willing will be like the mutah conquest that was commanded by the messenger of allah and led to the disappearance of their state the new york and washington action represented the third of the increasing blows dealt to the united states the first was the bombing of the marines in lebanon and the second was the bombing of the us embassy in nairobi from where the us invasion of somalia was launched during which 31000 of our brothers were killed under the flag despite the setback tha t allah praise and glory be to him has tried us with this battle will lead to the disappearance of the united state s and the infidel we st even after dozens of years youth of the nation crave death and life will be given to you listen to the few of the nations clerics who are adhe ring to the rule guiltlessness and loyalty and who are hostile to those loyal to the nations enemies who have adopted the temporal ideas and the customs and corruptions of the pagan nations such as borrowing from usurious banks the criminal penal c odes and the secular dealings and insurances nd allowed the establishment of parties labor associations womens societies all of which are unacceptable fads as the ancestral clerics and their successors had unanimously ruled clerics of islam you are today small minority and i know you by name and read your statements and your truthful

to you my children forgive because i have given you only little of my time since i answered the jihad call i have shouldered the muslims concerns and the concerns of their causes i have chosen road fraught with dangers and for this sake suffered from hardships embitterment betrayal and treachery if it was not for treachery the situation would not be what it is now and the outcome would not be what it is now i advise you to fear allah for it is the most precious provision in life i advise you not to work with alqaida and the front islamic front for fighting the jews and christians as umar binalkhattab advised his abdallah may allah be pleased with them he forbade him from becoming caliph and said if it is good then we have had our share if it is bad then it is enough for alkhattab what umar had had from it my last advise to all the mujahidin wherever they are recover your breath and forget for the time being the fight against the jews and crusaders devote yourselves to purging your ranks from the agents and the weak and the bad clerics who are refraining from jihad and who have let the nation down your brother abuabdallah usama bin muhammad bin ladin friday 28 ramadan 1422 hegira corresponding to 14 december 2001 the report is followed by majallah comment fear of treachery and an advise to leave alqaida this will is an extremely important document because it points to bin ladins way of thinking and action under difficult conditions its date 28 ramadan 1422 hegira corresponding to 14 december 2001 matches what the experts believe to be the last confirmed date of bin ladins survival several qu estion marks emerge from reading the will and its contents first this will was definitely written during the pressures exerted by the american forces on the battlefronts and bin ladin felt that his hour of death was getting nearer observers and analysts remember that the date at the bottom of the document points to that period during which bin ladin disappeared from view and was not heard of everyone started to refer to the possibility of his death and pakistans prime minister pervez musharraf title as published even said publicly that bin ladin had died basing this on information he had received that the us bombardment of the area in which bin ladin was staying had killed him bin ladin has not appeared in clear and open way so far to indicate that he is still alive despite the recent tape recording of his voice that was aired and which did not include any documented information such as the timing of an incident or the date of public issue the call to jihad could have been from any of his speeches at meeting or gathering or from his lectures to alqaida members second bin ladin refers to betrayal and treachery in several places as if he is expecting treachery and betrayal from those around him this impression is bolstered for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 226 by his remark in another paragraph as he talks bitterly about what had happened after the us attack he said only very few from the students of religion he meant taliban remained steadfast the rest surrendered or fled before they encountered the enemy bin ladin once again underlined the issue of treason at more critical situation when he said i have chosen road fraught with dangers and for this sake suffered from hardships embitterment betrayal and treachery if it was not for treachery the situation would not be what it is now and the outcome would not be what it is now his family third he did not refer to the number of his wives and did not choose any of them to mention in particular especially the older ones among them he did not mention those who had remained with him or who had left and returned to their countries or somewhere else all he did was ask them not to marry after him fourth he did not specify the number of his children or those who had stayed with him and whether they were with him or somewhere safe and who was protecting them and looking after their security and well being the noticeable thing about his children is th at he asked them not to work with alqaida and the world front for fighting the jews and christians which he founded when he was joined by the egyptian ji had organization that is led by ayman alzawahiri it becomes obvious from looking at the example of umar binalkhattab that he cited that he has suffered from alqaida more than he has benefited from it by asking his children to stay away from it the agents fifth bin ladins advise to his followers whom he addresses in his will by telling all the mujahidin in case of his death of course to forget for the time being about fighting the jews and crusaders and to devote themselves to purging their ranks from the agents and the weak and the bad clerics who have refrained from jihad and who have let the nation down beside meaning ceasing the world jihad and focusing on reorganizing and purging the ranks this recommendation once again confirms the importance of bin ladins remarks about betrayal and treachery to the point where he makes the purging of the ranks his mens priority in case of his death even if this necessitated forgetting or ceasing the world jihad for the time being it could also be interpreted as the planting of new qaida cells in other parts of the world outside afghanistan as some experts are asserting sixth he did not refer to any of his friends and those close to him such as mullah omar ayman alzawahiri abuhafs sayf aladl and others this is quite remarkable and looks as if the will was written away from them this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without

movements and calls for unity of islamic factions correction added urgent tag fbis translated text alsharq alawsat obtained yesterday new message prepared by the islamic studies and research center in pakistan the main mouthpiece for qaida organization the message is titled islamic action between causes of consensus and advocates of disagreement alamal islami bayn dawai alijtima wa duat niza the foreword was wr itten by usama bin ladin the leader of the secret organization whom washington is hunting down as the main defendant in the september 2001 terrorist attacks on washington and new york the islamic studies and research center reported exclusively during the past months alqaidas operations most notably the mombassa operation in kenya the faylaka operation in kuwait and the attack on the french oil tanker limburg in yemens waters last october bin ladin says in new message that fundamentalist sources in london say was written only few weeks ago it is the extent of differences and disunity among muslims in general and those working for islam in par ticular that the muslim observes today which is surprising and bewildering this dangerous phenomenon has almost become the only point of consensus and agreement between the vari ous islamic action factions in the arena bin ladin adds in the 26page message the importance of the message does not lie only in its contents but also in its source it comes from the depth of the jihadist tendency inside the blessed islamic awakening it expresses broad sector inside this tendency which used to be and is still described as the proudest of its views on disputed issues among the islamic tendencies he did not talk about or touch upon the other jihadist or islamic tendencies that disagree with alqaidas thinking he hastens to add however if the feelin g that disunity and differences are dangerous and unity and agreement are important has prompted this important party in the cause to raise it within this universal and unifying framework then it is with greater reason that the other parties should deal positively with this proposal the alqaida leader goes on to say the message we are presenting today falls within the framework of the commendable efforts that are closing an important gap in this matter the message sets forth the most important evidence from the holy book the sunna and the sayings of the nations ulemas concerning the need for unity and for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 232 consensus and renunciation of disunity and differences and for concentrating on the effects and damages that differences in views cause he then reviews the is lamic situation and the splits di fferences disunity and disagreements in which it is living according to bin ladin the message underlines the need for adhering to the course followed by the people of the sunna and for set of shariah rules that govern the relationship between muslims nd those working for islam so as to protect their islamic brotherhood even if they hold different scholastic views and practical interpretations the fundamentalist sources in london disclosed that this is the first time that bin ladin affiliates himself openly to the jihadist tendency in the past he spoke about jihad as religious duty that is as an absolute but now affiliates himself to specific tendency with ideological precepts and practices that distinguish it from the other islamic tendencies the new crusade prepared by alqaida on cd bin ladins message asks when will muslims wake up from the long slumber and deep sleep when will they rise to carry out serious action for their religion and call when will they distinguish between their friend and their enemy when will they point their arrows with which they are fighting each other at their external enemy that is oppressing their nation looting and robbing its resources and wealth on his part libyan islamist numan binuthman the expert in fundamentalist movements said in telephone contact with alsharq alawsat that this latest message is not the only one prepared by alqaidas political bureau there is another 160page book titled the new crusade that is on cd and its foreword contains dedication to the us congress there is also the allegiance and disavowal book by ayman alzawahiri leader of the egyptian jihad organization and bin ladins righthand man this book can be found on the islamic studies and research centers in ternet website alzawahiri had earlier written knights under the prophets banner book which alsharq alawsat published last year as part of his recollections about some contemporary leaders of the islamic movements the libyan islamist said the purpose behind the publication of these fundamentalists studies is an alqaida attempt to restore the conceptual structure of the jihadist tendency movement he pointed out that the new crusade book defines alqaidas priorities in the operations against us targets and is dedicated to the us congress he asserted that bin ladins new message comes at the right time because it presents through its shariahbased evidence and documentation clear call to renounce the differences between the fundamentalists matter how profound they are and to unite the ranks against the external enemy this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 233 for official use only he explained that all alqaidas recent books agree on the need to stand by the believers and to be hostile to the infide l who are in particular the united states and israel that is to concentrate on the violent struggle between the forces of unbelief tyranny and arrogance and the muslim nation and its jihad vanguard and which reached its peak with the new york and washington conquests in reply to an alsharq alawsat question about the timing of publishing bin ladins message the libyan islamist an swered that he is still live and said bin ladins death or arrest is something that cannot be kept secret the man does not live alone but is hiding among group of islamists who are in charge of protecting him he added such thing cannot be kept secret especially in the afghan milieu that is known to be unable to keep secret the arab aghans who took part in the jihad against the russians used to joke and mock this to the point whe re they said that if you wanted the secret of the last arab afghans operation then go to the afghan cook at the front and he would tell you all the details bin ladins message touches on the muslims differences and disunity and says these are not anymore something inherited from the old negative legacy which the muslims inherited from the past eras and the direct occupation ones but they are being entrenched and deepened in the islamic awakenings reality by those working for islam who are rearing the generations on these differences and planting in their minds in practical way the idea that action according to them is part of the rules of allegiance and disagreement the message adds in addition to being disobedience to allah the almighty disunity and differences are the cause of betrayal defeat and failure disunity and differences about the reality in the islamic arena and the disunity and differences it is living in bin ladins message says despite what islam and its people are suffering from at the hands of their enemies the secularist movements despotic governments and infidel nations and despite the calamities from which the nation is suffering foremost of them the desecration and occupation of its holy places the occupation of territories and the violation of honor despite all this and that the muslims are still wholly engaged in violent differences blazing feuds and issues and matte rs that are not part of the rules of religion or the consensus where differences are not permitted the message addresses sharp criticisms to the enemies who are waging an intellectual campaign of disinformati on parallel to the military crusade in an endeavor to patch up the wornout reality touching on the secularists it says tongues very often seek to harm the propagators ulema and seekers of knowledge who hold their heads high because truth is on their side at time when the heads of the lowly bend before the storm of falsehood betray the trust of the truth and offer it in the street of inducement and intimidation the tongues that seek to harm the ulema are quite often the same ones that praise and extol the actions of the despotic and other ene mies of islam and muslims who have declared war on allah and fought his holy men and supported his enemies for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 234 the message then goes on to justify the mistakes of the organizations leaders and downplay their consequences it says under the headline mistake is assessed proportionately that the human being is by nature liable to make mistakes and to err this being so and as all the virtuous and ulema are liable too rules ought to be laid down that protect their dignity from bein g destroyed and their status from being wrecked for some mistake they make it adds the crucial factor is not persons mistakes but his good deeds and righteousness his status is not wrecked because of an accidental mistake from which one is infallible there is contradiction in the message that ignor the mistakes of alqa idas leaders and demands that rules be laid down to protect its ulemas dignity while at the same time not ignoring the mistakes of those who have moved to the camp of tyranny and falsehood and who have devoted themselves to fight the truth and its upholders the message urges the loyal youth to mobilize their efforts for the battle that has not finished yet by saying the situation that muslims are living in today requires the mobilization of everyone who belongs to this religion and the utilization of his resources and efforts in the battle that islam is fighting against the crusaders alliance which has bared its teeth and revealed its true objectives from figh ting islam and muslims and is not content anymore with what its agents in the region are

and all companions as to the description of these acts as terrorism it is false and as to the youths whom god had opened their hearts transfe rred their battle to the heart of the united states and

pronouncements sees link between your recent oath in which you said verbatim i swear by god almighty who raised the heavens without pillars that the united states will not enjoy security before it becomes reality in palestine and the terrorist attacks in new york and washington what is your opinion on this conclusion bin ladin the link is understandable since we roused these acts we roused such acts for years and issued statements and fatwas religious rulings on them there was continuous rousing in many meetings and in the media if they or you meant that there was link between these acts and the rousing then it is correct we rouse and rousing is duty today god almighty entrusted it to the best of mankind muhammad may the peace and blessings of god be upon him when he said then fight in gods cause though art held responsible only for thyself and rouse the believers it may be that god will restrain the fury of the unbelievers for god is the strongest in might and in punishment the fury of the unbelievers is restrained through fighting and liberation the link is correct we roused the believers to fight the americans and the jews this is correct alluni shaykh usama bin ladin alqaida organization is now facing country that dominates the world militarily politically and technologically under what logic can qaida which does not have the material capabilities posse ssed by the united states defeat that country militarily bin ladin praise be to god i say that the battle is not between alqaida and the world crusade the battle is between islam and muslims on the one nd and the world crusade on the other with gods grace this organization fought on the side of our brother afghan mujahidin and people used to say the same things and even more they said how could you defeat the soviet union the soviet union then was great power that frightened the whole world even nato used to tremble with fear from the soviet union where now is that power which was said to be impossible for our brother mujahidin with gods grace the soviet union has vanished into oblivion it longer exists it split up into severa l small states with only russia left it was god almighty that gave us the support and the help to defeat the soviet union and god almighty will give us the support once again to defeat the americans on the same land and with the same people that was gods grace we believe that th defeat of the united states is possible god willing in fact it would be easier god willing than the earlier defeat of the soviet union alluni how do you explain that why is would it be easier

nothing it left quicker than people had imagined it forgot all the big uproar it created in the media about the new world order and its being the master of that order which could do what it liked praised be god it swallowed up all those trivialities gathered its army and withdrew in abject defeat we fought the russians from 1979 to 1989 and with gods grace we continued fighting the afghan communists today we are at the end of the second week what big difference there is between the two battles and two groups we pray to god to give us support to break americas back for he is omnipotent alluni regarding the land you said we will defeat it on the same land dont you think that alqaidas existence on afghan soil costs the afghan people heavy price bin ladin this is narrow view and not full view it is view from one angle when we came to afghanistan to support the afghan mujahidin against the russians who entered in the year 1399 hegira corresponding to 1979 ad the saudi government asked us officially not to proceed to afghanista n it said our entry into afghanistan would implicate the saudi regime the message th at came was an order to not to go to afghanistan but to stay with the refugees in peshawar it said that if the russians arrested that would be proof of support for the mujahidin against the soviet union at that time the whole world trembled from the soviet union but i ignored the ban it was wrong from their view point when we came to afghanistan for the first time we suffered great deal for the sake of saving muslim lives protecting children preventing harm to muslims and supporting religion that was the duty of all muslims and not just the afghans therefore if my brethren or i have carried out the duty of jihad in support of our brethren in palestine this does not mean that i alone must assume this duty it is duty which everyone and the entire nation must assume for the sake of god today jihad is duty for ourselves afghans and others true they already assume this duty but it is sharia duty which they and others must assume for the sake of god they attack the afghans because of us although this is not personal issue the united states did not seize my funds or hurt in any way they are enraged because we have roused people against the jews and the americans in defense of the islamic nation it is also understood that the united states was against the establishment of an islamic state in afghanistan the emir of the faithful said that on more than one occasion taliban leaders also made similar statements so they were targeted for their religion and due to the existence of usama bin ladin the emir himself said that the british came and attacked afghanistan before the existence of usama bin ladin the russians also came before we came and now the americans have come and we pray to god that he would defeat them the way he defeat ed their allies before them this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 237 for official use only alluni let us go back to the attacks in ne w york and washington what is your assessment of what happened and what is its effect on the united states and the islamic world the question is in two parts please bin ladin i say that what happened in new york and washington on tuesday 11 september was great event by all standards and its repercussions continue to this moment the collapse of the twin towers has taken place while ago but the repercussions continue let us speak about the economic effects that are still continuing according to their own admission the loss in wall street was 16 percent they also said it was an alltime figure since the market opened more than 230 years ago the big collapse in the dealings in this market amounted to 4 trillion if we multiply the 4 trillion by 16 percent we will find that the loss sustained by their shares amounted to 640 trillion this figure is equivalent to sudans budget for 640 years this was their loss as result of the strike that took place in just one hour with gods assistance the daily us income is 20 billion there was business during the first week due to the psychological shock and one has gone to work to this day due to the big shock if you multiply 20 billion by seven days the answer is 140 billion but it is actually more than that you have to add it to the 640 billion so what is the result it is more than 800 billion the loss of buildings is more than 30 billion the number of employees dismissed by aviation companies to this day or until two days ago was over 170000 us researches and studies say that more than 70 percent of the american people suffer to this day from depression and mental disturbances after the attacks on the twin towers and the defense department the pentagon one famous international hotel chain intercontinental dismissed 20000 employees one can actually determine the total losses due to their vastness numerousness and ramifications god be praised they are on the increase what is obvious is that the loss is at least 1 trillion god be praised with these blessed and successful strikes we pray to god to accept the brothers as martyrs and to make paradise their abode but i also say that there are other repercussions which are more serious than the collapse of the twin towers it is the collapse of the western civilization headed by the united states the incidents destroyed its values they also destroyed those huge moral towers that spoke of freedom human rights and humanity they vanished into thin air this was clear when the us government intervened and banned the news media from carrying our statements which were just for few minutes it was because they felt that the truth would become clear to the am ericans that we were not terrorists in the sense they wanted but were aggrieved parties in palestine iraq lebanon sudan somalia kashmir the philippines and other places this was reac tion by the youths of the nation against the attacks by the british government possibly slip of the tongue as he might have meant the us government thus they made those statements and gave those orders and forgot the opinion and the other opinion and such things therefore i say that us liberties and human rights have gone to the guillotine and might vanish forever unless they realize that very soon the government will push the americans and the west in general into an unbearable for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without

serving the interests of israel which kills our sons and children without any right so that they would remain in power alluni regarding the effect of these operations on the islamic world there have been conflicting statements on the one hand there has been an overwhelming joy in the islamic world and on the other you have heard official and private statements saying that these are unacceptable terrorist attacks against civilians and that they conflict with the teachings of the islamic religion and so on what is your assessment of what has happened on the basis of your follow up of what is taking place in the islamic world through the network which you own and run in different parts of the world bin ladin i say that events have greatly proven the terrorism which the united states is practicing against the world bush has said that the world must make choice between one of two parties there is the party that supports him and that any state that does not join the bush government and the world crusade will necessarily be considered with the terrorists can there be clearer terrorism than this one thus many states that do not control their affairs had to go along with this powerful world terrorism they were compelled first to appease him and say we are with you but when they knew full well that we were defending our brothers and holy places the statements by the leaders whether in the west or in the east said that it was esse ntial to resolve the problem by eliminating the basic causes of terrorism what are these causes they said it is the palestine question so we are people with just cause but fearing the united states they could not say that we were the defenders of just cause but said we were terrorists so go ahead and resolve the palestine question due to these strikes and their repercussions bush and blair moved and said that it was time an independent palestinian state was established good grace it was not possible to resolve the issue for the past 20 years except when this strike took place these people only understand the language of force and fighting just as they fight us we must also fight them until we achieve balance of terror this is the first time in this modern age in which the two sides the muslims and the americans come closer to balance of terror us politicians used to do what they liked with us the victim was banned from crying or paining muslims were crushed and clinton came out after the 1996 qana massacre to say israel had right to defend itself they did not even rebuke the israelis and while the new president bush and secre tary of state colin powell were still in the first months of their administration they said that they would allow the transfer of the american embassy to jerusalem to become the eternal capital of israel the congress and the house of representative applauded them what sheer hypocrisy and plain injustice they will not understand until the blows fall on their heads thus with gods grace the battle was transferred to us territory we will continue with it god willing until victory or martyrdom this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 239 for official use only alluni i see that your answers always lead to the talk about palestine and the palestine question let us pose this question your recent statements or to be more precise statement that you made several years ago called for fighting the jews and crusaders we recall that the statement carried title which included quotation from prophets tradition it said expel the infidels from the arabian peninsula you emphasis then was on evicting the americans from the ar abian peninsula recently however we have observed change in your priorities you have placed the palestine question or what you term alaqsa issue as first priority nd the issue of the two holy mosques as second priority if i may so what is your comment on that bin ladin i say that doubt the jihad to liberate alaqsa and save the oppressed people in palestine lebanon iraq and all muslim countries is religious duty doubt also the liberation of the arab ian peninsula from the infidels is religious duty but the talk that i have given priority to the palestine question is not correct this humble subject delivered lectures in the year 1407 hegira urging muslims to boycott us goods i used to say then that the americans were taking our money and given it to the jews to kill our brothers in palestine this is religious duty and that is religious duty there are many such religious duties including the jihad in kashmir and other places the front which we established few years ago was called the islamic front against jews and crusaders both issues are important but sometimes developments in one issue prompt us to take more action in its direction without ignoring the other direction alluni what were the deve lopments that made you push in the direction of the palestine question bin ladin the outbreak of the recent blessed intifadah the rajab september 2000 intifadah prompted us to push in this direction this was the main reason that made us push in this direction rather than the other direction but our endeavor shifts from one duty to another moving from one duty to another is not taboo in religion the duties serve one another the strike against the america ns on the palestine question serves the strike against them on the issue of the two holy mosques and vice versa the americans in tabuk and the eastern region of saudi arabia consider themselves second defense line for the jews so there is conflict between the two issues alluni let us now consider the case of the jews and crusaders as you said you issued fatwa calling for jihad against the jews and crusaders mean while other ulema issued different fatwas some have supported you but other have criticized or opposed your fatwa some of them asked under what religious basis must we kill jew crusader or christian simply because of his religion there was also coordination between your fatwa and those by the other ulema bin ladin praise be god i say that many fatwas have been issued on these matters muslim ulema in pakistan issued many fatwas especially the one by mufti nizamuddin many fatwas were also in the arab countries especially in the land of the two holy mosques foremost was the one by hamud binabdallah binuqlah alshuaybi may god prolong his age he is one of the prominent scholars in the land of the two holy for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 240 mosques he supports fighting americans and israelis in palestine and permits the spilling of their blood and the seizure of their property fatwa was also issued by shaykh sulayman alalwan moreover scholar published book on the reality of the new crusade wars he refuted the claims made by those who say that jihad is wrong and those who say that it is religious duty but he also noted certain evils yes i read them all and he was successful in that may god bless him alluni and what about killing innocent civilians bin ladin killing innocent civilians as the united states and some intellectuals claim is strange talk what i mean to say is that who says tha t our sons and civilians are not innocent and that it is right to spill their blood when we kill their civilians the whole world from east to west cries out and the united states instigates its allies and small agents who says that our blood is not bad and theirs is good who issued such fatwa who has been killing in our countries for scores of years more than one million children died in iraq and many more are still dying why didnt we hear anyone denouncing these acts or supporting or even condoling tradition by the prophet says woman was put in hell for tying up cat without feeding it or letting it feed itself this was just cat how about the millions of muslims who are being killed where are the intellectuals writers and ulema where are the free men where are the ones with faith in their hearts how can these people take action when american civilians are killed while we are being killed daily and our children are killed in palestine every day there is big fault here there must be clear and strong stand as well as recalculation but it is in the nature of people to support the powerful without knowing what it is they talk against us because they know that we will not respond to them and when they stand alongside the governments and americans they feel something without knowing that it is arab history tells us that an arab king once killed man people then were used to kings killing people the brother of the victim lurked for the king and killed him when this man committed this act to avenge for his brother people said do you kill king for the sake of your brother he said why should the king be different this is soul and that is soul and souls are equal so the blood of muslims is equal in that age blood was equal the man said my brother is my king the man you see is my king we also say that all our sons in palestine are our kings we will kill the kings of infidelity the kings of the crusaders and the infidel civilians for killing our sons this is permissible legally and logically alluni so you say that it is on the basis of reciprocity they kill our innocent civilians and we kill their innocent civilians bin ladin we kill their innocent civilians and it is permissible legally and logically because some of those who spoke on the subject argued on legal basis alluni what is their proof this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 241 for official use only bin ladin they said it is impermissible and cited the proof that the prophet may the peace and blessings of god be upon him banned the killing of children and women this is correct alluni this is exactly what we are wondering about bin ladin but the ban on killing innocent children is not absolute there are provisions that restrict it god says and if ye do catch them out catch them out worse than they catch you out religious scholars including ibnalqayyim alshawkani and qurtubi say in their inte rpretations and many also say th at if infidels purposely kill our women and children then there is reason why we should not treat them equally so as to stop them from killing our children and women again now this is from the legal aspect as for those who talk without religious knowledge they say that it is impermissible to kill child the youths whom god opened the way for them did not intend to kill children they simply attacked the biggest military center in the world the pentagon that has more than 64000 employees it is military place and the center of military power and expertise alluni what about the world trade center towers bin ladin those who were killed in the world trade center towers were an economic power not school for children or house those who were in the center backed the biggest economic power in that world that sows corruption on earth these people must pause and recalculate they mu st recalculate we are treating them the way they treat us those who kill our women and innocent civilians we will kill their women and innocent civilians until they stop that alluni news media and intelligence services say that you are running wide network that is spread out in 54 countries reports also say that alqaidas financial assets are enormous and that you are using them in the operations that are carried out moreover they say that you back islamic movements or movements that are called terrorist in several other places the question posed to you is how attach ed is alqaida to the person of usama bin ladin bin ladin praise be to god i say in response to your question and repeat what i said before that the matter does not concern this humble subject or alqaida we are the sons of an islamic nation whose leader is muhammad may the peace and blessings of god be upon him our god is one and he is the almighty allah our prophet is one who is muhammad may the peace and blessings of god be upon him our qibla is also one we are one nation with one book this holy book and the prophets traditions oblige us under the sharia to become brothers in faith all the faithful are brothers the faithful are brethren the question is not as portrayed in the west that there is an organization known by such and such name this name is very old it emerged without our intention brother abufor official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 242 ubaydah albanshiri may his soul rest in peace set up military training camp for youths to fight the tyrannical oppressive and atheist soviet union which really terrorized peaceful civilians we used to call that training camp the base the name then stuck as to ourselves we are not separate from the nation we are the sons of the nation and an indivisible part of it thes massive demonstrations from the philippines in the far east to malaysia indonesia india pakistan and mauritania only express the conscience of the nation these youths that sacrificed their lives in new york and washington and we pray to god to accept them as martyrs were the spokesmen of the true conscience of the nation they were its pulsating conscience which believed that there must be revenge against injustice the tyrant the criminal and the terrorist who truly terrifies innocent people not every kind of terrorism is censured there is malignant terrorism and benevolent terrorism the criminal thief is frightened of the police do you tell the policeman you are terrorist because you frighten the thief police terrorism of criminals is benevolent terrorism the criminals terrorism of innocent civilians is malignant terrorism the united states and israel practice malignant terrorism and we practice benevolent terr orism which deters those who kill our children in palestine and other places alluni what is the alqaida strategy in th arab states it was observed that some arab states criticized what took place in new york and washington and supported us charges that you were behind what happened in new york and washington some of these states went even beyond that in their criticism such as the recent comment by the saudi interior minister in which he warned people against following your course and statements do you have any speci strategy for the arab states and what is your reply to the recent statement by the saudi interior minister bin ladin i affirm that we are part of this nation and our aim is to support our nation and remove the injustice humiliation and submissiveness our aim is also to remove the rules that the united states has imposed on its agents in the region we want this nation to be ruled according to the book of god who created it i heard part of the statement made by the interior minister he accuse d directly he said we consider muslims infidels god forbid we be lieve that muslims are muslims we do not consider any one of them infidel unless he viola ted any of the known islamic rules intentionally but we say that in general our interest is to unite the nation under the book of god and the traditions of his prophet may the peace and blessings of god be upon him we want the revival of this nation under the islamic caliphate as predicted by the prophet in his traditions he said that the caliphate would return the nation must unify its efforts against this crusade it is the most savage and violent crusade against the islamic world since the dawn of islamic history many crusades have occurred in the past but this one is unprecedented bush himself spoke about this crusade the strange thing is that we are misquoted and people believe that they believe the saudi interior minister when he says we consider muslims infide ls god forbid but they find excuses for bush when they he did not mean to say crusade war he said that it was crusade war bush was also considered right when he said you ar either with us or with terrorism in other words you are either with the crusade or islam this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 243 for official use only today bush is the leader and bearer of the big cross i swear to god that anyone who follows bush in his plan is renegade from the creed of muhammad may the peace and blessings of god be upon him this is one of the clearest rules in gods book and the traditions of the prophet may the peace and blessings of god be upon him the ulema have issued fatwas on this subject and the proof is in the words of god when addressing the faithful ye who believe take not the jews and the christians for your friends and protectors they are but friends and protectors to each other and he amongst you that turns to them for friendship is of them verily god guideth not people unjust religious scholars say that who befriends infidels blasphemes one manifestation of this friendship is making statements of support those who follow bush in his campaign against muslims blaspheme god also says those in whose hearts is disease thou seest how eagerly they run about amongst them saying we do fear lest change of fortune bring us disaster ah perhaps god will give thee victory or decision according to his will then will they repent of the thoughts which they secretly harbored in their hearts god also says and those who belie ve will say are these the men who swore their strongest oaths by god that they were with you all that they do will be in vain and they will fall into nothing but ruin ibnalkathir may his soul rest in peace says in his interpretation of the koran that many of the prophets companions did not know that abdallah binabi binsalul was hypocrite infidel when c onflict occurred between the muslims and the jews the prophet may the peace and blessings of god be upon him wanted to punish the jews this hypocrite suddenly sided with the jews against the prophet thus the verse those who befriend infidels blaspheme was revealed then came the next verse which emphasized the same point ye who believe if any from among you turn back from his faith soon will god produce people whom he will love and they will love him lowly with the believers mighty aga inst the rejecters fighting in the way of god and never afraid of the reproaches of such as find fault that is the grace of god which he will bestow on whom he pleaseth and god encompasseth all and he knoweth all things i tell muslims to be very careful of befriending jews and chri stians and to the one whose tongue has slipped with word to fear god and repent for what he did alluni even for one word bin ladin even for one word and whoever befriends them with one word falls in apostasy extreme apostasy power is from god alluni but this is very big section of the nation bin ladin it is not big section this is the ruling of god almighty it is clear in his holy book in fact it is one of the clearest rules alluni how about the arab and islamic governments bin ladin whoever does not hurt us when say this or that knows the truth and he will know its people this is gods book it is one of our constants even if the whole world for official use only this report may contain copyrighted

infidelity alluni is it possible to find excuses for some helpless states let us take qatar for example it is small state whose foreign minister said once i am surrounded by great power that could wipe out of the map easily therefore i am compelled to strike an alliance with the americans and others is it possible to find an excuse for the state of qatar kuwait or bahrain for example bin ladin in these islamic matters where the faithful are killed the talk about coercion by these people is not acceptable under the sharia if the amir of qatar ordered man to kill your and then we asked the soldier why he killed your brother nd he said i was forced to do it you taysir know how dear you are to but i was forced to do it this how peoples blood is wasted under such excuses this coercion is not acceptable the soul of this soldier is not better than that of your he has right to appoint an oppressor to kill your this is not acceptable under the sharia alluni what is your comment on what samuel huntington and others say about the inevitability of the clash of civilizations your repetition of the words crusade and crusades indicates that you support the inevitability of the clash of civilizations bin ladin i say there is doubt about that it is clearly established in the book and the sunna faithful muslim can deny these facts whether it is said or not what counts to us is what exists in the book and the sunna of our prophet may the peace and blessings of god be upon him but the jews and the united states have come out with fib to make simple muslims believe it unfortunately the rulers of the region and many others believed the call for peace and world peace this is baseless fib alluni peace bin ladin the peace they claim is intended to lull muslims before butchering them for the butchering continues if we defend ourselves they say we are terrorists and the butchering continues our prophet may the peace and blessings of god be upon him said doomsday shall not come until muslims fight jews jew would be hiding behind tree or stone the tree or the stone would say muslim subject of god there is jew behind come and kill him the only exception is gharqad tree is tree that belongs to jews whoever claims that there is lasting peace with the jews is disbeliever of what the prophet may the peace and blessings of god upon him said our conflict with the enemies of islam will continue until doomsday the socalled peace prize is fib awarded to the biggest murderers here is begin the man behind the dayr yasin massacre on 10 april 1948 awarded the peace prize here is traitor anwar alsadat who sold the land the country the cause and the blood of the martyrs awarded the peace prize we are at the time ntioned by our prophet may the peace and blessings of god be upon him in his traditions he said there will come time when people will witness years of deception when people would believe the liar rather than the truthful and trust the traitorous rather than the honest and the alruwaybidah would spread asked what this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 245 for official use only is alruwaybidah the prophet said the trivial man who speaks on public affairs this unfortunately is the state of affairs of the islamic world under its big leaders and known leadership it is deception they deceive and lie to people but god willing gods relief and promised victory are near alluni so we can conclude from what shaykh usama bin ladin said that he assesses that the current crisis in afghanistan and the war now waged by the united states and its allies are taking place within the circle of the conflict between what you call the crusade and islam but how do you see the way out of the current crisis bin ladin as i said we are in strong and deci sive battle with the jews headed by israel and the zionists and crusaders who help it we will not hesitate to kill the israelis who occupied the site jerusalem of the ascension of our prophet may the peace and blessings of god be upon him and who are killing our children women and brethren day and night whoever stands in their trench must only blame himself as to how we can get out of the crisis this is in the hands of the others as for us we are the aggrieved party our first duty is to end the aggression whoever aggresses upon us must lift his aggression the prophet may the peace and blessings of god be upon him has heralded that we would fight the jews on this land this blessed land near the site of the ascension the united states has in volved itself and its peop several times for more than 53 years it is the one that recognized israel it is also the one that supported it moreover it is the one that set up an air bridge in the year 1393 hegira corresponding to 1973 ad under nixon from the united states to tel aviv with weapons equipment and men thereby changing the course of the battle how can we not fight it every muslim must fight it if it wants salvation we said it in simple words but these words frightened the united states they ridiculously claimed my messages were coded messages for the terrorists it is as if we are living in the age of pigeon carriers and that there are telephones travelers internet ordinary mail express mail or email the whole thing is ridiculous they insult peoples intelligence the words were our oath that the united states will not dream of security until it becomes reality in palestine this exposed the us government and showed it an israeli puppet placing the interests of israel before the interests of its own people the question is simple the unite d states will not come out of this crisis unless it comes out of the arabian peninsula stops supporting israel and interfering in the affairs of the islamic world if we ga ve this equation to any child in any american school he would have solved it in seconds but being agents bush and his followers will not be able to solve it until the swords fall on their heads god willing alluni shaykh usama do you have any message to address to your viewers bin ladin regarding this crisis this conflict and this fighting between islam and the crusade i assure you that god willing we will continue this jihad and rouse the nation until we meet god as we were promised the war with the jews will continue as it is now any country that joins the jewish trench should only blame itself if shaykh salman abughayth had only mentioned the united s tates and britain in his previous statements for

these countries only it was just to give the other countries chance to revise their calculations what has japan got to do with our affairs who has involved japan in this difficult strong and fierce war against our sons in palestine japan will not endure if it involved itself in war with us therefore it should reconsider its position what has australia which is in the far south got to do with the oppressed people in afghanistan and palestine what has germany got to do with this war other than the subject of infidelity and the crusade it is repetition of the old crusades led by richard the lion heart barbaroza of germany and louis of france the same thing is happening toda the moment bush raised the cross all the crusade countries rush to him what have the arab states also got to do with this crusade war and the intervention day and night the states have chosen to be ruled by the cross but whoever supports bush with one word let alone facilities or socalled facilities would be committing high treason they are twisting things there arent any military facilities they say yet they cooperate with them to kill our sons how can we believe that this regime is collecting donations for the innocent here in afghanistan when it is the main cause for the presence of the americans and their allies in the land of the two holy mosques how can we believe it when it is the main cause for killing more than one million children dont these people and rulers have hearts and faith how can they have faith when the infidels and debauchers against the sons of islam they help them against our sons in iraq and palestine i say tit for tat those who talk about innocent civilians in the united states have not tasted the bitterness of losing sons they also did not see the remains of children in palestine and elsewhere under what right to they deprive our kinfolk in pale stine of security thereby letting them be hunted by helicopters in their homes and among their women and children the bodies of dead and wounded are hauled up every day yet the stupid ones bemoan the dead in america and not the dead among our sons do they not fear punishment by the same method our prophet may the peace and blessings of god be upon said whoever does not invade or begets an invader in his family god would hit him with disaster before doomsday so let them fear and repent to god and lift this embargo on our innocent children westerners are free if europe chooses to join the war this is its affair but as far we are concerned we will fight whoever stands in the trench of the jews the united states and its people are free to join the jewish trench but they should be ready to receive what comes their way as for us we are in worship and jihad our prophet may the peace and blessings of god be upon him said prayer for one hour within the ranks is better than worship for 60 years what great honor it is to be on the side of god almighty fighting for the sake of religion we pray to god to accept our deeds and your deeds regarding muslims i tell them that they should place their trust in gods victory they should also respond to the order of the almighty god and his prophet may the peace and this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 247 for official use only blessings of god be

on killing the americans proceed with gods blessing and remember your rendezvous with god almighty in the company of the best of the prophets may the peace and blessings of god be upon him finally i address this appeal to my brothers in pakistan unfortunately the position taken by the pakistani government has made it pillar in this ominous alliance this crusader alliance action by our brethren in pa kistan would god willing lead to strong blow to this ominous crusader alliance supporting the united states whether with medical or any other facilities means disbelief and departure from the creed the brethren in pakistan must take serious action in support of gods religion and prophet may the peace and blessings of god be upon him today islam is calling them come to islam come to islam come to

enemy that in combat they mainly depend on psychological warfare this is in light of the huge media machine they have they also depend on massive air strikes so as to conceal their most prominent point of weakness which is the fear cowardliness and the absence of combat spirit among us soldiers those soldiers are completely convinced of the injustice and lying of their government they also lack fair cause to defend they only fight for capitalists usury takers and the merchants of arms and oil including the gang of crime at the white house this is in addition to crusader and personal grudges by bush the father we also realized that one of the most effective and available methods of rendering the air force of the crusader enemy ineffective is by setting up roofed and disguised trenches in large numbers i had referred to that in previous statement during the tora bora battle last year in that great battle faith triumphed over all the materialistic forces of the people of evil for principles were adhere d to thanks to god almighty i will narrate to you part of that great ba ttle to show how coward they are on the one hand and how effective trenches are in exhausting them on the other we were about 300 mujahids we dug 100 trenches that were spread in an area that does not exceed one square mile one trench for every three brothers so as to avoid the huge human losses resulting from the bombardment since the first hour of the us campaign on 20 rajab 1422 corresponding to 7 october 2001 our centers were exposed to concentrated bombardment and this bombardment continued until midramadan on 17 ramadan very fierce bombardment began particularly after the us command was certain that some of alqaida leaders were still in tora bora including the humble servant to god referring to himself nd the brother mujahid dr ayman alzawahiri the bombardment was roundtheclock and the warplanes continued to fly over us day and night the us pentagon together with its allies worked full time on blowing up and destroying this small spot as well as on removing it entirely planes poured their lava on us particularly after accomplishing their main missions in afghanistan the us forces attacked us with smart bombs bombs that weigh thousands of pounds cluster bombs and bunker busters bombers like the b52 used to fly over head for more than two hours and drop between 2030 bombs at time the modified c130 aircraft kept carpetbombing us at night using modern types of bombs the us forces dared not break into our positions despite the unprecedented massive bombing and terrible propaganda targeting this co mpletely besieged small area this is in addition to the forces of hypocrites whom they prodded to fight us for 15 days nonstop every time the latter attacked us we forced them out of our area carrying their dead and wounded is there any clearer evidence of their cowa rdice fear and lies regarding their legends about their alleged power to sum it

10 degrees celsius below the zero the battle resulted in the injury of 6 percent of personnel we hope god will accept them as martyrs and the damage of two percent of the trenches praise be to god if all the world forces of evil could not achieve their goals on one square mile of area against small number of mujahidin with very limited capabilities how can these evil forces triumph over the muslim world this is impossible god willing if people adhere to their religion and insist on jihad for its sake mujahidin brothers in iraq do not be afraid of what the united states is propagating in terms of their lies about their power and their smart laserguided missiles the smart bombs will have effect worth mentioning in th hills and in the trenches on plains and in forests they must have apparent targets the wellcamouflaged trenches and targets will not be reached by either the smart or the stupid missiles there will only be haphazard strikes that dissipate the enemy ammunition and waste its money dig many trenches the early muslim caliph umar may god be pleased with him stated take the ground as shield because this will ensure the exha ustion of all the stored enemy missiles within months their daily production is too little and can be dealt with god willing we also recommend luring the enemy forces into protracted close and exhausting fight using the camouflaged defensive positions in plains farms mountains and cities the enemy fears city and street wars most war in which the enemy expects grave human losses we stress the impor tance of the mar tyrdom operations against the enemy operations that inflicted harm on the united states and israel that has been unprecedented in their history thanks to almighty god we also point out that whoever supported the united states including the hypocrites of iraq or the rulers of arab countries those who approved their actions and followed them in this crusade war by fighting with them or providing bases and administrative support or any form of support even by words to kill the muslims in iraq should know that they are apostates and outside the community of muslims it is permissible to spill their blood and take their property god says ye who believe take not the jews and the christians for your friends and protectors they are but friends and protectors to each other and he amongst you that turns to them for friendship is of them verily allah guideth not people unjust koranic verse we also stress to honest muslims that they should move incite and mobilize the islamic nation amid such grave events

jordan morocco nigeria pakistan the land of the two holy mosques saudi arabia and yemen needless to say this crusade war is primarily targeted against the people of islam regardless of the removal or the survival of the socialist party or saddam muslims in general and the iraqis in particular must brace themselves for jihad against this unjust campaign and acquire ammunition and weapons this is prescribed duty god says and let them pray with thee taking all precautions and bearing arms the unbelievers wish if ye were negligent of your arms and your baggage to assault you in single rush koranic verse fighting in support of the nonislamic banners is forbidden muslims doctrine and banner should be clear in fighting for the sake of god he who fights to raise the word of god will fight for gods sake under these circumstances there will be harm if the interests of muslims converge with the interests of the socialists in the fight against the cr usaders despite our belief in the infidelity of socialists the jurisdiction of the socialists and those rulers has fallen long time ago socialists are infidels wherever they are whether they are in baghdad or aden the fighting which is waging and which will be waged these days is very much like the fighting of muslims against the byzantine in the past and the convergence of interests is not detrimental the muslims fighting against the byzantine converged with the interests of the persians and this was not detrimental to the companions of the prophet before concluding we reiterate the importance of high morale and caution against false rumors defeatism uncertainty and discouragement the prophet said bring good omens and do not discourage people he also said the voice of abutalhah one of the prophets companions in the army is better than 100 men during the alyarmuk battle man told khalid binalwalid an islamic commander the byzantine soldiers are too many and the muslims are few so khalid told him shame on you armies do not triumph with large numbers but are defeated if the spirit of defeatism prevails keep this saying before your eyes it is not fitting for prophet that he should have prisoners of war

result of this awakening that the alaqsa intifadah and rose and used the language of stones from the hands of the courageous mujahidin men women and children and when the jews tried to run away they could find place to hide they became exposed even behind the walls thus facing exploding bodies that give them taste of death and terrorize them and shake the earth under their feet and make them full

initiative is just another trick from abura ghals bag of tricks another zionistamerican conspiracy painted with the saudi government colors it is nothing more than another example of continjuou8s treason something the rulers of the region are historically known for when dealing with our causes in general and the palestinian cause in particular he is only doing what his father did before him in 1936 when he gave the palestinians empty promises fro m him and from the english government thus tricking the palestinians who stopped their uprising while the occupation continued until 1948 when their land was handed ove r to the jews abdallah is only following the same path as those traitorous rulers like him that headed the seventh column under the command of the english to put an end to the serious pu8blic movement to liberate palestine they then continued their conspiracy by signing truce in 1949 but their greatest treason came in 1992 when they signed the oslo agreement which came to put an end to the first intifadah it is not surprising that the prince is now committing another treason against the first of the two qiblas directions of prayer nd the third shrine of islam and has decided to bury alive the cause of whole nat ion because of his personal desires he did so before when he allowed the americans on the holy sites under false pretext he and his brothers told the nation they lied when they claimed they needed assistance from the americans for three months and here we are going to our thirteenth year of allowing the infidels on the holy land this initiative is clearly an attempt to firmly implant the land extorting jewish state while the american forces are establishing military bases on the holy land to threaten the region and atta ck iraq and its muslim people the statements made by the saudi regime saying that they will not permit the use of saudi territory to strike iraq are empty lies because if they could indeed do anything they would have kicked the occupying american forces out from the holy land our muslim nation the fate of despots and traitors is very clear to all and what they have deservingly received is only proof of the faith and pride the sons of this nation have take look at king abdallah binalsharif husayn who was killed by pa lestinian hero and anwar sadat who was called tr aitor then shot by one of the heroes of egypt called khalid islambuli here are all the traitors and agents big and small receiving the same fate that every traitor deserves our muslim nation this type of initiative seen in the media of the pharonic despotic regime is nothing more than dirty conspiracy it means the right to rule in return for treason in the political dictionary and it means heresy in the dictionary of islamic law being on the side of the infidels against muslims is one of the ten acts that nullify faith and turn the muslim into an infidel the muslim must utter ly decry this act and disown those committing it whoever

offices in peshawar this is for the first time that bin ladin s message was delivere d in audiocassettes all his previous messages and announcements were either recorded in videotapes or typed we received the cassette in routine packets that people usually leave with the reception at our office wahid shah reporter of peshawarbased daily wahdat told ians indo asian news service over phone he said the message was in arabic and the recording was of very bad quality it is difficult to say if this is bin ladins voice but an announcement prior to the message says this is mujahid usama bin

arrived at the london headquarters of the algerian khalifa news television channel two days before the riyadh attacks which resulted in 34 dead on monday 13 may and its message was awful i shall soon strike the traitrous regime of king fahd who has submitted to the american aggressor against iraq as well as king abdallah of jordan who is guilty of complicity in this unjust war and all the arab powers that have engaged in guilty silence and will soon pay the price for their betrayal it was an awful and fateful prediction 48 hours later bin ladin would keep his macabre promises in saudi arabi there he went and struck again in morocco whose monarchy indeed matches the criteria of the arab governments which have engaged in guilty silence in addition to the fact that it is one of the rare

attacks was in fact jewish shop shows that quite well so if one is to believe the cassette the contents of which matin was able to obtain the carnage yesterday in casablanca has every chance of having been perpetrated by alqaida and so seems quite directly tied to the war in iraq to which it seems to be bloody response it alas risks being followed by others in certain arab capitals if one be lieves in the content of the cassette that was received by khalifa news and which the channel for ethical reasons as well as motives peculiar to it refused to broadcast the channel only slightly appreciates this poisoned gift which in other times would have delighted reporters why khalifa news the choice of the algerian channel according to journalists was reportedly made by alqaida itself the organization henceforth preferring it over aljazirah about whose reliability it is reportedly not certain and with whose treatment of current news it is reportedly unhappy the cassette according to the channels reporters seems quite authentic it should seem so more today since the head of the terrorist organization has taken action bin ladin who appears on it with the same pale face stated in weakened voice that the punishments will rain down on the arab regimes that are the henchmen of the united states and which refrained from reacting during the war long portion of the film as an introduction is devoted to the traditional speech on the virtues of the islamic path that alqaida always says it is determined to see respected in the world until total triumph so if one goes on the remarks in this recording it is to be feared that the terrorist organizations plan will not stop in saudi arabia and morocco bin ladin seems to be kicking off series of attacks in response to the war in iraq before the killing in riyadh bin ladin had struck in bali indonesia last october 100 or more victims in final response to the war in afghanistan today he is trying to repair the iraqi injustice and seems to have planned and pre pared lethal attacks in any event the hypothesis which has been strengthened by the ssage of the cassette received by khalifa news is being taken very

country to make the prominent saudi figures that are known for their hostility to the jihadists targeted in all cases observers believe that shaykh usama and alqaidas military and political leaders

occupy and divide the region had been preplanned six months ahead of the two conquests the new york and washington attacks the confusion caused to the enemy was sufficient to make people wake up from their slumber and rise for jihad for the sake of god i had the honor of knowing these men one is honored by knowing such men god has honored them and enabled them to champion the cause of islam i do not see them except as seeds that god planted in his faith and used in his obedience may god bless them these are my forefathers get men like them if we are to meet again jarir line of poetry he who wants to learn faithfulness honesty generosity and courage to support religion from contemporary persons then he must draw lessons from said alghamidi muhammad ata khalid almihdar ziyad aljarrahi marwan alshihhi and their brothers may god have mercy on them these persons learned from the traditions of our prophet muhammad may gods peace mercy and blessings be upon him who is the most honest courageous and generous man he may gods peace mercy and blessings be upon him said you will never find to be stingy coward or liar these traits are necessary for upholding the faith whoever is denied these traits cannot champion or uphold the faith here i say to those who do not enjoy some of these characteristics and who failed to carry out jihad he who is not convinced of killing should go away and not influence those who are convinced of killing i say to them he who fears climbing mountains will always live among holes verses of poetry this faithful youth and his brothers are young man is judged by the tiniest parts of his body that is his heart and tongue saying by prophet muhammad however they are men with big brains and great resolve they repeatedly protected their sanity and minds from being trampled under foot or exposed to danger by the deception of the agent governments and their institutions which paint vice as virtue and vice versa falsehood as right and enemies as friends this is because these young men are true believers and believers are not bitten twice from the same hole as our prophet may gods peace and blessings be upon him says those youths knew that the road to eternal damnation is the obstruction of the shariah islamic law and even some of its rulings they refuse to bootlick even princes and ulema over this they believe that the integrity of the shariah enjoys precedence over the safety of men regardless of how great they are in gods faith people are treated as equals they are guided by the saying of the prophet may gods peace and blessings be upon him which says by god if fatimah bintmuhammad were to steal i would chop off her hand for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without

aspects of our life because the facts on the ground are otherwise as matter of fact the rulers whims and their legislation prevail over peoples actions even though they permit people to perform some rituals these young men knew that the rulers were in the wrong as matter of fact they are apostates even if they perform prayers fast and claim to be muslims these young men refused to stay be hind and engage in unimportant things they set out on jihad and hastened to uphold the cause of god and the call for monotheism there is god but god muhammad is the prophet of god they engaged in jihad against the infide ls their condition is like that of muaz binaljamuh when he asked abdalrahman binawf may they both achieve gods satisfaction the following question uncle do you know abujahl amr binhisham archenemy of prophet muhammad and islam in the early years of islam binawf said yes what for my nephew binaljamuh said i have been told that he called the messenger of god names by god if i see him i will engage him in fight until the one who is predestined to die before the other is killed this is honesty and this is faith each and every matter has its own reality the reality of this hero said alghamidi and his brothers is that they showed the truthfulness of their faith by offe ring themselves and their souls for the sake of god thus they gained status that greatly angered the infidels and will continue to anger them for long time god willing this happened when they opted for practical applications and drastic solutions to champion the cause of the faith and shunned the unjust atheistic solutions the solutions offered by the united nations the atheistic pa rliaments and the tyrannical ru lers who turned themselves into gods who legislate and shun gods rulings moreover they did not pay atte ntion to the futile solutions the solutions of the prevaricators the arabs of the desert who failed to join the mujahidin who were preoccupied with their money and kindred and who were deceived by themselves to the effect that they have been busy preparing for jihad for dozens of years there is difference between he who views the fields of preparation and the arenas of jihad as hardship separation of fathers and sons and risking ones life and money thus satan will prevent him from continuing on the road to jihad and force him not to go to jihad along with those who failed to join the muja hidin and he who views the arenas of jihad as being the market of paradise whose doors are open thus he fears that they will be closed to him if he is late for an hour or that god is not pleased with him and so he will make him lag behind god says and if they had intended to march out certainly they would have made some preparation for it but allah was averse to the ir being sent forth so he made them lag behind and it was said to them sit you among those who sit at home koranic verse if he does not respond to gods order and fails to go to jihad by obeying the arabs of the desert who failed to join the mujahidin god will come in betwee n him and his heart and thus he will stray from the right path and be of the sinful ones this report may contain

serious repercussions and negative effects on islam and muslims young people of islam everywhere especially in the neighboring countries and in yemen you should pursue jihad and roll up your sleeves follow the right path and be careful not to support the men who follow their whims those who sat idle or those who relied on oppressors for those would seek to shake you and inhibit you from pursuing this blessed jihad there have been voices in iraq as there were in palestine egypt jordan yemen and other countries before calling for peaceful democratic solution in dealing with the apostate

the preislam era he who obeys the leaders or scholars in permitting what god banne d such as joining the legislative councils or banning what he permitted such as jihad for his sake would be associating other gods with him god is our sole source of strength i call on muslims in general and on the iraqi people in particular to not support the crusader us forces and their allies those who cooperate with the united states or its offshoots regardless of names and titles are infidels and so are those who support infidel parties such as the arab socialist bat h party and the democratic

rest of the gulf states to set the stage for controlling and dominating the whole world for the big powers believe that the gulf and the gulf states are the key to controlling the world due to the presence of the largest oil reserves there muslims the situation is serious and the misfortune is momentous by god i am keen on safeguarding your religion and your worldly life so lend your ears and open up your hearts to so that we may examine these pitchblack misfortunes and so that we may consider how we can find way out of these adversities and calamities the wests occupation of our countries is old yet new the struggle between us and them the confrontation and clashing began centuries ago and will continue because the ground rules regarding the fight between right and falsehood will remain valid until judgment day take note of this ground rule regarding this fight there can be dialogue with occupiers except through arms this is what we need today and what we should seek islamic countries in the past century were not liberated from the crusaders military occupation except through jihad in the cause of god under the pretext of fighting terrorism the west today is doing its utmost to tarnish jihad and kill anyone seeking jihad the west is supported in this endeavor by hypocrites this is because they all know that jihad is the effective power to foil all their conspiracies jihad is the path so seek it this is because if we seek to deter them with any means other than islam we would be like the one who goes round in circles we would also be like our forefathers the alghasasinah people who lived in state historically located in the northwest of the persian empire the concern of their seniors was to be appointed officers for the romans and to be named kings in orde r to safeguard the interests of the romans by killing their brothers of the peninsulas arabs suc h is the case of the new alghasasinah namely arab rulers muslims if you do not punish them for their sins in jerusalem and iraq they shall defeat you because of your failure they will also rob you of land of alharamayn mecca and medina today they robbed you of baghdad and tomorrow they will rob you of riyadh and so forth unless god deems otherwise sufficient unto us is god what then is the means to stop this tremendous onslaught in such hard times some reformers maintain that all popular and official forces should unite and that all government forces should unite with all their peoples everyone would do what is needed from him in order to ward off this crusaderzionist onslaught the question strongly raised is are the governments in the islamic world capable of pursuing this duty of defending the faith and nation and renounce allegiance to the united states for official use only this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 274 the calls by some reformers are strange they say that the path to righteousness and to defend the country and people passes though the doors of those rulers i tell those reformers if you have an excuse for not pursing jihad it does not give you the right to depend on the unjust ones thus becoming responsible for your sins as well as the sins of those you misguide fear god for your sake and for your nations sake god does not need your flattery of dictators for the sake of gods religion end recording in his audio message bin ladin strongly criticizes the arabian gulf rulers casting doubt on their ability to resist any possible us attack against their states to prove his point bin ladin gave an historical example such as these rulers stand on what happened between iraq and kuwait in 1990 and 1991 and their hesitation in supporting the united states in its latest war against iraq which he attributed to their fears of the principle of changing regimes by force bin ladin also spoke about the arrest of saddam husayn showing that the audio message was recorded recently bin ladin also criticized the arab regimes pursuing of their own people and accusing them of embracing the creed of alkhawarij rebellious islamic group in early islam begin bin ladin recording the gulf states proved their total inability to resist the iraqi forces they sought help from the crusaders led by the united states as is well known how can these states stand up to the united states in short these states came to americas hel p and backed it in its attack against an arab state which is bound to them with covenants of joint defense agreements these covenants were reiterated at the arab league just few days before the us attack only to violate them in full this shows their positions on the nations basic causes these regimes wavered too much before taking stand on using force and attacking iraq at times they absolutely rejected partic ipation and at other times they linked this with agreement then they went back to their first option in fact the lack of participation was in line with the domestic sire of these states howe ver they finally submitted and succumbed to us pressure and opened their air land and sea bases to contribute toward the us campaign despite the immense repercussi ons of this move most important of these repercussions is that this is against one of the islamic tenets most important and dangerous in their view was that they feared that the door would be open for bringing down dictatorial regimes by armed forces from abroad especially after they had seen the arrest of their former comrade in treason and agentry to the united states when it ordered him to ignite the first gulf war against iran which rebelled against it the war consumed everything and plunged the area in maze from which they have not emerged to this day they are aware that their turn will come they do not have the will to make the difficult decision to confront the aggression in addition to their belief that this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is prohibited without permission of the copyright owners 275 for official use only they do not possess the material resources for that indeed they were prevented from establishing large military force when they were forced to sign secret pledges and documents long ago in short the ruler who believes in some of the abovementioned deeds cannot defend the country how can he do so if he believes in all of them and has done that time and again those who believe in the principle of supporting the infidels over muslims and leave the blood honor and property of their brothers to be free for their enemy in order to remain safe claiming that they love their brothers but are being forced to take such path of course this compulsion cannot be regarded as legitimate are in fact qualified to take the same cour against one another in the gulf states indeed this principle is liable to be embraced within the same state itself those who read and understood the history of kings throughout history know that they are capable of committing more than these concessions except those who enjoyed the mercy of god indeed the rulers have practically started to sell out the sons of the land by pursuing and imprisoning them and by unjustly and wrongly accusing them of becoming like the alkhawarij sect who he ld muslims to be infidels and by committing the excesses of killing them we hold the m to be martyrs and god will judge them all of this happened before the riyadh explosions in rabi alawwal of this year around may 2003 this campaign came within drive to implement the us orders in the hope that they will win its blessings end recording bin ladins message said that the muslim rulers are not capable of confronting what he described as the us aggression referring to the history of dealing with the palestinian issue and explaining how the concessions made by the rulers since the beginning of the conflict show that they are willing to make concessions in the future bin ladin criticized the arab rulers fighting of the palestinia n resistance as represented by the sharm shaykh summit in 1996 the arab initiative in the beirut summit and the road map bin ladin also criticized the countries that stopped the financial assistance that was sent to the families of the palestinian martyrs he also criticized the gulf governments reception of members of the transitional iraqi governing council in iraq in his message bin ladin drew comparison between the economic development of one country that was an islamic country in the past namely spain and the arab countries whose collective economic capabilities are less than those of the spanish economy bin ladin also said in his message that the reason for the deterioration of the arabs and muslims is due to ignoring islam as way for governing he called on muslims to establish council for ahl alhall wa alaqd literally those who loose and bind reference to honest wise and righteous people who can appoint or remove ruler in islamic tradition to fill the vacuum that will result from the legitimate collapse of the governing regimes as he asserted he said that the task of this council is to unify the word and raise the flag of jihad to stop what he termed as the roman raid against the muslims which started in iraq for official use only

danger which the region in general and the arabian peninsula in particular is being exposed to has appeared it has become clear that the rulers are not qualified to apply the religion and defend the muslims in fact they have provided evidence that they are implementing the schemes of the enemies of the nation and religion and that they are qualified to abandon the countries and peoples now after we have known the situation of the rulers we should examine the policy they have been pursuing anyone who examines the policy of those rulers will easily see that they follow their whims and desires and their personal interests and crusade loyalties therefore the flaw does not involve secondary issue such as personal corruption that is confined to the palace of the ruler the flaw is in the very approach this happened when malicious belief and destructive principle spread in most walks of life to the effect that absolute supremacy and obedience are due to the ruler and not to the religion of god in other countries they have used the guise of parliaments and democracy thus the situation of all arab countries suffers from great deterioration in all walks of life in religious and worldly matters we have reached this miserable situation because many of us lack the correct and comprehensive understanding of the religion of islam many of us understand islam to mean performing some acts of worship such as prayer and fasting despite the great importance of these ritual s the religion of islam encompasses all the affairs of life including the religious and the worldly such as economic military and political affairs as well as the scales by which we weigh the actions of menrulers ulema and othersand how to deal with the ruler in line with the rules set by god for him and which the ruler should not violate therefore it becomes clear to us that the solution lies in adhering to the religion of god by which god granted us pride in the past centuries and installing strong and faithful leadership that applies the koran among us and raises the true banner of jihad the honest people who are concerned about this situation such as the ulema leaders who are obeyed among their people dignitaries notables and merchants should get together and meet in safe place away from the shadow of these suppressive regimes and form council for ahl alhall wa alaqd literally those who loose and bind reference to honest wise and righteous people who can appoint or remove ruler in islamic tradition to fill the vacuum caused by the religious invalidation of these regimes and their mental deficiency the right to appoint an imam leader is for the nation the nation also has the right to make him correct his course if he deviates from it and to remove him if he does something that warrants this such as apostasy and treason this temporary council should be made up of the minimum number of available personnel without word indistinct the rest of the nation except what the religion allows in case of necessity until the number is increased when the situation improves god willing their policy should be based on the book of god the koran and the sunna of his prophet muhammad gods peace and blessings be upon him they should start by directing the muslims to the important priorities at this critical stage and lead them to safe haven provided that their top priority should be uniting opinions under the word of monotheism and defending islam and its people and countries and declaring general this report may contain copyrighted material copying and dissemination is
