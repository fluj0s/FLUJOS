levels the reason for them lecture given on 20 october 1964 whats the day today audience october 20th twentieth twentieth of october ad 14 saint hill special briefing course were as you know just as an announcement here were dividing the course into central org and field personnel several reasons for thisis one the course is very large at this particular time and its one way to divide it and central org personnel are always used to working very very hard so we thought they could stand about three or four more hours of study day and it wasnt matter of punishment its just matter of expediency we have to get them in here and straightened up and taught and out of here central org personnel are bit different to this degree is in organizations they do keep right up with their technology and they dont drop far behind so to put them through the same set of checksheets is actually bit abusive and as result why central org personnel have been divided off and if you see somebody around looking very very haggard and looking very driven and face is always missing at party or something like this well you know thats central org personnel that doesnt mean the program is softened up for the field auditor now we have other curves on the line for the field auditor the way the course is being rigged at the present moment is that somebody comes in here and we check him out with great rapidity up the line to where he has reached on the levels and where he is expert on the levels and then we give him that set of checksheets to proceed therefrom you see in other words we hand him set of checksheets proceeding from the point to which he has progressed in his actual auditing application not his certificate and take him on from there so of course he is on relatively speaking different set of checksheets than central org personnel would be on even though well still do this with central org personnel the program is quite different with central org personnel he comes in here and the first thing well do with him is look him over and find out why hes dragging that way and find out why he misfiled that despatch and lets get those withholds off you know and lets get him straightened out lets get any bug in the case that somebody hadnt been able to crack straightened out lets straighten out any subject similar to scientology that he ever got wrapped up with dont you see this is right off the batbang you see then get his definitions real straight and get him on to clearing with dead crash and just with ai think its 7Â½ hour auditing daybring him right straight on up to clearbang dont you see and then hand him set of checksheets on r6 and kick him out of here in other words yeah let him go through his checksheets get him provisional classification he has to take his examination before he ever gets that but thats the idea dont you see and we wont be bothering too much why well theres good reason for that when he gets home hell still be getting checked out on bulletins hell still be getting technology hell still be getting this hell still be getting that dont you see and actually central orgs so miss their personnel that they send here that they have very very hard time and theyve had an awful hard time in the last year and half and one of the reasonsone of the main reasons for that has been its their key personnel very often is missing and we mustnt keep doing that so itsbe shorter course for them and much rougher course and the field auditor why the course goes on more or less the way its been going on straight on down the line making different slightly different basis they come up to the point where they have achieved their level give them the checksheets from that point make sure that they go through there and then put them through the auditing steps up from that point mostly its training basis dont you see and get them well trained up in that particular direction and when their cases are in good shape and that sort of thing throw them over into r6 so case is going to become requisite for provisional vi classification and theres very excellent technical reason for that you cannot take somebody who has been headon into r6 i mean actually running r6real r6 now im not talking now about running some items or what we were calling gpms year or two ago or you know 212 or stuff like thatno im talking about real honesttogoodness r6 you cant take somebody who is at that state of training and processing and return him into clearing you start clearing up definitions on person at that particular stage of the game and youre going to be in trouble youre going to be in trouble why the boy is right that instant sitting in an item to glopher gofs you see and this item to glopher gofs is all youre going to get and you can take lot of locks off to glopher gofs but if you unfortunately reach too far and got him into the next gpm with your definitions and all that sort of thingi dont mean just checking out definitions or words in general i mean for blood auditing you see and if you were auditing him on this and you got him into clay table clearing and he unfortunately picked up term that was in the bank series or three serieses or ten serieses on down the line or even six items down the line hes going to get cracking big somatic and that somatic is just going to get worse and worse and worse well why because you havent got the item necessary to resolve the case which is of course the whole item so he cant say well i want to improve my golf what of youhavent you understood about golf and he says well the effortuhthe effort necessary to hit the ball you say all right put effort together in clay its an end word its way down the line he isnt there dont you see hes up here well you wont run into this difficulty with somebody at the lower levels because all the words and all the gpms are there they havent got straightened or selected out do you see they arent selected out hes not running on down the track its just globular glutinous bunch of glue and any place that you pick anything off of it youre lucky dont you see but when youve got this straightened out and you get somebody going on down the line pocketapocketapocketa in real r6 auditing then you start clearing them well youre just going to find the item in which the person is now sitting that was the next item to come up and its just going to get goofier and goofier dont you see and its going to be very poorvery poor show now this means then that there are technical reasons why cases progress up the levels and should progress up the levels and theyre very solid sound technical reasons for these things thats what this lecture is about levels are not particularly popular because peoples got it mixed up with class consciousness and everybody wants to be equal well ill tell you ill tell you whatwhat equality to achieve lets say yes lets all be equal but the equality to achieve is ot you have to work long time to be equal thats what it comes down to so the reason for levelsthe reason for levels originally was to stretch out auditors into what they were capable of getting results with see the first attention was on auditors it quickly passed from there over into the realization that we were looking at why pcs didnt make good progress because they hadnt come up through an orderly progress on the line we tried to enforce this on pcs and it didnt go down very well they wanted to be run on r6 when they had to be run on level 0 and all that sort of thing and they didnt like this particularly so we took the classification off the pc and told the auditor to retain the classification on the pc see we didnt force the classification down the pcs throat but we say if you havent got class soandso you mustnt run processes above that class on the pc well thats good sense well it goes further than that also if youve got good sense you wont run process which is above the level where you find the pc now im not trying to give you at this moment an accurate progress that i dont have the bulletin in front of in which it was laid outand it is to some slight degree in state of flux at this moment im just trying to appeal to your reason along this particular line lets take an ordinary bit of raw meat thats drifting up and down the street out hereraw meat derivation of word the guy thinks hes brain you see so he doesnt know hes thetan he isnt up there and he thinks hes deteriorated into bit of matter he thinks hes body and so forth hence this derogatoryjocular term ratherraw meat and of course he hasnt been done up any particular way or another so it has side joke that goes along with it you know but it also carries the fact that man is sinking down intoand this is new thought on the lineinto just food animal hes long thought of himself as spiritual being andwith great pride and dignity and that sort of thing and theres bunch of revolutionary mutts all of sudden jumped up on the track in the late part of the 19th century and said we have made new discovery youre meat you know youre nothing but brain the way you perceive isthe way you perceive is theres bunch of cells that click against bunch of cells and this shows against some kind of screen and this analyzes the new thought and then this gives you reaction and then the man thinks he thinks dont you see and then he somehow or another acts in some stimulusresponse fashion and theyve made man into stimulusresponse animal and theyre trying to handle him that way governmentally and theyre trying to handle him that way with advertising and theyre going to have an awful lot of failures because theres big lie on the line he is not stimulus response animal there is always matter to what tiny degree theres power of choice and this is the one thing that overwhelms the planners is the fellow who doesnt like soup you know and that plate of soup will stay on that endless belt because he didnt take it off you know and it goes in and busts up all the machinery in the whole empire eventually by concatenation now if they could just solve this bird who didnt like soup then theyve got it made from there on dont you see because everybody would pick up their soup off of this endless belt and there wouldnt be any dissonance here of any kind whatsoever and all would be harmony but what kind of harmonyfor whom for what the end product of this would be bunch of machines running to maintain bunch of machines which i think is terribly interesting game if you look at ita bunch of machines running around and i remember old johnny campbell one time or another he used to hold forth at this at great length and so forth and the reason he parted company with us on the subject of this mind and the spirit and so forth is because of his dedication to the machine he wrote one ofa marvelous story by the way he could really string these things outand it was civilization you see where man had been dispensed with and itd become an ideal civilization in there were just machines left there which were repairing machines and that was the ideal civilization only he didnt put it out as satire he meant it now the end product of this sort of thing is the super stimulus response so when an individual shows this item called power of choice they conceive it to be an irregularity they think that this individual is now going to conduct himself irregularly well this is against the hidden standard that the plans hes given were right you see if all the plans for the universe were absolutely infallible why then there would be some reason not to have any power of choice over anything if all the plans laid down by social statesif all of theof the great designs of utopia were all of them utterly flawless and would lead to nothing but paradise on earth why then of course quite obviously power of choice would be quite destructive so those who pretend that the ideal has been achieved and laid down and must be followedthose who pretend that and carefully delete from it the totality of power of choice are going to get in mess and the way theyre going to get in mess is simply that they have told big lie as the ideal has not been laid down on the political front that there are this many ideologies at war with this many ideologies would tell you that there was something in error here none of these are winning above another one really capitalisms still hanging around i think the congo now is sliding back toward capitalism i noticed that russiaand i had very funny very funny cognition this morningi shall have to tell you what it isi realized what this khrushchev overthrow is i just suddenly realized the whole significance russia tried to have an election thats it she looked at the united states having an election and she looked at england having an election dont you see and she went into an obsessive duplication the only thing thats been holding her up at all is the personality of khrushchev now what happens we dont know dont you see but they did thats what they tried to do i think its very amusing so anyhowanyhow the ideal state has never been laid down and get thisnever will be absolutes are unobtainable and that absolute perfection is unobtainable you can get awfully closeyou can get close but you cant arrive and never will be able to arrive at total perfection and the reason for that is this same thing the reason why we cant attain this absolute is just this same item it is that youre not dealingyoure not dealing now with total carbon copy being to being to being to being you see so who would be to judge when the absolute had been attained you see oh we always had some tiny disagreement on that if we were trying to applywe were trying to apply absolute to the arts all right what is the perfect piano piece you see pft ah who is the perfect performer now we could go long way toward analyzing what perfect piano piece might be and what perfect performer might be but then this would get modified at once by the consideration of who was hearing it or seeing it and once more we would have dissonance on the basis of whether or not perfection had been attained and therefore the absolute is not achievable dont you see and its this one thing that man is capable of his own judgment thatnow that sounds very odd to you but man is capable of his own judgmentthat keeps the absolute from being attained now thats very peculiar very peculiar fact so therefore it could be read as very evil thing but who wants to attain an absolute thats game at all see thats the other question you have to ask so this individualthis individual never all the way down the line totally loses his individuality it doesnt matter how manyhow many lead boots you subject him to how many rats you have in the warm brass jar running around on his stomach trying to get out it doesnt matter how much economic duress you put him under this random factor of somebody all of sudden stands up and bears his chest to the bullets there go ahead and torture go ahead and shoot yeah all right the hell with you see and they say well now joe thats not reasonable attitude do you realize you can be tortured for eight thousand seven hundred and sixty four days and you can be incarcerated and imprisoned all your wives and children can be executed out of hand and the whole society will be destroyed and you lay up all these consequences and so forth and he says my answer to that bud is shoot go ahead torture go ahead put in jail but i wont say yes and the hell of it is is everybody admires him because they recognize this as the last resort of the thetan which is integrityintegrity to himself even the russian in propagandizing his own revolution could only make motion pictures of great heroes of the people and it is so interesting to watch some of these things you might not even be able to understand the russian but what is going on in this thing is quite terrificis dimitri novgorod leaps forward and says you are oppressing the people see and they say dimitri were going to fix your clock bud but goodbut good were gonna fix your clock and he says to hell with you and the plot then proceeds im sorry to give you such short synopsis of it but i mean its rather obvious and one of these at the final end shows novgorod who is about to be executed by having hook hooked in underneath his breast bonesi mean typical russian tasteand hoisted high in the air and so forth he brushes the guards off and does ballet leap into the air and collapses down on the hook the total theme is you could not and will never succeed in breaking down my individual integrity and even in the midst of the russian revolutionmaking motion pictures which were supposed to superpropagandize how you should all bow down to the communist stateall they could doall they could do you see was deify individualism and integrity they deified the revolutionary because they wanted these people of course to revolt against the other state and ever since theyve had this problem of counterrevolution now the individual can only be pushed so far you want to watch one of these situations where well the ships company is given terrific beating by their commanding officer theyre just chopped around madly and according to the bligh school of thought dont you see this is the perfect way to handle the crew well i knew such ship commander at one timehis name richmond kelly turner because i wouldnt want to be exposed for libel on the thing and he was in command of the uss astoria cruiser and he did this kind of thing and it was all pretty doggone confounded grim and it was strictly bligh sort of government of the ship dont you see well now youd say under normal circumstances isnt this perfectthis best of all form of worlds and this best of all form ofof management all right naturally you would have had perfect running ship oh quite the contrary there wasnt anything on the astoria worked nothing worked nothing you turn on water tap and water came out you know all right well then the ship fitter that was responsible for that would be put up on the carpet you see and why had his people been so remiss as not to fix up that pipeline crashcrashdont you seethudthud oh hes going to get general court or something like that if it isnt fixed up there at once and so on yeah well they go down and they take apart the pipes that had to do with this one pipe see they take apart those pipes very carefully and they see that theres seven of them that need replacing but they only have orders to replace one so they carefully take apart the whole bulkhead where these pipes run you see they take off these huge sheets of armor plates you see at enormous expense and labor they take off all this equipment they disconnect all the electrical connections that go in there this is fabulous operation you see modern manowar is built likeits built like lot of watches enlarged into much greater complication you know and you probably could touch them anyplace and they become vulnerable because the complexities and then they will fix that one pipe but there are seven pipes in there that needed fixing but they havent got order to fix the six so they fix the one now having fixed that one pipe they then put together all the electrical wiring at great expense they put back on all the armor plate at great expense you see they put everything back together againyou cant get at those six pipes now and now they turn on the water faucet and it runs and the ship fitter says well sir the water faucet now runs very good very good the next day in the next cabin the water faucet there doesnt run its called white mutiny it is the technical naval term for that do exactly what youre told and dont do anything else and all the way from the top to the bottom thetan will do this he never gives upnever never really gives up matter what state you eventually find him in at the bottom of the barrel he really has not given up and he could look like hes given up he could be down on skid row filled full of booze and that sort of thing and what do you suppose this is thats way of getting even too isnt it being good being burden to the society liability setting rotten example to everybody and so forth he hadnt given up not at all so whatwhat accounts for production and that sort of thing well the russian state right now in its overthrow only had one real liability in it in that its people didnt have anything they had to buy enormous quantities of wheat just to feed people something and they had lot of difficulty in keeping their economy going and one of the reasons why they had trouble in keeping their economy going is their collective farms didnt produce well they had little law in there that they really couldnt quite get rid of that every peasant or comrade or whatever they call them these days now had little plot of land of his own and he could raise things on this little plot of land of his own and he could sell those see russia even got back the income tax not too long agothey could sell all the produce on this little tiny plot of land you see but he was mainly supposed to work on the collective farm well russias food supply and i dont know the exact figure and i dont think anybody else does but is 60 or 70 percent from these little tiny food plots the bulk of their produce is coming from this privately produced materials of life still running on private ownerships you see right there in the middle of the communist state and over at the collective farm yeah they sit on that tractorof course it wont runbut they sit on there from 900 in the morning or whenever theyre supposed to work on through till about 530 and somebody comes around and says why isnt the tractor running and they say well we dont have any parts and well why havent you got any parts well the gearshift went out the other day well what happened to the gearshift well i dont know it was just being worked it was ivan over there who was operating it at the time and the gearshift went out we need new gearbox so the head of the collective farm of course he is actually an elected character they got democracy amongst them too so this bird instead of being the commissar which he was once upon time and so forth is more or less an elected representative of those workers of the collectivism you see so this bird of course hasis in the danger all the time of not being reelected to head of the collective farm by his own workers i dont know how the russian managed this because over his head is commissar who has the right to shoot him dead so hes left at point where the authority breaks down hes in pitiable position he feels that he cant shoot anybody dead but hell be shot dead unless things produce so anyway he passes on up the line and finds out that the same condition exists all the way up the line to the tractor factory and the tractor factory of course exists right on out into the mines this whole situation is awry all the way down the line they cant get the spare part for the tractor well if this were an american farm or something theyd go out and clip some pieces of bailing wire off or something like that and hold back one of these confounded gears that kept slipping into the other gears that were stripped and theyd wire it down in the gearbox so that it couldnt mesh dont you see and theyd get couple of gears that would mesh and theyd run the tractor in second gear from that time thereon with frozen shift dont you see and ive seen them do this you had to leap quick on this tractor because when you started it it started to run clutch gone you see so they just wired the drive shaft straight into the crankshaft you wont find that in russia why see its sort of white mutiny goes on all the time they dont approve of this and they dont approve of that and so theyre in revolt against the perfect state this isnt lecture against communism its just statement of that be very nice if someone could invent perfect society you see but there are societies which are more perfect than others and i know perfection is not supposed to behave grades or degrees you know best is not supposed to have degree and worst is not supposed to have degree and that sort of thing whereas as matter of fact life is full of these little shades of gray and to attain an absolute then in terms of conduct by making everybody conform to rule and to attain this absolute by denying himnow this is whats wrong you see it isnt actually lets conform to rule thats just an agreement dont you see but now denying him by duress and continuously any judgment or initiative with regard to rule now theres two things that makes managers or supervisors or something like that fight this one is the person before he knows rule is very prone to violate it because he doesnt even know what hes violating and he isnt going to get any result or get anything done or make factory run or anything else because he doesnt even know there could be rule dont you see so hes just extrapolating off of nothing hes just trying to figure out something from nowhere dont you see not being aware of the fact that there is an agreement on this point well maybe he could figure out something better but its his disagreement with everybody else who is running at that particular moment on rule that gets him in trouble well he doesnt know of its existence now nownow look at this difference now he knows rule and becomes very good at this rule he knows what rule is he knows why its there and he knows how to exercise it and he does something else and he gets away with it and it works do you see this well thats not mutiny its an improvement he knows very well what rule is and he knows how to use rule and that sort of thing and he can still keep the agreement in with rule and he can still exercise his freedom of choice with regard to other factors with relationship to rule it takes ait takes very welltrained very skilled fellow to do that in auditing if you took somebody in your has class and you said well you really dont have to follow comm cycle you know thats just well take comm cycle as rule you see out of an auditing cycle and you dontreally dont have to follow this you know and he says to himself i really dont have to follow this so he just sits there and he doesnt say anything to the pc and he acknowledges in the middle of the pcs sentences and that sort of thing youre going to have gobbledygook and you arent going to get any auditing done at all because this item does exist called an auditing cycle all right now lets take the middlethe middle area of auditor trainingthe middle area level ii iii and so on you have to be at that level pretty awful careful that that auditing cycle is followed man thats really followed this guy could follow it in his sleep he knows what it is bang now the reason hes following it is because he knows what it is he knows why he has to follow it and he knows what results it gets when he does follow it and so forth hes getting more experience on it and he is following it and the auditing cycle at the other end of the line why hes very expert with his auditing cycle he doesnt even think about using the auditing cycle while hes using the auditing cycle he thinks about the pc and so forth now you take him on upstairs into very very very skilled very experienced auditinga very odd thing about it is is occasionally one violates the auditing cycle but youve got to be an awful skilled auditor to do that the pc is saying yappityyappityyap and your sensitivity to the pc you know exactly where the acknowledgment should be and you modify the acknowledgment by little bit of nod you know and pc goes on and so forth and so forth and you find out the pc is answering this question now one right after the other hes giving you answer after answer after answer or something like that you know if hesyou can see this just blow youve just hit some kind of line charge on the thing and if you said yes and thank you every time he gave you one of these answers youd stop him cold in his tracks and you can see this thing blowing so you just sit there and let it blow you know and you give him little wink of the eye and nod and you still got that and so forth mm hmmm you know theres acknowledgments going on the auditing cycle has gotten into too blurred blow dont you see its blowing too quick for anybody to do anything about it and he sits there and when the pc finally runs down why he now knows all about auditing cycles and that sort of thinghe sees the pcs run down the pc hasnt got anything to say on that subject he says all right he said thank you see he puts the intonation of voice hes got different things now in his auditing cycle he uses his auditing cycle now you can teach fellow all about violin and you say if you saw on the violin while holding your finger down at this particular point you get and i remind you that that doesnt make jascha heifetz its very possible that heifetz possibly occasionally doesnt even touch string at particular place to make particular note did you ever think about that he possibly doesnt close the string at that particular place to make that note he may very well find out he can just as easily make it on harmonic on another string or he can make two notes sound togetherthey sound just like the other note which you heard so it doesnt matter whether he hit the string at that point or not in other words this is dont you see he canhe can render the effect with such case and such virtuosity and so forth that if you were observing it youif you observed it very veryif you were just listening to it youd think he was following all the rules but if you looked at it very very closely youd find out he wasnt really following all the rules now if he was following them hed be following them with variations well how well did he have to know the rules in order to follow them with variations see thats what gets interesting about all of this and there is where the person comes cropper who is trying to learn some subject or trying to follow out some industrial plan or something like that there are two conditions which are variation from the must do it two conditions and one is the condition of just total ignorance and rebellion which is based on aberration you know the manager is blond this guy was in the war and he killed lot of german blonds you see he didnt like blonds of course so therefore anything the manager says is wrong you know thats what wall so he doesnt even bother to find out what the plants manufacturing and yet hes supposed to be getting his coffee and cakes from this plant he hasnt bought himself job hes bought himself point from which he can revolt dont you see management sees this management sees this and they say shoot that guy from guns well thats variation dont you see and the other end of it is this happened one time down in south china when they were trying to industrializetrying to industrialize china is one of the more amusing activities because of course industry puts people out of work and the chinese have only one ambition and that is to get everybodyget everybody job between these two things you get quite clash but they themselves have terrific production potentials so heres the chinaman and hes got ahe makes tin cans hes sawing out the tin for tin cans for standard oil down there in some southern china plant and this is before china went boom and theres guard on this band saw that hes sawing metal with you see that is safety guard that keeps people from cutting their hands off you know so new american manager took over this area and he went through the plant and he saw this old chinese standing there at this band saw and this fellow was sawing out pieces of tin that were to make tin cans and he was going at it with great rate and he saw guard on the table so he said yeow yeow yeow yeow yeow and where is that guard through the interpreter and so forth why the old chinese workman there he said oh yes yes yes theres guard there it is its down underneath the table there just make sure its on the machine they picked it up and put it on the machine and so on is that where it belongs oh yes yes well thats it oh you make sure you leave it there and he came through the next day and the guard was back underneath the table so he got ahold of the interpreter and he got ahold of the couple of foremen around there and he said i want that guard on that table of that band saw because somebodys going to cut their hand off on the band saw you see and that guard prevents them from cutting their hand off and its an automatic control so that nothing can go into it but the piece of tin and he explained it all to them with terrific rationale and reason and all this sort of thing and they put the guard back on the table and everybody said yes and went away very happily and he came through on his inspection the next day and the guard was underneath the table so he explained to everybody where this guard belonged and he himself put the guard on the table that time he was thinking very seriously about thisabout the revolutionary spirit which must exist in this particular plant and it was all centering around this old workman well he was making fool out of himself of course the end of the story is that after the seventh or eighth day of the same performance and so forth he just walked on by the band saw table without even mentioning the absence of the guard on it that particular day you see the old chinese had won the sense of the thing is is he had ahe had highly skilled workman there and this guy could have probably sawed tin into scallops and scrolls and done anything else he wanted to do with this band saw and of course this guard was fromfor some knuckleheadedknuckleheaded kid that might be doing his job but lets notice that the knuckleheaded kid wasnt doing the job it was being done by skilled workman and the necessity of this guard was absolutely nonexistent because if we looked carefully at the old chinese workman we would have found he had all of his fingers hands and arms hed been working it for five or six years and he still had all of his fingers hands and arms and he hadnt had any guard on the band saw either so you would have thought somebody would have used some sense so it requires sense from the person who is handing out or enforcing the rules and it requires skill and observation and judgment on the other side to make anything work simply because there are perfect solutions now i dont care whether youre making greatbiggest piece of machinery in the world work or whether or not youre just teaching somebody to swab off windows on skyscraper or something like this with piece of cloth you can lay down all the rules in the world and all these rules are very sensible but after guys understood these rules and after hes understood what the job is and that sort of thing to keep going around asking him if he has had his safety belt tested for its stress analysis and so forth at the local plant testing office in the last sixteen daysits supposed to be tested every sixteen days or something like this and so on well at that point we have to decideit mustsomebody must believe theyre dealing with fool this guys not going to be on the 45thfloor window with weak safety belt and he doesnt test it at the plant test room when he hooks it onwhen he hooks it on and starts to do his job before he even he goes out on window ledge he usually puts his foot against the wall and goes crunch you know back against the belt oh thatsthats good today thats good you know he comes down he saidone day he said i gotta have new belt well the plant testing room tested the new belt theyre liable to get something like this well i dont care what the hell it has to do with the plant testing room but it so happens that this belt has weak point on it i dont care what they think its what i say and so forth if you dont believe you dont have to like it anybody in charge of the job who was very cleveran experienced workman says i need new belt theyd just say all right heres new belt young kid comes up has experience at all everythings been passed tested and standard and he had experience he hasnt anything with this and he says oooooooh iiii got an old belt here its got grease stain on it see ii got an old bbelt here and iiiii thththink its awful unsafe and id better have newnnew belt dont you see you say whats belt for well its to keep you from falling oh yeah well what else is it for well i dont know of course its leaned back against so you can get yourself some pressure against the window in order to put polish on the window you know why he doesnt even know what belts for how does he know whether he needs new belt or not he cant use the one hes got this is quite normally what happens to amateurs in photography they cant use the camera they got so they always got to have new camera which is their fixation on buying 50000 new cameras every fifteen minutes its quite different operation from somebody whos trying to get camera that grooves in easily and it goes snap pop and doesnt give him any trouble because he knows hes trying to get certain result and the certain result which hes trying to get he cannot squeeze out of the exact equipment which hes got well all right now weve got some reason for shifting but were shifting from the viewpoint of virtuosity the fellow can already do this do you follow that he knows in other words what hes trying to lay his hands on and of course hes also knowledgeable enough that if he gets hold of equipment that doesnt particularly service him or pick out this result or he cant hang back together again youd laugh i got new camera the other day and putting it together and so forth and it didnt function at all so i put it full of gasketsoh yes i have piece of newsi got my certificate today i graduated in earnest thank you but i put ai put piecea couple pieces of cardboard underneath the lens mount to hold it out another thousandth of an inch or something like that so it focuses properly and its piece of ordinary cardboard if anybody were to buy that camera theyd probably be horrified because theyd open up the lens mount and theyd see there was an old piece of cardboard stuck in there and theyd wonder what this old piece of cardboard was and theyd say that doesnt belong there so theyd pull it out and then their camera wouldnt work i was just taking some pictures few minutes ago i didnt have any parallax corrector for it i knew about what the parallax must have been on the camera so i put my thumb underneath the finder and tipped the finder up about what the parallax would be which i you know which i thought was about an eighth of an inch above where the thing should have been but taking pictures holding loose flopping finder would have given you fits you understand what i mean when i say parallax i mean the lens takes one picture and the finder sees another picture so you got to make the finder see what the lens is going to take well when they dontwhen they dont true up one for the other and so forth the normal course of human events is to just grit your teeth and bear it and wonder why your pictures have all the peoples heads cut off in them dont you see well this finders loose so what you do instead of putting the finder down where it belongs you know the viewfinder because it doesnt agree with the lens why just sort of hold it there in your fingers and look through it you see balanced at an angle which you guess might possibly be the proper angle with the lens so its looking at the same thing the lens is looking at and therefore youre not cutting somebodys head off when you get finder thats extreme this way its much more accurate just tojust to sort of hold the finder in your hand you could get down to point where it would be actually more accurate to disposedispense with the finder entirely dont you see and you say well therethis edge of this camera lines up with the upper righthand corner of the picture so well just squint along the edge of the camera and saywell thatll be the upper righthand corner of the picture snap see well how could you do that well youd have to know the theory of what you were trying to do you see and you knowhave to know what youwhy it was happening and youd have to know what was going on and what was liable to go on particularly what was liable to happen if you didnt do something about it you see youd have to know the whole game all the way around the line not rule you could quote about parallax parallax is the logarithm of the wizirods as they go into the wuclabugs its actually of course different for every distance you go another inch the parallax between the finderthis works on box camera too you see your finders up here your lens is down here so of course the picture you take is looked at up here the lens is taking the picture that is looked at down here theyre two different pictures cut peoples heads off so therefore youre reallyin lots of cases as you get up close to thingsmuch better off never to look through the finder going give you false picture but youd have to know that see youd have to know that existed youd have to know well enough that it did exist that you didnt suddenly find out you had forgotten to remember it just afterwards do you understand and then all of this stuff about parallax becomes veryvery uncomplicated why it doesnt amount toto lots see but when you were studying it my god how you sweated over thiswhat was this thing what was the formula how did the coincidence whats the difference between the axis of the lens and the axis of the finder and what is the formula that you apply and work onon your slide rule you see brrrrr and what are the various rules that relate to this thing huhhuhuhuh you know hes having an awful time with it you know and then youd get up so youd be very very careful about this does this camera have parallax and this camera doesnt have parallax this corrects its parallax and that doesnt correct its parallax ooohooohooo good and you get up through your total confusions about that sort of thing after while you take big view camera hold it up in the air squint over the corner edge of the thing and shoot it simply because you know that the lens is going to view what appears on the film you know thatyou know that very well now and you also know theres lots of ways by which this is not likely to happen so when in doubt you just short cut all these ways so the amateur busily trying to make his achievement or attainment or something like this is trying to get something else to do it or get the perfect instrument to do it hes trying to get the perfect instrument to do it i was looking over cameras the other night it was very interesting to to find out that i already had camera that was doing better than any of the cameras i was looking for in spite of the fact that it was very far from perfect camera these other cameras were much more expensive but it was very far from perfect camerathe camera that was better than those other cameras by sorting out all of the angles all of the little liabilities for instance when you vary the speed at which you take picture you dont know where you are if thats always variable because you have to take picture very quickly in order not to get any motion in it and most of the blurs which you get in your pictures are from motion theyre not from anything else theyre not the grain of the film or any complicated reason whatsoever its just because youre waving it around like red banner on high dont you see at the time you were taking the picture so the way to get over this is take picture very fast well if your pictures going to be very fast one moment and very slow the next moment and youre not going to know about it then you could never take picture without blur and you know the most expensive cameras made today are fixed up so the shutter speed varies in other words so they dont know whether youre taking picture fast you dont know whether youre taking it slow and thats true of most of these automatic cameras so thats why pro really wants nothing to do with an automatic camera he cant control thats one of the reasons there are dozen more too but look atim just giving you this as progress of rules at first you run into this thing called parallax and its as puzzling as the first time you heard use the word see and then you find out thats just parallelism between the lens and the finder and you find out finally that the lens is looking at one picture and you through the viewfinder are looking at another picture and that these are not the same picture so theres thing called parallax correction which the closer the object gets to you the more the finder has to be tipped over to see the same relative view you see and you get this through your head now youve got the formulas involved with this thing now you get how this happens now youve got all the methods of correcting it now youve got this and now youve got that and now youve got these other things now youre getting into very complex subject well by the time youve mastered this whole subject why you now finally come out the other end of the line and you dont correct parallax or figure out parallax anymore you know about what the thing would be you squint over the top of the box and you find out theres one line of the camera that is always parallel to the lensfilm line and that more or less occurs up in the top righthand corner of your picture and that you can squint along that you wouldnt even need finder but looklook youd have to come through all of that to come up to point of virtuosity so you see there are two breeds of variation there are two things that are variable and one of those things is sheer ignorance just crash unbelievable ignorance and unfamiliarity theres familiarity with itthey havent got clue you see all right and theres the other kind which is variation which stems from familiarity and knowledge theres hardly good cook in the world makes it up according to the recipes you see anymore they take couple of eggsthey may be very precise but they take these eggs and they throw them in one direction another direction and so forth and they say cookbook cookbook oh dear havent cooked out of cookbook for years you know beautiful cake when you try to shoot that one down youre in trouble because thats got experience familiarity judgment the individual has earned the right to vary it i told graflex camera company thatone of the oldest camera companies in america the other day in letter very insoucianti was writing the letter and i said i see that you have invented new camera term but having been in business as many years as you have you have perfect right this really got laugh out of them they recognize they have perfect right to invent new term for camera perfectly valid youll find the terms going to be used every place very shortly they have perfect right to theyre familiar enough with them but some johnnycome lately company that wouldnt really know cameras and wasnt making good camera anyhow they put new term out on the marketi wouldnt pay any attention to it see thats your difference now when management makes differentiation between these two things whether in company or political area or training area or anything of this sort when nobody makes differentiation between these two things these two reasons for variation then judgment is denied the individual and from that point on you really get in trouble you can handle that first onethe first kind the sheer stupidity with duress because youre being helped by all of life the person does the action wrong through stupidity theyre in trouble they dont get the result everything goes to hell anyhowif you can pardon my french life is assisting you in punishing them see its sort of q and well theyre going to get their heads blown off all right blow their heads off you know well all right now you could use then certain amount of coercion certain amount of persuasion and so forth to get people through that point make them see that there is something there and very often this is very hard to do an instructor very often finds this in teaching that it is quite rough getting across that early point see well right here pcs getting better but the auditor hasnt observed the fact that he isnt following an auditing comm cycle auditor sometimes sits there for fiveten minutes you know and never says yes pcs also not talking nothing is happening so auditing isnt working well certain amount of coercion is necessary at this point or persuasion or something of this sort to trace the source and cause of this action in the auditing session do you follow all right thats training now the instructor who carrying through somebody all the way and passing him successfully all the way and their understanding is up all the wayto let us say class viand then calling to the attention of class vi auditor whose pc was running like startled gazelle that he was not following the auditing cycle would be pure idiocy this fellow was following as much of the auditing cycle as is necessary to resolve the case hes using it with judgment so youd have an entirely different viewpoint your viewpoint of what was going on would be different because of your knowledge of the persons experience youd say were dealing here with virtuosity were not dealing here with stupidity and ignorance now almost everybody confuses these things and what messes it all up is the fellow who is ignorant very often considers himself very virtuous oh yes imi can drive cars beautifully he says as he goes over the embankment and into the gully and also what gets it fouled up is matter how great your virtuosity on some subject is you every once in while have catastrophe this is after all this universe people are after all people and you also once in while will run into some unexpected turn in the road thatsvuhnobody could have done anything about it at all it was absolutely beyond any power known to man to have averted what happened well now virtuosity simply is measured by how quick is the recovery we simply measure that so we find somebody has made colossal screaming blunder in the first halfhour of his session horrible blunder in the first halfhour of his session and its still blunder still in full force twoandahalf hours deep in the session oh well there must not have been very much virtuosity involved here because the recovery wasnt quick dont you see guy who knows his business recovers quick guy who knows his business doesnt always never make mistakesto give you double negative but that also confuses the situation so does person know his business or doesnt he is what has got to be decided and this is decided on the basis of result is the person obtaining his results or isnt he and you can assume then that person who is protesting against the rulesand this is very easy measureprotesting the duress with which hes being made to follow the rules who is himself getting results duress or duress dont you see we can assume that we must be dealing with considerable virtuosity here but person who is protesting against all the rules and isnt getting any results we must assume that he should have had more rules not less because what were dealing with herewe must be dealing with ignorance you see his departure from the rules does not result in ain ain better gaina better end product his departure from the rules always winds up in catastrophe and when he makes one of these catastrophes and so forth his recovery is absolutely zero see he not only goes over the cliff but he never gets back up the cliff either now that person protesting against the rules is the only fellow who gives management instruction running states and so forth the bad duressful character that these things develop it isnt the state that develops it its this bird he doesnt know what hes doing he doesnt know where hes going he doesnt know why hes going there he hasnt clue and yet hes agin it and to get anything done you go across his dead body and the only difficulty is he never dies theres only one way that you could ever pick him up or ever get the show on the road or anything like that and that is to pick him up and that is the one thing which very stupid management state or instructor would never try to do they would never try to pick this boy up they want this guy in concentration camps they want this bird starving they want this bird way downhill dont you see so its actually their combat with ignorance thats giving them trouble their combat with ignorance is what gives them the trouble and which gives them the broadest excuse to use force and duress and so forth now when we move this back over onto the other side and they are foolish enough to go into combat with virtuosity now they put leadership to the revolution and we have new khrushchev tomorrow there are only two types of people who were ever exported to this planet there were distinctly two typesthe very stupid criminal destructive personality and the genius these two personalities without any gradient between them of any kind whatsoever is the total export to this planet and comprises the population of this particular planet theres in between anybody who says there is an average human being an average which end of the scale human being would be what you would have to ask i could tell you long stories concerning that particular line but its both those people you see give an unthinking stupid state which believes that it has the perfect political answer the only troubleone is reactive and the other however happens to be intelligent selfdetermined trouble when you run into intelligent selfdetermined trouble and try to handle it with force this of course is handling thought with mass and it just doesnt handle very well and everything starts going up in small plumes of smoke because the biggest power the individual has is his own power of choicehis own selfdeterminism and this expresses itself in the very stupid the very ignorant as well as the very brilliant only when it expresses itself in the very stupid it expresses itself in total destruction and when it expresses itself in the very bright it expresses itself in the terms of total voltevis for all the forces involved in the situation in other words you just stay and change the whole lousy lotvoltevis about facefrench military command so do you see so somebody has decided on careful consideration that we are not running in perfect condition and werethat condition has become sufficiently imperfect to merit change this is on due consideration not on reactive consideration and then follows the thing on through with wellordered program and that changes the whole ruddy lot nothing much to that and generally this individual will accumulate to himself lot of other individuals who are on the upper strata of being able to shift things around and change the whole bloody lot yeah but this would be revolution which would normally come about on an evolutionary basis it would come about rather easily it would come about rather inevitably there wouldnt be anybody being able to stand up to it very good and all the other people who just revolt would probably revolt then too at the same time unless it were alleviated and things worked little bit better in their particular direction in which time they wouldnt be likely to do so but why did they have to stay stupid and that is our question in scientology why do they have to stay pushed down into the mire im not saying that we are saving the lower classes you understand but whywhy is such large segment of the population just in state of just solid protest why do they have to remain in that particular debased condition lot of other such questions as that therefore this gives you some kind of view of what youre handling when youre handling pcs and moving them on up the scale when they move up through levels with great unfamiliarity they say i want to have shot in the gluteus maximus with number 22 needle on plastic syringe with the spot anaesthetized first you see and that will make an ot and here we go into the wild blue yonder and you run into this bird and you run into lots of them see and hes going to be an ot in the next three minutes because youre going to wave magic wand in the first place the factor which he neglects utterly is becoming an ot has to do with his own power of selfdeterminism power of choice power of observation thats him thats going to become an ot you see thats not you and if you waved magic wand that caused this sort of thing to happen it would just result in further effect on himan effect to such degree he wouldnt be likely to get over it in asia poor old buddha tried to pick up man and waved few too many magic wands and turned the asians into utter complete debase slaves for about 2500 years i think its ratherthe mostmost horrible example of guys postulates going wrong way to that i ever heard of he would be utterly shocked and probably is every time he takes look at bunch of these brass images sitting around you know how hed say i wasnt talking about that oooooooow you know its probably matter of total outrage you know and fella down here in asia minor where theyre always having trouble sent bunch of swine over cliff and turned some fish to leaves and so forthinto loaves of bread or did something remarkable and everybody went gosh you know and 1964 years later see everybody is still overwhumped and you know i dont think that bloke was trying to do that at all well so much for the twentytwo gauge needle into the gluteus maximus and youre ot tomorrow see just result in further overwhelm now the unreality and unfamiliarity of the situation the fellow doesnt realize hes got road to walk and he hasnt got clue of what hes walking into and he therefore says to you as an auditor he says well all i want you to do is to put on the pad and light the fuse and here i go you know well man you can put him on the pad and you could light the fuse but after it burned out hed be just little more carbonized therefore we get really the unpopularity of levels because theres an unfamiliarity with the road thats to be walked so therefore we dont say much about it to pcs and i think the less we say about it to pcs the better off were going to be im talking about pcs here there and every place dont you see i dont think this is profitable line of progress at all because their unfamiliarity doesnt teach them that they have to go anyplace heres this guy sitting hereheres this guy sitting here saying well are you having any trouble well i really dont have great deal of trouble except with breakfast food and so forth i always have lot of trouble with breakfast food it makes throw up and so on well do you have any more trouble well yes i have about two or three different jobs year i keep getting sacked you say well isnt that lot of trouble well the state you know kind of takes care of it between times and so its really real trouble to ah well what about your marital situation well umoh that well i try not to think about that well all right now at the beginning of this session here do you have any present time problems is there anything worrying you here in present time not really nothing really worrying well you happen to know that hes about to be thrown in jail tomorrow you see for something of the sort you say how about that well he says thats just fate then he says well what i want you to do is make into an ot so that i can totally escape out the bottom his comprehension of the situation you see hasnt anything to do with the fact that he has anything to do with these problems that he has anything to do with his environment that its necessary for him to become slightly causative in his environment and even in the auditing sessionat least able to talk to the auditor goodness heavens weve got toyeah hes got to be able to project himself at least those three feet to sympathetic listener before he projects himself from here to arcturus so you have levels i told you i wasnt going to describe the levels today im going to try to tell you the sense behind them well thats the sense behind them and thats really muchall there is to it youve got to get the guy up to point where he can talk to an auditor enough and tolerate control enough and be keyedout enough of the glutinous mass hes sitting in so hes under sufficient disciplineas far as an auditor is concernedto go through the motions necessary to confront the very real objects of the bank necessary to run out to resolve his case and that may take quite while that may take quite while technically the easiest thing to do on something like this is to unburden the case by getting locks off and you do this by first unburdening the session environmentyou know you got to educate him little bit tell him what hes supposed to do get him used to be able to talk to the auditor well i started to audit somebody just few months ago and was very shocked to realize that i waswas startled that i had not estimated the situation because this person is apparently very glib all the time and this person was not willing to talk to as an auditor at all i had session i had session i was actually trying to do something for this person and i had session and i had overestimated the ability of that case to project you know to talk communicate and so forth so it was startling to have made the mistake dont you see dont often make mistake like this you see person was perfectly willing to talk about all the social subjects under the sun moon and stars but not willing to talk to an auditor and you thought i was going to say about personal subjectsno was willing to talk about all the social subjects under the sun moon and stars but was not willing to talk to an auditor not about anything you see just not willing to talk to an auditor and youd have to ask what would you be willing to talk to about i guess i dont know probably youd keep that up forfor hours and all of sudden the persons considerations with regard to this would have come into view and we would have had to straighten up the subject of auditing and we would have found some unhappy experience with regard to some such associated thing we would have gotten this by itsa we probably would have found little bit of difficulties they had had and worries they had had which hadnt been straightened out by some similar subject to scientology wed gradually get them to talk to the auditor see we dont care what theyre talking about wed find these other things were there and wed gradually get them so theyre talking to the auditor huhuhuh all right now weve got the thing of what are they supposed to do nowthis was just itsa seenow what are they supposed to do well the auditor says something and theyre supposed to do something so you pick out something very simple that you say and they say and then you okay now you could even teach them what an auditing cycle was and so forth and this is rudiment when you tell them to touch the chair you want them to touch the chair you have to explain this to them and so forth dont just leave it all on automatic and so on and so forth and you finally get ityou finally get this thing up so that they can be audited got the idea theyre sessionable or something invent new word as though we dont have enough and theyre quite auditable and they havent been audited on anything really you think well we must have made quite bit of progress on the case because the case did mention that they had been in the holy rollers and they hadnt done anything for him so that must have cleaned that oh brother they probably wont hit that again until theyre up there about level iv leave it alone you havent got any clue to this case yet so case is just able to be audited thats all weve achieved this now now can we audit the case so he isnt so disturbed with the immediate present time problems he has at this moment all the time in his environment lets handle that environmental situation what ptps is he running into and were not going to do anything very deep about these ptps were just going to get them counted lets get him to look over these things lets get him to look over problems and so forth now lets get the sessionnow to go over the steps againlets get the sessions so it can run get the pc so the pc can be in session and respond in session and not be upset about the auditor or theor some kind of room in session straighten this up see so get that step now lets get the environment so the pc can be audited on the immediate present time environment do you realize thats little bit different than auditing him on the environment hes not auditable yet on his environment he hasnt got his environment sufficiently disentangled to know what to look at in the environment hed be in total confusion all the time you said all right now this big problem youre talking all the time about your wife and so forth he said aooooh aoooohahh iiii dont know that wed better go into that heh heh heh hehhh oooh you say whats the matter whats the matter oh it wouldnt do any good so in other words without makingwithout straightening out his orientation on his environment we start to audit him on his environment we picked out one thing in the environment it overwhelmed him at once because all these things were in the matter of stuff in other words we didnt straighten this boys environment out so it could be audited we could do this as simply as all right now give the parts of your environment we do case assessment on the environment you see but its not real case assessment because its not going to be done with meter or anything else were just going to sit there and say all right whats your life all about now what are the various parts of this environment you know that you live in well youre part of it thatll come off pretty quick and then theres my job you know sometimes i have the feeling my job is good place to escape to of course at this moment if youve said all right now what problems do you have about your job youd just be doing q and because were trying to straighten out the environment dont you see i meanwell all right hes got job all right see he comes to that he doesntits good place to escape to all right thats fine all right now what are the other parts of your environment and so forth and way down at the end of the line someplace he all of sudden mentions his parents they live with him but weve heard about this guy and weve heard about this guy and weve heard about him weve listened to this guy and so forth and so forth and he just never mentioned the fact that his parents live with him and that his wife and five children and his parents live in this tworoom house he just never seems tohe neglects to have told us all this dont you see well he himself by the way has never confronted it you know and while hes telling you if youve straightened out his environment anything up to that pointas i say this is down toward the tail end of getting hisparts of his environment named and straightened out put in their properyou dont realize it you see but his job sits over there within foot outside that door i aint talking about crazy person now im talking about pretty good guy off the street and hishis entertainment you see his entertainment is over here just back of that wall dont you seethe theater he normally goes to and hes sort of sitting in his own office while hes sitting in the auditing room you see his environments confused well you get thisjust get these things spotted just where are they and what is all this about and where do you live and what do you do and that sort of thing well youre getting his environment auditable nownow that youve got that all straightened out and youve found out these various things youll find out that hes making good case progress along this line if you arent pushing him too hard now you maybe can start auditing the environment now what problems do you have in this environment oh well yeah i do have problems in this environment i and so forth and he starts to ease in and he starts listing this problem and that problem you finally find that hes named problem that he cant seem to get his mind off ofvooh boom chug you know hes stuck with that one you know well you could be so feather light as to say all right well what communications didnt you complete with that oh gee well you see i never wanted to communicate with it at all you see so and he gives you long list of communications with regard to that problem that he himself has never completed and you dont even bother to get the overts off see thats rather accusative after all too light you got to handle it too light oh are there lot of communications you didnt complete about that problem that problem doesnt bother him now all right theres lot of other of these things and you get all those things straightened out with similar feathertouch processes now now weve got the period from this auditing session to the next auditing session somewhat cared for so that it isnt always going to be coming up in the next auditing session dont you see now weve straightened that out even though it took us several sessions we got that straight dont you see what are we doing were expanding the perimeter comes from the auditing what is auditing expands out into the environment what is the environmentjust that you knowto the problems of the environment you see and were now involving the case now the case is getting involved that is to say were coming up against the outer perimeters really of the reactive bank now now after weve done all that we want to know something about the persons past and future ah but were going out into two different spheres nowisnt it well do you know you could youif youre going to audit person on his past arc straightwire is so wonderful simply because it orients the past its just the person you know there it is you know there it was if you say give date out of your past youd be doing almost the same thing by the way give date out of your past and where was that yeah whatwhat date can you remember something happening onout of the pastwhere it wouldnt matter what you were doing youre carrying this same area and zone of familiarity you see into the past do you follow that well when you had him up to that line why then maybe you start him at class iipardon whats now class i materials which is repetitive commands and auditing cycle and so forth now you didnt think he got anyplaceyou thought he got long way didnt you he hasnt gotten anyplace at all but hes just now in statei said ii i because actually ii has just been downgraded to i and i was talking out of force of habit your hqs is level i now you have some new of themone of these the reason why is is we needed room at the top hqsrepetitive processesis level i its not level ii now i know you say its changed well let call it to your attention it was never broadly released because of that see imand i told youbeen telling you for quite while this is in state of flux and study i keep telling you exactly where do we fit in these various points in order to bring off these various points in other words where do we fit in these various levels where has the guy got to go in order to get into these various levels and its pretty hard thing to figure out so the finalized result is all were talking about the guy can now stand repetitive process the guy can now sit there and run on automatic is all im talking to you about you see he can have the auditing question asked him again and again and again and he can answer this and he can involve his mind with this he can blow locks he can get rid of lot of things dont you see and so forth and hes flyinghes auditable and i will say that it is to our shame that some 80 or 90 percent of our pcs have never been brought up to point of where their environment was sufficiently straightened out they had been brought up to the point where they were sufficiently straightened out to be audited in the room but theyalways picking up ptps between sessions because their environment has never been even oriented enough to address so their problems have never been handled enough so were always faced at the beginning of sessions with ptps and where auditing becomes very involved very complicated and very upsetting and you cant really get on with the process and what youre all doing iswhat youre doing there is getting tangled up with the pcs disorientation in his own environment he doesnt know what problems he does have now they keep coming up and smashing him in the face and so forth between sessions and you try to carry on in sessions and so forth in other words we havent lifted the auditability of person very high now if you run this person on up into let us say healingclay table healing now and youre going to heal up some of their body conditions and that sort of thingtheir environment is so confused and from session to session its going tofirst their auditing could itself as sessionand the conditions for being audited are so confused they couldnt be audited at all well buh that goes without saying you see their environments so confused that from session to session we cant make them make any real progress they keep going back downhill again thats because their environment has never been straightened out now youre straightening out something that they have been worried abouttheir body clay table healinghealth that sort of thing were getting them so that they can live and not be so worried about pains and somatics in their body that every time they get little somatic from their upper level auditing they dont all of sudden start going into screaming fit of terror because their body might be destroyed right on the spot and you of course get rid of their hidden standards and that sort of thing as result you move on up then into healing and then youre handling the locks of the reactive bankthe gpms youre just handling locks locks locks locks locks locks locks and you just handle them by the ton and the person isnt into the actual bank and hasnt been sent down the linethen the bank itself straightens out sufficiently so that it could be audited you might find the person going onto whole track at that particular point and so forth so youre really including bit of level v in when you get up into your r6 however you want to make sure that that persons reactive bank is sufficiently unburdened the gpms are lying out there like doggone long parade all ready to go bzubzubzu you havent got the fifteenth tangled with the first and that sort of thing the only reason theyre tangled up is hes so disoriented himself he cant put his attention on it you try to run somebody on r6 when he hasnt been brought up the levels youre going to be in trouble all the way because he isnt auditable and great deal can go wrong at r6 and hes insufficiently under control for you to put it right so thats very difficult situation that you walk yourself into those are the levels those are the reasons for the levels and the individual revolt that i was talking to you about he revolts against what youre trying to do he doesnt understand what youre trying to do well give him some chance to find out what youre trying to do and give him some let himlet him get his feet wet before you throw him into the icy drink you know lets get himget some familiarity on it and if any variations occur as you go on up the level let them be from the level of intelligence and selfdeterminism merely than from reactive revolt i have spoken thank you
