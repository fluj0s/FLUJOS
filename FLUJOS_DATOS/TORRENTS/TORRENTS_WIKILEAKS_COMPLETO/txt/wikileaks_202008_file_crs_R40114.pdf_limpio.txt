economic cooperation and development is an intergovernmental economic organization in which the 30 member countries1 discuss develop and analyze economic and social policy2 the oecd is organized around three main bodies the council the committees and the secretariat committees are comprised of representatives of all the member countries the overriding committee is the council which has decisionmaking power it is composed of one representative for each member country generally at the level of ambassador gives guidance to the oecd and directs its work since the work agenda is set by unanimous consent by the council veto by council member removes an item from the agenda the oecd is strong proponent of the view that increasing world economic growth and welfare is best supported by free and open flow of goods services and capital as result it views its own role in this process as that of leading proponent of the benefits of globalization and as force for developing institutions and regulatory structures that ca n make these benefits available to the oecd members and to developing countries international flows of capital and goods and services around the world phenomenon referred to as globalization have grown dramatically over th last two decades and are producing significant challenges for the oecd members including the united states international flows in dollars for instance now total over 19 trillion per day or nearly as much as the total annual amount of us exports and imports of goods and services one part of these flows is foreign direct investment or investment in businesses and real estate the united states is the largest recipient of foreign direct investment and is the largest overseas investor in the world owning over 21 trillion in direct investment abroad or almost twic as much abroad as british investors the next most active overseas investors this international expansion of business activity and overseas presence however often leads to clash of cultures and values g22g138g161g561g10g138g159g142g151g156g561 during the last half of the 1990s the oecd pursued an effort to curtail the use of what it termed harmful tax competition3 which it defined as attempts by some countries to attract capital by offering taxbenefit inducements with the sole purpose of attracting foreign investment these concerns arise from judgement that certain kinds of competition for internationally mobile capital can threaten the tax bases of other oecd countries and can distort the worldwide allocation of capital in one report on the issue the oecd indicated that it was not focusing on any particular nations tax structure it stated 1 the member countries include australia austria belgium canada the c zech republic denmark finland france germany greece hungary iceland ireland italy japan korea luxembourg mexico the netherlands new zealand norway poland portugal slovak republic spain sweden switzerland turkey united kingdom and the

developed primarily to address domestic economic and social concerns the forms and levels of taxation were established on the basis of the desired level of publicly provided goods and transfers with regard also taken to the allocative stabilizing and redistributive aims thought appropriate for country 4 instead the oecd indicated that it was attempting to curtail tax practices by countries that have or only nominal taxation combined with the fact that country offers itself as place or is perceived to be place to be used by nonresidents to escape tax in their country or residence5 as result the oecd indicated that it was not targeting merely differences in tax structures between countries that may be exploited by individuals or firms but practice that is meant specifically to reallocate investment unlike the situation of mismatchinghere the effect is for one country to redirect capital and financial flows and the corresponding revenue from the other jurisdictions by bidding aggressively for the tax base of other countries some have described this effect as poaching as the tax base rightly belongs to the other country practices of this sort can appropriately be labeled harmful tax competition as they do not reflect different judgements about the appropriate level of taxes and public outlays or the appropriate mix of taxes in particular country but are in effect tailored to attract investment or savings originating elsewhere or to facilitate the avoidance of other countries taxes 6 the clinton administration played leadership role in shaping the oecds tax competition initiative when the initiative was publicly announced for instance the clinton administration through treasury secretary lawrence summers released statement that read the identification of tax havens and potentially harmful tax regimes is crucial step in preventing distortions that could undermine the benefits of enhanced capital mobility in todays global economywe encourage all countries to follow the example set by the oecd member countriesthat have committed to eliminate harmful tax practices 7 the bush administration however led by treasury secretary paul oneill decided to pursue different approach in statement before the senate committee on governmental affairs july 18 2001 secretary oneill voiced the bush administrations opposition to portions of the oecds efforts to target tax havens the secretary said the 1998 oecd report8 and followup report issued in june 2000 contained rhetoric that implicated fundamental internal tax policy decisions of countries within and outside the oecd including decisions regarding tax ra tes the reports enumerated the harms potentially caused by tax havens or harmful preferential regimes that drive the effective tax rate levied on income from the mobile activities significantly below rates in other countries tax systems that redirect capital and financial flows and the corresponding revenue from other countries were condemned as poaching the rightful tax base of the other countries 4 harmful tax competition p 13 5 ibid p 21 6 ibid p 16 7 treasury secretary welcomes oecd re port on harmful tax competition havens

without facilitating noncompliance with the tax laws of any other country9 as result of the bush administrations efforts the oecd backed away from its efforts to target harmful tax practices and shifted the scope of its efforts to improving exchanges of tax information between member countries in his statement secretary oneill stated that he was troubled by the notion that any country or group of countries should interfere in any other countrys decisions about how to structure its own tax system 10
