2002 henry cohen legislative attorney american law divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31499child pornography produced without an actual child constitutionality of 107th congress legislation summary in ashcroft v free speech coalition the supreme court declared unconstitutional the child pornography prev ention act of 1996 cppa to the extent that it prohibited material that was produced without the use of an actual child the only possible means that the court explicitly left open for congress to try to restrict such material was to ban it but allow an affirmative defense that the material was produced without using actual children ev this approach the court did not say would be constitutional but merely found need to d ecide whether it would be this approach would shift the burden of proof to the defendant on the question of whether actual children were used in producing the material if the defendant could not meet the burden of proof then he could be punished for child pornography that might or might not have been produced with an actual minor the court however said that the government ma not suppress lawful speech as means to suppress unlawful speech this suggest s that an affirmative defense would be unconstitutional if it were not effectively available to all classes of defendant it might not effectively be available how ever to individuals charged with mere possession of child pornography or to produ cers of pornography that predated the cppa as these defendants might have way of establishing the identity or even the existence of the actors the three bills that this report examines hr 4623 as passed by the house s 2511 and s 2520 would all ban child pornography produced without the use of an actual child though all three bills woul d allow an affirmative defense to the extent that they applied to defendants who had way of establishing the identity or even the existence of the actors they raise the same questions that the court in ashcroft posed as to the constitutionality of such an approach though the bills would permit defendant to pr ove that minors were use d rather than as under the cppa that only adult actors were used this would not appear to eliminate this problem and some defendant s might be convicted fo r conduct involving lawful speech some provisions of the bills however app ear constitutional all three bills for example would ban attempts to distribut material in manner that conveys the impression that it depicts minor engaging in sexually explic it conduct whether or not it does this proscription unlike the one that the court struck down in ashcroft would not ban any material itself but w ould ban only attempts to distribute such material all three bills would also ma ke it crime to provide minors with child pornography whether or not it was produced w ith an actual child this would appear constitutional because the court has found there to be compelling interest in shielding minors from any

declared unconstitutional the federal child pornography law to the extent that it prohibited material that was produced without the use of an actual child4 the case held in other words that pornography created by artists including virtual computergenerated pornography and nography produced with adult actors but with actors below 18 years of age are protected by the first amendment even if they appear to portray minors unle ss they are obscene in response to ashcroft bills were introduced in the 107th congress that would continue to ban some child pornography that was produced without the us of an actual child the senate bills are s 2520 and s 2511 the house bill is hr 4623 which was identical to s 2511 but which was amended by the house judiciary committee and reported on

exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person6 the child pornography prevention act of 1996 cppa7 added to the statute the following definition of child pornography child pornography means any visu depiction including any photograph film video picture or computer or computer generated image or picture whether made or produced by electronic mechanical or other means of sexually explicit conduct where the production of such visual depiction involves the use of minor engaging in xually explicit conduct b such visual depiction is or appears to be of minor engaging in sexually explicit

presented described or distributed in ch manner that conveys the impression that the material is or contains visual depiction of minor engaging in xually explicit conduct8 the cppa however provides an affirm ative defense not available to defendant charged with posse ssion without intent to sell that each person used in producing the alleged child pornography was an adult and that t he defendant did not advertise promote present describe or distribute the material in such manner as to convey the impression that it is or contai ns visual depiction of minor engaginghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31499crs3 918 usc 2252ac the reason that this affirmative defense is not available to defendant charged with possession without intent to sell is that the affirmative defense applies only to paragraphs 1 2 3 nd 4 of section 2252aa whereas paragraph 5 covers possession offenses paragraph 4 covers possession with intent to sell 1018 usc 2252d 2252ad 11ashcroft supra

there is an affirmative defens that the defendant 1 possessed fewer than three images of child pornography and 2 promptly and in good faith destroyed or reported the images to law enforcement agency10 ashcroft v free speech coalition on april 16 2002 in ashcroft v free speech coalition the supreme court struck down paragraphs b and d of the definition of child pornography quoted above paragraphs wh ich covers images of actual children engaged in sexually explicit conduct and paragr aph c which covers images of actual children morphed to make it appear as if the children are engaged in sexually explicit conduct were not in issue paragraphs b and d by contrast cover pornography that was produced without the use of actual children in ashcroft v free speech coalition the supreme court obs erved that statutes that prohibit child pornography that is produced with actual children are constitutional because they target the production of the work not the content11 the cppa by contrast targeted the cont ent not the means of production virtual child pornography is not intrinsically rela ted to the sexual abuse of children as were the materials in ferber12 the governments rationales for the cppa included that pedophiles might use the materials to encourage children to participate in sexual activity and might whet their own sexual appetites with it thereby increasing the sexual abuse and exploitation of actual children13 the court found thes rationales inadequate because the evil in question depends upon the actors unlawful conduct conduct defined as criminal quite apart from any link to the speech in question the government cannot constitu tionally premise legisla tion on the desirability of controlling persons private thoughts the government may not prohibit speech because it increases the chance an unlawfu l act will be committed at some indefinite future time without significan tly stronger more direct connection the government may not prohibit speech on th ground that it may encourage pedophiles to engage in illegal conduct14 the government also argued that the existence of virtual child pornography can make it harder to prosecute pornographers who do use real minors becausehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31499crs4 15id at 1397 16id at 1404 justice thomas concurring wrot that technology may evolve to the point where the government cannot prove th at certain pornographic images are of real children and that if that becomes the case the government may well have compelling interest in barring or otherwise regulating so narrow category of lawful speech in order to enforce effectively laws against pornography made though the abuse of real children id at 14061407 17id at 1400 18id at 1411as imaging technology improves it becomes more difficult to prove that particular picture was pr oduced using actual children15 this analysis the court found turns the first amendment upside down the government may not suppress lawful speech as means to suppress unlawful speech protected speech does not become unprotected merely because it resembles the latter the cons titution requires the reverse the possible harm to society in permitting some unprotected speech to go unpunished is outweighed by the possib ility that protected speech of others may be muted 16 the court also noted that because child pornography unlike obscenity may include material with serious literary artistic political or scientific value it includes any depiction of sexually explicit activity matter how it is presented the cppa therefore applies to picture in psychology manual as well as movie depicting the horrors of sexual abuse teenage sexual activity and the sexual abuse of children have inspired countless literary works17 the court then noted that the cppa would make it crime to film shakespeares romeo and juliet in manner that made it appear that the teenage lovers were engaging in sexually explicit conduct the majority opinion in ashcroft v free speech coalition was written by justice kennedy and joined by justices st evens souter ginsberg and breyer with justice thomas concurring justice connor concurred insofar as the decision struck down the prohibition of child pornogra phy created with adults that look like children but dissented insofar as it struck down the ban on virtual child pornography justices rehnquist wrote dissenting opinion joined by justice scalia arguing that the cppa should be construed to apply onl to computergenerated images that are virtually indistinguishable from real child ren engaged in sexua lly explicit conduct and upheld as such18 did the court leave congress with any constitutional means by which it may restrict child pornography that was produ ced without an actual child the only possibility that the court explicitly left open not by saying that it would be constitutional but merely by finding need to decide the question is to ban material that appears to pict an actual child engaging in sexually explicit conduct but that was produced without using an act ual child while allowing an affirmative defense that the material was produced wit hout using an actual child this approach would shift the burden of proof to the defe ndant on the question of whether an actual child was used in producing the material if the defendant could not meet the burdenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31499crs5 19id at 14041405 20see note 9 supraof proof then he could be punished for child pornography that might or might not have been produced with an actual minor here is what the court said on this matter the government would have us read the cppa not as measure suppressing speech but as law shifting the burden to the accused to prove the sp eech is lawful in this connection the government relies on an affirmative defense under the statute which allows defenda nt to avoid conviction for nonpossession offenses by showing that the materials were produced using only adults and were not otherwise distributed in manner conveying the impression that they depicted real children see 18 usc 2252ac the government raises serious constitutional difficulties by seeking to impose on the defendant the burden of proving his speech is not unlawful an affirmative defense applies only after prosecution has begun and the speaker must himself prove on pain of felony conviction that his conduct falls within the affirmative defense in cases unde r the cppa the evidentiary burden is not trivial where the defendant is not the producer of the work he may have way of establishing the identity or even the ex istence of the actors if the evidentiary issue is serious problem for the government as it asserts it will be at least as difficult for the innocent po ssessor the statute moreover applies to work created before 1996 and the producers them selves may not have preserved the records necessary to meet the burden of proof failure to establish the defense can lead to felony conviction we need not decide however whether th government could impose this burden on speaker even if an affirmative defense can save statute from first amendment challenge here the defense is incomplete and insufficient even on its own terms it allows persons to be convicted in some instances where they can prove children were not exploited in the production defendant charged with possessing as opposed to distributin g proscribed works may not defend on the ground that the film depicts only adult actors see ibid so while the affirmative defense may protect movie producer from prosecution for the act of distribution that same producer nd all other persons in the subsequent distribution chain could be liable for possessing the prohibited work furthermore the affirmative defense provides protection to persons who produce speech by using computer imagin g or through other means that do not involve the use of adult actors who appear to be minors see ibid in these cases the defendant can demonstrate children were harmed in producing the images yet the affirmative defense would not ba r the prosecution for this reason the affirmative defense cannot save the statut for it leaves unprotected substantial amount of speech not tied to the governments interest in distinguishing images produced using real children from virtual ones19 in the third paragraph of this quota tion the court notes that the cppas affirmative defense is not available to defendants charged with possessing as opposed to distributing proscribed works and is not available to defendants charged with producing material using computer ima ging or through other means that do not involve the use of adult actor s who appear to be minors20 but if congress expanded the affirmative defense to include these two classes of defenda nts the cppa mighthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31499crs6 21id at 1404 previously quoted in the text accompanying note 16 supra 22id at 1407 23id at 1405 24id at 1406still be unconstitutional an affirmative defense that applied to defendants charged with possession offenses or to producers of older works might violate due process because such persons might as the court noted in the second paragraph of the above quotation have way of establishing the identity or even the existence of the actors if such persons had way of establishing their innocence then the affirmative defense would ffectively not be available to them and the government would still apparently in vi olation of the first amendm ent suppress lawful speech as means to suppress unlawful speech21 justice thomas in his concurring opi nion wrote the court does leave open the possibility that more complete affirmative defense could save statutes constitutionality see at 1405 implicitly accepting that some regulation of virtual child pornography might be constitutional i would not prejudge however whether more complete affirmative defense is the only way to narrowly tailor criminal statute that prohibits the possession and dissemination of virtual child pornography22 he does not however suggest any other way the court concluded in sum 2256 8b covers materials beyond the categories of unprotected speech recognized in ferber child pornography using an actual child and miller obscenity and the reasons the government offers in support of limiting the freedom of speech have justification in our precedents or in the law of the first amendment23 it added that the prohibitions of 22568d as well as of 22568b are overbroad and unconstitutional24 constitutionality of pending bills the 107th congress bills that would continue to ban some child pornography that was produced without the use of an actual child are as noted above hr 4623 s 2511 and s 2520 hr 4623 was identical to s 2511 but was amended by the house judiciary committee and reported on june 24 2002 hr rep 107526 and passed by the house without further amendment on june 25 2002 the three bills are in broad outline s imilar all contain similar features that appear unconstitutional and othe r similar features that ppear constitutional this report considers these features of the bills in general terms for more detailed sectionbysection analysis of the bills see constitutionality of 107th congress legislation to ban child pornography produced without an actual minor this is crs generaldistribution memorandum by the present author dated july 2 2002 limiting the types of child nography that would be banned hr 4623 as passed by the house would amend paragraph b of the definition of child pornography quoted at page 2 above so that it longer would includehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31499crs7 25every reference to hr 4623 from this point on is to the bill as passed 26hr 4623 would define prepubescent child as 1 one whose physical development indicates the child is 12 years of age or ounger or 2 one who as depicted does not exhibit significant pubescent physical or sexual maturationany visual depiction that is or appear s to be of minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct but would include only any visual depiction that is computer image or computergenerated image that is or is indistinguishable from that of minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct25 thus hr 4623 unlike the cppa would ban depictions only if they appear on computer and only if they are virtually indistinguishable from images of actual nors engaging in sexually explicit conduct hr 4623 would also provide for purposes of the new paragraph b of the definition of child pornography new defi nition of sexually explicit conduct whereas for purposes of paragraphs c and d of the definition of child pornography the phrase sexually explic it conduct would continue to mean actual or simulated sexual inte rcourse bestiality masturbation sadis tic or masochistic abuse or lascivious exhibition of the ge nitals or pubic area of any person it would mean for purposes of the new paragraph b of the definition of child pornography each of these sexual activitie s in actual or lasc ivious simulated form hr 4623 thus would ban depicti ons of simulated sexual activities only if they were lascivious and for depictions of simulate d sexual intercourse to be lascivious the new definition of sexually explicit conduct applicable to the new paragraph b of the definition of child pornography provides th at the genitals breast or pubic area of any person would ve to be exhibited the provision does not distinguish male from female breasts this limitation on the meaning of lascivious would apply only to simulated sexual intercourse nd not to simulations of other types of xually explicit conduct hr 4623 would also enact new 18 usc 1466a that would make it crime knowingly to produce distribute r eceive or possess visual depiction that is or is indistinguishable from that of prepubescent child engaging in sexually explicit conduct26 it appears that the word indistinguishable would generally apply to computergenerated pornography and not to pornography that uses actors over 18 years of age as such actors would seem rarely if ever to be indistinguishable from prepubescent children section 1466a by prohibiting subset of child pornography would apparently be redundant except as to the penalties that could be imposed section 5b would prescribe th sentence applicable to these sections under the sentencing guidelines s 2511 is similar to hr 4623 as pa ssed regarding the above provisions none of the above limitations in and of themselves w ould appear to make hr 4623 or s 2511 constitutional to the exte nt that they would ban nonobscene child pornography that does not portray an actual child engaging in sexually explicit conduct this is because the court in ashcroft v free speech coalition held it unconstitutional to prohibit any nonobscene material that does not portray an actual child engaging in sexually explicit conduc t the decision provided exception for material that is virtually indistinguishable from child pornography for material thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31499crs8 27previously quoted in the third paragr aph of the text accompanying note 19 supra 28id see note 9 supra 29id the reason that this was the case under the cppa is that the affirmative defense required the defendant to prove that each acto r was an adult at the time the material was producedappears on computer for material that is scivious or for materi that depicts pre pubescent children s 2520 would include different limitation as to the child pornography that it would ban it would define child pornography to include visual depictions that are of minor or an individual who appears to be minor actually engaging in specified sex acts and that lack serious literary artistic political or scientific value this new definition would be unconstitutional to the extent that it would prohibit material that was produced without using minor and that was not obscene the fact that such material lacked serious literary artistic political or scientific value would mean that it would satisfy the third prong of the threepronged miller test for obscenity to be obscene however ma terial would also have to appeal to the prurient interest and be patently offensive providing new affirmative defense the affirmative defense in the cppa provided that defendant may avoid conviction by proving that each person used in producing the alleged child pornography was an adult and that the defendant did not advertise promote present describe or distribute the mate rial in such manner as to convey the impression that it is or contains visual depiction of minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct hr 4623 would require th defendant to prove that the alleged offense did not involve the use of minor the defendant would longer have to prove anything with regard to the matter of advertising promoting presenting describing or distributing the material the change from having to prove that the actors were adults to having to prove that they were not minors would be significant because the former requirement as the supreme court noted in ashcroft meant that the affirmativ defense provided protec tion to persons who produce speech by using computer imaging or thr ough other means that do not involve the use of adult actors who appear to be minors27 s 2511 is similar to hr 4623 as passed regarding its affirmative defense in ashcroft the court found the affirmative fense in the cppa incomplete and insufficient for two reasons 1 defendant charged with possessing as opposed to distributing proscribed works may not defend on the ground that the film depicts only adult actors28 and 2 the affirmative defense provides protection to persons who produce speech by using computer imaging or through other means that do not involve the use of adu lt actors who appear to be minors29 that would not be the case under hr 4623 or s 2511 but this would not necessarily mean that these bills would be constitutional as the court in ashcroft did not say that fixing these two problems would be sufficient rather it said that it need not decidehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31499crs9 30previously quoted in the second paragr aph of the text accompanying note 19 supra 31previously quoted in the text accompanying note 16 which indicates that this statement was response to the governments argument that ban on virtual child pornography should be permitted because as imaging technology improves it becomes more difficult to prove that particular picture was produced using actual children 32see note 9 supra 33if defendant can prove that the material was not produced with an actual minor then it would not matter whether the material was pr oduced only with adults or was computer generated and if the defendant can prove that the material was produced only with adults he would thereby also prove that it was not pr oduced with an actual minor therefore the bills option to prove that the material wa s produced only with adults seems superfluous whether the government could impose on speaker the burden of proving his innocence and it wrote where the defendant is not the producer of the work he may have way of establishing the identity or even the exis tence of the actors if the evidentiary issue is serious problem for the government as it asserts it will be at least as difficult for the innocent possessor th statute moreover applies to work created before 1996 and the producers them selves may not have preserved the records necessary to meet the burden of proof failure to establish the defense can lead to felony conviction30 all these facts would remain the case under hr 4623 and s 2511 defendant other than producer might not be able to prove that minor was not used in the production of child pornography whet her it was produced with adult actors or computergenerated and even producer might not be able to prove this with regard to material that predated the cppa though the court left open whether prosecutions in either of these instances would be constitutional it did say that the government may not suppre ss lawful speech as means to suppress unlawful speech31 the affirmative defense in hr 4623 and s 2511 would arguably not prevent the bills from suppressing lawful speech in some cases s 2520 would amend the affirmative defe nse in the cppa similarly to the way that hr 4623 and s 2511 would s 2520 w ould 1 make the affirmative defense apply to all five paragraphs of 18 usc 2252aa instead of just the first four thereby making it available to possession offenses32 2 allow the defendant to prove either that the material was produced only with adults or that it was not produced with an actual minor thereby making the ffirmative defense app licable to virtual child pornography33 and 3 remove the requirement that the defendant prove that he did not advertise promote present desc ribe or distribute the material in such manner as to convey the impression that it is or contains visual depiction of minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct the first and second of these changes w ould eliminate the two reasons that the court in ashcroft found the affirmative defense in the cppa incomplete and insufficient 1 defendant charged with possessing as opposed to distributing proscribed works may not defend on the ground that the film depicts only adult actors and 2 the affirmative defens provides protection to persons whohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31499crs10 34previously

note 16 supraproduce speech by using computer imaging or through other means that do not involve the use of adult actor s who appear to be minors34 to this extent s 2520 is similar to s 2511 and hr 4623 as passe d but the courts comment about the cppas affirmative defense would apparen tly apply to s 2520 as it would to the other two bills where the defendant is not the producer of the work he may have way of establishing the identity or even the existence of the actors35 as noted above the court did not decide whether this fact would render the cppas affirmative defense unconstitutional but if s 2520s affirmative defense would effectively be unavailable to class of defendants then s 2520 would appear to suppress lawful speech as m eans to suppress unlawful speech36 and therefore be unconstitutional prohibiting conduct ot her than possession both hr 4623 and s 2511 would repeal 18 usc 22568d which is the part of the definition of child pornography that makes it crime to mail transport receive distribute reproduce sell or posse ss material that is not necessarily child pornography but that is adve rtised promoted presente d described or distributed in such manner that conveys the impre ssion that it is this provision was held unconstitutional in ashcroft hr 4623 and s 2511 however would reenact this provision in different form as new s ection 2252b subsection of section 2252b would make it crime to offer agree attempt or cons pire to provide or sell visual depiction to another nd who in connection therewith knowingly advertises promotes presents or describes the visual piction with the intent to cause any person to believe that the material is or contains visual depiction of minor engaging in sexually explicit conduc t subsection b of the new section would make it crime to offer agree attempt or conspire to receive or purchase from another visual depiction that one believes to be or to contain visual depiction of minor engaging in sexually explicit conduc t subsection c of the new section would provide it is not required element of any offense under this section that any person actually provi sell receive purchase possess or produce any visual depiction the substance of subsection c seems imp licit in subsections and b and may have been included solely for the sa ke of clarity both section 22568d which hr 4623 and s 2511 would repeal and the new section 2252b could apply to material that is not child pornography the most significant difference between the two sections appears to be that secti on 22568d in conjunction with section 2252a outlaws various acts including distri buting or possessing material that was advertised as child pornography whethe r or not it was child pornography whereas the new section would outlaw merely attempts to provide or sell visual depiction by advertising it as child pornography whet her or not it is child pornography or even exists this means that the new pr ovision would not outlaw possession of any materialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31499crs11 37hr rep 107526 at 23 2002 38stanley v georgia 394 us 557 568 1969 39osborne v ohio 495 us 103 1990the committee report accompanying hr 4623 draws an analogy to criminalizing an individual offering to provide or sell illegal drugs even where the offeror does not actually have drugs in hand37 another analogy might be situation where the offeror does not even intend to sell illegal drugs but makes fraudulent offer yet banning such conduct would not seem unconstitutional the court in ashcroft found secti on 22568a unc onstitutional b ecause materials falling within the proscription are tainted and unlawful in the hands of all who receive it though they bear responsibility for how it was marketed sold or described the provision prohibits sexually explicit film containing youthful actors just because it is placed in box suggesting prohibited movie possession is crime even when the possessor knows the movie was mislabeled new section 2252b by contrast would not punish possession but only providing and selling it would therefore appear to be constitutional even when child pornography was provided or sold s 2520 has similar provision it would make it crime to advertise promote present describe distribut or solicit any material in manner that conveys the impression that th material is or contains an obscene visual depiction of minor engaging in xually explicit conduct this language is virtually identical to subparagraph 2256 8d however like hr 4623 and s 2511 it would differ from subparagraph 22568d in that it would not outlaw possession of any material therefore it would also appear to be constitutional banning obscene material depicting prepubescent child hr 4623 but neither of the senate bills would enact new 18 usc 1466b that would make it crime knowingly to produce distribute receive or possess visual depiction of any kind in cluding drawing cartoon sculpture or painting that 1 depicts prepubescen t child engaging in sexually explicit conduct and 2 is obscene it is not required element of any offense under this section that the prepubescent child depi cted actually existe d section 1466b by prohibiting subset of obscenity would pparently be redundant except as to the penalties that could be imposed section 5b would prescribe the sentence applicable to these sections unde r the sentencing guidelines possible constitutional problem with section 1466b is its prohibition of possession of obscene material the supr eme court has held that even though obscenity is not protected by the first amendment there is constitutional right to possess obscene material in the privacy of ones own home38 but that there is constitutional right to possess child pornography in the privacy of ones own home39 section 1466b would cover material that is both child pornography and obscene so which rule would apply the material that it would cover would include both child pornography produced with an actual chil d and child pornography produced without an actual child with the former bein g unprotected speech and the latter beinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31499crs12 40id at 109 41id at 111

would be unprotect ed and possession of the latter in ones home would be protected in addition the court in osborne v ohio in holding that there is constitutional right to possess child pornography in the privacy of ones own home appeared to rely primarily on th governmental interest in deterring the use of children as subjects of pornographic materials40 and this interest is not present with respect to child pornogra phy produced without an actual child osborne v ohio also mentioned that evidence suggests that pedophiles use child pornography to seduce other children into sexual activity41 and the governmental interest in deterring this conduct is present with respect to child pornography produced without an actual child but ashcroft found this interest not to be legitimate basis to ban such material thus to the extent that hr 4623 would ban possession in ones home of child pornogra phy produced without an actual child it would seem to be unconstitutional denying child pornography to minors hr 4623 would make it crime to provi or show to person below the age of 16 years any visual depiction that is or is indistinguishable from that of prepubescent child engaging in sexua lly explicit conduct any obscene matter or any child pornography material in th first category would not necessarily be obscene and would not cons titute child pornography under ferber if it did not depict an actual child nevertheless this provision would apparently be constitutional because it would not restrict adults access to speech and the supreme court has recognized that there is compelling interest in shielding minors from the influence of literature that is not obscene by adult standards42 s 2511 contains similar provision s 2520 would prohibit providing minor person under 18 not as in hr 4623 nd s 2511 person under 16 with any visual depiction that is or appears to be of minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct it would appear to be constitutional for the same reason that the comparable provisions of hr 4623 and s 2511 w ould appear to be constitutional conclusion in ashcroft v free speech coalition the supreme court declared unconstitutional the child pornography preven tion act of 1996 to the extent that it prohibited material that wa s produced without the use of an actual child the only possible means that the court explicitly left open for congress to try to restrict such material was to ban it but allow an affirmative defense that the material was produced without using actual children ev this approach the court did not say would be constitutional but merely found need to d ecide whether it would behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31499crs13 this approach would shift the burden of proof to the defendant on the question of whether actual children were used in producing the material if the defendant could not meet the burden of proof then he could be punished for child pornography that might or might not have been produced with an actual minor the court however said that the government ma not suppress lawful speech as means to suppress unlawful speech this suggests that an affirmative defense would be unconstitutional if it were not effectively available to all classes of defendant it might not effectively be available how ever to individuals charged with mere possession of child pornography or to produ cers of pornography that predated the cppa as these defendants might have way of establishing the identity or even the existence of the actors the three bills that this report has examined hr 4623 as passed by the house s 2511 and s 2520 would all ba n child pornography produced without the use of an actual child though all three b ills would allow an affirmative defense to the extent that they applied to defenda nts who had way of establishing the identity or even the existence of the actors they raise the same questions that the court in ashcroft posed as to the constitutionality of such an approach though the bills would permit defendant to prove that minors were used rather than as under the cppa that only adult actors were used this would not appear to eliminate this problem and some defe ndants might be convicted for conduct involving lawful speech some provisions of the bills however app ear constitutional all three bills for example would ban attempts to distribut material in manner that conveys the impression that it depicts minor engaging in sexually explic it conduct whether or not it does this proscription unlike the one that the court struck down in ashcroft would not ban any material itself but w ould ban only attempts to distribute such material all three bills would also ma ke it crime to provide minors with child pornography whether or not it was produced w ith an actual child this would appear constitutional because the court has found there to be compelling interest in shielding minors from any pornography
