resources science and industry division updated march 30 2004 abstract this report examines the effects of an alaska natural gas pipeline on the us current account balance order code rs21787 march 30 2004 crs report for congress received through the crs web foreign trade effects of an alaskan natural gas pipeline robert pirog analyst in energy economics and policy resources science and industry summary httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21787 the energy information administration eia in the annual energy outlook 2004 aeo projects increased demand for imported natural gas through 2025 the aeo reference case forecast assumes natural gas pipeline will begin delivering alaskan natural gas to the lower 48 state consuming markets in 2018 hr 6 the omnibus energy bill contains provisions to enhance the future supply of natural gas through construction of pipeline this report examines the effects of an alaska natural gas pipeline on the us current account balance the eia finds that if the pipeline is not constructed natural gas prices will increase markets will adjust and imports of natural gas will increase however due to price induced market adjustments the increase in imports is projected to be less than the gas volume lost from the lack of pipeline construction as result if pipeline is constructed the effect on the current account balance will be less than the value of the amount of gas that was projected to be delivered through pipeline this report will not be updated background this report examines the policy implications for the us current account balance of the construction of natural gas pipeline from alaska to the lower 48 states the 108th congress has included in hr 6 the omnibus energy bill provisions which provide incentives for the construction of an alaska natural gas pipeline pipeline would link currently unavailable alaskan gas supplies to the consuming market this report analyzes the possible expansion or contraction of natural gas imports as result of constructing or not constructing an alaskan pipeline within the framework of the national energy modeling system nems1 nems is used by the eia as tool to forecast future energy 1 for full description of the structure and use of nems see energy information administration the national energy modeling system an overview 2003 march 2003 pp173 congressional research service the library of congress crs2 trends as included in the aeo2 recently the eia has published analyses of variety of restricted natural gas supply scenarios including the nonavailability of an alaska natural gas pipeline3 market forecast the aeo reference case forecast is the eias baseline estimate of the state of energy markets in the out years to 20254 the reference case forecast projects natural gas prices to be high enough after 2009 to begin construction of an alaska natural gas pipeline5 in the forecast natural gas deliveries come on stream from pipeline in 2018 with full capacity deliveries becoming available near the end of the forecast period in 2024 if policy based incentives to construct pipeline become available it is possible that pipeline might be constructed sooner than in the aeo reference case altering the results presented in this report as result of the construction and delivery time line assumed in the reference case the forecasts with and without the construction of pipeline are virtually identical until 2018 this report will examine differences in the forecasts for the years 2020 and 20256 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21787 to focus on the international trade effects of the pipeline likely variations in the current account balance in 2020 and 2025 will be calculated the current account balance is basic measure of nations foreign trade position and is defined as the nations exports of goods and services minus the nations imports of goods and services when nations exports exceed its imports the country has current account surplus when nations imports exceed its exports the nation has current account deficit the eia forecasts do not include estimates of the cost of constructing the pipeline or any trade effects that might come about as result of sourcing decisions for the steel and other goods and services used in the construction process the current account balance effects described in this report are limited to the natural gas that pipeline would deliver to the market current account effects in the aeo reference case an alaska natural gas pipeline is expected to deliver approximately 2 trillion cubic feet tcf about 7 of yearly consumption of gas per year 2 energy information administration annual energy outlook 2004 with projections to 2025 january 2004 3 energy information administration analysis of restricted natural gas supply cases february 2004 4 the aeo forecast is not prediction of what will happen in the future rather it is projection of what could happen if policies and trends in place today remained in effect and if additional policies or trends affected outcomes 5 while the aeo reference case assumes that natural gas pipeline will begin construction in 2009 and come on stream in 2018 this assumption is based solely on private sector economic decisions because there is policy in place as of january 2004 to provide incentives to construct pipeline the forecast does not include public incentives to construct pipeline 6 gas volume data is expressed in trillion cubic feet tcf and prices are expressed in 2002 dollars to control for estimated inflation crs3 by the time it reaches full capacity operation in 2024 although deliveries are forecast to begin in 2018 they are expected to begin at approximately 08 tcf per year and grow to full capacity by 2020 the reference case forecast projects gap between total domestic production 2389 tcf and total demand 3036 tcf requiring imports of 647 tcf the forecast projects that by 2020 pipeline natural gas imports from canada will be in decline compared to 2003 level the us imported 34 tcf of natural gas from canada in 2003 about 97 of import requirements by 2020 canadian imports are expected to decline to 25 tcf even though total us import requirement will have nearly doubled over 2003 levels the reference forecast projects that essentially all of the additional us import requirements will come from liquefied natural gas lng the values cited in the forecast are determined in conjunction with the forecast wellhead price of natural gas in 2020 which is expected to reach 428 per thousand cubic feet in real terms which would be over 800 per thousand cubic feet in nominal terms7 by 2025 the reference case projects total domestic production to reach 2409 tcf and total demand to reach 3133 tcf with gap of 724 tcf to be filled by imports in 2025 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21787 canadian pipeline imports are projected to be 256 tcf with lng again filling most of the remaining import gap the reference case forecast projects lng demand growing from 216 tcf in 2010 to 414 tcf in 2020 and 48 tcf in 2025 by 2025 the reference case projects wellhead natural gas price of 440 per thousand cubic feet in real terms translating to nominal price of about 8408 in contrast to the reference case forecast the pipeline case assumes that natural gas pipeline from alaska is not constructed as result alaskan natural gas production which totaled about 051 tcf in 2003 is projected to rise to 072 tcf in 2020 and 051 tcf in 2025 less than the 229 tcf and 271 tcf for the same years in the reference case9 since imports are expected to fill the gap between us domestic production and total demand simple analysis might suggest that the pipeline case would show an approximate 2 tcf increase in imports to compensate for delivery of alaskan gas this is not the case however the unavailability of alaskan natural gas through the pipeline leads to price increases in the natural gas market these price increases reduce the total demand for natural gas as well as providing an incentive for producers both in the us and canada to increase production as result of these adjustments the gas not available because of lack of pipeline from alaska is not replaced by imports on one to one basis in the eia analysis the increases in imports attributable to the lack of natural gas pipeline from alaska are 072 tcf in 2020 and 063 tcf in 2025 as projected in the eia pipeline case to determine the effect of these projected increases in natural gas imports these quantities 7 energy information administration analysis of restricted natural gas supply cases february 2004 pp 3537 tables c2 c3 8 ibid 9 part of alaskan natural gas supply is exported to japan in the form of lng the 68 billion cubic feet per year liquefaction terminal at kenai alaska has been exporting to japan for over 30 years source the energy information administration the global liquefied natural gas market status and outlook december 2003 p11 crs4 must be multiplied by appropriate prices the eia publishes import prices as part of the aeo reference case but not for the pipeline case as an approximation of the import price in the pipeline case crs has computed prices based on the eia reference case prices10 for 2020 the estimated import price is 481 per thousand cubic feet and for 2025 it is 490 per thousand cubic feet based on these values for price and quantity of imported natural gas estimated increases in the value of natural gas imports as result of lack of construction of pipeline would be approximately 346 billion in 2020 and 309 billion in 202511 to put these projected increases in imports in perspective they are less than 1 of the current account deficit in 2002 the year to which the price of natural gas is set in the eia forecasts although these values represent potential increases in the current account deficits in 2020 and 2025 or reductions in the surpluses they might well be either increased or decreased by other related effects in the economy that might result from higher projected natural gas prices for example industrial demand for natural gas is projected to decrease this could mean that the us production of chemicals especially those that have natural gas as large cost component might be reduced this might mean greater imports of fertilizers and other chemicals bringing additional pressure on the current httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21787 account balance on the other hand if the higher natural gas prices resulted in general reductions in income and employment in the united states that might imply lower imports of consumer goods and services improving the current account balance the eia analysis which focuses on energy issues does not provide detailed picture of all the secondary economic effects of higher natural gas prices as they alter relationships in the economy as whole analysis an alaska natural gas pipeline is projected to account for about 2 tcf of delivered gas in 2025 when operating at full capacity but imports increase by only 063 tcf in that year as result of the lack of pipeline construction in 2020 pipeline is projected to deliver about 16 tcf reflecting the buildup of delivered gas as operation begins in 2018 but imports increase by only 072 tcf in the forecasts if pipeline is constructed it might appear that 137 tcf of gas in 2025 and almost 1 tcf in 2020 has disappeared the lost volumes can be accounted for by examining the effects of the higher projected prices of natural gas in 2025 and 2020 on aggregate demand and supply as likely result of higher prices projected natural gas demand is lower in the pipeline case both in 2025 and in 2020 aggregate demand is 071 tcf lower in 2025 and 062 tcf lower in 2020 compared to the reference case in 2025 comparison of demand patterns in the reference case and the alaska pipeline case all sectors reduce their 10 over the six year period 2020 to 2025 the average projected price premium for imported prices over lower 48 state wellhead prices was 6 in the reference case i applied 6 premium to lower 48 state wellhead prices to obtain approximate import prices in the pipeline case the estimated prices may be somewhat downward biased because the increased volume of imports in the pipeline case might raise the market price of imported gas over the historic premium 11 energy information administration analysis of restricted natural gas supply cases february 2004 pp 3537 4042 tables c2c3c5c6 crs5 consumption but the largest declines are in the industrial and electric generators at 011 tcf 1 and 031 tcf 37 respectively in comparison the residential and commercial sectors reduced their consumption by only 006 tcf 05 in total fuel switching and reduced demand due to curtailed production are likely explanations for the relatively larger reductions in the industrial and electric generator sectors the pattern of reduced consumption is similar in 2020 residential and commercial consumption each decline about 1 while industrial demand declines by about 2 and demand from electric generators falls by 27 on the production side of the market because of the incentive of higher prices domestic onshore and offshore production of natural gas in the lower 48 states increases by 023 tcf in 2020 and 067 tcf in 2025 for 2025 if the reduced demand of 071 tcf is added to the increased lower 48 states production of 067 tcf the total is 138 tcf if 138 tcf is added to the extra imports of 063 tcf the total is approximately equal to the 2 tcf that is not delivered through an alaskan pipeline for 2020 the reduction in demand is 072 tcf and the added production projected from onshore and offshore production in the lower 48 states is 028 tcf which when added equals 1 tcf imports are projected to httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21787 increase by 072 tcf in 2020 which when added to the 1 tcf demand reduction and lower 48 state increased production equals 172 tcf which again is approximately equal to the amount of gas not delivered as result of construction of an alaska pipeline12 conclusion in the aeo reference case an alaska natural gas pipeline is projected to begin deliveries in 2018 and achieve full capacity delivery of about 2 tcf of gas per year to market when it achieves full capacity operation in 2025 this quantity of natural gas subtracted from the market in the pipeline case is sufficient to alter projected market prices in the pipeline case increases in the price of natural gas cause changes in consumption and production of gas as well as the composition of gas sources these price changes and resultant changes suggest that in the forecast energy markets compensate for the lack of alaskan gas supplies in variety of ways as result the forecast increase in gas imports is not as great as the loss in deliveries from the pipeline if it is not constructed 12 ibid
