definition of gift under congre ssional rules includes specifically the gift of free meal2 and there is general exemption under the house or senate rules for the acceptance of free meals3 while there

gifts of any value even under 10 the ethics and standards bodies in the senate and house both cite to the concern of the late senator paul douglas expressed in his work ethical standards in government that even small gratuities can be significant if they are repeat ed and come to be expected 5 gift to spouse and to other family mbers of the member officer or employee are considered as gifts to the member and thus would come within the restrictions and limitations if the gift is given with th knowledge and acquiescence of the member officer or employee and when the member officer or employee has reason to believe the gift was given because of his or her official position6 although gift to spouse or child may be an imputed gift to the member when food or refreshments are offered simultaneously same time and place to both member officer or employee and his or her spouse or dependent only the food provide d to the member officer or employee will be considered gift for the purpose of figu ring the value of such gift under the rules that is the amounts will not be aggregated7 changes in the rules of the house were adopted in 2003 relative to food sent by an outside private source to congressional offi ce for the consumption by the staff this perishable food amendment provides that the value of such food sent by an outside private source to congressional office for the staff will be prorated among the employees sharing the items to determine if such valu is less than 50 per staff employee rather than having the entire amount attributable to the employing member as previously done8 the house committee on standards of official conduct has advised offices however that the identity of the donor and th value of the food must be determined to remember that the aggregate value of gifts one may accept from any one source in calendar year is 9999 of gifts of 10 or more and even if under 10 freque nt or repetitive gifts from the same source are imp ermissible that because of the illegal gratuity clause of the bribery law food mu st be refused entirely if the person offering it has direct interest in the particular legi slation or other official business on which staff is working at the time and that gifts may not be solicited9 in the senate the total value of such food delivered to senate office is considered gift to the supervising senator10 in addition to the

cost of refresh ments one is consuming relatives one of the major categories of exemption from the strict gifts prohibitions are gifts from and between ones relatives the definitions of relative in the congressional rules incorporate the extensive list stated in the ethics in government act and specifically includes ones fiancé or fiancee12 personal friendship the house and the senate gift bans seeking not to unduly interfere with normal family and personal rela tionships allow the receipt and exchange of gifts on the basis of personal friendship as well as those from and between family members13 if gift made on the basis of pe rsonal friendship is to exceed 250 in value however the member officer or employee must get written determination from the house committee on standards of official conduc t in the house or the senate select committee on ethics in the senate that the exception still applies14 in an effort not to create too large potential loophole within the gi fts rules by allowing one to merely claim that any giftgiver lobbyist or intere sted party is personal friend the rules establish somewhat more objective criteria or factors to be considered in determining whether particular gift qualifies as one which is made on the basis of personal friendship initially the member officer or employee must consider whether there has been history of personal friendship and gift exchange with this individual that is has the member also given gifts to this individual or have the gifts been all oneway toward the member or staffer secondly the memb er or staffer should consider whether the friend has himself or herself personally paid for the particular meal in question as opposed to having business pay for it or ving the expense reimbursed by some other entity or person or claiming tax deduction for the expense finally members and employees should consider whether similar free meals were given by this individual to other members or employees thus indicating that such gift had not necessarily been extended merely on the basis of personal friendship15 gifts of meals from lobbyists or othe rs who have partic ular interests in congressional legislation or wor k are singled out as examples of gifts where there is particular concern in distingu ishing between gifts that have been offered and given for business purpose rather than on the basis of personal friendship with the member or staffer the house committee on standards of official conduct fo r example has noted that such gifts from lobbyist when not paid for personally out of the lobbyists own pocket or when the member of cong ress or staffer have not themselves given gifts to this individual should not be accepted on the basis of the personal friendship exemptionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22231crs5 16 gifts and travel 106th congress 2d sess supra at 2021 17 house rule 25 cl 5a3p senate rule 35 cl 1c17 18 such expenses may not be accepted from lobbyists or from foreign agents house rule 25 cl 5b1a senate rule 35 cl 2a1 19 house rule 25 cl 5a3l senate rule 35 cl 1c13quite obviously where the offeror is lobbyist or someone else who has interests before congress members officers and employees have the most reason to be concerned about whether gift is offered for reason other than personal friendship in that circumstance the criteria set forth in the rule are especially helpful for example if the gift was paid for by business or will be charged to firm or corporate credit card as opposed to being paid for out of the offerors own pocket it is likely that the gift is based on business concerns rather than personal friendship footnote omitted likewise if in relationship all of the gifts have gone to the member or staff person and there has not been reciprocal gift giving it is likely that the gifts have business purpose thus where member or staff person is offered gift by lobbyist or someone who has interests before congress and either of these circumstances is present ie the gift is not paid for personally or there has not been reciprocal gift giving the official should not accept the gift on the basis of the personal friendship provision unless the gift is acceptable under another provision of the gift rule the member or staff person should either decline the gift or pay for it personally16 personal hospitality in addition to the exceptions for gifts from relatives and gifts made on the basis of personal friends hip the house and nate gift rules also exempt from the gift prohibitions certain gifts of personal
