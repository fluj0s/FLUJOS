shsbc 82 effective auditing lecture given on 9 november 1961 thank you thank you this is 9 nov russian year 9 nov kapluskov i invite your curiosity to the behavior of needle on the emeter there is only one thing that can make an emeter lie and that is bad auditor bad auditor can make an emeter lie we had some character running around the states about year ago and he couldnt read an emeter and he was asking everybody if theyd ever been paindrughypnotized and of course each one of these words fell on the meter he never bothered to compartment the question and it wasnt till i started proving to people conclusively that they had been paindrughypnotized by cats dogs mice and so forth that somebody woke up and said what do you know the auditor has something to do with making an emeter read right yeah he does and similarly you cannot get false goal or false terminal or false modifier or anything else on an emeter if you know how to run an emeter you just cant get one you couldnt push one off on an auditor you cant receive one the emeter tells you the truth in the matter for number of years we have had difficulty in auditing because auditors were very leery of actually believing an emeter thats because the auditor in practicing his skill uniformly had withholds and having withholds of course he didnt want any withholds off anybody else we got central organization right this minute its getting all nicely straightened out but we had somebody in the central organization as actually it was an auditor that was auditing staff fortunately it wasnt anybody important thats joke and this auditor just kept sitting there and kept sitting there and you know the needle would knock on withhold and the auditor wouldnt get the withhold and finally why the staff member was just getting worse and worse and feeling badder and badder about it all and so hco secretary took lance out of the umbrella stand couched it properly and went at solid charge in the direction of the association secretary and said what is this and the association secretary spoke to the director of processing and the director of processing mentioned it casually to the auditor and the next day it went right on happening why well that particular auditor and that particular director of processing had some mutual withholds from the organization not only would the auditor not get withhold off somebody else but of course with her partner in crime involved the partner in crime would not even force her to get withhold off somebody else so its lets all be down here in the mud with these nice withholds that is the motto of all of that interesting isnt it whenever you see somebody i just take this as forthright thing person refuses security check theyve got withholds see person that wont get withholds off another case has withholds that they have never divulged this is about the way it looks i mean its quite technical fact this particular hco secretary by the way had just written letter which i received this afternoon begging to come over here and let somebody give her one hundred percent run on joburg and get all of her withholds off completely so that she would have diffidence on this particular line and then let her go back and saw into the staff so that if it started out with just one person with withholds you see this would then get contagious which was an interesting suggestion i didnt take her up on it because class member here very shortly will be going back to that organization and they better have all their withholds off by the time they leave and everything will be fine you see how this goes though you see how this goes diffidence is based also on this fact it is accompanied by withholds because person wouldnt be this way unless they had withholds but they are very afraid of what they might hear from the pc and when they get very afraid of what they might hear from the pc they wont ask for withholds they might hear some gossip about themselves you see well pcs are always willing to oblige particularly on an auditor that cant security check well you say to the pc well all right now are you withholding anything oh yes yes im withholding the fact that yesterday in coffee shop why i heard three people talking about you huuhuuhuuhuu and these people said and im withholding it from you the hell he is he hasnt withheld it yet theres been lapse of time of about six hours between the incident and the session when did he have any time to withhold it oh when i hear somebody start that one i always can get pay dirt i can always get pay dirt because hes about to say i heard and i say good fine thank you very much now lets find out what you have been up to lately oh well thats something else haha well but i heard and actually i wont be able to get insession you see unless i get the well fine youre insession now whats the withhold now you would be utterly amazed how far you can go and what you can get away with in auditing you invalidate somebodys goal you invalidate somebodys terminal you upset somebody on the subject of his auditing progress in some way or another and you deserve to be shot thats for sure but you fail to accept the pcs answers you do these various things and its very upsetting to the pc he feels he cant talk to the auditor and so forth but how far can you go within the framework of these rules actually i dont invite you to do such tactic but we have been boxing around with withhold that keeps falling on an instant read and we cant get it do you know the pc feels better if the auditor even went as far as god damn it what is it do you know that the pc says uuuuh it was soandso and soandso and soandso you say thank you now good you see its the same thing as you would lay hands on pc if he tried to blow the room see the pc feels under control now you can ask you can persuade you can be quite forceful you dont have to be angry or upset im just giving you an extreme extreme extreme example but you can be very pressing on these things you know yes yes yes i know i know thats all very interesting but what did you do and the pc says there you know theres some session control around here by george you know id better not look up too much because theres liable to be controlled session going on here you have asked question you want to know what that fall is and the pc doesnt give it to you now the pc may not know may not know that is the time to be very helpful get your help valence on and you say all right now lets just sort this out you say you dont know what it is all right lets just sort this out and now you ask great variety of questions great variety of questions have you stolen anything from the firm and weve gotten knock and the pc says i dont know all right well lets just try like mad to help this pc sort it out lets dont immediately assume the pc is holding out on us and does know you see pc says he doesnt know he looks puzzled he looks little bit upset hes actually sitting there trying to figure it out now youre an auditor and you can tell when somebodys sitting there trying to figure it out so you help him out stolen something well could it have been property could it have been some item could it have been some perfectly worthless item could it have been some very valuable item what could it have been you see how about paper stationery stuff like that youre watching the meter all the time you see paper stat pong pong you say what the heck is that oh the person says oh yes ive ive been customarily taking sheets of paper home and i never realized it was stealing they could must have realized they were stealing you see or they wouldnt get knock on the emeter but there it is and there it is and you say well what was it well about it seems like for long time now ive been taking sheets of paper home and yes the first time i did it was long time ago i remember i did have twinge of conscience the first time i did it you know yeah all right you say good all right now have you stolen anything from the firm dead thats it now thats one proceeding you see youre being very helpful and you compartmented the question you see you know youve moved the question around that is to say have you stolen anything from the firm you know and we find out that it is just firm that is falling whats this about firm you know have you stolen anything is null whats this about firm firm what is this firm what else about this firm you see the pc says i dont know you help him out all right theres another point of view about all this see theres another point of view you say have you been cheating on your girlfriend you know and pc says and well good and you say theres fall here on the meter what could that be and he says well must be false must be on something else instant read and you say well have you been cheating on your girlfriend bang instant read see and he says nope and you say well come on tell about it and he says theres nothing there there is nothing there i have not as matter of fact i resent your inquiries into it because its accusative and you realize the auditors code doesnt permit you to be accusative i say well the auditors code isnt covered for the emeter emeter isnt bound by it i say all right now tell all about it now noi havent been and so on and i think its very mean of you to ask and actually youre trying to destroy my reputation and its probably something i heard about you and now all right thats fine what is this withhold right here about your girlfriend with whom have you been cheating on your girlfriend tell oh that its just nothing its fair i mean youre picking on just taking advantage of your position as an auditor all right tell now i want to know who is it oh sniffs isabel and you say good now do you feel better uh yes well i am but you really shouldnt be so accusative what else what other one you see youre justified there at that particular type of withhold because the fellow has gone into games condition with you and he doesnt think that you can do anything about it and that you wont do anything about it and he knows youre all bound down and you mustnt dare talk turkey to him but it requires some sense you know it takes some sense on your part it takes an ability to look at the pc and to estimate the situation and when you estimate the situation you have to make up your mind is this just willful heels or is this actual confusion or upset or what is this or is it the question which is almost on or its some part of the question thats reacting or is this pc just in fog from something else that has been going on in the session what is this all about the rudiments have just gone out crazily or something has happened here thats for sure we know something has happened and as an auditor we go ahead and take care of what happened but we cannot say the blanket solution to every time you get fall on the meter is to ask the question this way this way this way and you do it every time and so forth and its all here in the rule book and so forth it requires you it requires your participation in the session as the auditor it takes you now if you developed nice calloused dead mask in lieu of tr 0 if you think that tremendous deadness tremendous woodenness tremendous i will now repeat the auditing question one two three four thank you good thank you the next auditing question is see i sneer that is taking refuge back of ritual the ritual is for your use not for your protection if you need ritual why go to session with bulletproof vest on youll feel better but its all under the heading of all youve got to do is audit the pc you are auditing and the technology you have is to assist you to do that the rituals you have is to assist you to do that everything in scientology is to assist you to process the pc now for you to just throw your bare chest out against the howling north wind and say here i stand all alone naked and scathed personally processing this preclear oooooh thats pretty adventurous bulletproof vest protective screens pat textbook answer to fit every single turn of the road well just get brave thats all just get brave and sometime if you ever have tendency to just follow the ritual and be very wooden about the whole thing and never do anything offline and just go on down the line down the line down the line and never get curious about what the pc is doing and just sit there and reel it all out and give them the auditing questions and so forth and the needle knocks and you say ill repeat the auditing question and the needle knocks and ill repeat the auditing question the needle knocks and ill repeat the auditing question the needle knocks and ill repeat the auditing question and the needle knocks do you know after while somebody including the pc will begin to believe that time is stuck at that point you see how that could be well if you find yourself doing that sometime or another get brilliant idea you audit the pc for moment maybe your rudiments as an auditor are out but the way to get them in is just audit the pc audit that pc in that instant of time that you are covering right that moment the pc is going boohoohoo wowwowwow i dont want any more of this this is too much and so forth i cant face it now i just dont remember anything and its horrible and youre just torturing and so forth and so on and there doesnt seem to be textbook answer to all of this you know all of sudden sort of relax and look at the pc and look the situation over even if it takes little time pc wont forgive it but thats all right he wont give anything right now anyway and look it over and say what is going on and you know hes liable to tell you because you asked him you see you asked him thats different than ritual question just try it sometime the pc will all of sudden wake up and sort of come out of it and think it over and then tell you whats wrong and you go on and you clear the thing and youll find your session swings right on in do you know that with one single question which is heartfelt and meant by you you can put all rudiments in just like that its an interesting thing but there is substitute for live auditor theres just substitute for one and this is particularly true in security checking now when i say this to you it opens you up on perhaps some of you might get the idea that what i mean is that you should be sweet or you should be kind or you should be inviting or something of the sort there are times for the mailed fist in the auditors glove believe it might be time for you to get human as an auditor and express exactly what youre feeling about the thing and it might put the reality right back into the session you maybe have gone as far as this look joe youve been sitting here now for half an hour giving motivators dont you think its time you gave just one little teensy overt huh you know dont you think thatd be better proportion and you know the pc is liable to think it over and decide youre right and give you one and it starts the ball rolling now the odd part of it is is you can do any of that within the framework of modern auditing you dont have to throw all the rules away to suddenly become an auditor because actually if you are really auditing do you know the rules all go into place click clickclickclickclickclickclick thats whats interesting about it the more and better you know your business the easier it is to apply your trade and the more human you can be for instance i talk to pcs oh theres doubt about it occasionally i go too far they always come up shining at the other end of the session sometimes i go too far thats for sure look ive only got another half an hour to get this im trying to get your rudiments in now are you going to help or arent you thats going little bit too far see guy could be bowled over by that you think well lets just shortcut this whole thing and you tell exactly what you think is going wrong right here right now now what is going wrong right here right now what do you think is upset pc just oh uh well there isnt anything right now its what was going wrong all right all right fine well is there anything going wrong now well well there was something going wrong all right lets just lay that aside for the moment and carry on with this sec check in go the rudiments end of session of course you have to go back and clean it all up you know the more you the longer it takes you to end the session you realize that an auditor always pays for his sins in terms of end rudiments but do you know that there are times when you pay for your omissions you didnt commit any sins you werent direct enough you werent real enough you were just kind of wobbling around well have you ever raped anybody all right thank you all right i got fall there have you ever raped anybody it says here uh you uhthank you all right have you ever raped anybody okay all right heres the next question lets see what is it oh yeah have you ever sung in church yeah have you ever sung have you ever sung in church all right well we can skip that and you know the pc gets the idea that youre not doing anything he does pc does get that idea he gets the idea that youre not doing thing which i consider quite remarkable in view of the fact that of course youre in there industriously you know youre right in there pulling those withholds youre right in there looking down his throat you know exactly whats in the bank you know exactly what the emeters saying and you know where these questions are going and you know what youre trying to do with the pc of course out of such session he gets that idea doesnt he never he says well he says the mice could accumulate in the belfry and the cobwebs stretch across the door and not breath of air would ever stir the dust in this stygian gloom he doesnt even restimulate his withholds now of course you can be far too overwhumping with withholds ill show you how you really overwhump pc you say well have you ever sung in church reaction on the meter at all and he says you say well have you ever sung in church reaction on the meter he says i never have as matter of fact i never go to church and so on well have you ever sung in church well i and do you know you can have pc crying and sobbing in time if you keep that up do you know that you can get the pc actually sitting there shattered you can make people stammer you make people so they cant talk just with that kind of idiocy all right you say heres another way to do it have you ever sung in church pc says well yes i did once youre adjusting the meter you see have you ever sung in church pc says yes i did once you say good well have you ever sung in church um what is this reading here yeah all right were ready to begin now pc says begin how about this singing in church oh well that was just test question it didnt have too much to do with it youve set up withhold situation you have forced the pc to withhold see you can qanda with it so you force the pc to withhold well how by not accepting any of his answers so of course its all unintentional withholds now i wouldnt break out laughing or something when the pc gives you thing as matter of fact startled once by an auditor who looked all of sudden it had all been going you know it was the change of pace that did it you know all had been going about have you ever poured water down drain pipe thank you good all right now have you ever poured water up drain pipe thank you you know and have you ever washed any horses thank you and so forth and have you ever stolen any horses and so on and i said yes as matter of fact i have stole horse and the auditor said you did you know there was this tremendous gleam of interest you know it was all going along knocked about five feet out of the session last thing in the world i ever expected to happen though gradient scales are of use so if youre going to be interested in the pc be interested in the pc dont fade from complete interest to total disinterest to mild interest to vivid enthusiastic interest to interest and so forth if youre auditing pc just audit the pc because they recognize these things as quite false but you the auditor have rights too the pc suddenly comes up with one that is an incredible type of withhold that youve never heard of before nobody asked you to put on death mask at this point so it startles you but dont just leave the pc in the dark about this and then try to put on death mask afterwards you see the pc says yes well as matter of fact i rowed boat up drain pipe one time you know and you say you did oh really and the pc says well yes whats so unusual about that and you say well i was just startled did you row boat up drain pipe how did you do that well i did this soandso and soandso and suchandsuch and soandso and soandso and you say okay all right and he gets the illusion that he has satisfied this startled curiosity see because youve got to be satisfied to the degree that you were curious you see that those things are direct in their relationship i mean if youre going to say nooooo you know well at least get your acknowledgment up to that level of enthusiasm see well all right hey what do you know all right okay i really got that you know pitch your acknowledgment up to match the other you know you say you did kidding and then say all right now the funny part of it is it takes some auditor to make an auditing session some auditors have too much auditor there now the way you have too much auditor there however is simply distracting the pcs attention giving him change of pace startling things dropping the emeter fixing the cans while youre in session you know if an emeter goes out on you just for heavens sakes leave it alone dont even move it dont bother to look at it anymore but just leave it alone do you realize that your emeter all of sudden is out and your emeter isnt registering anymore and by the usual movements by which you regulate an emeter usual movements by which you regulate one you all of sudden see that is very very dirty meter dont even move your hand on it dont take the electrodes out of the pcs hands go on with the session as best you can that is it not another quiver out of you do you hear thats very important much more important than it would appear to be because emeters do go out pcs start gesticulating with electrodes they can pull the plug out and they can rip the connections up they can actually break wire they can do something of this sort and if you pay any attention to it well lets say the pc just tears up the emeter cans you know just rips them up rips them right out of the sockets and that sort of thing and hes sitting there with the emeter cans and he all of sudden notices the emeter cans are broken and he says whats this he says and so on why just say well thats all right and ask him the next question yeah but whats this the emeters busted just take them out of his hand and put them on the floor and go on with the session you see dont ever fix meter dont fiddle in session dont fiddle with ashtrays electric fans windows doors that sort of thing leave it alone if youre going to do something about something end the session just go right on into end rudiments end the session even though you do it rapidly and declare break and then go ahead and do what you please and adjust the doors and adjust the people rushing up and down the hall and adjust anything youve got to adjust you see and come back into session and open up brandnew session youll find that the break however is probably more upsetting than the disturbance and your fiddling with the emeter can cause that tone arm to go up as much as two divisions all of sudden you see the meter isnt working you see and you get over here and you start cranking it you know and you start balancing it and you its just about the worst thing you can do to pc now how do you run how do you run sec check how do you run sec check if with busted meter on very tough pc whos got lots of withholds and your meter busts and youre busy sec checking like crazy how do you do this well you dont thats easy and you say well do you think you have any more withholds on that and he says well so on and so on and so on and you say well well look into that right now id like to run some of your havingness and confront and here we go and we run some havingness and confront and so forth and finish off the session or if theres lot of session to go we simply end the session repair or get another meter and complete the sec check but we dont do it in the full flight of session we never distract the pcs attention out of the session see just dont do that now you can put the pcs attention on the auditor with an auditors interest because he realizes this is with him the way you knock the pc out is by irrelevancy you can be as interesting and as interested and so forth as you please as long as you are relevant to the session and what the pc is doing your interest your pressure your this your that anything of the sort as long as its relevant to what the pcs doing that is fine you can do almost anything you please you can actually get up to shout you can get down to whisper you can be terribly active you can be very histrionic without really upsetting the pc because its all relevant to his case now youll see this im sure what upsets the pc what upsets the pc is an irrelevancy to his case thats all that upsets pc it is not what you do it is how relevant your actions are now you start doing things which are not relevant to his case your watch is run down so you sit there fixing your watch while you audit him see and hell go blooey he lights cigarette in spite you start to light one irrelevant hell go blooey your attention is patently on the emeter not on him hell go blooey something wrong with the emeter you see its irrelevant its on the emeter not his case via the emeter you can inspect an emeter all you want to you see yes yes huhhuh yes oh yeah all right uhhuh okay lets see here now you say so are you sure that that is all there is on that question im looking at the meter here beware now im looking at the meter when you answer that all right have you ever swum up waterspout haha there it is hahaha yeah haha there it is hahahaha all right all right all right now you tell about that you tell it was an instant read too come on come on come on come on come on never affect pc never in million years hed say oooooh you know waterspout i did i did i did swim up waterspout and so forth i did oh gosh hoo when was that when was that its right here come on come on come on come on oh if it says there it must be there i wonder what it is and so forth now come on dont kid about it now dont monkey with it because i want to know right now right now come on give it now what is that im not giving you this as model im giving you this as rather corny auditing it wont upset him do all of that you say well lets see whats the meter reading here i mean whats the matter with the tone arm uhoh uhoh uhoh next thing you know the tone arm is reading at 50 and you say how did it get there well it got there because your attention was on something else rather than the pc his terminal demands attention and the only thing pc will not forgive is not getting any attention from the auditor and the auditor could practically dance jig as long as it was relevant to the pcs case the pc said well we used to have these dances you know we used to go up and down the temple floor this would be horribly corny auditing and the auditor can get up and say like this or like this and sit down in the chair again and the pc would be quite fascinated and say well it was actually like that it was actually like that first one you did yeah and hed go right on talking and telling you about it and so forth but the auditor has danced jig see it isnt what you do in session it is how relevant it is to his case as soon as you learn that you can shed few shackles in auditing you can feel little less braced little less plaster of paris model auditing you see if i twitch my left cheek little bit the plaster of paris will crack i mustnt permit my eyeballs to dilate more than an eighth of an inch because thats proper tr 0 im sure you could do all that like an indian some of the schools in india practicing hypnosis can stop or start blood from flowing from cut vein you know i heard about that in america one time and i was absolutely fascinated absolutely fascinated in chicago they rounded up every doctor in chicago who even was inspecting an indian who could make blood start and stop flowing from his veins its marvelous he could make the blood do this but what was fascinating is that america didnt know it could be done i didnt ever know it couldnt be done you see you can get several sides to every opinion see i was real startled because i didnt know it couldnt be done now youre similarly going to get startled someday at the fact that you ever had any trouble with auditing you know what you know i had some i was nervous about it or i was upset about it or i was diffident about it or id held myself in brace about it and so on its rather nonsensical and you feel quite natural while youre auditing drink cup of coffee audit i mean more effort either way because you gradually learned what you can get away with and what you cant get away with and you feel perfectly comfortable because thats it and you say to the pc what you think as long as its relevant to his case and isnt challenge to him you know an invalidation its pretty rough on pc when an auditor starts in on him on the basis well youve been creep all of your life how can you expect to level with now that sounds awful rough you know have you ever done one decent action in your whole life now tell have you have you have you ever just one tell one one one decent action youve done in your whole life so you see you cant all right now lets get the withholds off thatd be awful rough on pc wouldnt it well get your order of magnitude do you know that its ten times as rough on the pc for you to get rattled about your emeter and start fiddling with your meter as for you to do that get your perspectives in why because any crack you make at the pc believe it is attention that is attention for the pc youre interested in him and do you know that some pcs wont believe you and well susan hayward for instance hated like poison for long while years until one night i was in particularly vicious mood and she brought up some picture her husband was sitting there and her husband looked at and hed warned never to flatter this girl about her acting or anything she was very upset about it and i was feeling in very vicious mood and said it stunk the last one id seen you know almost that bluntly you know it stunk and she said what did you think was wrong with it particularly and i said you were false you know she was my friend forever afterwards she knew i was sincere she knew i was sincere that was her whole measure of whether or not somebody was her friend an enemy is somebody who flatters you friend is somebody who criticizes the living daylights out of you weve had people around occasionally one or two guys around and all i would do would just give them studied insult id never say hello to them i would say well i see somebody has left door open again and theyd get this immediate sensation he understands this sounds mad doesnt it but these are acceptance level remember the old acceptance level and person whos in grief will accept sad remark and person who is in degradation will accept the degrading remark the only reality is the reality of the tone scale on which theyre sitting well nobody asked you to compromise your reality im just calling to your attention that it isnt so much what the auditor does it is whether or not the auditor is being effective with his attention relevant to the pc is he being effective with his attention relevant to the pcs case and that is all pc ever demands of an auditor that hes effective and that his attention is relevant to the pcs case and thats what basically an auditor violates when he gets in trouble with the pc hes sitting there woodenly hes asking questions disinterestedly his attention is on something else the pc is aware of the fact that the auditor has an appointment at three oclock and that its getting toward three oclock and that the auditor has present time problem and the auditor keeps glancing toward the door and looking at his watch oh man if you want to form some arc breaks the whole pattern of arc breaks is actually totally on the basis of the pc ceases to believe that the auditors attention is relevant to his case and that is the whole background of arc breaks there is other background now were up there if you remember the philadelphia lectures the highest level is conviction all right well right up there that is above agreement that is above communication and mechanics and so forth that is belief the pc must stay convinced that the auditor is interested in auditing him and interested in auditing his case and auditing his case not necessarily interested at that point of the prehav scale but just auditing him effectively and the auditors attention is on the pc and as soon as that has been achieved by the auditor he gets more trouble with rudiments but its something to achieve and it is not anything very arduous to accomplish i assure you its not arduous to accomplish its very easy to accomplish the first requisite is if you know enough about the mind and if you yourself have enough reality on its mechanics then you are never debarred by the mystery of it all the pc doesnt look to you like big mystery he only looks to you like something that can be resolved you want to know the ramifications of the thing so that you can do something about it but if you yourself know the basics of how his mind operates you arent backed off to point where its all just total mystery and you go into disinterest if you know the actual mechanics of how he operates you know that he has engrams you know hes got time track and you know hes got circuits and hes got valences and you know these various mechanics you know how he responds to these you know the overt act motivator phenomena you know about goals terminals you know about these various things you can look at somebody theyre doing something well you can understand what theyre doing it must have something to do with some of these well this brings you immediately close enough to an understanding of the pc to form an arc with the pc its an arc thats formed but its formed by your understanding of the generalities of his difficulty he has generality of difficulty now your attention and interest is on the particularity of his difficulty the specific parts that refer to him out of your knowledge of the general picture the pc presents if you were comfortable and if you can go down the street and you see somebody gimping along and you know hes gimping along and hes having an awful time there and he seems to have great big bandage on his right foot you know an uninformed person looks at him and says somebody has injured his foot you look at him and dont tell you dont because i know that you do you look at him and you know that hes kicked somebody or hes stamped on somebodys toes at some time or another you see you know the basic mechanic the overt motivator sequence and he couldnt possibly have bunged up foot unless he was specialist in bunging up foots see therefore you arent invited into supersaccharine sympathy about it at all but if the fellow were to say to you you know i got an awfully bad foot you would be very happy to do something about his foot you know even if it was just look at my fingers you know and throw some somatics around for him why go through the histrionics of all right how did you hurt your foot well foot was run over by an automobile wheel and its been very bad and so forth you say all right stand there and kick an automobile wheel thank you kick an automobile wheel thank you kick an automobile wheel thank you you got some twentyfive percent chance of just knocking it out just like that see twentyfive percent you know its small percentage but youll get your percentage thats for sure give him touch assist do this and that you can do lots of things about this foot all right if you can do things about the foot then you arent in awe of this foot and you also can be interested in the foot without getting totally interiorized into the horrible mysteries of the foot and how horrible it was that he got this terribly bad foot and how could he possibly have gotten this foot isnt it terrible of the police department to drive the police van right straight across this mans foot and we ought to change the government shouldnt we see youre not off to the races here you know exactly whats wrong with the mans foot you say whats it feel like and he says well it just it feels like its in boot you know it just feels like its in great big boot and its not you know but it feels like its in great big lead boot well that communicates to scientologist it doesnt communicate to him youre in the favored position of knowing far more about it than he does now knowing that actually that alone just without your saying anything or doing anything that you know about that reflects immediately it forms superiority on your part where he is concerned you dont have to do anything from that point there on somebody who understands life can talk about life and other people know that he understands life even though they dont know what hes saying which is great oddity very possibly some of you at one time or another have been overheard in discussion with somebody or other and had somebody sort of looking at you kind of well they dont really know what youre saying and they dont really understand you maybe but they certainly know that you know what youre talking about i had fellow on an airplane one time some big company executive and somebody was chattering to some fourstriper in the navy and i was giving him very banal replies i was not trying to impress him even vaguely and this fellow sitting across from us he all of sudden it was in the bar and he was getting very interested and so on the guy next to him started to get very interested and they said something to each other and there were three or four people there four or five people there on the other side and theyd get talking to him and theyd look over they were listening to this conversation they were absolutely fascinated we werent talking about anything that had anything to do with the price of fish as far as i was concerned but this fourstriper had problems and all i was doing was giving some offhand advice you know hardly anything to bother with i was trying to explain to him few little minor things you know and these guys were looking at this you know they didnt understand what that was all about but they knew somebody knew something about life over there and finally one of them as he left say he says who are you and i laughed at him and went on back to my seat left him in total mystery but this sort of thing communicates to the pc because youre outside the pcs bank and are not being influenced directly by the pcs aberrations he of course recognizes even though youre equally trained he recognizes that you could know more about what hes doing than he does see he recognizes this instinctively its true you see now when you equally trained or better trained or worse trained or anything else are there and you are not looking and you are not interested in doing something about it in session that itself is an arc break just like that see hes been cut he realizes that you with your skill could get right on down there to the bottom of the pile and pull that bottom overt and thered be clinketyclank of breaking glass all over the place and you dont do it well actually it wouldnt matter how you did it as long as you did it and its quite interesting as long as you did it thats the only thing which he doesnt forgive is not doing it that he wont forgive people do not forgive auditing people do not forgive being ineffective they just dont forgive these things the best answer for it is to audit the pc yourself and always to some slight degree be effective now youve got enough tools and weapons now to be effective to the end of your days i mean you never catch up with the human race with how much you know now i mean the human race would never catch up with you i mean god elp us theres two billion five hundred million pcs out there right this minute there are wise men all over india there are hakims and sad apples and sufis and bugjumps and jujus and ama doctors and bums and tramps amongst the witchcraft and so on medicine men amongst the indians all this sort of thing and not one of these experts knows as much as you do about mind or about life not one of them you give them cards and spades and still whip them every time medical doctor says well theres something wrong every time this fellow every time we examine him he sits there and he starts to tremble and so forth and he starts to tremble every time they examine him and i wonder what this is is this locomotor nerves in the pocomocus and so forth and shouldnt we operate and snap couple of tendons or something here in order to keep him from going this way and so on you listen to some of the wildest balderdash well hes being the expert its quite remarkable you are diffident about it because youre so schooled to believe that hes the expert so schooled to believe that the man is interfering if youd have walked over to him slightly in his lingo and said the mans suffering from psychic trauma he probably has some reaction to an examination ask him if hes ever been an examiner and the medico says what oh but he says what very interestedly you must have said something there hes liable to be kind of nervous about you too you know but different entirely different atmosphere than what you would expect would arise from the situation because he knows he is talking to somebody who knows and that cant be missed it isnt how you hold your pinky it isnt how you balance the saucer on the end of your nose its just whether or not you know and your confidence and skill of course is in direct ratio to your certainty of knowledge you know these things are true you know they are true and thats it youve had it you sit down in an auditing chair you look at the pc he feels this and the only other thing the pc demands is attention on his case not on something else you start telling that pc sitting in the auditing chair about your case youre going to form one of the wildest arc breaks you ever heard of try it sometime pc sits there in an auditing session and you say well that reminds of an auditing session i had once and you talk about totally dissimilar action to anything youre undertaking see and anything has nothing to do with hiis case whatsoever and carry on for about twenty or thirty minutes in that wise man if you can get the rudiments back in in end of session ill tell you ill give you medal its its marvelous and yet you actually have been very polite youve been very kind youre trying to reassure the pc anything you could put it down to you see it still wouldnt make any difference because it violates this little rule youve got to be effective and your attention has got to be on the pcs case thats all he demands hell even forgive tremendous numbers of things if you do those things hell forgive things all over the place hell forgive dropping the ashtray and everything else hell forgive running the wrong process 895 hours even if you all of sudden start running the right one on him aw you havent seen anybody particularly arc broke about suddenly bringing up modifiers i dont think anybodys been cursing about it i felt tiny bit chagrined about it that its taken some months to find out that there were tails and middles and beginnings on some of these goals you see that was holding them up i know right now why clears go unclear so suddenly just modifier clicks just like that theyre all cleared up but theres that little tag end of disappeared modifier and it has enough charge on it to make the case charge up again well how do you patch up clear who has been clear and then who has this charge all youve got to do is go back and clip out the modifier that has been hung up there this has been quite mystery because certain percentage of clears lapse one down in durban the other day perfectly clear checked out clear everything was beautiful and so forth went outside and bow you see the bank falls in she reads stiff on the meter the meter up to 50 you know all just blwaaaaah everybody down in durban being terribly reasonable about it see theyre saying well all right lets see the the pc couldnt confront the environment cleared on the first dynamic ability to postulate caved themselves in and so forth and maybe after this why the pc was feeling bad about being clear and was selfconscious about it and so on and that caused the environment to do so see all the figurefigure going on see some auditor has just been handed lose fortunately why the marines were landing right at that moment halfway between here and south africa at that moment was 7 november 61 bulletin see all they got to do is get hold of this girl and say all right now lets see first goal you were audited on was to sew socks fine lets find the rest of it to sew socks and _____ whats the rest of it go ahead and complete the sentence go ahead to sew socks and _____ good complete the sentence now and fill them full of holes oho yeah you know your needle goes bang you know now you say what was the goal to sew socks bang big surge all right full of holes tick all right to sew socks tick all right full of holes gone gone gone and just take each goal theyve had right on up the line bring those tails and middles off of the thing and so forth and theyd settle out straight interesting huh might take little more patchup work or something like that because it was such shock to them to go clear and then unclear so fast with the missing link weve really found the missing link now havent we yeah anyway i dont know maybe somebody around here said gee whiz well i audited on the wrong goal all of these hours you didnt you were on the same goals chain and so forth but im much more interested in your case than i am my face and you know that so youve taken much worse than that from but people get upset about my building fireplaces and buying ships why you see it adds up makes little arc break they dont know that i do that on my time they dont think i have any time and its true i dont all i have to do is tell them however all the time im fixing up ships im thinking about cases and only if that were true however only if it were true would that wipe even that away you see you see why this is all right pc can form considerable amount of arc with an auditor and the arc according to some schools of thought even in scientology is only formed by sweetness kindness and nice humoresque on the stradivarius you can make pc hate you with that youre always sweet and kind and understanding and never effective the pc is going out of control the pc knows hes going out of control and youre sweet and kind i never had pc insession so much or actually ever had any arc with one pc so much as i did after i had practically picked her up by the nape of the neck and carried her across the room and set her down in chair with terrible thud with real thud i said lets not have anymore of that right now now pick up the cans you know the pc tried to blow the pc was not arc broke this all registered on the basis of hey you know he really means to audit he really means what he is doing hes not kidding what do you know hey what do you know now the reason student auditing is often slow is because everybody is studying auditing at the same time theyre doing auditing so all of the auditors could come into the category of just auditing in order to learn and practice so that would modify the definition effective and interested in my case see they could be effective and not interested in the case and have hard time keeping rudiments in you see how that would modify it well whatever weve been learning lately has nothing to do with it what do you think has happened here that you have tone arm up at 60 well just what do you think happened well how come your tone arm went up to 60 its been stuck here for about two weeks he says well i dont know i dont know taken off the process suddenly and and i guess or something i dont know really its true though i felt different for the last two weeks now how have you felt different and what have you been doing now thats different well ive just felt different and so forth all right well anything went on two weeks ago that you were in violent disagreement with in some kind or another were you in fight with somebody around or something happening and so forth well we all of sudden find postulate that theyre going to keep the rudiments in now and theyre not going to let the rudiments go out so that they can be properly assessed and so they can go clear and get out of here and nothing is going to affect them in any way whatsoever ah but they give this up to somebody you see they give this up to an auditor who is asking about them asking about them individually not as an example to something else you know the fellow wants to know and he asks them i am actually maybe opening the doors on the hordes of hell because an auditor can use this as an excuse just to do anything in session you can practically do anything in session as long as youre effective and interested in the pcs case and your attention is on his case and what you do is relevant to the solution of his case now that tells you that if you really want to chop up pc and get the pc overwhelmed is use an auditing session to secure an advantage over the pc ah thats not being effective is it and its not really being interested in the pcs case but interested in using the pcs case and even though the pcll go into kind of thralldom thereafter and so forth man theyre really never quite on your side you have hell of time with them so some auditor carelessly goes and sleeps with his pc aw he says well this will make good arc great day in the morning itll make good arc all right why didnt he cut his throat i mean as far as the auditing session is its finished hes not going to get any auditing done not after that its quite interesting isnt it because it violates this idea hes not interested in the pcs case hes interested in the pcs body well thats not being much interested in the pc women can actually figure it out so that if youre interested in their body why youre interested in them they actually will put this together and make mishmash out of it but it wont work with them in an auditing session you can always tell girl going along you look very pretty today thats fine she may accept this she may not but she thinks of that as complimentary and of course it is but in an auditing session if you sat there and described to them what pretty body they had and how nice they were to look at and how well dressed they were theyd go some little distance with this then all of sudden itd suddenly go bzzzzzzt and you couldnt quite figure out why it went zzzzzt of course body isnt case youre an auditor therefore what youre doing isnt effective all things just boil down to that every skill that you have in an auditing routine sec checking your elements of model session problems intensive it doesnt matter which or what of these youre practicing has of course certain form this form rather guarantees interest in the persons case it rather guarantees that dont let it ride on automatic because now it sort of compounds the felony the ritual is interested in the pcs case but the auditor isnt and i think youve seen that havent you the ritual is interested in the pcs case well then the auditor looks kind of funny you know the auditor asking if its really all right if he does soandso and the auditor doesnt care whether its all right if he does soandso and it makes kind of lie and the pc gets weird unreality about the whole thing what you have to do is be interested in the pcs case and determine to do something effective about it and then through the media of the ritual and emeter you give him the auditing commands thats all thats those things serve they are secondary theyre very vital secondary you shouldnt come off of them and so forth but unless theyre backed up theyre as empty as sounding brass in the tinkle of the temple bell they are nothing and in sec checking if you dont get to the pc as an auditor if the auditor does not become visible or real to the pc withholds knock how do you like that little voice in the far distance is saying well have you ever swum up waterspout doesnt mean anything to the pc nobody there have you ever swum up waterspout the little voice says in the far distance hasnt anything to do with him its not restimulative all right but the auditor is real to him he knows the auditor is there he has an idea that there is somebody auditing him and that this person is going to be effective and is interested in his case now it doesnt much matter what the fellow does what the auditor does at that juncture as long as it satisfies those points he can say have you ever swum up waterspout and he can get some knock on the emeter but if hes got good presence he says have you ever swum up waterspout and the you get pretty good fall on the meter you dont get fall on the meter in direct ratio to the volume of your voice you get fall on the meter in direct ratio to your reality to the pc so i look at pc sometimes and i ask him very softly and quietly and so forth if they have ever swum up waterspout or sung in church or some other crime and the needle falls off the pin i turn it over to somebody they dont even get knock and this is true of assessment i assess somebody the needle falls off the pin turn it over to somebody to check out its gone its nulled but thats because nobody is asking him its more mystery than that now your presence is as poor in the pcs opinion as you have to keep the rudiments in an auditor has direct selfcriticism mechanism your presence is as poor not as much as the pc objects to you thats all balderdash the auditor is as real and has as much presence to the pc as the rudiments stay in and has as little presence as the rudiments go out because youre using terribly powerful forms terribly powerful commands very challenging questions all said from nobody there see theres nobody saying these things there is presence delivering these things and these tremendously overwhelming forms are being thrown at the pc from nowhere he hears the words you know but theres music its the auditor thats the music that goes along with it he hears it but it doesnt mean anything to him actually it can be disturbing to him he has just gotten through robbing whole peach orchard he knows it was crime he not only robbed the orchard but as he went through the thing he broke off all branches and then he didnt want the peaches for anything he fed them to the pigs and the whole herd of pigs died you know i mean this is quite an overt as we stack it up and its all very complicated and intricate of some kind or another and from nowhere he hears have you ever robbed peach orchard see have you ever robbed peach orchard have you ever robbed its hard to get that disinterested you see have you ever robbed peach orchard yes hes robbed peach orchard and hes scared about it too nothing matches here theres nobody really interested and you dont get much of knock on the needle it doesnt restimulate it at all but when you living being living presence look at him right in the thetan and you say to him have you ever robbed peach orchard oh oh somebody is knocking on the door he has suspicion that he should answer that one he just better answer it he just better answer it and your sec checking goals finding levels finding speed of delivery all become very easy on these bases problems intensive you say well have there been any selfdetermined changes in your life all right thats fine all right list the selfdetermined changes in 1956 and so on so on so on all right now were going to assess these changes all right 1952 change well bought new hat in 1952 you bought new hat and 55 you bought new hat and 61 you bought new hat and so forth and youre going to buy new hat and thats the changes in your life and you come around and you say you know theres changes in this persons life you got the volume of change to the direct volume of auditor theyre matchly tuned the quality of your auditing was buying new hat see get the idea you mean your presence was so faint on the line all right now youre interested in it youre being effective youre right in there pitching you want to know about this thing and you say to the pc all right what selfdetermined changes have you had in your life and the pc says well what do you mean as selfdetermined change you know you make up your mind to change now how many times has that happened to you in your life do you suppose well quite few all right now tell one of them selfdetermined change in your life selfdetermined that you decided to change now tell one all right tell one now all right oh and its yeah yeah well theres soandso and i decided i couldnt stand my motherinlaw anymore and shot her yes thats change and other changes and i decided this and i decided to bathe only in borscht yes ive always been mystified about that one and you get wild list and you get it rapidly now of course the bank the pcs bank is quite responsive to your auditing and is responsive to your presence and you can handle it of course to the degree that you are handling it youre real to the pc you can handle his bank its odd that you can handle his bank better than he can and this is what he means by being effective so when you never order his bank around youre sunk he doesnt think youre auditing him nothing happens you sit there irresponsible about the whole thing bang nothing happens but you say to him all right now are there any more selfdetermined changes in your life youre looking at the emeter it doesnt knock all right thats fine thats the end of the list its that easy all right are there any more selfdetermined changes in your life is asked well are there any more selfdetermined changes in your life it doesnt fall couldnt be any more and with just little more presence just little more interest are there any more and it restimulates and youve got another one you get the idea the more presence you have the more you get out of the pc its quite interesting as mechanism now your deadpan auditing asking pc or accepting withholds that dont fall by the way is one of the wildest things you can ever do the pc tells you the withhold and you see this and nothing happened nothing happened to the needle nothing happened to the tone arm this must be about the flattest question there is you ask him again ask him the question again just for form sakes to get off the question have you ever swum up waterspout its null off of it on to the next one but you sit there and use auditing form to demand answers to your auditing questions and youll get all sorts of created universes now the trick is be effective you see only ask for withholds when you see that they are there only start pressing when theyre obviously there only start getting frantic and histrionic when you just cant get them off and its quite obvious that the pc is sitting there with clenched jaw with his hands locked behind him wont touch the emeter cans and says dont you dare ask that question again well what would you do at that point well whatever you do do it effectively if thats your signal for throwing your auditors pad down on the floor and say god damn ive had just about enough are you going to answer it or arent you if thats what you think you should do at that point and thats the only way you can possibly conceive that you would get an answer to it why by all means do it because youve come to that impasse situation dont you see or if its down to this basis oh come on george come on come on george you can answer it come on come on you can tell you can tell come on come on its all right its okay you can tell i dont know if i can tell you or not aw come on come on its all right just tell and well get onto the next question huh just tell and well get right on to the next question well all right but something tells i shouldnt he gives you the withhold clean it up the rest of the way hes back insession again but the way to get pc insession is to audit him and that sounds like one of these horrible truisms there is way of talking pc into session there is way of wheedling him into session there is way of pleading him into session the way to put pc into session is audit him audit him be effective put your attention on what hes doing what hes thinking about and so forth you know pc would even forgive something as corny as this now just sit there and shut up for minute and let think let think you presented here with rough one and im not quite sure which way im going on the thing so just be quiet for moment and let figure this out shut up now hm well jesus you got rough case all right this is what im gonna do see and lay something down i mean thats awful corny but pc would accept it because you were trying to do something about this situation pc would sit there for an hour waiting you figure out something about his case its actually true but beware of mechanical distractions of all kinds and its by definition what is distraction well distraction is something that is not relevant to the pcs case and is ineffective and that serves as distraction if you want to knock pc into cocked hat in minor sort of way all you have to do is find very effective process on him ask him about three questions of that effective process and then change the process youre obviously being ineffective because he knows the process is effective he can feel this thing bite he can feel the fangs go straight in see and youve asked him three questions and you say well what is not known about ruddy rod and the meter goes bong and the tone arm swings and ooooooh i dont know if i could ask that i dont know if i could answer that i wouldnt ever ask anybody that what is unknown about ruddy oh boy ooooh ooooo uhuhuhuhuhuhuhuh mmmmmmmmmmmmmm got somatic all right all right okay ill repeat the auditing question now what is unknown about ruddy rod well its uhhhhh uhhh its length see all right what is unknown about ruddy rod mmm mmuuuuuhkrooooow and you ask three questions with that response and then you say well i think wed better get on to auditing your terminal now see it violates that part of the definition of what is auditing in being totally ineffective this thing is biting like crazy you see hes getting action action action and all of sudden here you go now unless you could demonstrate to him that the next process was about three times as effective as the one he was just running youre sunk you know pcs will sit around and mourn about having been audited in 1954 by something or other and they were run on process of jump over the moon thank you jump over the moon thank you jump over the moon and they really knew that one it was never flattened and it really bit and nobody has ever flattened the process and itll come up session after session after session you ask for arc breaks when was the first time you had an arc break and they go back to this unflattened process it isnt the process was unflat it was that the auditor was being ineffective the auditor shifted off an effective process to an ineffective process and the pc practically never forgives it now if you think of auditing as an activity concerned with deportment well youd have something vaguely true its vaguely true yes it has something to do with deportment ladies shouldnt put their heels on mantles while theyre being auditors in the auditing chair theres various things you shouldnt do you should wash your teeth before you process pc at least wash your teeth once in while and so forth and if you dont change your socks often why dont take off your shoes and put them in the pcs lap theres various little courtesies of this character that one should follow but you notice that theyre all irrelevancies to the pcs case and your being effective thats what makes them irrelevancies and thats what makes them bad its not codes of deportment that makes them bad its whether or not theyre relevant to the pcs case now you lay it down to the pc that youre going to audit the pc he expects some auditing the pc can be absolutely screaming in session just practically screaming and wind up at the end without hardly any arc break at all as long as the auditor was totally effective all the way through the thing and as long as it just wasnt arc breaks and irrelevancy that were causing the screams you know pc says uuuuuh these bullets are going by and oh wait minute wait minute you shouldnt be running this process at all you shouldnt be running this process because youve got bullets going by bullets theyre real live bullets in this thing and you say good fine all right lets have another basketful of them he can think of you as being the most cruel heartless person he ever heard of and say so but if you want an arc break turn kind at that moment become ineffective at that moment and you have honey that arc break will be catastrophic and itll be hard to find too because its obvious that you did the right thing you didnt you became ineffective the way out is the way through the pc was walking in the shadow of death and you by golly didnt keep shoving him along and you said okay there you are we will all gather round brethren and will sing this hymn it had nothing whatsoever to do with his case you see buuuuuuh so youre damned if you continue and you might try to figure your way out of it this way lets see im damned if i go on and so forth and hell just get worse and worse and so forth maybe i ought to stop because its too painful well of course thats just totally ineffective the only way out is the way through regardless of how rough it gets youve got to ride it on through to the other end theres where your judgment comes in run process that is the proper process that is the right process and runs the pc through as smoothly as possible and you dont get to these points of judgment where you say well oooooooo is it better to kill him or cure him at this point you really dont come across those things if youre auditing straight and your processes are all right and youre auditing goals terminals and problems intensive and doing what you should its easy now in your auditing then the one which i adjure is not auditing it all boils down to that thats the only that you can pull now if pc is demanding that you audit the pc you can say unless you start see you can say im not going to audit you i dont want to give you any more auditing im very full schedule and i cant do anything about it well youll get some arc break thats right youll get mess bit but if you start auditing him and stop then that becomes absolutely fantastic because youve got the pc insession and what youre doing now is irrelevant to his case so youre sunk deportment begins and ends on the one question of is there auditing taking place if auditing is taking place gains are being made and so forth then the deportment must by definition be perfect thank you
