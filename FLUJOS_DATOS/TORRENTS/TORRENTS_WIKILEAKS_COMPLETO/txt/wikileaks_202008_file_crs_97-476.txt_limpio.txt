defense dod spokesman kenneth bacon said on march 20 1997 that right now there is navy operation taking place at the naval station in long beach the naval station at long beach homeport for some navy ships was designated for closure during the 1991 round of the dod base realignment and closure brac process the naval station was closed in september 1994 the naval shipyard at long beach closed in september 1997 according to the defense base closure and realignment act of 1990 the local community where the base is located has the responsibility to determine its reuse long beachs plan the city of long beach proposed to acquire the closed naval station from the navy and use the property to build new container terminal under the plan the new terminal would generate about 1600 engineering environmental and construction jobs and thousands of other transportation trade and service jobs nearby long beach is the busiest port in north america handling more than 35 million containers annually about onefourth of chinas exports to the united states arrives through the port of long beach under the plan the port of long beach would spend 200 million to convert the 145acre facility into modern cargo terminal and the terminal operator would pay at least 145 million year cosco cosco has operated at the port of long beach since 1981 but does not have its own terminal it has subleased space in the pacific container terminal cosco was the only company to express interest in the proposed terminal cosco chinas merchant shipping corporation operates about 600 ships the worlds largest ocean shipping fleet cosco is owned by the chinese governments ministry of communications that government has stated that it does not interfere with coscos business operations and does not provide any subsidies to cosco despite the gunsmuggling and chemical proliferation cases described below cosco is not run by the military the peoples liberation army pla the pla or its commercial businesses however may use cosco ships in commercial shipping or in wartime coscos ships have made direct calls delivering and receiving cargo at seven us ports they are baltimore charleston long beach new york norfolk oakland and seattle cosco also has had facilities for trucking and rail services around the country potential implications for national security there were concerns among some that an expansion of coscos presence at the port of long beach would increase chinese smuggling of guns and other contraband and collection of intelligence about us naval operations although cosco is owned by the chinese government coscos presence at us ports represents commercial operations on march 20 1997 dod spokesman kenneth bacon said that cosco has been operating in the united states commercially for some time coscos facilities in the 1 confirmed by visit to the long beach naval facilities and port in january 1998 crs3 united states have been subject to us laws coscos ships have been reported to be under surveillance by us law enforcement for criminal activities including gun smuggling and evasion of textile quotas moreover american workers and law enforcement agents may be present at coscos facilities proponents of the lease to cosco argued that cosco has been tenant at long beach since 1981 without raising national security concerns even while the naval station was active they also contended that focus on long beach was unfair because coscos ships have made calls to other cities around the country moreover they argued since the naval station closed in september 1994 and the naval shipyard closed in september 1997 there has not been naval presence close to the port of long beach some pointed out that taiwan which faces threat from the pla allows ships owned by cosco to call at the port of kaohsiung there has been discussion about cosco setting up subsidiaries in taiwan through another country critics of the lease argued that larger cosco presence at us ports would facilitate increased illegal smuggling of contraband and chinese intelligence collection and reward company involved in shipments related to weapons proliferation in the reported cases of chinese proliferation of nuclear chemical and biological weapons and ballistic missiles number of chinese defenseindustrial companies or organizations have been targets of us sanctions but not cosco2 critics have cited at least two cases where cosco has ties to the pla or defenseindustrial companies and allegedly undermined us national interests one involved the smuggling of assault weapons and the other involved the alleged shipping of chemicals to iran gun smuggling case in 1996 2000 ak47 assault weapons were reportedly smuggled aboard cosco ship empress phoenix into the port of oakland two chinese companies were under investigation for the smuggling poly technologies which is owned by the general staff department of the pla and norinco or china north industries corporation which is part of chinas defense industries and owned by the chinese government3 cosco is not being charged in this case and is not the subject of ongoing investigations by federal law enforcement agents the yinhe case in july 1993 the united states sought to prevent chinese cargo ship yinhe from reaching iran the united states believed that the ship was carrying chemicals that could be used for mustard gas and nerve gas specifically thiodiglycol and thionyl chloride one unusual factor in this case was that the chinese media originally disclosed the issue along with extensive details china did not agree to allow us representatives to participate in saudi inspection of the ships cargo until august 26 1993 before the completion of the 2 see crs issue brief ib92056 chinese proliferation of weapons

senators ask for inquiry on leasing of california base to chinese new york times march 13 1997 crs4 inspection china declared that chemicals were found after the inspection the state department said that the suspected chemicals were not found aboard the ship4 chinese access to the panama canal has been another question raised by critics in february 1997 the government of panama awarded lease to hutchison port holdings ltd subsidiary of hutchison whampoa ltd one of hong kongs oldest and largest conglomerates news report alleged that this hong kong company has ties to the chinese government and members of hutchisons board of directors consult to cosco hutchison operates much of hong kongs ports and several terminals in southern china the 25year lease allows hutchison port holdings ltd to operate ports on both sides of the panama canal balboa on the pacific ocean and cristobal on the atlantic two commercially strategic sites according to the news report james mccarville president of the port of pittsburgh viewed this development in economic terms saying i dont think we should be terribly surprised to see the chinese proceeding in the same types of capitalistic endeavors as we have been encouraging them to do panamas ambassador responded to the article stating hutchison international terminals worldclass port operator based in hong kong made by far the best offer by relying on its competitive advantages and not on the strength of its government we made business decision not one of state5 staff report to senators helms and biden of the committee on foreign relations concluded on may 14 1997 that development of the two ports by hutchison port holdings does not translate into direct national security threat to the panama canal6 another question involved access of chinese ships to us ports the uschina maritime transport agreement of 1988 regulates the use of american ports by chinese ships and of chinese ports by us ships the agreement provided 40 chinese ports that are open to vessels flying the american flag subject to 24hours advance notice and allowed vessels flying the chinese flag to enter any us port with 24hours advance notice except for 12 ports entry by ships with chinese flags to those 12 ports required fourdays advance notice those 12 ports did not include long beach they were portsmouth nh new london and groton ct hampton roads va charleston sc kings bay ga port canaveral fl panama city fl pensacola fl port st joe fl san diego ca port hueneme ca and honolulu hi in june 1996 the united states and china agreed to extend the agreement in addition china agreed to allow two us companies american president lines and sea land to set up container transportation service company and six branch offices in china this was the first time that china allowed foreign investment in establishing such companies as part of the negotiations and for reasons of reciprocity the united states agreed to remove the requirement that chinese vessels enter the 12 ports listed above only 4 crs report 96767 chinese proliferation of weapons of mass destruction background and analysis by shirley kan 5 woellert lorraine us upset at deal ceding

proposed terminal in november 1996 long beach harbor commissioners had approved the plan to reuse the property as terminal in september 1996 and reaffirmed it in march 1997 after superior court judge robert obrien in angeles ordered review opponents of the planned terminal however argued that the existence of the lease prejudiced the review as ordered by judge obrien the harbor commissioners canceled the lease with cosco on april 21 1997 judge obrien issued tentative ruling on may 20 1997 that ruling questioned the process of approving the environmental impact report and held that the board of harbor commissioners was predisposed to approve the proposed terminal because the ports executive director and cosco had signed letter of intent on april 4 1996 long beach authorities appealed and won on april 29 1998 the california court of appeals ruled in favor of the port of long beach agreeing that it was legal for the port to propose reuse for the closed naval station before

security issues in dear colleague letter dated march 25 1997 representatives horn and dreier concluded that based on intelligence briefings from the central intelligence agency office of naval
