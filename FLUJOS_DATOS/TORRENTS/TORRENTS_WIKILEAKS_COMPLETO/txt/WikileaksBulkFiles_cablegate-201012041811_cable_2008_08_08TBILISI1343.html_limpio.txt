bombs fall throughout georgia ref tbilisi 1341 classified by ambassador john f tefft for reasons 14 b and d 1 c begin summary and comment multiple bases airports and georgias port of poti were all bombed overnight by russian aircraft with bombing continuing in the daylight hours of august 9 with bombs hitting civilian targets in the georgian city of gori reports of casualties continue to come in most still unreliable and unverifiable but it is clear that casualty numbers are growing there were reportedly dozens killed in senaki and poti the government of georgia has not declared state of emergency but is limiting news being aired on tv and has evacuated some key government buildings in tbilisi the bombing is causing widespread fear in the georgian population in south ossetia osce confirms that artillery fire continued into the morning hours near tskhinvali the mfa has released new statements and the ministry of reintegration has said the abkhaz defacto authorities have asked unomig to immediately withdraw from kodori this sitrep covers events that have transpired overnight on august 89 in georgia reftel end summary and comment 2 c president saakashvili told the ambassador in late morning phone call that the russians are out to take over georgia and install new regime they will not stop at retaking south ossetia but will move on tbilisi he fears the russians will never agree to ceasefire saakashvili and the georgian leadership now believe that this entire russian military operation is all part of grand design by putin to take georgia and change the regime saakashvili said that the russian forces are now attacking tskhinvali and the georgian forces are resisting we believe the georgians are out of air defense supplies which makes them vulnerable to russian air attacks he also believes the russians will soon attack and try to seize the upper kodori valley ominously the abkhaz formally asked unomig this morning to withdraw their detachment in the upper kodori 3 c osce observers report that beginning at 0600 on august 9 georgian artillery began shelling tskhinvali and becoming heavy after 0900 to the southwest of the city the jpfk commander

visible presence of georgian forces in the city since 1500 on august 8 when they withdrew accurate numbers of casualties are available and international organizations such as red cross are present to assist with casualties 4 c poloff called the mfa and was told that there are new statements since august 8 but confirmed that the government has notnot called state of emergency the mfa website wwwmfagovge appears to have been hacked 5 c deputy minister of reintegration ruslan abashidze told poloff that the situation in south ossetia is the same as august 8 with shelling coming from java but he believes georgian forces control the nearby villages he said that georgian forces are in control of tskhinvali and are inside the city turning to the abkhaz conflict he reported that the abkhaz side has asked unomig to withdraw immediately from kodori note we have been unable to confirm request this with unomig but such move indicated intended hostilities 6 c unomig observers reported that

east to west as well as communications tower president saakashvili reported that at midday august 9 russian planes had begun bombing housing blocks in gori with hundreds of casualties calling this pure terror upper kodori was also bombed details are sketchy 8 c additional unconfirmed reports include sections of the railroad running from poti toward kutaisi may have been bombed dozens of police in mestia north west georgia have mobilized and are moving toward the russian border the zugdidi road is open and georgian troops are moving north toward kodori 9 c on the economic front the government has been undertaking contingency planning in case of prolonged conflict during an august 8 meeting with the ambassador prime minister gurgenidze talked about his efforts to calm investors during the current crisis he noted that the economy had been remarkably calm there had been change in the currency and the stock exchange was working normally georgia had not touched its eurobond money and natural gas and electricity supplies were in good shape the pm noted that the georgians were considering contingencies especially with regard to energy supplies should the conflict continue for example one major power plant had already shifted over to natural gas from electricity and there are plans to import gas from turkey the georgians are also planning to stop exports of electricity to russia and have made arrangements to purchase offpeak energy from azerbaijan although investors were nervous the pm noted that there was panic buying among the population tefft
