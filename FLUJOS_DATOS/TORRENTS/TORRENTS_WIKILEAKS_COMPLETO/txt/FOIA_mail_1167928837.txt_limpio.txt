from michael mann mannmeteopsuedu to phil jones pjonesueaacuk subject re not so fast an update date thu 04 jan 2007 114037 0500 replyto mannpsuedu xflowed sounds good phil i agree on the forecast i think its at least plausible by the way please remind what input you need from at this point on the wengen paper ive attached review paper ive got in press in areps not sure if i sent this to you before its mostly retread of our 04 rev geophys review which is getting lots of citations if youve noticed but little bit of newer stuff talk to you later mike phil jones wrote mike im just beginning to notice this i talked to ap about 5 hours ago our google search has noticed 150 in the last 3 hours i checked one cant recall whether it was minneapolis of san diego but it read ok its trivial forecast gw plus enso cheers phil i was hoping to put some of this background to the ipcc figure into the wengen paper but the more places the merrier by the way when ill send out reminder phil at 1619 04012007 michael mann wrote by the way 2007 to be warmest year headline getting huge amount of play in the us media today mike phil jones wrote dear all the net is closing national research council us committee for the global atmospheric research program understanding climatic change program for action national academy of sciences washington dc 1975 appendix this book fig a2b has the same figure as imbrieimbrie it is rotated it also has the same concept of the ipcc 1990 figure changes on various timescales all rotated loads of lamb diagrams i have seen countless times before this book also talks about the impending cooling john mitchell also thought the figure is in book by gribbin called 1982 co2 review anyone recall that one this isnt in the cru library nor ueas the direct source of the ipcc diagram is the uk dept of environment document from 1989 which is being posted to it though has source which isnt in the document john and geoff jenkins wrote it though it is possible that just the last millennium panel was from this source and the others from this 1975 source cheers phil dear all tom is off to texas david warrilow has found the said report photocopy is being posted to and two others have been asked if they know more about how it was arrived at ill report more when i get news phil tom heres reply from david warrilow below i still think it is in uk dept of the environment report from 198889 as does chris folland so have asked him to think little more ive looked at the 1979 edition and figure 45 is the one it has curve but with the 20th century warmer than the mwp it is said to be based on lamb 1969 this is chapter in the world survey of climatology series edited by landsberg i cant see how you can adapt anything from this huberts chapter has lots of detail many figures which have lines with the phrase analysts opinion one of his favourite terms for things he made up if it is an adaptation then it comes from huberts ideas about england and nw europe because these are the curves in the 1969 chapter anyone have the 1986 edition to see if this curve got changed the 1986 date is about right for being in the document i recall seeing some of you whove seen my room will be saying if i had better filing system then i would be able to find it despite keeping most things i cant find this by the way it is great pity the first ipcc report didnt use fig 45 wed all be very happy and the skeptics wouldnt be going on about what came out in 1990 attached is the met office forecast for 2007 it seems that im getting the credit for this in the media all i did was talk to the independent about what i thought 2007 had in store weatherwise with an nino going on i thought it might be record and just trotted off the typical things that happen in nino years cheers phil phil i cant be sure but i think the original diagram is from imbrie and imbrie imbrie john and katherine palmer imbrie ice ages solving the mystery cambridge massachusetts
