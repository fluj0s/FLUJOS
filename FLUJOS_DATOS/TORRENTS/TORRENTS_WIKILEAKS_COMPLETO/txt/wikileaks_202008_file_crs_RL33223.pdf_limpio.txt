the jury of today then and for sometime thereafter it was the body whose verdic t rested upon the knowledge of its members their prior knowledge of the circumstances of the offense of the character of the defendant and of the credibility of the witnesses2 by the beginning of the colonial period however the english jury had been transformed into an institution more familiar to us an impartial panel rather th an one necessarily convened with prior knowledge and thus perhaps with bias by then jury panel could longer be challenged simply because none of its members came from the neighborhood where the offense had occurred it was enough th at the panel was drawn from the county where the offense had occurred3 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33223crs3 particular neighbourhood blume the place of trial of

of the disadvantages of the loss of vicinage not to await hi s trial before jury from knowledge of whom he is encouraged to hope for speedy justice4 yet when the first continental congress later echoed the same objections it did so in terms more clearly grounded in both vicinage and venue whereas it has lately been resolved in parliament that by force of statute made in the thirtyfifth year

nowhere mentioned some of the delegates to the various states conventions called to ratify the constitution objected to the omission8 and when the first congress convened james madison attempted to meet the objection he proposed an amendment to appear nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33223crs5 9 1 nnals 436 1789 10 letter from james madison to edmund pendleton dated september 14 1789the senate have sent back the plan of amendments with some alternations which strike in my opinion at the most salutary articles in many of the states juries even in criminal cases are taken from the state at large in others from district s of considerable extent in very few from the county alone hence dislike to the restraint w ith respect to vicinage which has produced negative on that clause 12 t he papers of james madison 402 11 1 stat 98 1789 12 ii s tory commentaries on the constitution 1781 1833it is observable that the trial of all crimes is not only to be by jury but to be held in the state where they are committed the object of this clause is to secure the party accused from being dragged to trial in some distant state away from his friends and witnesses and neighborhood and thus to be subjected to the verdict of mere strangers who may feel on common sympathy or who may even cherish animosities or prejudices against him besides this trial in distant state or territory might subject the part to the most oppressive expenses or perhaps even to the inability of procuring the proper w itnesses to establish his innocence there is little danger indeed that congress would ever exert their power in such an oppressive and unjustifiable manner but upon subject so vital to the security of the citizen it was fit to leave as little as possible to mere discretion by the common law trial of all crimes is required to be in the county where they are co mmitted nay it originally carried its jealousy still further and required that the jury itself should come from the vicinage of the place where the crime was alleged to be committed this was certain precaution which however justifiable in an early and barbarous state of society is little commendable in its more advance stages it has been justly remarked that in such cases to summon jury laboring under local prejudices is laying snare for their consciences and though they should have virtue and vigor of mind sufficient to keep them upright the parties will grow suspicious and indulge other doubts of the impartiality of the trial 13 1 stat 73 1789as sixth amendment in bill of rights but in article iii of the cons titution under which criminal trials would be by an impartial jury of freeholders of the vicinage9 although the provision passed the house the senate would not agree perhaps because the laws of some of the states permitted jurors to be drawn from anywhere within the state10 the language upon which the tw houses ultimately agreed is found in the sixth amendment today in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to speedy and public trial by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed11 story explained the compromise as an effort to ensure that the accused would not be unfairly inconvenienced nor the benefici ary of too parochial jury12 by the time the amendments were sent to the states for ratification the geographical distinction between venue s tate in which the crime occurs and vicinage district in which the crime occurs made little difference for congress had established the federal courts with single district for each state except in virginia and massachusetts where separa districts were created for portions of those states which would soon become the st ates of kentucky and maine13 congress preserved

klahoma law review 3 65 72 745 1977after 1911 so far as congress was concerned the concept of vicinage had disappeared as an independent significant concept hence after 1911 th federal courts just like congress totally identified the geographical source from which petit jurors were summoned with the place at which the trial was being held for the courts too the concept of vicinage had been subsumed within the concept of venue in light of the legislative and decisional history of the concepts of venue and vicinage it is understandable that professor wright could say that the distinction between venue and vicinage is technical distinction having importance it is also understandable that pr ofessor blue could write as early as 1944 the tendency of modern law is to think of the plac of

capital cases trial had to be held in th county in which the offense occurred if possible and jurors had to be drawn from there in any event14 the county venue requirement in capital cases survives to this day15 but the distinct vicinage component that insisted that jurors be drawn from the county of the crime was repealed in 186216 thereafter other explicit vicinage components distinct from constitutional venue and vi cinage requirements surfaced occasionally when congress divided districts into divisions17 the judicial code revision of 1911 eliminated the explicit statutory basis for all of these18 but up until 1966 divisional vicinage practices continued in some districts under the umbrella of the venue provisions of rule 18 of the fede ral rules of criminal procedure19 when the

that the government bears the burden of establishing that venue is proper ie that the offense is being prosecuted in the district in which it was committed21 this obligation extends to ever count within the indictment or information there is supplemental venue22 venue however is not substantive element of the offense and consequently the government need only establish venue by preponderance of the evidence23 moreover venue is not jurisdictional24 therefore court in an improper venue enjoys the judicial authority to proceed toconviction or acquittal if the accused waives objection 25 if the

been committed in violation of the prohibition and 3 where those acts or omissions occurred the words congress uses when it drafts criminal proscription will establish where the offense occurs and therefore the district or districts in which venue is proper for some time the courts and acad emics used socalled verb test as one means of identify where an offense was committed29 the test may

shown or ever performedcourt was quick to point out however that under different circumstances venue over money laundering charge might be prope r in the district in which its predicate offenses occurred notably the counts at issue do not charge cabrales with conspiracy they do not link her to or assert her responsibility for acts done by others nor do they charge her as an aider or abettor

laundering arguably might rank as continuing offense triable in more than one place if the launderer acquired th funds in one district and transported them into another but that is tellingly not this case 524 us at 8 conspiracy conspiracy may be the most commonly recognized continuing offense although whether cons piracy is really continui ng offense or merely shares the attributes of continuing offense is not clear when the present general federal conspiracy statute was first drafted it contained an overt act requirement33 as it does today34 the crime under the general statute was not and is not complete until one of the conspirators takes some affirmative action in furtherance of the criminal scheme an overt act is an element of the crime35 in such cases it would come as surprise if venue were said to be proper wherever an overt act was committed was proper wherever conduct element of the crime occurred under several individual federal conspiracy statutes however an overt act is not required and therefore is not an element of the offense36 in such cases is venue nevertheless proper wherever an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is committed it appears so some time ago

committed at least when the conspiracy statute has an overt act requirement hyde v united states 225 us 347 36061 1912if the unlawful combin ation and the overt act constitute the offense marking its

but the proceedings against them must be in that county if they go into another county to execute their plans of mischief and there commit an overt act they may be punished in the latter county without any evidence of an express renewal of their agreement if this was the law of venue in conspiracies at common law where proof of an overt act was not necessary to show completed offense the same rule can be urged with much greater force here as the offense described here for all practical purposes is not complete until an overt act is committed it seems clear then that whether we place
