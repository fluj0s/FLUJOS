from mnoguermetogovuk to scenariosmetogovuk subject scenarios issues date mon 20 jul 1998 1800 0000 gmt dear colleagues i will like to post here some correspondence which is clearly relevant for this scenarios discussion group regarding some issues related to the use of the new emission scenarios simple models etc please post any comments on these issues or any other issue that you may want to raise to the following address scenariosmetogovuk i have added the following experts to the list posted in my first email p wagner r watson j edmonds s smith g marland many thanks maria noguer issues raised by j mitchell 1 there are several uses for scenarios conversion to concentration using chemistry models to produce forcing curves b forcings for gcm runs c use in simpler models to produce global mean curves of concentrations forcing temperature and sea level this would requires simple model which is documented and calibrated against one preferably several climate models the final ipcc approved scenarios will not be available until february 2000 so we should decide now on which draft scenarios to use 2 the provisional emissions will be made available imminently these need to be evaluated as there are four basic families and many variants how is the median scenario defined 3 what criteria are to be set for the simpler models used for global mean projections issue raised by tom wigley and reponses date mon 13 jul 1998 110054 0600 mdt from tom wigley wigleymeekerucaredu to sir john houghton jthoughtonipccwg1demoncouk patricia wagner wagneriiasaacat hugh pitcher

rrichelsmsmepricom dave schimel schimelucaredu ssmithucaredu subject ipcc co2 emissions scenarios dear bob hugh naki and john mike hulme has told something that is quite alarming about the soontobereleased ipcc co2 emissions scenarios if this is correct youipcc should try to remedy it as matter of some urgency he said that the new ipcc co2 emissions scenarios will still begin in 1990 and will not use observed marland emissions for the 1990s you may either not realize or not remember that during the preparation of the sar and especially tps 2 and 4 ipcc was frequently criticized for using outofdate emissions data that were manifestly wrong during the 1990s it would be extremely embarrassing to be subject to the same criticism with the tar indeed since the criticism is justifiable one it would be inexcusable not to have responded to it equally embarrassing should be the fact that in the published literature my 1997 nature and 1998 grl papers this error has already been avoided how can you get around this problem ideally the energyeconomics models need to be revised to begin in or around 2000 instead of 1990 indeed in talking to rich richels about this issue as well as echoing my concern he noted that his model merge is currently being updated in just this way he also pointed out that beginning an energyeconomics model run in 1990 leads to considerable flexibility in 2000 emissions when in fact the 2000 emissions will already be fixed and known by the time the tar comes out it is probably impossible to make this ideal type of fix but fix can still be made what you could do is just what i have done in the above two papers this is simple procedure that can be used since it is in the published literature all i did was use observed emissions to 1996 as far as data were available linearly extrapolate these to 2000 under the assumption that this was better projection than the corresponding is92a projection and then use is92a changes from 2000 you may be able to improve on the second step but this is unimportant the crucial thing is to get the beginning years of the record to match observed emissions as far as such data are available the above by the way does not have to be applied to emissions from landuse change because of the way we deal with initialization with the carbon cycle models we do not use historical landuse change emissions you may argue that in terms of projected co2 concentrations incorrect 1990s emissions have only minor effect this is such an obviously specious argument that i wont bother to discuss it not least it will not satisfy the critics parallel issue does however arise with the co2 concentration stabilization profiles the s profiles are already ludicrous since their concentrations and implied emissions already diverge markedly from observations the wre profiles diverge less but still enough for to deem that they need revising i have in fact already done this i would be happy to pass the new profiles on to ipcc best wishes tom from robert watson on july 13 tom i appreciate you bringing this critical issue to the fore you are absolutely right that we must not look naive i assume that naki and jon et will deal with this while i an on vacation for the next four days bob date wed 15 jul 1998 021809 0000 from david schimel daveschimelmpijenampgde to tom wigley wigleymeekerucaredu subject re ipcc co2 emissions scenarios tom i raised this issue at the scoping meeting in bad very bad munstereieffel where it was greeted with general agreement but it appeared to come as complete surprise to many that scenarios should have relationship to reality there was also general mild surprise at the degree of non gcmcommunity interest in following kyoto and stabilization rather than 1 per year and similar reactions to the fact that 1 year doubles the current rate of change but the wind is shifting ds date thu 16 jul 1998 094649 0500 from atul jain jainuiatmaatmosuiucedu to tom

mhulmeueaacuk fortunat joos joosphilunibech richard richels rrichelsmsmepricom dave schimel schimelucaredu ssmithucaredu subject re ipcc co2 emissions scenarios dear tom i got the same impression from hughs talk during the last week community meeting on ia which was sponsored by nsf it does not matter so much whether the starting point for the scenario calculations is 1990 or 2000 the main concern is that the emission scenarios should reflect the recent changes in fossil emissions which show decreasing trend from 1990 to 1995 in annex b emissions using projected emissions that are incorrect rather than updating them with observed emissions is clearly not acceptable i agree with you that the effects of these emissions on co2 concentration is minor however recent observed emissions will have major impact on estimates of the cost of co2 abatement which depend mainly on cumulative emissions rather than on concentration it is important especially in light of kyoto commitments not to produce inaccurate emission pathways that overestimate emissions from 19902000 since they may be used as baselines for producing cost estimates cheers atul date thu 16 jul 1998 081922 0700 from

schimelucaredu ssmithucaredu subject re ipcc co2 emissions scenarios dear tom et in setting up the minicam to do the scenario work for the sres we tuned the 2005 energy and hence emissions numbers to reproduce the latest iea forecast which explicitly incorporates the slowdown in 1990 to 1995 the only problem here is that informal feedback from within russiaigor bashmakov suggests the iea data significantly overstate the reduction in energy use our scenarios all go through the short term forecast for 2005 and then diverge onto alternative paths getting good handle on recent historical data and consistentreasonable forecast for tuning the short term aspect of the scenarios is going to be increasingly critical as we try to sort out strategies and costs of strategies this is separate problem from the long term scenario work and requires rather different tools cheers hugh date fri 17 jul 1998 142751 0600 mdt from tom wigley wigleymeekerucaredu to pitcher hugh m hughpitcherpnlgov cc

emissions scenarios dear all i appreciate the responses regarding my concern about the new ipcc fossil co2 emissions scenarios however noone seems to be willing to grasp the nettle and suggest what can be done about it from what hugh says all scenarios go through the same 2005 value so this suggests an obvious fix i am curious to know what this 2005 value is and how close it is to what i used in my kyoto papers hugh also suggests the ipcc 2005 value may be open to improvement but i presume it is too late to do this now so what should be done the obvious solution would be to use gregg marlands observed values as far as they go and then linearly interpolate from his latest year to 2005 when i did my work i had greggs values to 1995 and was able to make good guess from what he told about what the 1996 value would be by now 1996 should be available and good estimate may be possible for 1997 if so then the linear interpolation would go over 1997 to 2005 do you all agree with this strategy or does someone have better idea im copying this to gregg to see what more recent data he can provide cheers tom
