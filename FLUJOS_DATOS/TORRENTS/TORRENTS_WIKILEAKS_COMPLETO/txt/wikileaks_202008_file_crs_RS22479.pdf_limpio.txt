state house of representatives and thus both houses of the legislature it enacted new congressional redist ricting map with the goal to increase republi can representation in th congressional delegation2 lulac and others challenged the new plan in court alleging various statutory and constitutional violations the district court entere d judgment against them on all claims3 and they appealed to the us supreme court as the court had just issued its decision in vieth v jubelirer 4 it vacated the district court decision and remanded in light of its holding in vieth on remand the district court again rule d against the appellants finding that the scope of its consideration was limited to questions of political gerrymandering5 in their appeal to the supreme court appellants argued that the ne w redistricting plan should be invalidated as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander supreme court ruling league of united latin americ an citizens lulac v perry was consolidation of four appeals before the us supreme court6 in this ruling the supreme courts nine justices filed six different opi nions each with subparts many issues were raised by the appellants in this case but the decision primarily addressed two topics 1 the constitutionality of partisan gerrymandering and 2 whether the texas redistricting plan violated section 2 of the voting rights act constitutionality of pa rtisan gerrymandering appellants in lulac challenged the 2003 middecennial texas redist ricting plan on the grounds that it was an unconstitutional political gerrymander motivated by partisan objectives in violation of equal protection and firs t amendment guarantees under the constitution they maintained that the plan served leg itimate public purpose and burdened one group because of its political opinions and affiliation appe llants urged the court to adopt rule or presumption of invalidity when middecade redistricting plan is enacted solely for partisan purposes thereby alleviating the need for courts to inquire about or for parties to prove the discriminatory effects of partisan gerrymandering7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22479crs3 8 id the court further noted the legislature does seem to have decided to redistrict with the sole purpose of achieving republican congressiona l majority but partisan aims did not guide every line it drew id 9 id at 2610 citing vieth v jubelirer 541

in its entirety8 the court further determined that ascertaining the legality of an act arising from mixed motives can be complicated and indeed hazardous particularly when the act or is legislature and the act is series of choices hence the court expressed skepticism of claim seeking to invalidate statute based on legislature s unlawful motive without reference to its content notwithstanding its skepticism the court also found that in order for claim of unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering to prevail it must show burden on complainants representational rights as meas ured by reliable standard indeed the court noted for this exact reason majority of the vieth court had rejected test markedly similar to the one proposed by the appellants9 in regard to appellants reliance on the fact that the redistricting plan was enacted middecade the court announced that the c onstitution and the courts case law indicate that there is nothing inherently suspect bout legislatures decision to replace mid decade courtordered plan with one of its own even if there were the court commented the fact of middecade redistricting alone is not sure indication of unlawful political gerrymanders10 the court also observed that the soleintent standard is more compelling when bolstered by the fact that the redistricting was enacted mid decade11 appellants proffered second political gerrymandering theory that middecade redistricting for exclusively partisan purpos violates the constitutions oneperson one vote requirement citing landmark supreme court holdings in karcher v daggett12 and kirkpatrick v preisler 13 they observed that population variances among congressional districts are acceptable only if they are unavoidable despite good faith efforts to attain complete equality or for which justification is shown from that premise appellants maintained that due to population shifts in texas since the 2000 census the 2003 redistricting which still relied on the 2000 census numbers created unlawful population variances among the dist ricts to distinguish the texa s 2003 redistricting plans reliance on threeyearold census numbers from other more typical redistricting plans reliance on threeyearold or older census numbers appellants again highlighted the voluntary middecade nature of the redistricting and its partisan motivation leaving appellants observations regarding established juri sprudence on the acceptability of population variances among districts unchallenged the c ourt found that appellant s reasoning merely restated their primary argument that it was impermissible for the texas legislature to redraw the districting map middecade for sole ly partisan purposes hence for the samehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22479crs4 14 lulac v perry 126 s ct 2594

concluding statement the court announced in sum we disagree with appellants view that legislatures decision to override valid courtdrawn plan middecade is suffici ently suspect to give shape to reliable standard for identifying unconstitutional political gerrymanders we conclude that appellants have established legally impe rmissible use of politi cal classifications for this reason they state claim on which relief may be granted for their statewide challenge15 the lulac v perry ruling appears to leave earlier court precedent basically unchanged in its 2004 decision vieth v jubelirer16 plurality of four justices would have held that claims of unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering are not justiciable17 thereby overruling the courts 1986 holding in davis v bandemer18 another plurality of four justices would have held such claims to be justiciable although they could not agree upon standard that courts could use in order to make ch determinations19 the deciding vote in that case justice kennedy held that the claims presented were not justiciable but left open the possibility that such standards might exist20 similar to its decision in vieth the lulac court was also divided on the issue of whether partisan gerrymandering claims are beyond the scope of judicial review in lulac the same four justices would have held that claims of unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering are justiciable while not ag reeing upon standard for adjudicating such claims21 of the four justices in vieth who would have held that such claims are not justiciable the two who remain on the court maintained that same position in lulac 22 the two newest members of the court chie f justice roberts and justice alito however generally agreed with justice kennedys position leaving open the possibility of standard for adjudicating unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering claims23 hence in lulac the court was unable to find reliable measure of what constitutes an

to evaluate such claims do not exist in the aftermath of lulac it appears theoretically possible for claim of unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering to prevail the critical standard that court could use to ascertain such determination and grant relie f however remains unresolved compliance with the voting rights act appellants in lulac argued that changes to texass congressiona l district 23 diluted the voting rights of latinos who remained in the district afte r the 2003 redistricting causing the latino share of the citizen votingage population to drop from 575 to 46 although the supreme court acknowledged the district courts finding th at latino voting strength was unquestionably weakened the question for the court wa s whether it constituted vote dilution engaging in threshold analysis under the landmark 1986 decision thornburg v gingles the court determined that appellants satisfied all three gingles requirements that is district 23 possessed the requisite cohesion among the latino minority group bloc voting among the majority population and lati citizenry that was sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute majority in singlemember district25 nevertheless the appellee argued that it met its section 2 obligations by creating newdistrict 25 as an offsetting oppor tunity district noting that it has rejected the premise that state can compensate for the lessthanequal opport unity of some individuals by providing greater opportunity to others th court rejected the appellees argument 26 next as directed by the text of the voting rights act the court turned to consider the totality of the circumstances to determine whether members of the latino population have less opportunity th an other members of the elect orate to participate in the political process and to elect candidates of their choice27 the court determined that changes to district 23 stymied the progress of racial group that had historically been subject to substantial votingrelated discrimination and was increasingly politically active and cohesive in effect th court noted the state t ook away the latinos opportunity because latinos were about to exercise it28 the court further nnounced that the state chose to break apart latino opportunity dist rict to protect the incumbent congressman from the growing dissatisfaction of the cohesive and politically active latino community in the district then purporting to compensate for the injury the state created an entirely new district combining two groups of latinos geographically far apart and representing differing communities of interest even assuming that the redrawing of district 23 was close to proportional representation the court he ld that its troubling blend of politics and race and the resulting vote dilution of gr oup that was beginning to achieve 2s goalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22479crs6 29 id at 2623 30 id 31 lulac v perry civ action n 203cv354 ed tex june 29 2006 32

cannot be sustained29 hence the supreme court ruled that district 23 violated section 2 of the voting rights act because it diluted the voting power of latinos this portion of the opinion was written by justice kennedy and joined by justices sout er ginsburg stevens and breyer consequences after rejecting the statewide challenge to texass redistricting as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander and holding that congre ssional district 23 violat section 2 of the voting rights act the supreme court in lulac affirmed the district court decision in part reversed in part vacated in part and remanded the case fo r further pr oceedings30 in accordance with the supreme courts rulin g on june 29 2006 federal district court in texas ordered parties in the case to s ubmit remedial proposals

special elections in the redrawn districts for the 110th congress be held in conjunction with the general electi on which occurred on november 7 200632 as result of the courts ruling comme ntators have observed other states may dispense with the tradition of redrawing congressional districts only once per decade following the decennial census and instead redistrict following change in political control of the state government it has also been noted however that there does not appear to be any urgency on the part of state legislatures to do so33 selected legislation in the 110th congress legislation introduced during the 110th congress would limit state from enacting congressional redistricting plan more than once following an apportionment of representatives to the us house for example hr 543 the fairness and independence in redistricting act of 2007 representative ta nner hr 2248 the redistricting reform act of 2007 representative lofgren and s 2342 the fairness and independence in redistri cting act of 2007 senator johnson contain provisions that would prohibit states from carrying out more than one congressional redistricting after decennial census and apportionment unless court required the state to conduct subsequent redistricting to comply with the constitution or to enforce the voting rights act of 1965 and that would require states to conduct redistricting through the use of independent commissions
