ions in housepassed hr 6 109th congress title xii electricity section 1201 short title this title may be cited as the electric reliability act of 2005 subtitle reliability standards section 1211 electric reliability standards this section would require the federal energy regulatory commission ferc to promulgate rules within 180 days of enactment to create ferccertified electric reliability organization ero the north american electri c reliability council nerc currently has responsib ility for reliability of the bulk power system nerc has established reliability guidelines but has enforcement authority the fe deral power act currently gives ferc jurisdiction over unbundled transmission and au thority to regulate wholesale rates however authority was provided to regula reliability unde r this section the ero would develop and enforce reliability standards for the bulkpower system including cybersecurity protection all er standards would be approved by ferc under this title the ero could impose penalties on user owner or operator of the bulkpower system that violates any ferc approved reliability sta ndard in addition ferc could order compliance with reliability standard and could impose penalty if ferc finds that user owner or opera tor of the bulkpower system has engaged in or is about to engage in violation of reliability standard this provision would not give an ero or ferc authorizati on to order construction of additional generation or transmission capacity this provision would also require that ferc establish regional advisory body if requested by at least twothirds of the states within region that have more than half of their electric load served within that region the advisory body would be composed of one member from each partic ipating state in the region appointed by the governor of each state and could provide advice to the ero or ferc on reliability standards pr oposed regional entities propos ed fees and any other responsibilities requested by ferc the tire reliability provision would not apply to alaska or hawaii the state of new york is authorized to develop rules that would result in greater reliability for new york as long as those rules do not result in lower reliability for neighboring states hr 6 would require the ero to be funded through contributions from its utility members the congressional budg et office cbo determined that underhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32925crs2 1 pl 1044 109 stat 48 et seq 2 according to nerc canadian utilities cont ribute approximately 125 to the total nerc budget leaving us utilities contribu ting approximately 45500000 to the 2005 nerc budget 3 congressional budget office letter to honorable david dreier april 19 2005 the safe harbor provision would potentially provide liability shield for all those who might be sued for supplying defective renewable fuel or methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbethe unfunded mandates refo rm act umra of 19951 these contributions would constitute an unfunded mandate both on the private sect or and intergovernmentally because both private sector utilities and those run by local governments munis would be obligated to contribute hr 6 would limit the total amount of all dues fees and other charges collected by the ero to 50000000 annually with adjustment for inflation through 2015 this limit was initially included in hr 6 to avoid point of order based on the budget resolution umra limits would not apply to dues collected from canadian utilitie s and it is unclear whether the 50000000 limit on the ero budget applies to fees co llected from us and canadian utilities or just the us utilities contributions2 this limit would restrict the cost of this mandate to less than the threshold at which umra subjects congressional consideration of legislation containing intergovernmental ma ndates to point of order the 2005 budget for nerc and all of its regional tities however is 51950000 of which munis contributed approximately 6370000 and the ero would be required to engage in functions beyond what nerc already performs one new function is the ability of the ero to impose and collect penalties 50000000 cap on all dues fees and other charge s that can be collected by the ero could limit the penalties that could be collected by the ero cbo provided separate estimate for the cost of the mandates in this subtitle but estimated that hr 6 as whole c ontains both intergovernmental and private sector unfunded mandates that would exceed the applicable thresholds the cbo estimate stated that the cost of complying with intergovernmental mandates in aggregate could be significant and likely would exceed the threshold established in umra 62 million in 2005 adjusted annually fo r inflation at some point over the next five years because cbo expects future damage awards for state and local governments under the bill s safe harbor provision title xv would likely be reduced3 section 1211c would authorize to be appropriated not more than 50 million per year for fy2006 through fy2015 for ll activities under the amendment to the federal power act that creates the ero this is in addition to the dues paid by the ero members it is unclear whether fe rc would be the sole recipient of the 50 million annual authorization since section 1211 b specifically stat that the ero and its regional entities are not departments agencies or instrumentalities of the united states government the proposed legislation is intended to provide federal jurisdiction over activities that are requi red to support reliabi lity of the us bulk power system clarifying ferc authority to establish and regulate an ero is intended to improvehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32925crs3 reliability as restructuring of the u s bulk power system proceeds similar provisions were included in the conf erence report of hr 6 in the 108th congress advocates of giving ferc authority over the ero contend that central jurisdiction would provide more accountability ferc would be u ltimately responsible for reliability issues if the penalties employed by the ero were not successful then ferc would have the authority to enforce penalties for entities that did not comply with reliability standards establishing this new relationship between ferc and the ero would have the pot ential to improve coordination between market functions and reliab ility functions similar legi slation has been introduced during the past several sessions of cong ress but has not been enacted despite general support minor opposition to this proposal has centered on giving ferc jurisdiction over bulk power system reliability contending that ferc has experience in this area if ferc is given this authority it would have to rely on the ero for much of its expertise placing ferc in this position may add to the uncertainty associated with the changes in institutional structure as ferc takes on this new role section 1221 siting of interstate electric transmission facilities the secretary of energy would be re quired to conduct study of electric transmission congestion every three years based on the findings the secretary of energy could designate geographic area as being congested under certain conditions ferc would be authorized to issue construction pe rmits under proposed federal power act fpa sec tion 216d affected states federal agencies indian tribes property owners and other interest ed parties would ve an opportunity to present their views and recommendations with respect to the need for and impact of proposed construction permit however there is requirement for specific comment period new fpa section 216e would allow permit holders to petition in us district court to acquire rightso fway through the exercise of the right of eminent domain any exercise of eminent domain authority would be considered to be takings of private property for which ju st compensation is due new fpa section 216g does not state whether property ow ners would be required to reimburse compensation if the rightsofway were transferred back to the owner an applicant for federal authorization to site transmission facilities on federal lands could request that the department of energy be th lead agency to coordinate environmental review and ot her federal authorization once completed application is submitted all related environmental reviews would be required to be completed within one year unless another federal law makes that impossible fpa section 216h would give the depa rtment of energy doe new authority to prepare environmental documents nd appears to give doe additional decisionmaking authority for rightsofway and siting on federal lands this would appear to give doe input into the decision process for creating rightsofway review under section 503 of the federal land policy nd management act c ould be streamlined by relying on prior analyses if federal agency has denied an authorization required by transmission or distributions facility the denial could be appealed by the applicant or relevant state to the secretary of energy the secretary of energy would be required to

voltage transmission system in order to create truly competitive bulk power market some i ndustry groups have voiced concerns about the implementation of smd on april 28 2003 ferc staff issued wholesale power market platform white paper that intended to clarif fercs smd proposal the white paper responds to approximately 1000 sets of formal comments submitted to ferc in the white paper ferc states its intention to eliminate proposed requirement that utilities join an independent transmission provider instead the final rule would require utilities to join an rto or iso in the nopr ferc proposed to assert jurisdiction over the transmission compone nt of bundled retail service the white paper reverses this position and states that the final rule will not assert new ferc jurisdiction over bundl ed retail sales some state officials have expressed concern that the proposed rule would infringe on state authority ferc responded to this in the white paper by clarifying that the final rule would not include requirement for minimum level of resource adequacy in addition the final rule w ould eliminate the nopr s requirement that firm transmission rights be auctioned the white paper noted that each rto or iso would need to have cost recovery policy outlined in its tariff but each region may differ on how participant funding would be used in addition ferc stated that the final rule would allow for phased imple mentation to address regional differences the report language that accompanied the fy2003 consolidated appropriations resolution asked the department of energy to analyze the smd noprs impact on wholesale electricity prices and the safety and reliability of generation and transmission facilities8 doe issued its report to congress on april 30 2003 but did not include changes from fercs white paper in its analysis doe in part quantitatively analyzed the wholesale and retail price impacts of smd using two economic models general electrics mu ltiarea production simulation maps and does policy office electricity modeling system poems some of the assumptions that doe uses are the annual increase in electricity demand is assumed to be approximate ly 18 per year from 2005 to 2020 most regions are assumed to have reserve margins of 15 curre nt environmental laws and regulations are assumed to apply generator efficiency for fossil steam plants is assumed to be 2 to 4 higher in ne w rto regions with smd in the nonsmd case the models were not able to take into account freezes on retail rates in states that are transitioning to competitive markets and increase in transmission capacity is assumed under the smd case 5 increase in transmission capability by 2005 is assumed by doe due to improved operational efficiency at regional seams inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32925crs8 9 the pjm control area includes all or parts of delaware illinois indiana kentucky maryland michigan new jersey north carolina ohio pennsylvania tennessee virginia west virginia and the district of columbiaaddition doe assumes that adopting the smd would result in some savings that are difficult to quantify but would be re sult of several factors including the consolidation of control areas from the cu rrently existing 150 the possible avoidance of capital cost and software expenditures th at would have been needed at existing control centers improved regi onal planning and consistenc of market design doe assigns 10 savings due to these efficien cy improvements doe believes that the assumptions used in the models are cons ervative and result in an underestimation of the net economic bene fits of the smd doe calculates the median cost of fercs smd rule to be about 760 million per year or about 21 cents per megawatt hour the models range for uncertainties is estimated to be about 100 million the cost varies significantly by region ranging from 47 cents per megawatthour fo r gridflorida to 12 cents per megawatt hour for pjm9 regions with existing rtos have zero additional costs under the smd case the effects of smd on retail rates are influenced to significant extent by whether the states in question have costofservice regulation or competitive retail choice doe found that for some importing regions with costbased rates the net result could be increased costs associated with wholesale purchases which would be passed through to retail customers for some exporting regions with costbased rates additional utility revenues from exports are expected to lead to lower retail prices for the region under the smd case in contrast in regions in which most states have adopted retail choice increased electricity exports are ex pected to lead to higher marketclearing prices in the shortterm markets and somewhat higher consumer prices however in areas such as calif ornia that are projected to see increased imports lower wholesale prices and lower prices for consumers are expected doe found that the magnitude of the project ed changes both positive and negative decreases through 2020 overall doe proj ects the net benefit for all consumers would be about 1 billion per year over the first six years after factoring in the estimated 760 million per year and rto cost s over the longterm 20162020 the net benefit is expected to be about 700 million per year however the projected change in retail prices varies by region the midatlantic region is expected to see 4 decrease in retail prices but illinoi s wisconsin and arizona are expected to have 3 increase in retail prices as result of smd section 1236 native load service

repealed in 1987 buthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32925crs11 13 pl 102486by this time qfs and small power produ cers had gained portion of the total electricity supply this influx of qf power challenged the costbased rates that previously guided wholesale transactions before imple mentation of purp ferc approved wholesale interstate electricity transactions based on the sellers costs to generate and transmit the power since nonutility generato rs typically do not have enough market power to influence the rates they charge ferc began approving certain wholesale transactions whose rates were result of competitive bidding process these rates are called marketbased rates this first incremental change to traditional electricity regulation started movement toward marketori ented approach to electricity supply following the enactment of purpa two basic issues stimulated calls for further change whether to encourage nonutility generation and whethe r to permit utilities to diversify into nonregulated activities the energy policy act of 1992 epact removed several re gulatory barriers for entry into electricity generation to increase competition of electricity supply13 however epact does not permit ferc to mandate that utilities transmit exempt wholesale generator ewg power to re tail consumers commonly called retail wheeling or retail competition an ac tivity that remains under the jurisdiction of state public utility commissions purpa began to shift more regulatory responsibilities to the federa l government and epact continued that shift away from the states by creating new options for utilities and regulators to meet electricity demand proponents of purpa repeal primar ily investorowned utilities ious located in the northeast and in california argue that their state regulators misguided implementation of purpa in the early 1980s has forced them to pay contractually high prices for power they do not need they argue that given the current environment for costconscious competition purpa is outdated the purpa reform group which promotes iou in terests strongly supports repeal of 210 of purpa contending that the current laws mandatory purchase obligation is anticompetitive and anticonsumer opponents of mandatory purchase requi rement repeal independent power producers industrial power customers most segments of the natural gas industry the renewable energy industry and environmen tal groups have many reasons to support purpa as it stands mainly their argument is that purpa introduced competition in the electric generating s ector and at the same time helped promote wider use of cleaner alternative fuels to generate electricity since the electric generating sector is not yet fully competitive they argue repeal of purpa would decrease competition and impede the development of the renewable energy industry additionally opponents of purpa repeal argue that it would result in less competition and greater utility monopoly cont rol over the electric industry somehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32925crs12 state regulators have expressed concern that 210 repeal would prevent them from deciding matters currently under their jurisdiction

holding company act of 1935 the public utility holding company act of 1935 puhca would be repealed the provision to repeal puhca was included in the conference report of hr 6 in the 108th congress in general the public utility holding company act of 1935 currently sets forth the structure of holding companies by prohibiting all holding companies that are more than twice removed from the operating subsidiaries it also federally regulates holding companies of investorowned utilities and provides for securities and exchange commission sec regulation of mergers and diversification proposals registered holding companies of subsidia ries are required to have sec approval prior to issuing securities all loans and intercompany financial transactions are regulated by the sec holding co mpany can be exempt from puhca if its business operations and those of its subsid iaries occur within one state or within contiguous states historically electricity service was fined as natural monopoly meaning that the industry has 1 an inhere nt tendency toward declining longterm costs 2 high threshold investment and 3 technolog ical conditions that limit the number of potential entrants in addition many regula tors have considered unified control of generation transmission and distribution as the most efficient means of providing service as result most people about 75 are currently served by vertically integrated investorowned utility as the electric utility industry has evol ved however there has been growing belief that the historic classification of electric utilities as natural monopolies has been overtaken by events and that market forces can and should replace some of the traditional economic regulatory structure for example the existence of utilities thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32925crs13 do not own all of their generating facilities primarily c ooperatives and publicly owned utilities has provided evidence that ve rtical integration has not been necessary for providing efficient elect ric service moreover recen t changes in electric utility regulation and improved tec hnologies have allowed dditional generating capacity to be provided by independent firms rather than utilities the public utility holding company act and the federal power act fpa of 1935 title i and title ii of the public utility act establis hed regime of regulating electric utilities that gave specific and separate powers to the states and the federal government regulatory bargain was made between the government and utilities in exchange for an exclusive franchise service territory utilities must provide electricity to all users at reasonable regulated rates state regulatory commissions address intrastate utility activities including wholesale and retail ratemaking state authority currently tends to be as broad and as varied as the states are diverse at the least state public utility commission will have authority over retail rates and often over investment and debt at the other nd of the spectrum the state regulatory body will oversee many f acets of utility operation despite this diversity the essential mission of the state regulator in states that have not restructured is the establishment of retail electric prices this is accomplished through an adversarial hearing process the central issues in such cases are the total amount of money the utility will be permitted to collect and how the burden of the revenue requirement will be distributed among the various customer classes residential commercial and industrial under the fpa federal economic regula tion addresses wholesale transactions and rates for electric power flowing in interstate commerce federal regulation followed state regulation and is premised on the need to fill the regulatory vacuum resulting from the constitutional inability of states to regulate interstate commerce in this bifurcation of regulatory jurisdiction federal regulation is limited and

mic efficiency and service of an integrated public utility system it has been argued that reform to allow diversification would improve the risk profile of electric utilities in much the same way as in other businesses the risk of any one investment is diluted by the risk associated with all investments utilities have also argued that diversification would lead to better use of underutilized resources due to the seas onal nature of elect ric demand utility holding companies that have been exempt from sec regulation argue that puhca discourages diversification because the sec could repeal exempt status if exemption would be detrimental to the public interest for number of years there has been significant bipartisan congressional support for repealing much of puhca since the 1980s the s ecurities and exchange commission has testified befo re congress that many provisions of puhca are longer relevant and other provisions are redundant with state and other federal regulations14 however as result of enrons dealings and collapse some in congress have ta ken somewhat different view toward significantly amending or repealing puhca15 even though enron had claimed exemption from puhca on february 6 2003 secur ities and exchange commission chief administrative law judge brenda p murray denied enrons puhca exemption applications of april 12 2000 and february 28 2002 amended on may 31

could lead to abuses including crosssubsidiz ation regulated company subsidizing an unregulated affiliate crosssubsidization was major argument against the creation of exempt wholesale generators ewgs and has reemerged as an argument against further puhca change in the case of electric and gas companies nonutility ventures that are undertaken as result of diversification may benefit from the regulated utilities llowed rate of return mone ymaking nonutility enterprises would contribute to the overall financial he alth of holding company however unsuccessful ventures could harm the entire holding company including utility subsidiaries in this situation opponents f ear that utilities would not be penalized for failure in terms of reduced access to new capital because they could increase retail rates several consumer and envi ronmental public interest groups as well as state legislators have expresse d concerns about puhca re peal puhca repeal such groups argue could only exacerbate
