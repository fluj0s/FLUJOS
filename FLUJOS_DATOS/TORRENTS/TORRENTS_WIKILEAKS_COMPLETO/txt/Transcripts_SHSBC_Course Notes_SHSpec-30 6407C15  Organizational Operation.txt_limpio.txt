6407c15 shspec30 organizational operation your practice as scientologist can carry you into the fields of organization and business your perimeter of action goes out wider than just processing people it includes the economic woof and warp that makes the trap that keeps civilizations interiorized into themselves it includes relationships on dynamics beyond the first dynamic we dont evaluate for the pc however outside of an auditing session advice can be valuable and nonevaluative the individual has eight dynamics you can handle his first dynamic in auditing but he has stresses and impacts reaching him from the second third and other dynamics only two things give you trouble 1 significance 2 mass when someone cant confront mass he goes into significance figurefigure etc and sometimes but not necessarily handling mass is substitute activity for one unable to handle significances also some people who can handle mass very well cant think but there is reason why someone cant do both occupationally person could be in position where he mainly handles one or the other and considers that he mustnt do the other or that he cant society tells you that you mustnt confront certain things if you accept this dictum you can find yourself up some blind alley someplace when life offers person reward he will lose interest in playing the game anymore destruction of reward factor is more contributive to psychosis than punishment you could have conflict between fourth dynamics if terrans came into conflict with another race of beings the fifth dynamic tends to be out of comm with people so does the sixth man finds the seventh dynamic unreal one this planet the eighth dynamic is the subject of nuttiness up the line the common denominator is understanding and communication the only reason why you have trouble inside dynamic or one dynamic against another is lack of communication and understanding with it or of it the less communication and understanding is feasible the more trouble you would have in doing something with it the reward and punishment factors are out to the degree that the communication or understanding is out the english and germans keep having wars because of differences in culture slight those these differences are understanding can exist even in the absence of significant communication on the fifth dynamic or at least between men and the fifth dynamic there is not much mutual understanding within the fifth dynamic there is lot of mutual warfare this doesnt mean that the law of the jungle is senior or the only one operating there are also assistive factors in the fifth dynamic points of high understanding as in symbiosis we are in the field of looking over the dynamics and finding out how far communication is out and how far understanding is out the easiest way to square somebody around in life is to process him however sometimes you have to start out by approaching person with advice before he will even get processing you can advise someone who is going to get processed to move out of his normal environment for week and so on you may have to give him very complicated advice to match the complexity of his problems as you move up into dynamics besides the first you may find that you have things to handle that you cant handle by getting all involved into processing when you depart from handling first dynamic practically speaking you have advice or instruction as the main activity instruction is more directed advice you use this on the upper seven dynamics so training instilling cultural patterns etc becomes part of scientologists activities advice is casual undirected instruction basically it is what you use everywhere but on the first dynamic when people ask for advice go ahead and evaluate if advice is all you can get them to have it would be irresponsible not to give advice if the person cant get some processing within the reality youve got and the data youve got give the best and least partisan advice you can you only get into trouble when you move away from being pandetermined in the advice you give or for that matter in whom you will process remember though that advice that isnt partisan is unacceptable do give advice but dont spend whole lot of time mulling it over just dont pretend to be completely detached if guy wants you to get mad at his motherinlaw you dont have to but you dont have to pretend that you are detached and part of the conflict either bleaugh look interested and give advice you can offer advice urging communication if that is not accepted realize that you dont know much about the situation and you might as well give the person something that he can and will apply and do estimate the degree of understanding that can occur in the situation and advise that presumably this would also apply to communication dont assume that you know very much about the situation or that you can give him the perfect solution if you had the perfect solution the person wouldnt take it he would only take as much as he could apply so give him what he can apply and do the equation is what is the best advice you can give him that will be taken when you know that person will take particular piece of advice put pressure on and put in the hope factor advice is anything that you can deal off the cuff that the person can do that is more beneficial to him than what he is doing the point is handle it you can do lot besides processing person hunt and punch around for what he will accept dont assume that everything you are told is true and dont get partisan the advice you give can be slightly destructive just dont give advice that is widely destructive 1 try to bring about auditing 2 if you cant bring about auditing try to bring about communication 3 if you cant bring about communication try to bring about understanding give the individual something practical give him something to do in this way you will lessen the amount of peoples troubles that you listen to even if people dont do what you say you will have catalyzed the situation and it will have smoothed out if they dont want to handle it they will stop talking to you anyway the fact that you are helping the people in your vicinity handle life does put you kingpin and aces up and you actually occupy role that you will increasingly occupy as scientology rolls along
