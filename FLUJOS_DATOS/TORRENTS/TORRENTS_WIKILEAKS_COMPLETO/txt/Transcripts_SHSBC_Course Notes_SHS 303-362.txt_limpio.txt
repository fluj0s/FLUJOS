reach for an emeter to straighten out arguments put the person or persons on meter pull missed withholds on nattery person just sit him or her down as though natter had occurred and ask what have we failed to find out about you what have i failed to find out about you in this session have i missed withhold on you etc when you use an emeter get something done you can do great deal with it so use it to get somewhere the rules of auditing are to keep you from doing ineffective things men have been talking to men for thousands of years and the general result of these discussions has been nil how can we use talking in auditing to get something to happen the rules by which you audit are the rules of an effective path to an accomplishment of reaching someone bettering someone reaching an agreement and improving existence but it is highly circumscribed path there have been almost numberless efforts in the past to cure people or make them better almost all schools of healing have involved talking or listening there is an effort to reach axiom 10 applies throughout we can now make this same talk effective auditing has to do with the comm formula this is the most fundamental fundamental of scientology when someone says something and someone acknowledges it if the statement is true and the acknowledgment is received mental charge can blow deintensify eraser be eradicated it is on this fact alone that auditing works it isnt what is said it is axiom 10 the cycle of auditing follows this pattern 1 the auditors question or command directs the pcs attention to certain area of bank causing momentary restim 2 the pc perceiving the area of bank that has been restimulated responds by verbalizing 3 when he is acknowledged and receives the acknowledgment he knows that he has responded 4 that area of the bank blows 304 most auditing rules exist to maintain the purity of the auditing cycle the tech exists to determine what should be restimulated in what sequence if you have done the auditing cycle right and you know what buttons should be hit and what responses should be given then you only need add repetitive question and response and the proper sequence of questions each followed by the same cycle to obtain the state of release clear theta clear or ot that formula is the only reason anyone gets out there can be numberless departures from the auditing cycle other activities like selling and teaching have their own cycles which are different from the auditing cycle if the auditor has spent lifetimes being salesman he may use the wrong sort of comm cycle and end up selling the pc an engram or you may get someone who thinks forgiveness of sins makes people better this person wont use the proper auditing comm cycle he will do something else auditing is basically cycle of command that operates as an attentiondirector eliciting response from the pc and getting the pc to asis the restimulated area the pc knows he has done so when he receives an acknowledgment from the auditor that it has occurred that cycle all by itself is sufficiently powerful to get gains matter what words or process is used the mere fact of directed attention and the acknowledgment that the pc has directed his attention that fact by itself is therapeutic there need be significance in the command the repetitive action adds duplication to the formula this increases the effectiveness of the communication the person will become aware of the existence of another being he will become aware of mass and of whether his attention is easy or hard to shift his awareness will increase and his attention will become freer in essence those are your cchs it is the nonsignificance of directed attention the cchs present different ways of directing the pcs attention with minimal significance your worstoff pc does well on these because he discovers that there is matter energy space time and another being in the universe this can be great shock to him how does the great criminal live with himself by knowing that he is the only one that there is one else in the universe you cant tell someone in that condition to think of the significance of this or that because the significance would never arrive he cant duplicate it he can duplicate the fairly nonsignificant action of simply directed attention this is new idea in the communication cycle communication without significance beyond the significance of what the pcs attention is directed to linguistic analysts refer to the performance aspect of language apart from the mere significance of the words many an activity has directed attention but has not done so duplicatively that is one of the secrets of scientology processing and why it works this was not discovered before scientology because earlier practitioners couldnt duplicate you could run duplicative process on one object but two is better because it makes space and adds duplication you need to have two things to use you need two to make space we live in twopole universe you cant make space with just one spot you also need two things to have duplication this applies to op pro by dup the two points book and bottle give you space i dont care how you run op pro by dup run it 305 you could direct attention repetitively in duplicative fashion or in almost any fashion and achieve renewed awareness on the part of another being of yourself and the world around him theres further significance than that and that is the whole result of the process this increased awareness improves iq alertness etc wherever you have communication line set up you have some kind of response system on this line and it will go through some kind of cycle knowing that different cycles of action exist you will see that the auditing comm cycle is unique and you will realize that the question or command directs the pcs attention by pulling his bank up around his ears the auditing comm cycle operates independent of the intention of the pc it is more responsive to the practitioner than it is to the pc any outsider has more control over the persons reactive bank than the person himself its on that fact that auditing is based the common denominator of the reactive bank is otherdeterminism so auditing requires an auditor separate from the pc to be very effective and when the auditor isnt following through the cycle of action of auditing then nobody else will adjust the bank for the pc an auditor who wont help the pc out by adjusting the bank for him is leaving him in the soup the auditor must control the pcs attention if the pc is to be able to asis anything in the bank otherwise the pc obeys the bank and auditing is not occurring there are good pcs and bad pcs there are only good and bad auditors the good ones know and keep in the cycle of auditing if the auditing cycle isnt followed auditing doesnt occur pc whose attention cannot be controlled cannot be directed into areas of significance that reactively dont want any attention directed there say the pc has goal never to look if you cant control the pcs attention you will never find it because the bank has more authority over the pc than the auditor does all goals lists contain goals of this character if you look over the goals list of pc whose goal is being easily found you will find an absence of those goals that command the pcs attention to go the other way you will find never to look or to be silent these goals cause trouble until they are located the pc whose attention can be directed by the auditor on the other hand will have great many of these there are good or bad pcs only auditors who do or dont use the auditing comm cycle and get it executed sometimes an auditor has to work harder than at other times thats all you should look over your auditing with the question is the pcs attention being directed by and can i count upon the fact that it is if you do this you will learn lot about your auditing and what is going on with that pc and the relationship between your auditing and what is going on with the pc l ron hubbard type 3 idate18962 volnum1 issue190 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec190 3ga dynamic assessment by rock slam 6209c18 shspec190 3ga dynamic assessment by rock slam the rock slam is socalled because it is achieved when the auditor is approaching what we once called the rock there is something earlier than the rock goal if it were called goal slam you would have it it is producing lot of random needle motion because of currents being set up amongst the items and identities that the person has assumed or fought in the process of executing the goal the individual has way to go towards or 306 away from the goal he is in state of agitation it is thetan convulsion in the absence of slamming needle you may well see convulsions of the body when the convulsion gets to great degree of solidity this is surmise with some evidence behind it that is called an epileptic fit if it went beyond that to enter the physical universe around the person you would get other effects first the physical universe gets enturbulated auditors drop commands people have accidents further on you could get poltergeist phenomena you get enmest in any case what this is is obsessive and random motion or postulate that is in state of producing obsessive and random impulses when restimulated one may well get ones goal restimulated in the course of life so the rock slam is the goal track the pcs interest follows the track of the goal and therefore also the slam the pc is being reached as case when he is rockslamming dont arc break pc while he is rockslamming you wont get away with things that you could get away with when he wasnt rockslamming so your auditing had better be smooth the case will hang up if you bungle it during that time the pcs interest is very much on his case and the distraction is severe if you yank his attention out of session he goes from tone 30 to minus 80 with curve and it is hard to clean that up dynamic assessment is an intense activity and it should be so regarded by the auditor since as the pc goes down the track he is unknowingly running into all the items that you will later list you will find his detested person which will make him very happy you will take lot of edges off the case you will find the dynamic that slams and this means great deal to him now we find the item and here is something that is enormously significant to him it explains all sorts of things then you find the goal beside which all else pales this gives the pc gradient gains which is an improvement over ordinary 3ga nervousness can build up while you are tigerdrilling see p 295a the 850 goal list the tension that built up when we were assessing by elimination was enough to break the pcs and the auditors heart the pc was so nervy and arc breaky he was almost impossible to audit if you tiger drill list the goals but not the goal are being erased as you go along and the pc feels better and better but this is still not good enough or fast enough there is such terrific attention line here that any little wiggle is superupsetting doing dynamic assessment by rock slam eliminates most of the liabilities it goes into the goal line not direct for the goal and it goes by gradient of interest with the pc an active participant making gains every few hours also successful dynamic assessment by rock slam makes the pc feel great the auditor doesnt really care about this because the end product is getting the goal the auditor can get distracted by the spectacular successes that he is getting but anything other than going for the goal is waste of time if you are going to get to be class iv auditor you have to do it fast to clear earth you have to be able to find pcs goal in week this is something lrh can do so you have to learn to be that effective this is an upgrade lrh wants class ivs to handle group coauditing to clear per the program for world clearing 307 that is the only way to get it done as fast as it needs to be done this would produce fifty clears in one year when the technology is trimmed bit more you should be able to get it done in twelve and half hours but to do this you have to be pretty slick as an auditor there is point of diminishing returns where it is done so fast that it is unreal to the pc as pcs listing continues his interest in the goal ebbs and fades it is brought back by tigerdrilling it takes one minute on the average to clean up goal by tiger drilling at 460 down the list of 850 thats 450 minutes or seven and half hours plus rudiments to get to the goal that is not bad and that was the place where the second goal was found on one pc but the first goal is rockier to find many pcs will never find one without dynamic assessment by rock slam so we are looking for positive and efficient method of finding goals on all pcs in fairly predictable amount of time some accs found pcs running for six weeks without finding goal this was very disappointing dynamic assessment by rock slam has the luck factor of whether the list you are assessing is complete if item assesses out unmistakably the list was incomplete there is other reason we know that if we can get dynamic that rockslams when the pc considers committing overts against it we can then list what represents that dynamic on dwindling rock slam we can assess that list to get an item the goal will be an overt against that item in one shade of meaning or another as given on the list the tough point is the entrance point trying to find the first slam there is new caper the most detested person this is experimental at present who or what have you detested could get it but you may or may not get an item or what looks like an item short cut is to say what do you wish was not part of existence oil him up by getting list then ask what isnt part of existence this will serve you as an item if it will develop rock slam you assess it by consider overts against _______ you will find that the common denominator of all dynamics and items is that the person will not admit that they are part of existence they are things from which the pc has individuated so when you get the slamming item you might build it back to dynamic when all else fails by asking what part of existence does _______ belong to this could give rock slam when the list is assessed then you could list what part of existence does _______ represent this could give the dwindling slam the normal way is to ask what opinionated person have you detested assess the list with think of doing bad things to _______ get down to an elimination by rock slam get one person often the first on the list list what part of existence does _______ represent this gives list of dynamics on which there will be rock slams assess with think of doing bad things to _______ if you are lucky you will get an unmistakable rock slam on one dynamic then the list of the item will be dwindling slam down to dirty needle assess that with think of doing bad things to _______ one will fire well and now we have the pcs goals line on that item you list with what goal might you have that would be an overt against _______ that will go also by dwindling rock slam then list line six in high percentage the goal will be number 1 2 3 or 4 on that list just tiger drill each goal 308 there is an action that must precede any dynamic assessment by rock slam the pc must first list 850 goals and find and list every goal ever listed on the pc and tiger drill the whole list first however you tiger drill the tiger drill buttons eg on the word suppress has anything been suppressed etc down to flatness or cognition this is must on anyone who has been audited much you should also be sure to get the pc to tell you the consequences of your clearing him it could be so horrendous that the pc will never give you his goal work the suppress and the careful buttons hard careful is especially likely to turn on rock slam when the rock slam is off the command you use to tiger drill early goals is in auditing on the goal _______ has anything been suppressed etc thus goal that has been buried will begin to read again you can also use since date goal was found on goal has anything been _______ dont ever discard old goals the case can be stalled from that point forward l ron hubbard type 3 idate20962 volnum1 issue191 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec191 listing lines 6209c20 shspec191 listing lines the original four lines used in 3ga listing from goals want not want oppose and not oppose are augmented by the addition of create curious about desire enforce inhibit scale attached to each one making twenty combinations then each of these reduplicated in an effect form making forty listing lines in all pc was allowed to list only four items before going on to the next list this process was carried to the ep of fn at clear read for each goal found having large number of lines served the dual purpose of making the auditing question as clear and precise as possible and keeping the pc fluid on the lines before doing this listing you have to tiger drill the goal until it reads much more detail is given in this tape particularly concerning gain and sensation and their significance in listing goals what happens if you overlist is the following sequence 1 the line flows in direction where it isnt reaching anything and it is trying to come back that is the comm lag 2 he feels that you are getting him to reach too far and it is indescribable at this point he is fishing for the right item 3 if he goes on from there the backflow starts to hit he more than announces something than he invalidates it all these manifestations are just bank manifestations one problem that arises in selflisting these lines is that pain and sensation will appear on the wrong lines this occurs because in order to give himself the command the pc has to go into other valences and give the command to another valence this louses up where the pain and sensation belong he goes into the oppose to list the want and vice versa so he gets the sensation and pain in the wrong places 309 just before the pc goes clear his ta wont necessarily be near clear read the last two or three days of listing are the tough ones the pc rollercoasters bit he gets very worried just before the needle goes free he is afraid he will have game if he gives up the goal you have to persuade him through this to the there is nothing there point where he is free to make some new games early on in clearing somatics tend to be dull and persistent in the middle of listing they fade in and out by the end they flash on and off that is symptom of winding up the somatics may make the pc resist the end of clearing because he doesnt want them beware also the pc feeling wonderful when he is not yet clear this is the manic phase he will drop he will also tell you that it is blown many times before he is clear but when he is really clear the needle is free and will stay free until you find the next goal he may start looking right away listing can be done by hcas class ii auditors see hcopl 21may62

geriatrics gerontology never solved geriatrics but we have you should understand that one of mans longest searches has been search for longevity geriatrics is the study of living longer lrhs research at oak knoll naval hospital suggested that the mind could change the body more than the body and physical substances could change the mind you can always get function or thought to monitor structure but you cant always get structure to monitor thought medicos got this messed up because it is usually so obvious when structure monitors thought if you cut guys leg off you generally but not always see his thought change but if you dont get rid of the psychic traumas you wont change someones structure or function change the psychic condition and the structure can change these conclusions are very valuable in the field of geriatrics metchnikoff studied geriatrics as he felt the years creep up he found that theoretically sour milk could extend life indefinitely but he died before age seventy it is odd that there is all this interest in geriatrics given that thetan is indestructible this is actually interest in preserving the body which as it ages irritates the thetan by restricting his activity pc doing well generally looks younger one that is doing poorly looks older in the process of doing dynamic assessment on goals see previous tape you will see rapid change when you get the dynamic and the item and the goal as pc gets listed on the goal he or she looks younger if things go sour the pc looks older we dont know the theoretical age limit for body so we dont know how long clear should live it should be longer than normal anyway if you clear somebody around age thirty you will probably add thirty to forty years to his life if he goes clear at seventy or eighty you might add only five or six years probably the older they are the less you could add to the lifespan 310 the field of geriatrics has the problem of researchers dying out without leaving records and dying out before the length of time it takes to produce results so the researchers are always getting challenged age is normally determinable by the condition of certain body parts functions and cellular structures if you were to examine someone physiologically then clear him then reexamine him you would find that the person was physiologically younger this predetermines that they will live longer people get interested in scientology when you tell them about its geriatric aspects you would think that insurance companies would be interested in the idea of changing someones lifeexpectancy but they are not they are only interested in figures which are based on expectancy of claim payments all figured out by averages etc since the risk is spread out amongst many individuals they dont care about making individuals live longer they could even be against it since it could cost them money so you can get reverse philosophy on this point socialist states and insurance companies realize that if we werent kicking off regularly things would be in terrible state but most people would be far more interested in living longer than they would be interested even in being healthy since being healthy would cost them service facsimile people wish they could live longer even if they dont believe it is possible just doing problems intensive would increase persons life expectancy most people are fighting living longer even if they say they want to lrhs experiments with horticulture using tomato plants produced some tomatoes that were kept in constant temperature and humidity and which were not injured in any way they grew to sixteen feet grew enormous numbers of tomatoes and lived longer lrh found that the life span and resistance to blight of tomato plant is directly related to the amount of punishment the amount of clipping handling topping pruning etc people thought he was interested in horticulture but he wasnt he was interested in geriatrics and longevity plant that is abused will become ill and will die sooner abuse determines 1 longevity 2 susceptibility to illness if you can delete abuse eg by running engrams you pick up the characteristics of not having been abused in the first place ie health and longevity this would apply equally well to human bodies dianetics also pointed to this conclusion see science of survival book ii p 23 in humans if you delete audit out abuse or the consideration that one has been abused you effect the same change in longevity as not having been abused would have made so in disseminating scientology you can talk about longevity and preventing illness on planet that is very fixated on bodies these are good avenues of approach dianetics corresponds to deleting abuse from persons life which is equivalent to avoiding abuse in the tomato plants depression gives rise to symptoms just like an illness you can as dissemination approach use maybe you are not sick maybe you are just depressed you use that instead of suppressed the person will get very interested then give him problems intensive his sickness will frequently disappear you dont tell the person that you will cure anything you are only interested in removing the suppressions of life 311 we have to have bridge from raw meat to clearing and the bridge has to have reality in it the person must be brought to reality on the mind and life say you are running clinic giving problems intensives using repetitive prepchecking people will come out at the other end looking and feeling younger and longer sick this is an area that we have just neglected with our emphasis on clearing in book iii of dmsmh it says that if you can parallel what the mind is doing you can reach the mind and do something for it this is trick to parallel what raw meats mind is doing he is thinking how sick or well am i how young or old am i so how are you means how sick are you today common hidden standard is do i look feel or appear younger if most people are fixated on the body and they are you can use this fact to get in comm with them in effect you are getting guy in session according to the definition of in session before you officially get him in session age is normally hooked onto the body by the thetan himself using engrams and secondaries the limitation on what thought can do for structure is only the thetans consideration the reason you have trouble defining scientology to people is that there is datum of comparable magnitude in this universe so they always put up datum of incomparable magnitude and hang you right away in suppression and disagreement oh its like christian science you say right there you are hung with suppression of him it puts you into disagreement never let him choose the datum of comparable magnitude to scientology give him one his ruin himself what he owns his family his sick mother or wife his health etc this is what is really of comparable magnitude to scientology for him l ron hubbard type 3 idate25962

years after it was proposed ss possibility clearing is not something you achieve because of faith or right belief or any such trap our only interest in discipline is in getting the job done we do need certain number of safeguards to see that it is done right since doing it wrong not only doesnt get it done but also gives the subject bad reputation people need to realize that clearing is precise activity not something done casually by the untrained lrh knows we are successful when we get attacked by squirrels and when we get counterfeited concept therapy is one such counterfeit picked up in 1952 or so the chief movers in that appeared at the clearing congress unfortunately the ethics of clearing are the effectiveness of clearing he who hasnt been trained cannot do it and should not try since he can bungle it you can have an unfortunate win when you have flukey lucky break we want technology that works on everybody dynamic assessments see pp 305308 above have this broad applicability it becomes unethical to clear somebody nonstandardly in order to keep the rules in use you clear somebody according to the rules and take advantage of every lucky break as long as you realize that it will probably never recur but dont go looking for the break and drop the rules broad clearing technology must be preserved as it is and safeguarded 312 confusion occurs when an action that should have occurred did not all of sudden extraordinary solutions are being required whenever an extraordinary solution is demanded of you in auditing it is only because the usual has not been followed the unusual is demanded of you because the usual has not been done when you see demand for an extraordinary solution you should 1 fix whatever is wrong with the pc 2 get the auditor straightened out that is vital or the errors will just continue 3 find out who dropped the ball in training the goofy auditor and everyone along the line who certified him and get them to handle if you only handle the

to peace and quiet while we get cases cleared for long time we have tried to find out what made some people nervous obsessed and prone to revolt and cutting their own throats we have wondered if there was some international group that was closely opposed to the advance of scientology the answer is communism has some goals which would make you nervous if you knew about them such as the goal to take away everything of yours this leads to total games condition socialism is also nutty it rewards people for not working it says if you are working real hard you should share with people who wont help you another antipathetic philosophy is that of the south american division into ricos and pobres capitalism has one small group owning everything democracy goes like this take bunch of uninformed people and take the mean of their opinion and say that it is valid and therefore disregard it and then do things and tell them its their fault its the perfect mechanism to prevent revolt better one

your fault all government is merely substitute for the disabilities of the individuals in the population in an absence of understanding of the human mind you inevitably have government and you have as much government as you have crime until the whole government is crime there is nothing government does that has not been done privately at one time this includes fire departments police etc police forces that are part of government have nothing in common with public safety the more government you have the less liberty you will have because government is nonproducer the laws that the government

scientology except to the degree that aberration opposes sanity mediumgood auditor gets chewed up from time to time an excellent auditor never gets chewed up the only enemy of man is his aberration you just need to audit thats all if people attack you it is because you are not auditing them what they want is relief from their own misery and agony and you are giving them auditing once you have embarked on this sort of thing you are in for it if you dont carry through with it in the past when we have not executed our commitments we have been in trouble you have to make some kind of arrangement whereby auditing can occur pc who has screaming arc break can be smoothed out just by auditing him smoothly and well though true enough he has missed withholds for you to clean up pcs arc break over auditing auditing can also be conducted so as to amount to auditing of any kind making auditing occur and making it possible is an even stronger action than pulling missed withholds although that is necessary too auditing is pure magic 314 the pretense of auditing without auditing is pure poison it is dangerous to be almost an auditor going through the motions of auditing without really listening to the pc etc pc will put up with relatively poor auditor but not with pretended auditor all the things you are having trouble with are resolvable with auditing therefore you must not fall short as an auditor in last nights tvd it turned out that the pc had set up the room in such way that the meter wasnt secure it bounced around and had to be fixed when it was fixed the pcs needle cleaned up the above truth applies regardless of the dynamic you are addressing you cant counterfeit the intention to audit if you have that you will win if you dont you wont even if the pc doesnt perceive the intention you should handle the situation by auditing put in the hope factor and the rfactor and audit what causes the apparent revolt against dianetics and scientology when it occurs it is particular sort of missed withhold missed dynamic item or goal it doesnt much matter what it is the person is thetan who is basically good an appeal directly to the thetan bypasses all the garbage and secures his cooperation if you truly intend to audit him all the crimes wars and insanity in the world are not caused by the individual himself they are caused by the misapprehensions of that individual the greatest misapprehensions of all are his considerations of the dynamic and item as result of his carelessly postulated goal we are dealing here with human behavior if an individual exists and can be reached anything wrong he does thereafter is the result of his not being reached or audited here is what makes him tough to reach 1 his goal 2 his item which is his pet antipathy 3 his dynamic in which he has included all the badness of existence hes fighting against shadows which are quite real to him persons goal may commit scientology to the status of being in his consideration his oppterm whether it makes any sense or not to you the scientologist you cant predict this just from knowing the goal it involves the pcs interpretation of the goal and his track experience you match up to his oppterms in his universe rockslamming case is one who would get rock slam on consider committing overts against 1 scientology 2 ron 3 the organization 4 the auditor if you get rock slam on any of those four commands the person considers you an enemy he is not unauditable but the meter behaves oddly it is rockslammers who have made things unpeaceful for the last twelve years not governments psychiatrists or some international organization these people make up not more than twenty percent of an organization 315 if psychiatrists or psychologists had come up with results like ours they would have published our case histories with graphs and all nevertheless they would undoubtedly rock slam because they have basic disagreement with what we are doing the psychologist has agreed that man is an animal meat robot there is an earlier fundamental that makes this lie psychology means study of the psyche if you talk to psychologist dont get into discussion about whether man is an animal talk about the derivation of psychology their fundamental name you will thereby blow off their disagreement with us and clear up something that was definitely antipathetic to themselves the individual existed before the goal the goal is less fundamental than the individual it is only the antipathetic goal that gives you trouble cf expanded dianetics evil purposes dont reward the rebel put him on the meter and check the four commands given above if someone rockslams on one of those dont hire him or enrol him on coaudit you could enrol him on subcoaudit hang the rock slam around his neck and he wont cause any trouble because you have asised the fact that he is rockslammer rockslammers will dramatize in 11 manner if you dont get them audited you get an emergency telephone call and they write down the message for you then as they leave the room their coat brushes it off into the wastebasket you dont see it but later on they can prove that they wrote it down for you they will also agree with you about doing all the silly things you mention and they will dissuade you somehow from doing all the right things knowing these principles you can understand human behavior much better in an organization clearing coaudit marriage or any other group you have surefire way of testing for the person who has to be straightened out it is the person

rockslams on may be so suppressed that it has to be thoroughly tiger drilled see p 295a before it rockslams find and handle rockslammers neither snuff them nor let them foul up the nonrockslammers we are in the weird situation that if we lose everybody loses while if we win everybody wins so it is an overt act for an auditor not to pick up and pay attention to rockslammer because if he omits to do this he is letting the person lose and making it possible for everybody to lose the rockslammer will only win if you do something only finding goal will make rockslammer go straight l ron hubbard type

central control but only had people doing processing and if combined with this situation there were other people with vested interest in making slaves we could get thrown on the dung heap and scientology could end up being practiced with electric shock by governments on the other side we could have completely different picture wellunified scientology with sufficient international esteem and force to overcome any attempt to use it wrongly 316 buddhism for lack of plan ended up being an enslaver of people some thought needs to be given to scientologys future to make sure that scientology doesnt end up like buddhism in buddhism nirvana became like gpm look at picture of nirvana sometime it looks like someone surrounded with valences gpm lamaism with more ghosts and devils became like another gpm zen buddhism was based on the idea that if you are hit you know much of it is dramatization of axiom 10 the indian rope trick is mass hypnotism the east never had technology that did anybody any good they knew few answers but they all wound up in the soup so this is the first time on this planet and maybe in this universe when sentient beings could better themselves without worsening someone else we are looking at tremendous force not as in bullets but force of knowingness theta force in this universe one is used to seeing good people being squashed it starts to look like goodness is weak not force and that evil is strong that is this universes lesson but it is not true the reverse is true even though this universe would like us to believe otherwise and seems to provide numerous proofs to the contrary if you block theta comm line and tap it you can suck certain power off it that is residual in it but it will explode in very short order the way an organization gets in bad shape is by individuation an org commits overts against other orgs and gets into games condition with them then starts considering itself strange and different then it cant communicate anymore or function anymore this cycle is an interesting phenomenon which one can see every day overts are followed by the still after the confusion the withhold the quiet moment on the battlefield is the one that sticks so the stable datum is likely to be whatever someone thought after the fight was over this is not necessarily what holds it still at all one dramatizes the withhold it is not the overt but the withhold that is the source of action for instance bill shoots joe and doesnt tell the police he fires joe falls bill feels remorse and says i mustnt tell the police and that not the shooting is what he dramatizes as time goes on he is longer sure what he mustnt tell to get rid of the source of pronouncement of his guilt he commits more overts against the police his i mustnt tell the police equates to individuation from the police he also mustnt be joe the victim that is another individuation he might be able to tell you the withhold i mustnt tell the police but he will probably not be able to spot or asis the prior overt since it is at the level of action committing an overt results in an individuation the more separate we are the less we can communicate and the less we can understand if you want laugh get someone to explain something to you in an area that he has overts on using symbolic logic where instead of numbers you are using meanings all mathematics can be derived from arc in the absence of arc ie when there are many overts there is understanding or knowledge overts lower which lowers the other two r and c someone who is totally stupid in an area has overts in that area in the absence of arc there can by definition be knowledge 317 you can always apply these mechanics backwards you can make someone feel that he has done something if he has withhold about it if we tell someone that we will burn him in the electric chair he will dream up crime to fit the punishment even if he continues to protest his innocence cf the jews in german concentration camps who felt they must have somehow betrayed their fatherland also if you tell someone not to touch something enough times he will start to believe that it is dangerous whether it is or not this is because you have told him not to communicate with it and the definition of dangerousness is not to be communicated with logic is twopoled there are two sides to an equation the mind also operates on twopoled basis thus when describing scientology to someone if you keep on saying that it isnt like this that or another thing he will get the idea that it simply isnt you have to dream up something scientology is just like so there will be datum of comparable magnitude you will find that the more arc he has towards the thing you compare scientology with the better he will understand scientology so the best strategy is to compare scientology to himself his highest arc terminal this will intrigue him at least you want things better right so does scientology you probably have lot of basic wisdom about life some buried but really there you have observed things scientology ia like you you like to be free scientology wants that you would be surprised how effective even so crude an argument could be with people it doesnt even matter if his understanding of scientology is correct or not he will get some r and c in the absence of any arc you have observation and knowledge of the object or thing something you feel something about have tiny reality on and have communicated slightly to the vicinity of that thing would be something that you would understand only slightly but you would know it existed there is an understanding that goes along with each step of the tone scale up to total arc which is total understanding this leads up to being part of everything which is the booby trap of nirvana the reverse of individuation is enforced association one can obsessively become something there is cycle here overts first lead to individuation then goes on through the cycle to obsessive identification with the thing overted against for more detail on this cycle see pp 242242a above pcs associate themselves with their own oppterms in varying degrees this phenomenon occurs throughout existence what you resist you become is here more accurately stated as that against which you have overts you become one becomes more and more individual and individuated up to limit at which point the harder one tries to individuate the more one becomes sort of fake version of that against which one has overts this shows up in dynamic assessment see pp 305308 and clearly shows up with the item this is how the person rockslams if an organization overts against another one it becomes more and more individuated until it becomes lowerlevel beingness thetan will run whole cycle this way that is why you get the dead thetan at 20 he is obsessively being what he was once part of 318 we must keep the above mechanism of individuation in mind and look at the organizational plan that says that one scientologist is field auditor and another is staff member this plan gives us source of inadvertent withholds if we are planning anything broad in the way of organizations we have to eliminate any incipient individuation or we will get fake scientology scientology must be single org in which the members freely participate yet scientology orgs must never individuate from scientology they must never be allowed unhandled overts or scientology will crash like every other attempt to help man the hco 10 tends to further individuation since it makes hco different from the org philosophers say that every organizations ethic is strongest at its inception but actually there ia reason why its ethic shouldnt get much higher to accomplish this you must set it up such that organizations are not made different from each other in order to avoid the incipient inadvertent withhold which would lead to true scientology being in existence here lrh goes into describing at some length an ideal scene for lower level scientology organizations looking further ahead when you have cleared everyone the scientology centers will be political centers and scientology will be the government l ron hubbard type 3 idate91062 volnum1 issue201 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec201 instructors bugbear 6210c09 shspec201 instructors bugbear an auditor clears as fast as he is bright and as he delivers good quality auditing and he clears as slowly as he flubs if all is not going well look to what is wrong with the auditor not the pc there is nothing wrong with pcs some pcs require more cleverness on the part of the auditor than others apparently the individuality of life was all attained by goals that doesnt mean people are individuals because of goals it means that they are odd individuals because of goals goal is symptom of individuation so each person acts differently in processing but there is goal too difficult to be found if you can discover goal never to be discovered why you have damned good technology auditing quality is not associated with sternness or immovability or with being able to repeat the auditing command or the idea that the auditor must always be right an instructor watching half dozen auditors may think that he needs half dozen new rules to overcome these students peculiar difficulties actually a11 he needs is tremendous ability to detect variation from the standard rule this variation is sometimes so clever and well hidden that one never spots it an auditor can leave the session on the forward track by leaving the pc at time point and progressing to point g as fast as possible the auditor is actually leaving the session by way of the future time track instead of the door the auditor is running the session process and the pc is still stuck in the first rud that the auditor couldnt confront and therefore didnt handle in an effort to avoid facing the confusion in session the auditor unwittingly refuses to set up session he ignores and evades some part of the session that he has had trouble with now the pc is trying to get into session while the auditor tries to run from the session 319 the pcs who give you the most trouble are the ones who do the least they dont explode at you they dont walk out they are just never in session and auditing never bites they make forward progress the good pc is produced by an auditor who never gets the pc into session enough to arc break them everything is all sort of shallow dusted off but not investigated etc there was communication and understanding present the auditor was trying to avoid arc breaks so there was arc at the outset and the whole session was an arc break standard auditing is the cycle of asking the auditing question of that pc who is sitting in that chair getting response or answer from that pc which is then understood by the auditor and is acknowledged by the auditor in such way that the pc knows he did properly answer when this is interfered with weirdnesses creep in it is terribly simple cycle and terribly simple people such as myself dont seem to have too much trouble with it more brilliant people figure their way through and arrive at some kind of mutated answer to it that produces noauditing situation and how they manage to do this is the subject of an instructor this is the instructors nightmare the instructor must observe the departure from the simple comm cycle and get the auditor to see what he is doing the instructor has to point out to students their errors in such way that they realize that they are not doing what they should be doing where do all these oddball considerations come from apart from goals which is source that we already know about man can rise above his aberrations anyway he doesnt have to dramatize his aberrations to the full it is not good enough to say that his goal and his item oppose his being good auditor even though he will perhaps never be fully expert until these are out of the way there is another element however the auditor has fixed idea left over from some group or philosophy or activity about what is supposed to happen or what he is supposed to do to make something happen when he audits for instance he may have been part of society which supposed that there was reason why you couldnt decide to be anything you wanted to be and immediately become it according to this view all men were evil because they couldnt do this thats rather familiar one on the track this is weird way of making nothing out of thetans an auditor with this kind of background operates on the basis that the pc is weak because he doesnt just make up his mind to go clear and do it another oddball consideration is why should you ask anybody question they already know and they know you know wait minute those are the people who think that everybody knows all about them to whom every minute is missed withhold this is the consideration well that is obvious to so it should be obvious to him then there is the consideration that the auditor has to control the session and that that means never let the pc originate or never confess that you didnt understand the answer or never check anything the pc tells you is out like rud so this auditor is doing basic notis of auditing the whole time he is auditing and it will be found that he has never examined his fixed idea with this auditor the instructor must 1 find the fixed idea 2 get the auditor to look at it 320 person can get the impression of knowing from an impact so if you have committed fantastic number of overts against thing you conceive that you know something about it but its an inverted knowingness its the total cycle of individuation and the pc returns on the reverse curve of inversion back to the center of impact see pp 242242a for more detailed description of this cycle at this point he knows that he knows but ask him say psychiatrist what he knows and he cant tell you anything that he knows if you kept it up things would get very interesting because you would deindividuate him out of an obsessed interiorization into whatever hes doing you would be reversing the cycle until he again knows he doesnt know when you try to teach such an individual something to know that room has already been rented it has occupants you cant because he already knowsat the level of impact and obsessive interiorization so you have to reverse that cycle and convince him that there is something he doesnt know this is the guy who greets everything you tell him with yes i know so you say to him everybody hates you and you will get yes i know 0h now wait minute well i knew if i knocked long enough somebody would open that door hello if you press such an auditor long and well enough as an instructor he will eventually cognite either that he knows or that he doesnt know and new piece of certainty will be added to his auditing dont leave these fixed ideas uninspected by the auditor just ask him to inspect his own considerations about why he is doing must do or should do what he is doing wrong take his cockeyed memorized answers acknowledge and then give the question again break down his machinery and he will finally see some screwy alteris that he has added into what he really should be doing ask him what puzzles you in session and you will get an item of alteris and confusion it is usually something he has added which wasnt taught all additives occur in the absence of understanding or the presence of misunderstanding idiocy equals all additives and understanding understanding is the reason for additives misunderstanding is the reason for additives know this misunderstandings get picked up on meters as disagreement nocomprehension of education by disagreement is fascinating approach hence while word clearing on meter you dont ask on spotting read what didnt you understand there you ask for the symptom of the lack of understanding what is the disagreement there in life with respect to knowledge disagreement occurs after the misunderstanding get the auditor to spot his disagreements and you will find his misunderstoods if you get him to give you twelve things in that bulletin you agree with you will inevitably get the twelve things they disagree with person cannot do what he does not understand increase persons understanding arc of what he is doing and he will do it better an auditor is not evil there is something he misunderstands or doesnt understand about the function of the auditor or the cycle of auditing action you cant understand psychiatrists because you dont realize that they havent any goals they arent doing anything that you would think they should be doing 321 goofing auditor can get really wild in his computations you have to spot it and get him to spot it for instance you could get computation like this 1 im trying to straighten out this pcs mind 2 therefore i have to correct the things that they think 3 the only way to correct anything is to change it 4 so to change the pc i have to correct him 5 so i have to tell the pc something different every time he says something if you do not understand what is going on in session you wont be able to handle that session at the bottom of all error is misunderstanding you restore understanding of something by deleting the disagreement with it then you can study it and do things with it etc l ron hubbard type 3 idate301062 volnum1 issue204 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0

comments on rigorous training see also hcob 13oct62 processes any former data on the subject of assessing scales was prior to the experience of nulling goals we have learned that items can disappear from list without being out or appear on list without being in all nulling of lists is therefore to be done as follows we have scale or list from some source and we have lot of words verbs terminals or whatever old style assessment by elimination is superseded by new style that is much faster then tiger drilling the items it is done by reading each item in turn the ones that produce disturbance of the needle not necessarily an instant read at this point are in the time to judge whether it is proper read is when it is still in at the end keep the questionable ones in until you have eliminated most having assessed each line mark the ones that read matter how they read in this means that they disturbed the needle when the pc is in rock slam area the pc is all over the place the read can be early late etc for instance read could appear latent because the rising portion of rock slam could obscure the first part of the read if the pc is out of session you may get prior reads but goals almost always instant read in assessing scale the time to get picky about reads is when you have an item still in and it is one of the few remaining now you get nice about it rocket reads are consistent rook slams are not the item with the slam has far more authority than the auditor the to may sit there cogniting silently having forgotten the auditor altogether 322 on dynamic assessment as you go down the list pay attention to the pcs somatics on the different levels you would be foolish to go headlong down the items list and pay attention to the somatics that the pc is getting you may find the pcs valence at one of these levels he is likely to hit an item which is where he has been for millenia and if you dont watch what you are doing you will go on leaving him there standard assessment by elimination is not likely to work except with really good auditor who maintained real two way comm with the pc inval or eval out ruds etc items on the rock slam chain must be right therefore the procedure must be revised the revised version is easy to do especially if you can see the meter read it does require precise meter reading the pc must know what you are doing and what you are trying to find or the whole list can be protest be sure you can read the list before you try to assess it so that you can give the items right if the pc is rockslammer on scientology and you give an item wrong the item could rockslam at the very least it can make the pc protest wrong or irrelevant item on list read back to the pc is being asserted by the auditor and protested by the pc therefore it will read the pc may get caught up in an oppterm and may get protest reads from that another phenomenon is everything on the list reacing that is bypassing the item all the items can stop reading too either one of these two phenomena indicates that the midruds of the session not the list are out one item in every now and then is what looks right if the midruds are out the pc is handling the outrud on down the list and everything can read on that outrud when this happens the auditors voice reading anything creates greater effect on the pc and the item has greater effect on the meter the pc is vulnerable as in bridge because partial win becomes missed withhold so the auditors voice matter what he says will produce reaction the pc really has missed withhold whichever rud is out if this phenomenon is increased further nothing will read however if you put session midruds in too often the pc will be driven out of session by cleaning cleans if you assess for awhile without noticing that nothing was reading when you see the column of xs the next time through call these items again to be sure this system is to prevent reads from being wiped out by outmidruds and to let you select the right item by tiger drilling see p 295a for tiger drill procedure it is best to err on the side of having too many items left in to be tiger drilled you should leave say five items in midruds may not be out enough to screw up the session but they may be out enough to screw up particular item so the procedure is 1 assess by elimination to few between three and eight items keeping midruds in 2 start tiger drilling using sixbutton tiger drill unless the pc is protesty in which case you can make it seven by adding protest after tiger drilling you are looking for slam if an item stays in with mere dirty needle circle it but dont necessarily buy it buy the biggest read you should get bigger read on the right item and smaller read on the wrong item after tiger drilling you dont necessarily do this with big polish operation because you dont have the same need to be precise as with goal just tiger drill it enough to make sure 323 this should not take more than three minutes dont pay any attention to pain and sensation while you are doing this just dust them off if you cant make up your mind tiger drill them harder l ron hubbard type 3 idate11162 volnum1 issue206

withholds starting in february 1962 in spite of all this the subject has not been duplicated by students people keep picking up withholds instead of missed withholds all arc breaks stem from missed withholds i dont know exactly how to get this across to you except to be brave squint up your eyes and plunge get the missed withhold missed withhold is withhold that people nearly found out about but didnt you want to find out what people almost found out withhold is something pc did and isnt talking about it is not missed unless someone nearly found out about it the missed withhold has nothing to do with what the pc did or is doing its not the pcs action it is the other persons action and the pcs wonder about it it often shows up as recurring withhold one which the pc keeps giving you the charge keeps coming up because of the restimulation as yet unlocated of someone possibly finding out missed withhold has nothing to do with the pc it is another persons action and the pcs wonder about it forget that it is even withhold you are looking for exact moments in the lifetime of this pc when somebody almost found out and hes never been sure since whether they did or they didnt we dont care what they almost found out we only care that they almost found out something that is the address to missed withhold its an otherpersonthanthepcs action its an other persons action the pc is stuck in the unknownness of the uncertainty as to whether someone else knew this blows when the pc spots it missed withhold is an overt and withhold plus mystery the magnitude of the overt has nothing to do with its evaporation the degree of mystery is what holds it in place if you want to know what is sticking thetan to something look for the mystery sandwich even overts themselves wind up in the mystery of whether you should have done it this causes withholding of further action all things boil down to right conduct so when you ask the pc for missed withholds be alert for whether the pc is giving you withholds or missed withholds the number of withholds person has on the whole track is undoubtedly staggering you dont need to get them all to clear somebody the whole anatomy of game is ow you gather energies by the mechanism of ow which result in solidmass terminals making game possible etc in spite of all that you dont have time enough to run nut all the pcs overts even for one lifetime general ow does have its uses it is useful for getting the pc into session and smoothing things out but it is generally too lengthy so to see case go sproing ask the pc for nearlyfoundouts when i tell you to pick up pcs missed withhold i want you to pick up another persons action not the pcs and it is best characterized as nearly found out you are running the almostdiscovered track 324 youll never see anybody quite so upset as somebody who has been just barely missed look at pedestrian who was not hit or bear that is biting at bullet that just missed him or an exam that you failed by one or two points its the nearness of the miss that counts it is misestimation of effort or thought thetans main attention is on estimation of thought effort and look he wants to know how much look is look his certainties are all based on proper estimation of thought effort look etc when an error is made here it is upsetting how much knowledge is knowingness that is an estimation how much emotion does it take to be emotional enough to create the desired effect what is proper symbol etc you can estimate everything except how much mystery constitutes mystery because that is mystery you are now into the noestimation band and it is all mysterious the notknowingness of it is upsetting notknowingness that is probably known is especially painful because of the multiple notknow flows involved take notknowingness and play with it both ways they knew but they didnt or couldnt have known you know they knew but you know they didnt know the fourway flows of missed withhold are painful to thetan this is the stuff of which insanity is made insanity in the effort band of the know to mystery scale is cant reachmust reach insanity in the mystery band is diddidnt mustmustnt know that is what missed withhold is and what it is doing to the pc its just pure mystery mucilage and the thetan will stick right to it getting just the overt and withhold off when there is an added mystery of missed withhold doesnt produce an asisness of the section of track where the pc is stuck because the pc is not stuck with the overt or the withhold the pc is stuck with the almost found out so of course nothing asises if you only get the ows and you get recurring withhold you could get remarkable results running get the idea of people nearly finding out about you you could run this on three flows this process would free up track that the pc had never seen before but which had been right in front of his nose so when pulling missed withholds it is not what the pc did which is of interest when pulling withholds get the name rank and serial number of the person who missed it i couldnt care less what was missed i dont want the pcs action i want the pcs guess about the other guy get who the pc thinks might know etc etc if you have gotten off his overts on something and he still feels bit weird about it you are apt to think that he must have more overts so you keep after him for more this will send him around the bend since you are essentially cleaning clean you have to find 1 who nearly discovered the overt 2 when 3 how often this is what is needed to complete the cycle that was started when the overt was almost discovered just as far as time is concerned it is mystery sandwich the thetan is wondering whether certain punitive track is going to happen it doesnt so that time doesnt exist the result in the creation of mockedup track that never actually appears on the track and therefore hangs up in time not dropping the other shoe is like producing missed withhold 325 so you dont ask what have we failed to find out about you ask what have we nearly found out about you and when did we nearly find it out the first gets withholds the second gets missed withholds the worst type of missed withhold is where the pc is asking himself which one of my crimes did he maybe discover l ron hubbard type 3 idate11162 volnum1 issue207 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0

ultimate in its most severe interpretation lots of people have stated what truth is without realizing that they are putting an absolute where there is actually maybe truth is relative commodity the best approach to truth is contained in the mathematics used in connecting telephone switchboards they dont select out subscribers with arithmetical truth arithmetic is theoretical truth it is only theoretical because there is commodity connected with it it is truth of symbols errors only turn up when people say the symbols mean something in reality two apples minus two apples equals apples is magicians trick noapple is relative thing there is still something of an apple you can say well there are apples on the table after you take two apples off that is true as long as you accept time as truth which is adventurous the statement is only true for one particular time and place yet it passes as truth it is truth but relative one thetan since apples came into existence has utterly asised an apple so two apples minus two apples equals apples is only relative unless it presupposes some kind of magic we have become used to accepting such things as true the abstract 220 is true but it is true only because we have set it up that way the person who adventures out on the road to truth adventures with great desperateness it is an adventurous step philosopher who seeks to discover and teach truth is taking his life in his hands as well as the lives of many others therein lies his responsibility it is adventurous because it is the only track you have to go the whole way on there is short stop on the way to truth you have to walk to the end of the road otherwise all manner of difficulties and upsets will beset you there is such thing as relative philosophical truth that is safe if it doesnt approach the actual composition of the subject matter it addresses if you address the subject of the physical universe through the physical sciences you will find weird things in your path the savants of these sciences use the phrase exact science with great impudence considering the complete difference between what is given as truth in two different fields like chemistry and physics there is an article in the encyclopedia britannica at the turn of the century that wisely said that people wouldnt find out much about time and space until they studied in the field of the mind and got the conceptual basis that preceded time and space physics has gotten the world in trouble by building weapons that can be used by men who arent sane 326 there are workable truths which gives the exact sciences bloated notion of themselves because they deal in workable truths in the field of the study of man people try to use as workable truth the notion that one can do anything about man because he is merely an animal this idea started as revolt against religions control of mens faith psychology is study that is peculiarly religious and was so until 1879 when wundt theorized that man has soul up to that point psychology had been religious study looking at the will reason etc somebody moved in on it in the spirit of revolt just as the advances of the exact sciences have here and there down the track blown up religion so the exact sciences have now entrenched themselves in total falsehood concerning the mind at the same time they have developed an unworkable psychology to back up the exact science of blowing up the planet that gives you some of the liabilities of embarking on the road to truth and not going towards truth gautama siddhartha discovered how to exteriorize without discovering the laws governing it or how to let someone else exteriorize at will how many hundred million people did he condemn to slavery by not walking all the way down that road because halftruths have been used and misused ever since knowing this it takes brave man to go in that direction he knows that the traps and upsets of existence are composed of halftruths and that all efforts to enlighten can be employed to enslave and entrap by the fact of twoway flow aesops fables originally had morals they were just amusing stories this is pertinent to what you are doing because in the microcosm of single person you have the macrocosm of the universe the universe proceeds from basic postulates you can go on from these basic postulates to spot the goals of gold and lead and the methods of livelihood of quartz and schist they arent alive but they follow behavior pattern all flies wash their faces in the same way it is wonderful the way some postulates stick moss or man you are looking at the same cumulative structure based on some intentions and dedications you could reanalyze the world of chemistry or physics on the basis of postulates and intentions one of the booby traps of studying science is the sort of statement typified by nobody knows what electricity is this is in fact just remark not even postulate but everyone takes it as truth so they go into agreement with it and therefore are debarred from discovering more truth people have been telling other people for long time that they cant find out about truth the idea of the unknowable has some use but only to let people see that you dont have to know all about something before you start to find out about it emmanuel kant used the concept of the unknowable differently he said that the unknowable would never be known by anybody well how did he find out about it even by philosophic examination it is preposterous if you cant experience it at all how can you know it exists to be notknown there are some roads that are agreed to be closed for instance there is an idea that it is bad to know about the human mind some things it is better not to know if you are alive you know something about the human mind what is really dangerous is to find out nothing more about it in the last few days the cobalt60 was close to spreading across the steppes of russia and the plains of the us because of what because it 327 is so dangerous to begin to know anything about the human mind people recognize that it is dangerous to some degree but they recognize what is really dangerous if you know of the existence of something it is dangerous not to know all about it people concede that they dont know anything at all about it that is an idiotic premise in the field of the mind they are already aware of the existence of figure think calculate in other beings so they are already started on the road to knowledge of the human mind it is very dangerous to go further so the search for truth isnt the province of few everyone has started to know something about it but not to know more about it than they do will cause them to die that doesnt even seem startling it is so accepted if group decides to go all the way on the road to truth the more they know the less dangerous it is what is really dangerous is to suppose that people think and to know nothing more about it than that it is also very dangerous to be spotted as one who is walking towards truth unless you go the whole way it is booby trapped everyone is very suspicious of anything being known because people who have jumped up and said something was known have often lied if they pretended to know more then others they have committed overts if they found some partial truth and never got any further but instead spread bricabrac in all directions as the true wisdom they have committed the overt of consigning perhaps billions of people to slavery so there is substitute for walking the track lrh has never doubted that he would bring off this study though he has often wondered whether or not the time factor would upset things we needed few clear years if you have reputation for knowing you enter into mechanism called the missed withhold if you seem to have the gift of knowing about the mind people think you know the truth and to them the only truth that exists is themselves first dynamic truth this includes their own aberrations their ideas about rightness of conduct etc so you run into missed withholds scientist wants to get away from right and wrong because he is blind to the possibility that there could be an exact right conduct the idea of right conduct has been particular concern of eastern philosophers it has been ignored in the west all considerations of behavior and the ow mechanism are primarily based on ideas of right and wrong conduct in back of the ow mechanism is the idea that right conduct can exist this is the saving grace of any race of beings survival is the monitoring factor of rightness of conduct the behaviorist would try to tell you that right conduct is first dynamic matter that it is not survival but selfpreservation this misses the boat person commits overts not because of selfpreservation but because of survival that is his rightness of conduct the difference is that in fact one acts out of more than one dynamic right conduct is always group activity not an individual one matter how much person speaks of integrity to himself his ideas of his own rightness are based on the concepts of the group to which he belongs so we get third dynamic aberration of right conduct as underlying all ow and missed withholds the only thing senior to ow is the pure mechanics of existence as given in the early axioms those early axioms are very close to absolute truth thought absolutes are unattainable because the only absolute is static and that is nothing hence it is unattainable because it cannot be had 328 the aberrations person engages in are his efforts to discover right conduct with the handicap that mores change from group to group and lifetime to lifetime so there is road to truth on the subject of right conduct if you realize that thetans aberrated condition results from 1 search for right conduct 2 an effort to adhere to codes of right conduct 3 the breaking of codes of right conduct then you are walking the road to truth moral statements are the entrance of arbitraries into conduct not truths this fact is unknown to legislators who always try to say that their laws are true but in making the laws they longer even consult the customs of the people but instead try to reverse the social order however laws which dont evolve from the customs of the people 1 operate as total tyranny 2 are totally unenforceable prohibition was good example of this fact this concerns you because you are in the business of determining truth from right conduct or nowimsupposedtos people think that right conduct is truth they think they have some data when they dont your period of peril is past there was time when taking you as unit of truth there was question whether or not your state of understanding of yourself could be materially improved by study and processing however it is now clear that if anyone will sit still and if the auditor does the right processing this will occur we started out with everyone stupid as hell on the subject including lrh originally now we have gotten to the point where someone can know all about where he has been what he has done and where the axioms look to him like clearlystated obvious things we are essentially in the business of individuals dont forget that matter what you are trying to do or handle whether it is world government or whatever it is you will never in your whole history handle more than sn individual if you fail to handle an individual then you will have to set up all sorts of groups and laws to do it the raison detre of most earth organizations is the fact that they could not handle an individual this brought about their construction not their demise this isnt true of all third dynamics only the aberrated ones here on earth this is actually an inverted third dynamic they couldnt handle the first dynamic so they developed an organization not to have to do it despite that scientology is the one activity on this planet that doesnt follow this rule there still tends to be an organization that gets pulled in and grows up around lrh at times this organization fails to deliver service due to shortage of time or material or personnel but on the whole we are handling the individual russia shoots individuals and loves the masses this is aberrated you can handle the individual if everything you do is individually tailored to serve his needs so he is not overlooked whenever you fail to handle an individual you set up an upset so you will set up an organization laws and all sorts of ow to do it we are probably the only organization today going in the direction of clear third dynamic we use ow only to park an individual until we can handle him 329 there is truth in the mass of things and truth in moral codes truth isnt to be found there only agreements there is truth apart from the individual if there is any truth you are it if there is any truth to be known you will know it when someone almost caves in because you have confronted him and made him wonder what you do know ie when you have missed withhold on him your only mistake is not to reach him as truth you are at that moment confronting the road to truth and you have got to travel it because you have already started to there will be many pc that you will start to process many person that you will tell about scientology of whom you will say why did i get up this morning if someone says i heard that ron doesnt believe in god the wrong thing to do is to unload jump off the road you handle it all your disasters anyplace will stem from the instant you backed off turned around did something else and set up an organization to handle this jerk you will only fail when you dont try because if you make some stab at it he wont go away you will be surprised to find that you will pick him up somewhere down the track many times you will think you have failed when you havent the only mistake is to try to go backwards on the road to truth that is dangerous if you fail to stand up to someone who is mad at you because of his missed withholds or to the guy in the pe course who says it cant be true because ron doesnt believe in god that is when you fail catastrophes occur people get mad at you you cave in but that can be changed or handled if you fail to handle an individual you end up setting up an org to handle masses but not individuals individuals only stand up and yap in order to be handled there is truth to be found and there is road to truth you have that in you and every time you look at human being you see it in him rut you dont find truth in the mass of things and in moral codes since you understand what human nature is about the more you know and understand it the less these factors like having to handle banky individual will trouble you but every little fellow has started on the road to truth his only stupidity is not to keep going we are almost there the main road and the thorns are behind us we only retreat from our position to the degree that we dont realize that you cant start case you cant embark on clearing planet or an individual and do it diffidently without to some degree seeing it through to final conclusion your only disasters will stem from failure to follow that road all the way through l ron hubbard type 3 idate131162 volnum1 issue210 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec210 the difficult case 6211c13 shspec210 the difficult case problems intensive see p 292 is apparently capable of producing book one mest clear if it is done right it has done so on couple of pcs if this is not happening elsewhere than at st hill it may be that people elsewhere dont know what free needle is peoples tas have been gotten to clear read with mention of fn so pay some attention to this it could be that it was happening without being reported the aspect of case depends on the way the case is handled generally how the case is handled has great deal to do with how rough the case looks say case and case b are similarly tough cases if case gets lot of usual actions good hope factor good rfactor and case b gets unusualness and wrong actions case will run easily and case b will run rough and break anybodys heart 330 psychiatric classification behavior in life etc have bearing on how hard or easy the case will be to handle the same goes for scientology classification schemes we make our own tough cases the black v theetieweetie etc it doesnt matter the length of time to handle the case doesnt compare to the state of the case all cases are hard actually some are made more difficult by preconceptions and classifications that dont really apply the technology has bypassed the difficulties the case that you will have trouble with is always spook and surprise to you it is not the psychiatric disaster case the tough ones are the ones who look sane and able and lie like hell because they dont do the commands they get upset if you keep at them to see if they did the command that just makes them feel accused and they get harder to audit you can spot this kind of case by observing that after short period of modern auditing the case hasnt recovered this case either 1 hasnt done your commands or 2 you havent audited the case this case interrupts the auditing cycle the most extreme example of this kind of case is the individual who cant communicate at all or the case that cant hear or that has command of the language that you are using but that is simple you recognize the outofcommunication state that he is in and know that you would get nowhere with subjective process like straightwire but you miss the case who ostensibly speaks and understands english but never answers the question or executes the commands there is actually gradient of this which at its top level includes every case sooner or later any case wont do the command the spook is the one who never does the command and always does something else what is happening is that he is on circuit he is being wired set of valences the pc is out there somewhere and has nothing to do with the auditing at all dont let your pc sit there in sort of comfortable relaxed puzzle find out what is going on but dont chop up the pc auditors sometimes sense that the pc isnt executing the command and they start harassing the pc chopping him up because they know something is wrong they dont feel in good 2wc with the pc so you move in and get insistent with the pc then the ta moves even less this case is the last one in the world to admit that he is not doing the command he could even get ta say he is running the command through an electronic incident because he knows that if it changes he is better how do you handle this case you watch the ta while you are running the pcs right havingness process or you can run another process that has something to do with the physical universe like op pro by dup scs or cchs if you get good ta with that flatten that the reason you dont notice the ta is that the pc is off the meter but if the pc gets lot of ta in the rudiments and little in the body of the session you know at once that the pc never does the auditing command it is selfevident that this is the true state of affairs if you run the pt environment eg with look at the _______ and the ta moves while problems intensive gives zilch ta here you will see that the pc can get ta 331 such people have short span into the past reality on what went on in the world ceases five minutes to five days ago or so in the body of the session you are trying to send him out of pt if all pcs were like this tough case we would clear people with ruds since ta action gives direct index of case change if you dont get as much ta action in the body of the session as you do in running the rudiments please realize that the process is not running ta motion mirrors directly and immediately the amount of change which is being secured it is direct index of how much bank is changing or shifting so you handle the difficult case by giving ruds and havingness sessions case with good reality on the bank wouldnt get good ta on ruds ta on havingness or any cch or contact process means that the pc is becoming aware of the walls of the room what wall indeed his concept of mass is being shifted by confronting his environment it is not bank mass that is giving ta it is the mass of the walls of the room the pc is in shape to be audited because where is he going to be audited from furthermore he doesnt have the stability of pt to audit against so any attempt on your part to get him to address the track throws him into confusion he cant answer the auditing question because he has point of reference cases are audited against the reference point of pt oddly enough the memory of eight million years ago totally depends on knowing it was sight million years from specific time eg pt guy who is stuck in an electronic incident of three million years ago will get ta when you get him to look at his immediate vicinity otherwise hs will run problems intensive from point three million years ago which is an unstable point so you are running confusion against an instability but two confusions never made stability case that is wildly out of pt seldom answers the auditing command or executes it and auditing depends exclusively on getting the command executed the auditing cycle must occur every time the auditor opens his mouth on recall time you communicated if the time he commed is up the track from where he is stuck he cant recall it because it hasnt happened yet so he has to do something else so for instance he mocks up psychoanalyst against the auditor or he holds the two back corners of the room he does these things because he doesnt want to wasts the auditors time ta action on ruds and on the body of the session is the only reliable indication of this type of case in this situation it becomes important to prepare case dont try to plow the ground with cadillac it is the wrong vehicle if the pc isnt doing the command dont harass him do objective processes when the motion goes out of the ta do the body of the session with subjective processes the gradient scale of toughness of cases is proportional to the amount of ta they get on pt or nearpt processes ruds and havingness to get good reality on this point take pc who has been having an awful time with 3gaxx and run some ptps or some such and watch the ta fly first mentioned in tape 6210c23 shspec202a 3gaxx also mentioned in tape 6210c23 3gaxx following the rock slam and 6210c25 shspec209 3gaxx secondary prehav scale these tapes are confidential the process lists and handles some types of implants it unburdens the case and locates goals see also pp 332335 below and hcobs 8nov62 listing pack ii and 11nov62 3gaxx straightening up 3gaxx cases for more on 3gaxx running the pc must be there 332 before you audit him the auditing cycle requires the presence of the pc so give him lots of ruds and havingness and problems intensive on closetopt problem he can confront this type of pc will get sensation on list all right because he would get sensation from two days ago it is that unreal he has sensation because he is in the middle of confusion with referral point pt how do you expect him to be anywhere but in confusion thats what sensation basically is the pc in confusion give him pt then you can run him l ron hubbard type 3 idate131162 volnum1 issue211 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec211 entrance to cases 6211c13 shspec211 entrance to cases lrh starts by referring to recent bulletin hcob 11nov62 3gaxx straightening up 3gaxx cases the subject of entrance to cases is becoming broad and encyclopedic there is new routine r321 see also p 356 below the original 3ga was highly workable but insufficiently delineated routine 321 is 3ga plus all the improvements like tiger drilling it would probably work on any case that was wellprepared but we cant count on case being wellprepared preparation would be done with cchs and prepchecks there have been frailties in the preparation of cases that have made it necessary to develop things that werent really vital we rediscover havingness every six months it seems it has been six months since the last time matter how tricky your auditing question is if the pc isnt there it wont reach him or alter his case unusual solution will get to him either so when faced with the unusual do the usual the very ordinary the tricky developmental work has had uses and has brought us forward on wellprepared case tiger drilling the 850goal list is easy the pc doesnt protest all the time the pc who is not wellprepared isnt doing the commands and has dirty needle he never completes the auditing cycle the reads you get while tiger drilling arent coming from the po confronting anything they are coming from some automaticity even if the case is wellprepared you could still have difficulty doing r321 the goal could be absent from the list or on the list but so unreal to the pc that it would never answer up if confronted so you need process that overcomes the pcs enturbulated pt environment etc this process is 3gaxx 3gaxx is designed to totally grab the pcs attention and interest and to keep it where the rock slam is it will always be true that rock slam will produce interest it is sort of forced insessionness interest follows rock slam you are overwhelming the socalled natural defenses of the mind you use the rock slam channel find the goal find the pairs of items all along the channel by their rock slams you can pretty well overwhump almost anything in the pc if you can get on the trail of rock slam you will be asked to do miracles to audit in noisy environments on poorlyprepared cases for that you need very powerful processes 3gaxx is what you need it is designed to capture the pcs interest so much that he can only tell you what is in front of his face 333 there are three bank elements that are handled in 3gaxx 1 the rock slam channel 2 the goals channel 3 set of pairs that lead from the dimmest beginnings of the gpm up to the tiniest pair in pt the route between these pairs is travelled from pt back to the beginning the procedure is to 1 find the goal and then 2 find items that have built up by the existence of this goal this is path marked by rock slams 3gaxx has rules such as the rule that the pcs interest follows the rock slam since this is true the pc has choice but to be in session suppose the pc is protesting midruds whenever you get off the rock slam channel this would be because he is only in session as long as you are on the rock slam channel where he cant help being interested it could also be because he has been beaten with midruds to point where he cant stand them when you are getting his prehav level items by listing ww would prehav level the answers come ripping off his circuits when havingness is low circuits key in someone who is in indifferent contact with pt has his circuits keyed in circuits are gpm items or their cousins aunts or uncles 3gaxx deals out the circuits that the pc would normally be using anyhow so he has choice but to give them to you and thus you do get an auditing cycle you start out with dynamic assessment see pp 305308 for the general procedure use these questions 1 what isnt part of existence 2 who or what have you detested 3 who or what would you prefer not to associate with in listing and nulling these follow the rock slam note these commands might be the precursors of later pts rundown tech lrh recognizes the enturbulative effect of environmental factors on auditing though as yet there appears to be official form of ethics handling there seems to be an attempt to handle all of it through tech so you are doing 3gaxx and now you call his attention to pt to get midruds in and you have godawful time nothing quite cleans up if you have goofed and invalidated one of his items you will really be in the soup since he is allergic to pt which is where he would have to be to clean it up so process as beefy as 3gaxx must be done with expertise particularly when used on pc who is not well set up for it you have leeway for error when you have overwhelmed the natural defenses of the mind that is why untrained auditors shouldnt try to run these highpowered processes with r321 you can find the pcs goal whether he is ready to find it or not by entering the case with dynamic assessment by rock slam an additional method of entering the case is roll your own prehav see hcob 7nov62 roll your own prehav the prehav scale to be exact must be given by the pc in his own words so find the prehav level and ask the represent question get list and find the item which will be his perfect individual prehav level this procedure gets rid of the necessity for huge long assessments and you will probably wind up with rock slam this way you will list who or what would do that and get 334 terminal or oppterm it doesnt matter which the assessment can be done simply by calling each level assessing by elimination down to few items tiger drilling those items to one and saying consider committing overts against _______ this should turn on the slam so you get the item which is the protagonist or antagonist in the game which pursues from the fellow having had goal in the first place they are like pair of dumbbells there is also another pair of dumbbells the notpair pinned to the positive items electronically eg ww would smoke ww would not smoke ww would oppose smoking ww would oppose not smoking positive negative you can however safely ignore the negative items you could find the item get the oppose represent oppose that represent that etc etc you are not trying to clear somebody this way although you could theoretically by going back item by item down the rock slam channel it would be hard though lacking the goal it is easier to go down aways pick up the goal and then list it unburden the goal then find it and work with it if you kept discharging the case and at the same time disorienting the case you would get further and further from finding the goal you would really just be enturbulating the case say if you kept giving the pc items that didnt slam he would keep getting fuzzier and more confused this could occur when you went by detested person etc see p 333 see also p 243 above there is pair there which you have ignored if you go on to the dynamic assessment and the represent etc so your rule is to make pair when you get an item that rockslams you oppose it if it is still hot you represent it this isnt all that smooth when the pc is not clear the items can be out of order you have to pick your way through it the test by which you go is what is still slamming it will slam if you run get the idea of committing overts against itwithholding from it if it still slams it hasnt been opposed even if you think you got the oppterm the gpm straightens out only because you have gotten the pc to recognize the matter energy space and time that the item consists of it has been recognized and placed where it should be placed the pc has seen what it is opposed by and has gotten sensible about it this goes back to the earliest laws of the mind that lrh formulated namely that things are composed of 1 identities 2 similarities and 3 differences this is from dianetics the original thesis and dmsmh see note on p 198 above gpm is in state of total identification when you first greet it every item is every other item when you list you are bringing about similarity from an identity by causing the pc to find the item they the other items were all pinned to in the first place differentiation takes place and the thing starts blowing apart just calmly finding that the pc is rockslammer and telling him will make him significantly saner right there he was mad at the whole environment now he knows what hes mad at specifically eg scientology 335 ron etc now if we find who or what was mad at whatever he was slamming on scientology or whatever we would have pair that would tend to blow because slam is the meter manifestation of games condition its the unsuccessful effort to withdraw from the thing he must attack it takes two items minimally to make package one stick wont burn it takes two to make fight every package has at least two items and really four including the not pair ie you also have to find out what wasnt against scientology and what scientology isnt rockslammer is only bad off before he has been detected when he finds out what his target really is scientology and then finds out what would attack that target he will feel better he will start to shed that valence and he can be someone else but the more rock slam you leave behind you by leaving items the more the rock slam will diminish the pcs attention is on those bypassed items and he cant confront the items ahead of him since he only slams on things that can become real to him the slam fades out so you had better get all the things that he can confront if you have available parts of his line plot with unopposed items you can free up more of his attention by filling in those blanks so heres why you are doing 3gaxx you are releasing sufficient attention from fancied opposition in the environment so the pc is not distracted and going backtrack from the ruffled point of the environment as you go on he will get less and less confused and more and more able to find his goal eventually you find the goal after you have hatful of items by variety of methods you could take goal like to dance on eggs that fired only three times but which rocket reads once in awhile you can do represent list on that goal to get similar goal and pull apart goals you can list for the goal that given item would have cf expanded dianetics wants handled rundown but unless all this improves the pcs presence alertness and available attention you would do better to just give him problems intensive and cchs l ron hubbard type 3 idate151162 volnum1 issue212 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec212 terminals 6211c15 shspec212 terminals there is an item on the bulletin board about nixon we really clobbered him i hit him because he hit mary sue he was using the us secret service as sort of private gestapo all over washington which didnt seem right you will notice that after country has defeated country b customs of country b will show up in almost anyone will take on the color of his oppterm this is horrible but true people tend to think of themselves as the cowboy in the white hat and the oppterm as the cowboy in the black hat however the only real to tell whether you are dealing with terminal or an oppterm is whether it turns on pain or sensation pain shows that it is terminal sensation shows that it is an oppterm some people get tangled up because they consider themselves to be the guys in the black hat if you get terminal on the oppterm side or vice versa the consequence is great confusion such an item combination terminal turns on pain and sensation this is deteriorated package mark it in the center of the line plot its legitimate it is new terminal that has attributes of both terminal and oppterm sort of end of the road combination terminal which is lock on both the terminal chain and the oppterm chain 336 in national life you get succeeding generations of politicians performing as combination terminals the us defeats germany then somewhere up the track there is tendency towards democratic fascism in the us it is ok for democracy to exist as long as we can also operate gestapo its that sort of thing that i tend to keep an eye on you may not realize it but you are all members of secret society you have been for very long time it is the spg you can enlist anyone there are dues only performance is required it is the society for the prevention of government it is interesting that man hasnt yet realized that government is the cause of his wars pure government attacks an sp government thus producing combination terminal the pure government henceforth isnt so pure keep this up and you will get what we have in the way of government lrh recently received an invitation to be part of group that is supposed to figure out what should be done with governments and man and atom bombs all the group is doing is meeting in the hope that someone will come up with solution all they are doing is to get people in communication they havent approached governments the reason why government occupies so much of peoples attention is that governments have spokesmen and salesmen while individuals do not democracy is highly publicized but in democracy everything is the peoples fault so the head of the government has responsibility but the people have real choice this is real mess with salesmen you get more and more government individuals become less and less the end of this process is totalitarianism the only reason you collide with government is that you are selling the idea of the individual you see that bettering things by handling the individual is workable system so you push it this puts you up against the government because it is for the government this makes you revolutionary in totalitarian world whether you intend to revolt or not the perfect reply to communist is to tell him that you are an anarchist that is the one thing that he cannot handle he is claiming that communism wants to do away with the state and you force him to say that government is necessary thus you turn him into conservative anarchy has always been rampant in countries just before the communists took over anarchy is the one thing that the communist fears he has so many overts on anarchists that they have almost become sacred to him similarly the us government is becoming more and more communistic eg with its tax laws things wont get straightened out in the political arena they will just get more and more confused you can predict the politics of the future by looking at the opposing sides and combining the least desirable characteristics of both combination terminals in politics occur because the least admired characteristics tend to persist that which is least admired tends to persist we are going to get the worst of russia and the us combined into super state unless we stop it this is also the fate of any individual livingness alone will not lead to new highly desirable state because the above mechanism will occur in the course of handling cases you will get look at the eventual fate of any individual you process in the absence of further processing suppose you could locate the chief terminal and the chief oppterm in an individual without in any way relieving them you could take 337 the least desirable characteristics of both and get the combination terminal the person would become in few generations those terminals and oppterms that are near the top will produce new pair but first they will produce new single terminal the new combination terminal as the gpm flies off you will see that this had been taking place the freedom that is there to be freed is fantastic because all cases are in very deteriorated state when we first discovered the tremendous power that the basic postulate of an individual could exert over him in the course of creating the sections of the gpm we tended to see it as something brand new despite the fact that it is mentioned in the definition of the first dynamic in dianetics the original thesisi the dynamic of self consists of the dynamic thrust to survive as an individual to obtain pleasure as an individual and to avoid pain it covers the general field of food clothing and shelter personal ambition and general individual purpose p 31 see also advanced procedures and axioms p 42 and p 270 above thetan does various basic things following the laws governing theta as formulated in the axioms however he also splinters off and postulates some portion or specialization of them he tries to go forward with this specialization as an individual purpose and trying to effect this purpose moves on with lot of accumulated mass and things like terminals oppterms combination terminals items upsets etc thus the thetan builds up section of the gpm then he postulates something else and builds up another section of the gpm that dwindles out it gets blown up thoroughly and the thetan gets sort of out of it he forgets it utterly then he makes up new individual purpose actually all these purposes are in controversion to the basic laws of this universe theta and the purposes of thetans and if there is any reason why it builds up mass it is that it is an alteris of the axioms the thetan is an individual already in games condition with his fellows and the universe then he decides to be even more individual and makes basic postulate it is this basic postulate that we are dragging up as goal this postulate is counter to the agreements on the structure of the universe as contained in the axioms so the thetan is now individuated out to the degree that he has pitted himself against the whole lot what we are finding out as we find items turn on somatics and clear the individual is that he hasnt gotten away with it there is the gpm and it is killing him he cant even execute his individual purpose or goal because it fights his own more basic agreements postulates etc he has called himself liar by violating these agreements eg the axioms and thus he has departed into superindividuality as the individual goes forth postulating new goal he is flying in the teeth of all his former agreements so now he gets to point where he explodes out of the bank then he postulates new individuation new basic purpose he lives this one out when he finally gets out of it he adds it to the old stuff that he has accumulated each new purpose gets messed up faster and faster he finds more and more things he cant do and that he can longer confront eventually he wont even explode out of the mass anymore one day he says row come its all black and he wont get out of the gpm again 338 this is hell an oblivion of total pain and sensation whats hell in religions theyll have some metaphorical method of trying to communicate but if they were talking about hell this is hell they recognize there is something waiting for them in the future and they try to shorten it up and say its the next life and this time youll die and youll go to it well thats just enthusiasm the only alternative to this grisly picture is scientology but people have been saved before too many times on the track eg by the autodafe of the inquisition thats why they are decidedly reluctant to be saved by scientology someone who gets mad at scientology and refuses further processing is fool he isnt aware of his future of total pain and sensation which is hell but thetans have long history of being sold pieinthesky so they are likely to be skeptical about what scientology has to offer someone who has been sold on heaven and hasnt found it and who knows that hell is possible begins to regard the idea of freedom with some doubt he has been straightened out before and has been cheated this area of betrayal comes up in the course of clearing someone the offer of help restimulates this area and the pc will fight help all the way until he gets reality on what is happening the kindest way to handle him is to give him fast reality on the fact that you mean business do something for him subjectively so that he will realize that he is on some kind of real road to truth the pc whose trust level is shot alterises commands doesnt answer etc the auditor can feel uncomfortable about this the healing sciences havent helped with their general ineffectiveness in most things wonder the pcs trust level is so low this is the main thing that gets in the way of dissemination the individual has fought the physical universe and the laws of the physical universe after agreeing to them he now alterises them since those laws concern matter energy space and time he starts accumulating mest that is what puts mest in his bank then he makes an individual purpose that has nothing to do with these other purposes he tries to go up against these other purposes with this individual purpose that causes lot of mass to accumulate then he does this again and again etc all this is true but this activity must have been based on very low level of confidence and trust anyway to have gone to all this trouble with all the individuation etc the thetan must have had very low level of trust and confidence he must have thought that what was going on was detrimental or he wouldnt have taken all this trouble to individuate from it most pcs are mad at the physical universe to some degree now here is something ive never told you before but it follows from the sixtyfour lectures of the 1952 philadelphia lectures the physical universe will stay there for the individual until the individual gets back to the first individuating goal that he made after agreeing to the axioms at this point you would think that the pc would hit total ot but he wont he still has to handle the axioms you will now have to back up through the axioms the pc at this point in processing would start telling you about the axioms even if he had never heard of them they are getting ready to blow 339 the individuals agreement to the axioms his contribution to the axioms to that degree is in all probability his first basic trust you may have to go back to the axioms and run them sooner or later the pc will collide with them going backward the purposes that you will run into at first are all purposes that are individuations from the basic purpose you have to go long way back to pick up more than the first dynamic even today the fellow is generally on an inversion of the first you will find that there are seven dynamics that will invert on you you must reverse the inversion process before the pc gets to straight first dynamic he then has to go quite ways before he gets sight of the other dynamics that is what you are tackling in every pc there is deteriorated trust in everything not only in his fellow man but also in organizations group activities and any effort to do something for him he starts to get nervous when you start to do anything for him because he knows that that has always been dangerous for him you are reversing his experiential track so he is going back into areas that he thinks are dangerous and thinking these areas are dangerous he is nervous this applies to every pc what is important is your skill as an auditor the smoothness of your model session the positiveness of what you are doing the fact that you can produce result in the pc in which he has reality these things make him realize that you are going in the direction of freedom the pc may be so downscale that when he sees that he is going towards freedom he cant have it because it looks too good and you get into another wrigglewraggle you can add to the above phenomenon the idea that if you existed and if you freed man and did things for the physical universe then this person couldnt execute the first goal you will run into in processing him this goal one is not the first goal that the pc made it is the first one you find with this addition youve got rockslammer his distrust is not built just on goal one it goes earlier and is built on the quicksand that everybody is made of to handle him you have to find the oppterm to what he is rockslamming on then it tends to blow up his whole viewpoint on the subject of scientology will shift see hcob 23nov62 urgent routine 212 opening procedure by rockslam an hparca skill this bulletin gives r212 procedure at this point r212 is also known as 3gaxx for rock slammers evidently it is form of 3gaxx that can be done by lower than class iv auditor many other bulletins and tapes on r212 follow soon as your auditing is less than perfect you rekindle or permit to remain all the morass of distrust that has been generated down the track all the betrayals of promises of heaven all his experience of hell you can flub little but if you let the case drift too far out without win and you will key in the whole background of there is heaven and you will pay the price the individuals reality on hell is much greater than his reality on heaven thus the longer you take to produce result on pc the harder it is to get the result because of the distrust factor 340 you cant say positively that person isnt rockslammer because he may have to be processed awhile before it shows up some rockslammers are below being rockslammers at first the pc may at first simply be nattery and then you have to rely on intuition there is absolute test of absolution except persistent case progress rockslamming relates to the degree of overting in your direction and his belief that if you did not exist he could achieve his basic goal once you discover and he discovers that he is rockslammer the discovery of it tends to pull its teeth all you have to do is to list the oppose list to the thing on which he is rockslamming and it will blow up in smoke if its an auditor write an opposition list to an auditor and get the first pt package capable auditor should be able to straighten this out in two or three hours you can list goal against any terminal or oppterm that rockslams sometimes you will wind up with the persons goal if so opposition it unhandled rockslammers will frequently become combination terminals squirrels for instance combine scientology with something else because they realize that they are as crazy as loon to be attacking it l ron hubbard type 3 idate151162 volnum1 issue213 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec213 clearing technology 6211c15 shspec213 clearing technology we are pretty well there technologically although things can still be sorted out and neatened up more data keeps appearing of course when you are on top of the mountain you can see alternate routes up just dont forget the way you got there and could get others up one reason you dont like to see long goals lists is that you dont like having to tiger drill every goal it takes an average of minute per goal even when the case is running well if the case is not wellprepared the pc will have persistent dirty needle we used to call this the pcs needle pattern it means that ruds are out and it is not ok this dirty needle that you see on goals lists wont clean up with midruds persistent dirty needle and dirty read an instant read that goes bzzzt on the needle are not the same thing if ruds are in and the pc is wellprepared dirty needle means the list is incomplete or you could have listed from the wrong question eg the wrong prehav question actually if you use the right question and the item is on the list even if it is the pcs first list when you null it the dirty needle if any disappears after pc is prepared the only reason thereafter that dirty needle occurs and midruds dont handle it is that the list is not complete the item is the missed withhold that dirties the needle therefore assuming prepared pc there are two variables that cause dirty needle on nulling 1 wrong question 2 list incomplete this makes it little more difficult you may have to use trial and error to discover what it is details on assessing goals there is new experimental process you can assess the long list of goals then only tiger drill the ones that stay in after the single assessment the pc should let the auditor know if pain turns on pain goes deeper than the meter and it may indicate the presence of the item when felt or few items earlier on the list 341 you can get the pc to list goals from terminals and oppterms using the commands what goals would terminal have and if you were oppterm what goal of yours would be impossible to achieve just having the pc write out goals list is very therapeutic even on raw meat reading something once has minimal restimulation beyond three times you have started running process so you can go over goals list once and the only thing hot enough to give the pc somatics will be the goal so watch for the somatic while on that assessment another method of goals finding is known as the prepcheck you will get an early mest clear with enough use of the method described in hcob 21mar62 prepchecking data when to do what lot of people sit around not looking they do not look that is their motto problem that has shown up is that after two or three problems intensives the pc keeps saying that such and such is his goal and he wants to know what to do about it in other words you tiger drill the pc until his goal reads the vital part is to assess the right problem if you run the right one smoothly run it dont q and keep ruds in the pc will tend to go mest clear and the goal floats into view it could take four or five problems intensives this would be very simple way to do it it may not work on all oases maybe if we added routine 2 button or two to the problems intensives using roll your own prehav see pp 333334 above against problems intensive we might find the goal this way the only thing wrong with problems intensive is to find truly selfdetermined change on the queen elizabeth reg thorpe was auditing lrh and lrh only found two real selfdetermined changes this lifetime so we can assume that most pcs are answering fallaciously we should realize that there is trick built into the problems intensive you get the pc to give you change that he believes to have been selfdetermined then you find the prior confusion and the determination for that change so there is probably something wrong with the question there shouldnt be trick to it you should just use change not selfdetermined change we formerly asked for selfdetermined changes so as not to have him give engrams however the prepcheck buttons are powerful enough to run the pc through engrams he wont get stuck in an engram anyway if he doesnt have missed withhold that is what sometimes makes pcs curl up in ball and go into an engram while you are tiger drilling the missed withhold pull the missed withhold and he will come right out of the dramatization the pcs effort to withhold is what pulls him back into the incident because he cant be in pt so you could ask for times you decided to change then the pc doesnt have to tell you lie to answer bad assessment can give you ta so in handling problems intensives keep your eye on the ta you should get ta in the first twenty minutes on the first button if not drop the first change and do new assessment 342 l ron hubbard type 3 idate201162 volnum1 issue215 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec215 fundamentals of auditing 6211c20 shspec215 fundamentals of auditing there are probably thousands of rules you could go by in auditing but the way to audit has only few fundamental basic rules without which auditing does not occur these are the senior data of auditing 1 auditing is third dynamic activity 2 the basis of it is communication 3 audit the pc in front of you violate those and you have had it matter how many other rules you are following never neglect those few little fundamentals an auditor can forget about communication and sit there as an individuated island in this case matter what is right about what he does he wont be auditing the pc dont be first dynamic using communication to audit book or nothing if the auditor and the pc are group and if they are in communication and the auditor is auditing the pc in front of him then auditing will occur and results will be obtained one day all of sudden long blue spark hits you and you say to yourself maybe if i ask the pc i can find out and communication starts to occur what st hill graduate misses when he gets back into the field is any feeling that auditing can happen people dont know that there is right way to audit also st hill graduates have gotten over being nervous or selfconscious about auditing if you overlook these few little fundamentals of auditing you then need thousands of rules to handle whatever comes up there is right way to audit described above relatively muzzled auditing uniformity of sessions these are desirable if an auditor is going to add bunch of nonsense into the lineup but muzzled auditing is just curative measure to prevent people who dont know the above basics from adding nonsense that has nothing to do with auditing the other part of the situation is that the human race knows nothing of third dynamic activities or communication what passes for communication in the wog world is unduplicatable there are completed cycles of communication and communication consists exclusively of dispersed mishmash of invalidation and evaluation the rules about q and tr4 and host of others are to keep these aberrated habits out of the session if you didnt have tr4 the green auditor would slip right into thinkthink figurefigure evaluation invalidation etc none of these have anything to do with the communication cycle compute should not be part of the doingness of the auditor cf the old definition of an auditor one who listens and computes in hcob 26may59 man who invented scientology the answer to the pcs origination that black is white is thank you it is not oh it isnt or thats neat thought or whatever every time the pc asks you to do something it is because you have done instead of acknowledged when the pc originated the pc has begun to control you you have driven him out of session and into thoughts about the pt environment by not letting communication cycle occur to the degree that you break down the communication cycle you break down the third dynamic activity you individuate the pc and after that he starts running the session he has gone on selfaudit you will have trouble with the pc in direct ratio to the number of times you have not permitted the pc to originate 343 because the pc is aberrated it is very easy to individuate him it is quite trick to keep the pc from individuating and going on selfaudit as the pc gets better he is less susceptible to individuation his thinkingness should get more under the auditors control as he goes along if the pc gets interrupted by the auditor such that his communication cycle keeps getting messed up his thinkingness will get less and less under auditor control the number of times that you have to get the midruds in is direct index of the amount of thinkingness that pc individuated from the session has been engaging in that is how the auditing third dynamic gets broken down into two first dynamics two first dynamics do not make third dynamic they make games condition an auditors perception is not the perception of an individual looking at another individual it is third dynamic perception there is knowingness about whether the pc is in session or not that an auditor will have when he is genuinely perceptive or intuitive an auditors perceptivity is bad to the degree that he departs from the third dynamic back to the first dynamic thetans communicate on the same wavelengths used in space opera you can spot an arc break before the pc knows he has it if you are attuned to this form of communication you used to know and recognize other thetans by their feeling or wavelength and not by their bodies dolls know each other despite not having names as rule it is done by direct perception you can forge passport but try to forge wavelength this is not mest communication and it doesnt require or use mest or even wavelengths as via esp investigators like rhine err by testing esp against mest and by entering proof into the computations proof is one of the most aberrative buttons on the track if you walk through forest with gun concealed in your pocket you will not see bird or squirrel why because you are emanating menace as long as you have the gun and the game gets the communication even if the scientist doesnt the animals dont have to see the gun some thetans evidently emanate more than other thetans this is also true of pcs you apparently get more of relay from some than from others this is fascinating subject as long as you dont pull it down into mest through the button called proof we tried to process people along this line the biggest indication we have that it exists is the effect of auditing on unaudited third parties say pc is having trouble with person b we process he doesnt have any communication with b yet the problem with b evaporates furthermore frequently b often then tries to communicate with this is so true that you could legitimately chew out as auditor for not having solved bs problem with similarly an ri will always produce trouble for you if you are deathly afraid of oil companies rest assured that you will get bum stock short changed etc process the pc and the oil company will stop giving the pc hard time there is then perception factor but when the individual is in games condition on the third or fourth dynamic say with women he cant perceive perception cant bridge across games gap so the auditor makes mess of it every time he audits women ones perception in such case inverts and one reads good wave as bad one or vice versa the auditor cant perceive what is happening so he dubs it in he writes script in session he thinks and figures etc the pc 344 is an enemy and therefore the auditor doesnt dare to confront or read him the more the auditor is in this state the less reliable perception there is and the more substitute perception you will find taking the form of think think substitute perception look dont think direct perception only gets invalidated by those who are to some degree in games condition with what they are trying to audit or perceive they cant confront so they cant perceive so they do think instead of look they figure it all out you have to figure out the way the gpm goes it is complicated and aberration doesnt emanate so you need the meter as an aid but as far as the pc is concerned you should be able to read him pretty directly but if you cant confront him if you dont want to if you dont want anything to do with him you are going to get substitute in there and that substitute is think and youre going to go into consideration of what is going on and you get script writing at its worst the auditor sees an arc break when there isnt one he doesnt see one when it is present etc tension and complicatedness in session divides the auditors attention and cuts down auditor perception thereby impairing his performance if the auditor takes some weird action you know that his perception dropped out the session will be as clumsy as with the sort of limitation of perception that occurs when one gives demonstration session and has ones attention split up lrh has experienced that he flubs in tv demonstrations more often than normally so that gives him some reality on what less perceptive auditor lives with when you dont acknowledge the pcs origination he will cut down his transmission power which will make it that much harder for you to perceive him he will also go off on selfaudit so you get two individuals conducting disrelated activity one fellow is busy nulling the list and the other fellow is trying to keep his rudiments in the pc tends to individuate to the degree that you q and with him and prevent him from blowing something by not just letting him get it off and acknowledging lot of auditors think that if the pc mentions something it means that you have to do something about it so that the pc can blow it the fact that you say or do something in response to pcs origination or anybodys origination tells him that he hasnt gotten it off he hasnt blown it it is all communication activity when something is fully communicated and the communication cycle is complete it is blown the degree that pc cant blow things is the degree that he has been q and ad with after you have and ad three or four times in the session what is the use of trying to patch it up now you have to have rules to cure the arc break what the hell were you doing getting an arc break in the first place the rules for getting out of swamps are lrhs and with auditors who got into them through not knowing fundamentals an arc break occurs fifteen to ninety minutes before most auditors perceive it and then they try to clean up the arc break that has just happened which is the wrong one to be cleaning up it is inexcusable for the pc to find out that he has an arc break before the auditor does where is the auditor 345 what is wrong with the auditors perception when the pc mired as he is in the bank can perceive better than the alert auditor the pc never forgives this because it proves to him conclusively that the auditor has individuated and that he is not in third dynamic situation and doesnt have an auditor it is unforgivable because the pc doesnt forgive it if that is what your auditing is like you wont have sessions you will have dogs breakfasts but if you are alert you will find out ages before the pc does that something is wrong dont harass the pc when there is nothing wrong but if your own perception is up and the pc doesnt feel right to you just get in 2wc with him to find out how it is going and persist enough to be sure without badgering him there is nothing wrong with making mistake in session the only thing that is unforgivable is for the pc to catch it before you do perception then comes above technical perfection because you can always handle mistake if you find out about it before the pc does eg the auditor says is something going on there just light 2wc the pc says auditor well did you have thought of some kind there pc i well actually yes you used the wrong command that is ok because you spotted it first before it turned into an arc break that the pc incidently would have attributed to something later in the session if you hadnt spotted it at its inception if the pc could be relied on to spot the correct source of an arc break by himself he wouldnt need an auditor at all because he would just blow his arc breaks by inspection if he has got one he has misassigned it qed the degree of the apparent arc break is related to the number of unobserved arc breaks that have preceded it the first arc break in session is always quite previous to where the pc thinks it is this is true of lists where the pain turns on before the pc notices it the pc is always late because the bank is instantaneous and he isnt he wrongly attributes what is happening to ask him to think anything at all is miraculous if he knew what was going on he wouldnt need an auditor the communication cycle of homo sapiens consists of 1 i originate 2 you invalidate 3 i notis an auditing session is based on far simpler communication cycle than homo sapiens imagines you have to audit the pc in front of you not the meter the final step of matching up the items must be done by the pc not the meter if you go on the basis of if the pc said it it isnt true you are again being homo sap there are some things on which the pc isnt right he is never right on misemotional point but on what the score is and on whether it is the right item yes he can tell you that correctly you could assess list without the meter if you did it very carefully asking the pc where the pain was there is substitute for putting the pc in session and auditing him if you get tangled up in all the rules it is just that many rules between you and the pc that are forbidding auditing if those rules are used to prevent third dynamic to interrupt or upset communication cycle or to get out of auditing the pc in front of you then those rules are not for that session there are many styles of auditing but there is substitute for auditing what is auditing to the pc it is alleviation of his upsets and reaching his basic purposes and doing down the gpm he 346 wont let you near his bank and he wont forgive you if you dont run it out nevertheless if he is making gains and getting someplace the pc will take anything off of you on the other hand your auditing could be the last word in technical perfection but if you are not using it to get somewhere with the pc he will be arc broken all the way there is right way to audit it is directly straightforwardly the good auditor uses the tools that he has to get something done the bad auditor doesnt know that there is right way but thinks that there are thousands of right ways and that he has to dream up new one in session that is just another way to figurefigure your way out of giving session the more you add to the basics of auditing the less it will work the auditor who audits smoothly by pattern gets the most done rules are valid but should never interferes with the three basics discussed in this lecture 1 auditing is third dynamic activity 2 the basis of it is communication 3 audit the pc in front of you l ron hubbard type 3 idate271162 volnum1 issue218 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec218 routine 212 part 1 6211c27 shspec218 routine 212 part 1 poor r212 the first and fundamental error of r212 showed up lrh made mistake by giving some leeway on list one dont add motivatorish items to the list the list must contain only nouns verbs adjectives or adverbs when lrh expanded list one it escaped his notice that lot of practice with 3gaxx would invite lot of things to be entered onto the list by the pc even though r212 says that it is not the pcs list so list one issue two must contain only scientology nouns r212 is to put the case in condition so that it can progress towards clearing as well as being in itself clearing process what we are fighting in clearing today is slow progress with r321 you will sooner or later get the item that is holding up the case see p 332 above but with r212 you will get it sooner you are looking for the items that pin the pc to present time you want to eradicate the items that have been keyed in by present time which now hold the pc in ptp in r212 you dont just oppose any item that once rockslammed you always start from scratch matter what has been done previously you take list one even if it was done before start with the first list find what rockslams oppose it etc the main discovery is that any time you get whisper on list you can represent it and get rock slam on it the rationale of r212 is that as long as the gpm is keyed in in pt the pc is left with full ptp and will show case gain you dont have to find his goal to set him straight this is all based on the observation made in 1949 that what needs to be run to resolve the case always has little tag sticking out like taximeter flag there are lots of these little tags sticking out but most come out easily and can be thrown away however every once in awhile you get one that is tied to something it was also known that case gain wont occur over ptp the gpm would be the biggest ptp person could have the only way you get rid of it is to identify it very thoroughly in its various parts this is what the tag gets stuck in 347 if part of the gpm is in pt walking around and the other part is buried in the bank the pc will go around feeling that it is the visible part that is keeping him from getting clear he never looks to see what is opposing it and that item will remain so undisclosed that the person could go all the way to clear and still have it he might by fluke key out the rest of the gpm and still have that buried part of the gpm pair this gives you bypassed item par excellence the probability that he would go clear under these circumstances is very miniscule to be sure it takes awhile to build up rock slam it is not from pt directly that the pc gets the rock slam it is from confusing pt with some opposition mass in the bank the pc hasnt even seen the terminal in the bank that faces the opposition mass he has made mistake he has mistaken something in the environment for an opposition mass in the bank and he cant see his terminal in the bank he thinks he is opposed to something in pt when it is just an oppterm that he has confused it with he is in this oppterm but he never puts it on the list so it never blows and he doesnt opposition it you will get recurring item as the pc lists it recurs because something is missing namely the other half of the package the half that he is being person doesnt look at things that he is stuck in that is how the bank accumulates the person is too close to it to look at it the recurring item lacking an oppterm to balance it creates ptp in itself with this condition the pc will make little or case gain if the pc werent pinned to pt he would still have this trouble it is part of every case to some degree let us define rockslammer as anyone who slams in pt on any item that is part of the gpm at first neither we nor he can determine which item he is slamming on one fine day you make list on something and it doesnt immediately go out on tiger drilling the tiger drill is what saves our bacon it tells us whether the worm is still in the ground in r212 you pick up the trace list it out and get slamming item if the item was accurately assessed and if it doesnt go out with the tiger drill then it must be stuck in the gpm therefore you can represent it and you will get slam so one fine day he accidentally puts an item on his present time environment list now he is longer able to not confront it when you oppose it he now doesnt feel bad about it you have discharged the mass here is another place where r212 differs from 3gaxx r212 deals with the tags the locks to pt and blows them on r212 the items blow up and go pffft on 3gaxx items stay in there in concrete and brass because you are diving into the bank to find the fundamental goal you are reaching for deeper items 3gaxx delivers goals but not pt when you have an item that is in pt you will get more fireworks the amount of case gain that you will get from r212 is sometimes fantastic all the pcs lifelong worry has evaporated watch out for doing misassessment on list 1a and getting deeper than you intended this is not likely to happen on list one where he doesnt make the list if the question was in pt what have you been upset about and he gives you something like dragons or spaceships just pretend to write it down dont put it on the list you will get terminal and an oppterm from such an item but they wont do the pc much good in pt you could use them to get goals but that doesnt get rid of ptps you could 348 get big read on an item like this bigger than you would normally get on list one or list 1a if you take up dragons you are not handling any pt restimulation you will be led astray if you dont keep in mind that r212 is an effort to locate one of the gpm items as it seems to be in pt to the pc and find its oppterm and if you succeed youve taken away the ptp the ptp is below the pcs recognition of what it is that he is worried about which is why you wouldnt get the ptp by running ptps there is heavy charge on this anything with rock slam has heavy standoffishness connected with it rock slam item is like guy at night shining flashlight in your eyes you cant see who it is and you dont want to look at it but you have to the pc cant look at rock slam item and he cant look away from it unless you get it out of pt he doesnt have enough attention units to look at the bank if he can be sufficiently aware of the piece of the gpm that is in pt to be nervous about it he can cognite on it other things equally part of gpms are so buried that he cant even slam on them they are too tough for him they wont read or be real to him until later when the case is unburdened more person whos getting off motivators is being an oppterm to himself hes out of valence hes not even in his own terminal line he will therefore turn on sensation all over the place the terminal is always at cause if you try to list something causative for the oppterm eg who or what would the oppterm oppose or who or what would the oppterm do something to instead of ho or what would oppose the oppterm you will get total stuck needle misemotion etc this is the wrong way to phenomenon if you get rid of problem on which the pc has great reality the pc will have tremendous resurgence when you do skilled r212 that is the result that you will get even though the pc doesnt even know that he has the problem in order to handle the problems in his environment he must not have problem on scientology the session is closer to the pc than the rest of his environment therefore in doing r212 you take his scientology problems away before you take the other environment problems away get them out of the way and watch the pcs relief if you arent seeing it you are doing something wrong l ron hubbard type 3 idate271162 volnum1 issue219 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec219 routine 212 part ii 6211c27 shspec219 routine 212 part ii lrh has been auditing r212 for about eighteen months now and he has made all the mistakes the procedure as now released is the nomistake way to do it as an invariable action even when it is done perfectly it will occasionally lay an egg why because you might pick up an item on the first assessment that isnt part of gpm and the cleanup that it gets on tiger drilling may not clean it up entirely in that case you are currying dead horse ie you are not going anywhere the source of the dead horse is some withholds or something on the item when it is not part of the gpm what is dead horse it is list whether represent or an oppose list that contains wide slams after you have gotten midruds in for the session if you have gotten nothing but dirty reads and dirty needles and nothing has slammed by the time you get up to fifty items you will lay an egg the best thing to do is to carry it to fifty items and if there is slam abandon it 349 the likeliest way to get dead horse list is wrong assessment the auditor doesnt check if he is in doubt about read he missed reads arc breaks the pc etc you can also have an item reading on an arc break because the pc doesnt understand the word the emeter is reality indicator another way to get misassessment is for the auditor to misduplicate what the pc said on listing and to write down something else then when the auditor assesses it the pc will protest it since it is not what he intended if you dont understand what the pc said you have to get it understood even if he arc breaks every time you ask him the way you ask pc to repeat something is to take responsibility for not understanding in way that doesnt challenge the pc you can ask him to spell it thats fine unless he cant spell do not repeat the item after the pc it will drive him around the bend it can make him feel like he is spinning and it tends to shut him up dont ask did you say _______ that causes him to protest and can leave mark on the list it also looks like you are correcting him also never point to an item on list dont ever point towards pc anyway cf not pushing in anchor points the thetan will put his theta beams against that finger and his theta beams will get bent this includes pointing to list items it makes wrong items stay in pc must be able to put anything on list but he must never be allowed to take anything off if he wants word changed take it down and add it as new separate item eg the pc says oh that should be cow and not the cow acknowledge and add cow to the list at the bottom of the list and leave the cow on the list if you null list that has given you persistent dirty needle and then oppose that you wont wind up with much the invariable actions of r212 eliminate that pretty well if you are listing on list and nothing is slamming get your midruds in but dont get them in when the pc originates if the auditor isnt sure whether or not he is doing it right and has guilty conscience about it that auditor is very vulnerable because he thinks he might be committing overts therefore he tends to withdraw from his pcs even an auditor who is doing letterperfect auditing can be shaken up by pc who snarls about midruds being put in treat this as an origin when the pc is protesty keep him talking dont punish him with the missed withhold question but get it handled sneakily by finding what you havent found out about his state of mind or something then go ahead and get the midruds in that is the way to handle this situation not with q and the next big source of dead horses is an incomplete list if the pc says that last item he gave you is it that is sure sign that the list is incomplete and that there is slamming item coming up dont quit listing when the pc tells you that the last item he gave you was it what he means is that is the last safe item the list is incomplete and the rock slam is just over the horizon and the pc has chickened out dont ever quit until the list is complete the pc will never forgive you for not getting the item however much he protests further listing so get the list done that is the only road out unless the pc has legitimate beef for instance if the pc insists that an item is reading on protest check protest clean it up and recheck it dont take items from what the pc is giving you as protest or 2wc that is robbing the pc 350 in the process of listing list you are liable to run into dwindling or sporadic rock slam if you dont get an item that slams while listing you dont have list the classic dwindling rock slam is common dont stop listing just because the rock slam stops you can get midruds in and ask the question you are listing from to see if it reads that is not certain but it is good indicator the proof that list is incomplete is that when you are nulling and the needle is dirty when you ask did you think of something the pc gives you something that doesnt clean up the needle if you find yourself having to keep using this question to clean the needle it is an indicator that the list is incomplete it also invites more items the pcs arc breaks about not completing the list do not stem from the auditor or auditing flubs they come entirely from the pcs unwillingness to confront when list is complete the pc will be willing to go on listing forever he only balks when the list is incomplete so any balk by pc is an indication of an incomplete list so you keep going on list until you dont have to get midruds in to null it on assessing list two consecutive items in almost always means that the midruds have gone out the list will be more than ten to twenty items long but some pcs go for long lists 500 items or so 80150 items is more usual anything that restrains pc or keeps him from giving complete list will wreck r212 as well as 3gaxx the more you harass or worry pc the less you will get done dont ever yap at pc about his dirty needle it does good never stop pc from listing you can get as many as three dwindling rock slams from one item there is an accidental on list one since you didnt just do list midruds arent in so get them in before you assess list one one reason not to let the pc add items to list one is that once you start the pc is listing and you will have to let him list it out or you will have dirty needle so just dont start in r212 what you are trying to do is to find tag first in scientology then in the present time environment off of gpm that is hooked into pt by the nature of the bank you are doing this because if it is there the pc has chronic ptp recognize that the other side of the package the side that opposes the pt item is keyed in all the time recognize also that it is lie to say that it is in pt it is only keyed in to pt the moment you start your represent list the pc will fly out of pt thats fine on represent what else is there to list on the represent list very likely the pc will go back track recall 1 identities 2 similarities 3 differences see p 198 above the pc has the gpm mass identified with pt item the ptp is in pt because of aaa the gpm item is identified with the item in pt minds being what they are when you represent anything you are peeling identifications off of it this is not true of opposing listing is auditing by taking anything someone is worried about and by representing items the pc will see similarities instead of identities get the represent off first that helps him differentiate you could do this as an assist not even on the meter using eg what does bellyache 351 represent to you also many pt items dont have opposites you need the represent step for them also in fact any time you say who or what would _______ you are really doing represent list so it is therapeutic because it separates out items it separates what is true from what is false the more identified person is with something the more items will come off of that thing as you list or null you are auditing like crazy this is solid auditing and about the soundest and most condensed auditing you can do it produces the most gain per auditing hour so long lists are lots of auditing every time you null you are differentiating done right getting items it is fantastic l ron hubbard type 3 idate291162 volnum1 issue220 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec220 r212 theory and practice part i 6211c29 shspec220 r212 theory and practice part i there are many indicators and few stabilities about lists there is only one absolute rule about lists that we have as stable datum list must be nullable there is difference between an indication and rule the following gives some indications first of all where there is rock slam on the list you have dead horse list dead horses consume most of the auditors time in r212 so this is of interest but if after fifty items with rock slam if the pc is still interested go on to seventy or eighty if there are rock slams by then unload list with slam wont produce an item on the other hand rock slam on list doesnt guarantee that you will find an item nullable list is list that you can go down without getting midruds in every eight to ten items to clean up dirty needle if you find that you have to put in midruds this often that is an indicator that you may be on dead horse the study of what makes nonnullable list is point of orientation from which to study assessment there are three sources of nonnullable list the first is wrong source the thing from which the list is being listed is improper there is way to establish this on an early list one assessment the item could be one that merely parallels the gpm without ever leading into it it can also be wrong source because you are opposing the wrong item maybe it rockslammed and turned on sensation you list from it then when you null the needle gets dirty even after you have extended the list it could have looked perfect when you listed it and still not be nullable what happened was that the items rock slam wasnt solid it was lock on the gpm rock slam needs something to lean on for you to wind up with something by using it when you have reliable item wall to discharge against you will find the opposed item if you have clean needle on an item that is not reliable item if you oppose it the list is never going to end you are cutting out paper dolls from the gpm you are just picking off locks from the gpm if sensation turned on however be sure to continue to list until the somatic turns off even if the list goes nowhere you can settle for light case of sensation get off the horse and find another item from your list one dead horse lists do produce some gain pcs can cognite etc dont stay with it forever unload when the pc feels pretty good if the pc has interest gets cognitions and has rock slams this guarantees that the list is dead horse however the presence of these indicators doesnt guarantee nullable list 352 another way to foul up and get nonnullable list is to audit the case in the presence of tremendous missed withholds thats rare getting ruds in should be enough to handle this situation actually it is really the missing item that gives the pc feeling of having missed withhold the third source of trouble is the incomplete list an incomplete list may look like nonnullable list if you find this to be the case unload it is rule that list must be nullable so at the point where you find that list is nonnullable go back to list one nullable list is one where items go out easily and the needle stays pretty clean and cleans up easily if it gets dirty during nulling it is good idea to check suppress about once page as you null because suppressed list acts like complete list you dont have to go over what you have nulled if suppress reads just clean up the suppress button get used to how many items need to be listed before you get rock slams this depends on how identified the case is the more jammed up and messed up the pc is the longer the list will go the odd case that is very heavily identified may go 150 items before rockslamming another lighter case may go fifteen or twenty items the ta doesnt necessarily indicate the degree of identification mass doesnt necessarily equal identification and some items are massier than others what if the pc has an item solid steel the dead thetan case will require lot of listing he will need represent lists by the carload getting rock slams the pc will feel better and eventually the list one will get hotter and hotter the mechanics of it are that essentially we have new therapy listing is auditing lrh knew that listing on goal was auditing now it is clear that listing in general is auditing listing an opposition list to anything that continues to rockslam ie reliable item is auditing the more magnitudinous the read the more reality the pc has on the thing anything that reads is safe to list you could develop process for say sick pc you could find out what is bothering him he says my liver you check it for read if it reads you do represent list with what would represent liver to you pretty soon he has more liver trouble you could even assess it by interest without meter the thing that combines interest and reality is the rock slam it is also ridge wherein everything is identified the dynamics are collapsed eg the food faddist when you hit the button you get an automatic release it is not that the pc is thinking so to summarize what makes nonnullable list 1 wrong source faulty assessment eg of list one b the thing from which the list is being listed is improper this may not be auditor error on early list one assessments there is way to be sure that you have the right thing to oppose or represent the item could be one that merely parallels the gpm without ever leading into it c using nonri to oppose it could look perfect when you list it and still not be nullable 2 auditing the case in the presence of many missed withholds this is rare 3 list is incomplete 353 an indicator for nullable list is that it comes out with interest and positiveness so the rule is that list must not be continued that is being invalidated by the pc that is overlisting another indicator of overlist is comm lag or groping for items that is danger sign dont worry about these phenomena in r212 but do pay attention to these last two when listing goals invalidation is not ok in any case inval is preceded by comm lag and then the pc groping for the right way to word it all will produce nonnullable list from that point on so the signs of overlisting in order of appearance are 1 comm lag 2 groping for items 3 pc invalidation of the list the invalidation can be fairly faint just questioning doubt hesitancy about the items the list might have been nullable earlier you can try to null the earlier part list is not nullable if 1 it does not produce rock slam and 2 if it is being delivered by the pc with great uncertainty however the most uncertain person in the world listing from proper source will be the most certain person you ever saw good indicators in listing are 1 interest 2 certainty 3 rock slams bad indicators are 1 rock slams 2 uncertainty we arent too concerned in r212 with whether we get an item or not many cases are below rockslamming so you just keep assessing you keep listing the pcs outofsession appearance is concern of yours as long as he stays interested while he is in session he may well get fancy somatics if you quit in the middle of an opposition list just complete each cycle to the best of your ability some pcs will run fifteen lists off of list one with rock slam then get one on the list itself which continues to rockslam make sure the pc isnt thinking of items and then suppressing them all the items he thinks of should go on the list r212 is itself therapeutic activity if we also get reliable item slamming persistently and get the opposition list listed to an ri the pc will feel marvellous how often this happens is monitored by the accuracy of the auditor an auditor who is doing it all right should expect to be dead on the beam about fifty percent of the time this is due to the aaa factor if you are batting fifty percent ie half of the represent lists you do wind up with an rl and half of the opposition lists get an ri you are good poor auditor may get an ri ten percent of the time and someone will have to straighten out the case sometime but the case will feel better and make gains fifty percent of the time there isnt reliable item there to get so when listing you are only being therapeutic the pc will feel almost as good even if there isnt an ri from the gpm on his r212 list 354 l ron hubbard type 3 idate291162 volnum1 issue221 rev0 rdate000

and p 356 below but the purpose of r212 is to cure the great big ptps that are impinged on the gpm the pcs bugbear that which he must destroy is half of dumbbell package of the gpm the pc looks only at one side of the package he never says who am i everyone accepts this because the pcs objection to the other side looks reasonable the green auditor in particular is likely to think of course and pay further attention to it because it doesnt seem aberrative this is clearest when rockslammers cant find rock slams on other rockslammers this reasonableness is your most fruitful source of error this is sort of mutual outrud tacit consent the mechanics of the situation is that whenever person has his attention fixated on some pt thing that thing represents piece of one side of the gpm its opposing piece or side lies hidden rockslammer is dramatizing the other half of the dumbbell the first half is being represented in pt by scientology the pcs wife the boss etc the pc never asks himself what would oppose _______ because he opposes it and he has keyed in some unconfrontable terminal but the pc is being audited over considerable ptp his fixation prevents him from going back track he is dramatizing the other terminal the thing he is fixated on in pt is not part of the bank it is substitute for lock on the gpm item that keeps the gpm item in continuous restimulation therefore because one side is restimulated hidden and out of sight we have the pcs terminal the pc never recognizes this but he does dramatize this the rock slam on an item means overts against withholds from fixation on reality on and games condition with the item so we find that the pc gets sensation when we call the item we list who or what would oppose _______ and we get rockslamming terminal if the original thing didnt rockslam we do represent list to get something that steadily rockslams either way we get package that will discharge you can do other things with the package you could represent each sending the pc deeper into the bank or you could get goals with the items you find why is it called gpm it is mass which is composed of identities which oppose identities and they are so delicately faced against each other on the track that they dont slip neither has ever overwhelmed the other they finally make up big black mass the identities in the gpm are round black ridges they are black they are round they do have mass they do oppose each other this is not allegorical the anatomy of problem is item vs item postulate vs postulate it is game where you have two sides equally opposed problem doesnt become problem until one is unable to overwhelm and wont be overwhelmed it is matter of balance dont underestimate the age of pair of items in the gpm the whole thing is built basically on the alterisness of goals it has gone on for trillions of years you may say why not resolve it all by just finding the pcs goal because it doesnt immediately resolve the pt items thats why so you are trying to audit someone with screaming ptp the bypassed items are primed into pt and are beyond the pcs reach or confront so the pc doesnt list to free needle after you get the goal the opposed items could have been there for trillions of years 355 the game before that likewise etc it takes long time to get in that condition the pc has lived many lives corresponding to each pair to the main pair are accumulated thousands of lesser ones also opposed in groups of two the gpm would be easy to plot if all the pairs were neatly aligned in the bank on neat time track but the pc is case of scrunch the reactive mind has time this is also one of the highest characteristics of thetan thetan has time the bank is the lowerscale mockery of this to the pc the whole of the gpm is now so when you null things react in this instant hence instant reads the analytical mind would require time so analytical reads are latent the most aberrative thing is time to the bank hundred million years ago is now so if time is all the same what differentiation can we use to work on in theory whenever you say boo to the pc the whole reactive mind reacts but this is an unattainable absolute nonsensical statement in actual fact the situation as we look at the meter is only saved by the reality of the pc the meter reads on what the pc has reality on not what the pc is momentarily in there is free track alongside the gpm and the pc can move along it dianetics is the study of that free track free track is timed the reality of the pc is governed by the pcs tolerance of force thing reads because it most closely approximates pcs limit of reality on force you can always run against the ceiling of that limit that ceiling is marked by the rock slam that is how much force the pc can confront person is as sane as he can tolerate force not use force necessarily tolerate it if you run around banning bombs you wont get much support because the bulk of the population dont believe in them there is too much force to confront in one of them so people dont confront them and they are not real if the populace could tolerate force they would long since have torn the governments of the us and russia to shreds wars occur because people cant tolerate force so they have reality on what they are doing they dont know how much force they are going to turn loose it is an irresponsible action the amount of force person will throw out is measure of sanity but how much he can confront is as the person comes down the track through the gpm he has become less and less capable of tolerating force so the pt terminals and oppterms usually seem quite insurmountable to the pc until they are audited on r212 all pcs suffer from some reaction like this they think that there is more to it than there is that is one of the guiding idiocies of thetan for instance pc will think that he has some huge dramatic withhold to account for the fact that his ruds keep being out then he finally spots the withhold that he thought the instructors tie was crooked drama ie dramatic heavy events in pt seldom has anything to do with the degree on enturbulation of the pc he is trying to match the significance in pt of the drama that does exist in the gpm auditors do this sometimes they hound the pc because he has dirty needle 356 pcs have been good for hundreds of years underlying it will be the reverse but it takes some time for the pc to confront this fact you do find dramatic stuff in the gpm magnitudinous overts etc but you dont pull them out bit by bit they come out as packages pcs try to match up with the gpm it restimulates them to believe that they must be guilty of something but they cant put their finger on it it is in the gpm if you know this you will realize that some of the tech for freeing people on this planet is utterly outrageous what we are doing is quite fantastic pcs can get quite upset doing this ie being audited so it requires an auditor who can go steadily on to complete the job there is room for an auditor who quits because the pc twitters or gets somatic he has to complete the cycle of action that is in progress we could clear somebody albeit slowly by continuing to find and oppose ris more importantly as you go down the rock slam channel the pc will eventually find his goal but goal is senior to items it is easier to find the goal first and then from it to find the ris you would now be doing r321 so r212 cuts into r321 at place determined by the extent to which r212 is run you could go into 3gaxx using the prehav scale to get more items if you did r212 and had the case flying you might find the pc coming up with his goal after six packages had been found if you have pc who is very stacked up and identified it may take good deal longer you could just keep finding items until the pc goes clear doing nothing with his goal of course if you ignore it and dont acknowledge it he is thrown into protesting the goal and he wont go clear when the pc may have had wrong goal found andor run you must get rid of the wrong goal as senior action to r212 since that is now his ptp you run wrong goal with big tiger see p 295a above if it has just been found you prepcheck it if it has been listed when you have pc who has had bad auditing and has been all fouled up ever since that session do r212 it will handle it an item was loused up not the pc items are senior to any other auditing except goals r212 is also usable as an assist if the pc is bothered by something you could ask what illness of yours have you been interested in the pc answers my lumbosis you ask all right who or what does your lumbosis represent to you that would use the principle of r212 the question could be unmetered and unnulled if the pc is interested in it it is identified like mad he must have an aaa about it if the pc has psychosomatic illness he must have the past in pt therefore there is instantaneousness connected with it therefore it has some connection with the gpm if the pc has an engram chronically is restimulation one tag end of it must be headed into the gpm otherwise it would destimulate in three to ten days after going into restimulation to do an assist on chronic somatics ie timeless somatics that didnt disappear in three to ten days the first thing you have to know is that they are hooked up to the gpm the gpm or any part of it can never be educated out of anybody that is the source of repetitive criminality nothing will cure it short of getting rid of the gpm the criminal has been criminal longer than one life hes straight in the middle of an identity 357 of the gpm he knows what stores are for to put in trucks at night he cant be handled by dogooders some processes can key out the valence remarkably enough that we can have mest clears is fantastic luck matter energy and space are also in the gpm probably the gpm has mass simply because time is nothing but the energy space and matter isnt nothing yet this makes an interesting mathematical proposition if time were actually zero there would be matter or energy and possibly space so there is only an apparency of time in the aaa nature of the bank and although there is an apparency of matter there is mass there is an apparency of energy and space but in actuality there is energy and space so matter energy space and time are in the gpm whenever you restore any differentiation even from identity to slight similarity you get more matter energy and space because you get more time things cease to read instantly and you start to get prior and latent reads the case that has been dubin case may get very upset to find himself going black as you get more differentiation you get more mass smooth auditing is essential in handling the gpm otherwise the pcs ability to confront the increasing matter energy space and time in his bank is repressed so he would tend to hang fire auditing could take the place of the ptp some cases see that they are being asked to confront more than they care to they will turn off the reality that has been turning on and momentarily get worse the more the pc lists the more matter energy space and time is materializing probably the only thing that permits the process to work is that there is more time time permits escape from the pressure of the increased mass etc as past time becomes differentiated from pt so the pc is not so stuck in the mass energy and space l ron hubbard type 3 idate111262 volnum1 issue222 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec222 r212 data 6212c11 shspec222 r212 data much of the data in this lecture is given in hcob 15dec62 urgent r212 the fatal error and hcob 30dec62 urgent important routines 212 and 210 case errors points of greatest importance dont overuse 2wc eg did you just think of something in midsession have you thought of anything tends to put responsibility on the pc this tells him to selfaudit if the pc says that he has forgotten something dont say what was it give the missed withhold question cleaning needle is just fundamental auditing you could do it thoroughly with an eighteen button prepcheck in auditing or even just suppress and invalidate as prepcheck assist you could assess the eighteen buttons and run what reads best that would clean up needle very high ta will also be brought down with this basic stuff dont spend lot of time fixing up the case before you audit it you can also clean up needle with r212 if case doesnt move on r212 assume that he is rockslammer and take the largest read on list one and oppose it or just do an oppose list on scientology cf the green form handling what are you trying to prevent there is disgrace in being rockslammer some people have lied about whether it 358 was pain or sensation so as not to seem declasse so lrh checks untruth because if you write backwards list it is useless as well as hard on the pc there are two ways to approach the persistent dirty needle if you dont have someone to do r212 pull missed withholds etc do prepcheck of sorts to clean the needle and teach the auditor to get missed withholds if these attempts to clean the needle go on too long there is point where the pcs anxiety about auditing dirties the needle so dont overrun this repair action noauditing can be counted on to dirty needle the pc can also get anxious if nothing is reading on nulling he can be afraid that you are going to go into midruds and get dirty needle from that the first symptom of session blowing up is the pc getting little bit critical of the auditor this is the only thing lrh stops at when putting in midruds it is always the sign of an ow underlying it to neglect it lets it multiply into screaming arc break later so pick up critical with missed withhold at once this is fundamental any indication of missed withholds makes lrh go after them you dont use missed withhold to punish the pc but to prevent the pc from blowing up in r212 one mistake you can make is not to know what rock slam looks like and therefore to neglect rockslamming item the auditor knows that it reacted so he represents it this isnt invariably disastrous the command value of rockslamming item is terrific but the pcs attention is not on the slamming item it is on what opposes it in the gpm so when you do represent list it takes the pcs attention off the item that claims it and it drives the pc around the bend if you really get mad at someone when he is rockslamming on something represent it instead of opposing it he will practically go out the bottom another goof would be to null the opposition list just to the point where all the reads are gone without finding the item then quit just short of getting the package this leaves hidden pair in pt the pc will feel better but there is still something there nulling the represent or oppose list makes it easier for the pc to extend it you can get to point where list can be nulled even though it is incomplete just continue the list and you will see another rock slam turn on and the rock slam on the original item you were opposing will come back another error that people are making is abandoning lists that had rock slams on them they can get into this mistake by representing instead of opposing rockslamming item the list will go nowhere because there is nowhere to go except to the original item sometimes an item which didnt rockslam at first will unburden enough when you start to represent it to start rockslamming so check for this when the represent list gives dirty needle and item the less attention one has in pt the more one is likely to go down the tone scale as the pc takes his attention off past incidents to handle pt these past incidents collapse in on him and he dramatizes this is applicable to the fact that we have found the worst attention trap there is ris represented in pt the rock slam is caused by the fury and franticness of the pcs attention and opposed attentions 359 never fail to pair an item once found if you only find one item of rockslamming pair especially if you do this several times after awhile you will get rock slams that amount of attention is absorbed in the bank and all you will get will be dead horses thenceforth this isnt terribly serious since we can take the folder and go back to find the incomplete packages if you dont do this the packages can add up to point where the pc wont go clear an auditor who repairs situation like this gets all the residual gain the pc will already have gotten gains he will have felt much better even before the repair it is not dangerous to put r212 in clumsy hands as long as good records are kept and common ordinary good auditing gets done doing r212 right is last in order of importance if you simplify this down to the bare minimum omit midruds and anything at all complicated you have r210 to be run on heavily supervised coaudit basis the only place you will have trouble is deciding whether to represent or oppose an item that rockslams cyclically so you dont know if it is an ri learn what one of these cyclic dirty needle opposition lists looks like then you will know what you are listing l ron hubbard type 3 idate111262 volnum1 issue223 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec223 phantom rock slam 6212c11 shspec223 phantom rock slam the phantom rock slam is special manifestation of r212 this is not rare manifestation and it causes trouble there is rule about this you mustnt grab rock slams from ruds get them from r212 or case records eg old sec checks list ones the phantom slam will attach itself to various terminals and anything and everything in rudiments you can wind up with this peculiar phenomenon opposing something that isnt rockslamming item when this happens in r212 you may get rock slam in the oppose list but it will be cyclic proposition the rock slam becomes dirty needle becomes clean needle every two or three pages this cycle never ends the list is unnullable this phenomenon is peculiar to the opposition list you could make this happen by taking list of unreading items and insisting that the pc oppose one of them the pc will go ahead and do it but the list is unnullable in r212 it is an enemy that is helping the pc ie scientology an auditor etc anything from list one that the pc rock slams on therefore the pc cant accept the help the enemy is right here and now in this session list one is also right here and now it is what is being used on the pc auditors emeters sessions etc if list one isnt used these things are never located the most crude manifestation of failure to locate rockslamming items to oppose is the phantom slam which comes and goes you will only get dead horses doing lists from other sources if the pc is on record as having slammed on list one but you cant turn on the rock slam now tiger drill three or four main points of the list until one ticks then go ahead and oppose it it will turn on continuing rock slam and get you reliable item 360 the case that slams on this and that is the puzzler it confuses the auditor you eventually realize that the rock slam has nothing to do with what you are listing or nulling it turns on incidentally it will turn on more powerfully on heavily charged list that has some rock slams on it anyhow the phantom rock slam is generated by some tiny withhold and not by some item on the list the test of the phantom rock slam is do you get one rock slam in nulling that stays in or does the pc rockslam on ruds or midruds especially since big midruds the latter is more powerful rudiments action than is in regular model session if you see rock slam turn on during ruds action with timelimiter like since your last session you have phantom rock slam sometimes the pc graduates upstairs to having phantom rock slam as his case unburdens the rock slam can be absent at first then it develops first into tame rock slam then gets frantic then cools off again as the case unburdens then when you hit the item it is there again in force and blows the rock slam tends to stay the same size but it changes speed phantom rock slam is any slam that turns on in ruds or general ow it is caused by any withhold the pc has from you or the remainder of the dynamics every now and then you will be fixing up someones line plot done in coaudit or something and out of twentyfour packages only one will rock slam you may think well the charge is blown it was phantom slam all the way fortunately there is solution phantom rock slam is turned on by something in the immediate instant pt of the session it is turned on by something immediately in or in the vicinity of the session something right here it is not fight with the d of p because he is down the hall the way you smoke one out is to get every possible element of which the session consists with the pcs help you make special list which must include every part of the pc his name myself badges symbols tables etc cf the expanded dianetics present time environment list with this list you will get the ptp that is right present in the session the phantom slam will show up on the list the pc wont help much because since he slams on the item he cant see it he has overts on what it will be so he cant perceive it so you may have to suggest some items the majority of items will probably be first dynamic items the item could be but it could translate as my mind or some such thing but as you continued to get more and more packages the item would gradually change in character eg to include more dynamics the rock slam gets gradiently more sudden and more constant finally the pc could just blurt out the item the only test of whether you have found the source of the rock slam is that the rock slam doesnt recur so you cant tell for several sessions whether you have got it so the phantom rock slam item is an even more immediate version of the list one items it is something so much in pt and so disturbing to the pc that it is total ptp very screaming one because it is so close to the session this ptp blocks him from getting gains it was in 1956 or so when lrh isolated the ptp as that which prevents case gain the gpm was discovered via the ptp the closer to auditing and pt the ptp is the less gains are obtained from auditing that is why list one is cure note that we include other dynamics besides the first dynamic in 361 list one there are other dynamics in pt you can point at the pc and say or point at yourself and say we to get the point across ordinarily careful attention to list one will get the phantom slam and clean it up so the proper procedure is 1 complete running list one 2 make session list one if you run into phantom rock slam after completing list one and cleared up all the slams on it what you should do is to go over with the pc all the parts of the session so you can locate the insession rockslamming item keep your eye on the meter so that you can steer him and pick up something he thinks of that turns on slam 3 just go on finding reliable items do this to the best of your ability dont buy anything that doesnt stay in pretty well and make lists long enough to be complete get your packages difficult though this may be you will see the slam turn on more frequently and get progressively less frantic until one day the pc volunteers the item which slams beautifully and can be opposed 4 pick up all past incomplete or dead horse lists go back to all those lists that appeared to give lots of bonus packages and ris now you will be able to find some ris r212 should have positive result everything shouldnt just go up in smoke here is another point you can represent massless things ideas conditions etc and you will get nice massy rockslamming items but if you oppose significances you can get in trouble if significance rockslams you do oppose it but you are actually opposing nothing an idea so get the item the identity that opposes the significance eg mouse could oppose attack then oppose the item you got eg mouse right back to get second solid item eg cat with which to make up package otherwise you dont have two terminals this is the original 3dxx list long enough on the oppose list to the significance to get the item you can have package consisting of significance opposing significance but it is not much of gpm package significances easily go blank so the rock slam can wash out doing the oppose list the rock slam isnt really gone it is just submerged complete the list with mass when you have the item opposing the significance see if it has pain or sensation connected with it so you know which way to oppose it then oppose it and get the other mass rule if the list is nullable and rockslamming you can find juicy item on it list can be nullable and still incomplete dont use invalidated items for anything if the pc is invalidating the items that he is giving you yes thats valid test but dont use the invalidate button for other purposes than to clean off real inval dont use it to keep from having to complete the list pcs may try to get out of completing lists by invalidating items just go on and get the item after you have finished nulling the list or checking midruds sometimes pc cant give you more items until you have finished nulling the list 362 the basics of auditing cover most of the difficulty person will have the danger of r212 is that the auditor can get result that he and the pc are happy with without doing it right and getting all the available gain the residual gain is 1000 worth l ron hubbard
