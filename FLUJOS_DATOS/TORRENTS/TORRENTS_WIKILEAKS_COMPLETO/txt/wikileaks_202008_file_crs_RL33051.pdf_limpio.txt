introduction this report provides unclassified b ackground data from us government sources on transfers of conve ntional arms to developing nations by major suppliers for the period 1997 through 2004 it also in cludes some data on worldwide supplier transactions it updates nd revises the report entitled c onventional arms transfers to developing nations 19962003 publis hed by the congressional research service crs on august 26 2004 crs report rl32547 the data in the report illustrate how global patterns of conventional arms transfers have changed in the postcold war and postpersian gulf war years relationships between arms s uppliers and recipients conti nue to evolve in response to changing political military and economic circumstances nonetheless the developing world continues to be the primary focus of foreign arms sales activity by conventional weapons suppliers duri ng the period of this report 19972004 conventional arms transfer agreements whi ch represent orders for future delivery to developing nations have comprised 627 of the valu of all international arms transfer agreements the portion of agreements with developing countries constituted 573 of all agreements gl obally from 20012004 in 2004 arms transfer agreements with developing countries accounted for 589 of the value of all such agreements globally deliveries of conventional arms to developing nations from 20012004 constituted 632 of ll international arms liveries in 2004 arms deliveries to developing na tions constituted 646 of th value of all such arms deliveries worldwide the data in this new report supersede all data published in previous editions since these new data for 19972004 reflect potentially significant updates to and revisions in the underlying data bases utilized for this report only the data in this most recent edition should be used the data are expressed in us dollars for the calendar years indicated and adjusted for infl ation see box notes on page 2 us commercially licensed arms exports values are incorporated in the main delivery data tables and noted separately see box note on page 15 excluded are arms transfers by any supplier to subnational groups the finition of developing nations as used in this report and the specific classes of items included in its values totals are found in box notes on page 2 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33051crs2 calendar year data used all arms transfer and arms delivery data in this report are for the calendar year or calendar year period given this applies to both us and foreign data alike united states government departments and agencies publish data on us arms transfers and deliveries but generally use the united states fiscal year as the computational time period for these data us fiscal year covers the period from october 1 through september 30 as cons equence there are likely to be distinct differences noted in those published totals using fiscal year basis and those provided in this report which use cal endar year basis for its figures details on data used are outlined in footnotes at the bottom of tables 1 2 8 and 9 arms transfer values the values of arms transfer agreements or deliveries in this report refer to the total values of arms orders or deliveries as the case may be which include all categor ies of weapons and ammunition military spare parts military cons truction military assistance and training programs and ll associated services definition of developing nations and regions as used in this report the developi ng nations category includes all countries except the united states russia european na tions canada japan australia and new zealand listing of countries located in the regions defined for the purpose of this analysis asia near east latin america and africa is provided at the end of the reportconstant 2004 dollars throughout this report values of arms tr ansfer agreements and values of arms deliveries for all suppliers are expressed in us dollars values for any given year generally reflect the exchange rates that prevailed during that specific year in many instances the report converts these dollar am ounts current dollars into constant 2004 dollars although this helps to eliminate th distorting effects of us inflation to permit more accurate comparison of vari ous dollar levels over time the effects of fluctuating exchange rate s are not neutralized the deflators used for the constant dollar calculations in this report are those provided by the us department of defense and are set out at the bottom of tables 1 2 8 and 9 unless otherwise noted in the report all dollar values are stated in constant terms because all regional data tables are composed of f ouryear aggregate dollar totals 19972000 and 20012004 they must be expressed in current dollar terms where tables rank leading arms suppliers to developing nations or leading developi ng nation recipients using fouryear aggregate dollar totals these values are expressed in current dollarshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33051crs3 major findings general trends in arms transfers worldwide the value of all arms transfer agreem ents worldwide to both developed and developing nations in 2004 was nearly 37 b illion this is significant increase in arms agreements values over 2003 and is th first year that total arms agreements have increased since 2000 chart 1table 8a in 2004 the united states led in arms transfer agreements worldwide making agreements valued at nearly 124 billion 335 of all such agreements down notably from 151 billion in 2003 russia ranked second with 61 billion in agreements 165 of these agreements gl obally up notably from nearly 44 billion in 2003 the united kingdom ranked third its arms transfer agreements worldwide standing at 55 billion in 2004 up significantly from 311 million in 2003 the united states and russia collectively made agreements in 2004 valued at nearly 185 billi on about 50 of all international arms transfer agreements made by all suppliers figure 1tables 8a 8b and 8d for the period 20012004 the total value of all international arms transfer agreements 1302 billion was lower th an the worldwide value during 19972000 1392 billion decrease of 65 duri ng the period 19972000 developing world nations accounted for 677 of the value of all arms transfer agreements made worldwide during 20012004 developing wo rld nations accounted for 573 of all arms transfer agreements made globally in 2004 developing nations accounted for 589 of all arms transfer agreements made worldwide figure 1table 8a in 2004 the united states ranked fi rst in the value of all arms deliveries worldwide making nearly 186 billion in such deliveries or 534 this is the eighth year in row that the united states has led in global arms deliveries reflecting the magnitude of us postpersian gulf war arms transfer agreements which are now being implemented ru ssia ranked second in worl dwide arms deliveries in 2004 making 46 billion in such deliverie s france ranked third in 2004 making 44 billion in such deliveries these top th ree suppliers of arms in 2004 collectively delivered over 275 billion 793 of all arms delivered wo rldwide by all suppliers in that year figure 2tables 9a 9b and 9d the value of all interna tional arms deliveries in 2004 was nearly 348 billion this is nominal decrease in the total value of arms deliveries from the previous year fall of 874 million howeve r the total value of such arms deliveries worldwide in 20012004 1312 billion was s ubstantially lower in the value of arms deliveries by all suppliers worldwide from 19 972000 1812 billion decline of over 50 billion figure 2tables 9a and 9bcharts 7 and 8 developing nations fro m 20012004 acc ounted for 632 of the value of all international arms deliveries in the earlier period 19972000 developing nations accounted for 718 of the value of all arms deliveries worl dwide in 2004 developing nations collectively accounted fo r 646 of the value of all international arms deliveries figure 2tables 2a 9a and 9b httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33051crs4 the decline in weapons orders worldw ide since 2000 has been notable global arms agreement values have fallen fro m 421 billion in 2000 to about 37 billion in 2004 were it not for the conclusion of few very large orders in 2004 the total for that year likely would have been lower than the previous year some of the major weapons orders placed in 2004 were deferred purchases that were finally concluded after years of negotiations it has incr easingly become the practice of developed nations in recent years to seek to protect important elements of their national military industrial bases by limiting arms purchases from other developed nations they have placed greater emphasis on joint production of various weapons systems with other developed nations as more effectiv way to preserve domestic weapons production capability while sharing the costs of new weapons development both for their own militaries as well as for export some leading weapons producers have been forced to consolidate sectors of th eir domestic defense industry in the face of intense foreign competition while othe r supplying nations have chosen to manufacture items for niche arms mark ets where their specialized production capabilities provide them with important advantages in the evolving international arms marketplace because the arms market in recent year s has become so intensely competitive supplying states have come to emphasize sales efforts directed toward regions and nations where individual suppliers have had competitive advantages resulting from well established military support relationships with the prospective customers the potential has developed within europe for arms sales to nations that have recently become members of nato that are modernizing their basic force structures and that are replacing obsolete systems there are inherent limitations on these intra european sales due to the sm aller defense budgets of many of the prospective client states yet creative seller financing options as well as the use of coassembly co production and countertrade to offset co sts to the purchasers has resulted in some contracts being signed competition seems likely between the united states and european countries or consortia over the prospective arms contracts within the european region in the years ahead such sales have the potential to compensate for lost contracts resulting from reduced dema nd for weapons from other clients in the developing world more recently various developing nations have reduced their weapons purchases primarily due to their lack of sufficient funds to pay for such weaponry even those prospective arms purchasers in the developing world with significant financial assets tinue to exercise caution befo re embarking upon new and costly weapons procurement programs the spike in the price of oil while boon to the oil producing nations has caused economic difficulties for many consuming states the unsettled state of the world economy has in fluenced number of developing nations to upgrade existing weapons systems in their inventories while limiting their purchases of newer ones there has so been notable reduction in new arms agreements by number of nations in the developing world due to the substantial arms purchases these countries made in the 1990s several of them are curtailing their purchases while they absorb and inte grate previously acquired weapons systems into their force structures presently there appear to be fewer large weapons purchases being made by developing nations in the near east while relatively larger increase in purchaseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33051crs5 are being made by developing nations in asia lead principally by china and india while these apparent trends are subject to abrupt change based on the strength of either the international or regional economies the strength of individual economies in various nations in the developing world continues to be very significant factor in the timing of their arms purchasing decisions some nations in latin america and to much lesser extent in africa have expressed interest in modernizing important sectors of their military forces yet many states in these regions also continue to be constrained by their limited financial resources the limited availability of llersupplied credit and financing seems likely to continue to be factor that i nhibits conclusion of major weapons deals in these regions of the developing world general trends in arms transfers to developing nations the value of all arms transfer agreements with developing nations in 2004 was nearly 218 billion significant increase over the 151 billion total in 2003 this was the highest annual total in real terms since 2000 chart 1figure 1table 1a in 2004 the value of all arms deliveries to developing nations about 225 billion was clear increase from the value of 2003 deliveries nearly 208 billion and the highest total since 2000 charts 7 and 8figure 2table 2a recently from 20012004 the united states and russia have dominated the arms market in the developing world with the united states ranking first each of the last four years in the value of arms transfer agreements from 20012004 the united states made 298 billion in arms transfer agreements with developing nations 399 of all such agreements russia th second leading supplier during this period made 217billion in arms transfer agreem ents or 291 the united kingdom the third leading supplier from 20012004 made about 42 billion or 56 of all such agreements with developing nations durin g these years in the earlier period 1997 2000 the united states ranked first with 346 billion in arms transfer agreements with developing nations or 368 ru ssia made 173 billion in arms transfer agreements during this period or 184 france made 111 billion in agreements or 118 table 1a during the years from 19972004 most ar ms transfers to developing nations were made by two to three major suppliers in any given year the united states has ranked first among these suppliers every ear during this eight year period russia has been strong competitor for the lead in arms transfer agreements with developing nations ranking second every year fro m 1999 through 2004 despite the larger traditional client base for armaments held by other major west european suppliers russias successes in securing new arms or ders suggests that despite the traditional marketing advantage held by major west european competitors russia is likely to continue to rank higher in the value of ne w arms agreements than other key european arms suppliers for the near term however russias largest value arms transfer agreements continue to be with two c ountries china and india russian success in the arms trade with developed nations in the future will depend on its ability to expand its client base to this end ru ssia has sought to expand its prospects in southeast asia the russian government has also stated that it has adopted more flexible payment arrangements for its pros pective customers in the developing worldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33051crs6 and is seeking to enhance the quality of its followon support services to make russian products more ttractive and competitive european arms suppliers such as france the united kingdom and germany occasionally conclude notably large orders with developing count ries based on either longterm supply relationships or their ving specialized weapons systems they can readily provide neve rtheless the united states tinues to appear best equipped to secure new arms agreements with developing nations that are able to afford major new arms purchases prospects for purchas of new and highly expensive weapons by many developing countries seem likely to be limited in the ne ar term given the unsettled state of the international econom and the paucity of funds for such undertakings in the procurement budget s of several deve loping nations consequently the overa ll level of the arms trade with developing nations which has been generally declining in the year s since 2000 despite the notable level of agreements in 2004 is likely to remain relativ ely static or continue to decline in the near term even though few wealthie r developing nati ons may make some significant arms purchases on occasion arms suppliers in the tier below the united states and russia such as china other european and noneuropean suppliers ve participated in the arms trade with developing nations at much lower level however these suppliers are capable on occasion of making an arms deal of signif icance most of their annual arms transfer agreements values totals during 19972004 ve been relatively low and are based upon generally smaller transac tions of less sophisticated military equipment it is unlikely that most of these countries will be able to rise to the status of major supplier of advanced wea ponry on consistent basis tables 1a 1f 1g 2a 2f and 2g united states in 2004 the total value in real rms of united states arms transfer agreements with developing nations ro to nearly 69 billion from 65 billion in 2003 the us share of the value of all such agreements was 316 in 2004 down from 431 share in 2003 charts 1 3 and 4figure 1tables 1a and 1b in 2004 the value of us arms transfer agreements with developing nations was primarily attributable to number of purchases by wide variety of us clients in the near east and in asia instead of couple of very expensive contracts with one or two countries these arms agreement tota ls illustrate the us advantage of having well established defense s upport arrangements with weapons purchasers worldwide us agreements with all of its client s in 2004 include not only sales of major weapons systems but also the upgrading of systems previously provided the us totals also include agreements for wide variety of spare parts ammunition ordnance training and support services wh ich in the aggregate have significant value among major weapons systems ag reements the united states concluded in 2004 with developing nations were with eg ypt for three fast missile craft and associated weapons for 536 million with taiwan for two uhf longrange early warning radars for 436 million with braz il for 10 uh60l black hawk helicopters for 183 million with egypt for 100 high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicles for 105 million with egypt for the upgrading of four chinook

countermeasures system and with pakist an for 1 cobra combat helicopter the united states also concluded agreements fo r the sale of various missile systems to nations in both the near east and in asia it must be emphasized that the sale of munitions upgrades to existing systems spare parts training and support services to developing nations worldwide account for very substantial portion of the total va lue of us arms transfer agreements large number of countries in both the veloping and devel oped world have over decades acquired and continue to utilize wide range of american weapons systems and have continuing requirement to support modify and replace them russia the total value of russias arms transfer agreements with developing nations in 2004 was 59 billion notable increase from 43 billion in 2003 placing strong second in such agreements with th developing world russias share of all developing world arms transfer agreem ents decreased slightly falling from 281 in 2003 to 271 in 2004 charts 1 3 and 4figure 1tables 1a 1b and 1g russian arms transfer agreements tota ls with developing nations have been notable during the last four years during the 20012004 period russia ranked second among all suppliers to devel oping countries making 217 billion in agreements in constant 2004 dollars russi as status as the second leading supplier of arms to developing nations stems from an increasingly successful effort to overcome the significant economic and political problems associated with the dissolution of the former soviet union the traditional arms clients of the former soviet union were generally less wealthy developing count ries valued as much for their political support in the cold war as fo r their desire for s oviet weaponry many of these traditional soviet c lient states received substa ntial military aid grants and significant discounts on their arms purchases after the breakup of the soviet union in december 1991 these practices were grea tly curtailed the russia that emerged in 1991 consistently placed premium on obtaining hard currency for the weapons it sold faced with stiff competition from western arms suppliers in the 1990s russia gradually adapted its selling practices in an effort to regain and sustain an important share of the deve loping world arms market russian leaders have made important efforts in recent years to provide more flexible and creative financin g and payment options for pros pective arms clients it has also agreed to engage in countertrade offsets debtswapping and in key cases to make significant licensed production agreem ents in order to sell its weapons the willingness to license production has been central element in several cases involving russias principal arms clients china and india russias efforts to expand its arms customer base have been met with mixed results in the early 1990s russia developed supply relationship with iran providing that country with mig29 fighter aircraft su24 fighterbombers t72 main battle tanks and kiloclass attack submarines although new russian sa to iran were suspended for period from 19952000 in accordance with an agreem ent with the united states russia now asserts its option to sell arms to iran s hould it choose to do so despite discussionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33051crs8 held between russia and iran on prospective future arms purchases there has not been as of this date major new iran ian procurement from russia of advanced weapons systems comparable to the type s and quantities obtained in the early 1990s russias arms sales efforts apart from those with china and india seem focused on southeast asia where it has had some success in securing arms agreements with malaysia vietnam and indone sia although recurring fi nancial problems of some clients in this region have hampered significant growth in russian sales to them similarly russian combat fighter aircraft sales have been made in recent years to algeria and yemen elsewhere in the developing world russian military equipment still holds attractions because it ranges from the most basic to the highly advanced and can be less expensive than similar ar ms available from other major suppliers russia continues to confront significant obstacle in breaking into arms markets traditionally dominated by western suppliers namely its perceived inability to provide consistent highqua lity followon support spare parts and training for the weapons systems it sells there is an almo st ingrained reluctance on the part of many developing nations to purchase advanced armaments from supplier like russia that is still engaged in reorganization and rati onalization of its fense production base when more stable wellknown and estab lished sources of such weapons exist aerospace systems continue to be russias strong suit in arms sales but in the absence of major new research and development efforts in this and other military equipment areas future russian foreign arms sales may be more difficult to make some military research and development programs do exist in russia but the other major arms suppliers in the west are currently in the process of developing and producing weaponry much more advanced th an those in existing russian programs nonetheless russia continue s to have very significant ongoing arms transfer programs involving china and india whic h should provide it with sustained business during this decade on the basis of agr eements concluded starting in the mid1990s russia has sold major combat fighter aircraft and main battle tanks to india and has provided other major weapons systems t hough lease or licenced production in 2004 russia concluded major agreement with india for the transfer following modernization of the aircraft carrier admiral gorshkov together with 12 mig29k fighters four mig29kub training jets as well as six to eight ka28 helixa and ka31 helixb helicopters fo r about 15 billion china however continues to be central client for russias arms export prog ram particularly in aircraft and naval systems since 1996 russia has sold chin su27 fighter aircraft and agreed to licensed production of them it has also sold the chinese quantities of su30 multi role fighter aircraft sovr emennyclass destroyers quipped with sunburn antiship missiles and kiloclass proj ect 636 submarines russia has also sold the

considerably from year to year during the period of this report the value of chinas arms transfer agreements with developing nations peak ed in 1999 at 29 billion its sales figures that year resulted generally from several smaller valued weapons deals in asia africa and the near east rather than one or two especially large sales of major weapons systems similar arms deals with small scale purchasers in these regions continue in 2004 chinas arms tran sfer agreements total wa s 600 million consistent with its average total in most recent years for most of the mid1990s on chinas principal focus has not been on selling arms but on advancing significant military procurement program aimed at modernizing its own military forces with russia serving as its principal supplier of advanced combat aircraft submarines surface combatants and air defense systems tables 1a 1g and 1hchart 3 few clients for weapons with financia l resources have sought to purchase chinese military equipment during the eight ear period of this report because much is less advanced and sophisticated than weaponry available from western suppliers or russia china does not appear likely to be major supplier of conventional weapons in the international ar ms market in the foreseeable future its likely clients are states in asia and frica seeking quantities of small arms and light weapons rather than major combat systems at the same time china is an important source of missiles in the developing world arms market china supplied silkworm anti ship missiles to iran credible reports persist in various publications that china has sold surfacetosurface missiles to pakistan longstanding client iran and north korea have also reportedly received chines missile technology credible reports of this nature raise impor tant questions about china s stated commitment to the restrictions on missile transfers set out in the missile technology control regime mtcr including its pledge not to assist others in building missiles that could deliver nuclear weapons give n its continuing need for hard currency and the fact that it has some military produc ts particularly missile s that some developing countries would like to acquire china can pr esent an important obstacle to efforts to stem proliferation of advanced missile systems to some areas of the developing world where political and military tensions are significant and where some nations are seeking to develop asymmetric military capabilities major west european suppliers the four major west european supplie rs france united kingdom germany and

of these three nations large agreement totals in one year have usually reflected the conclusion of very large arms contracts with one or more major purchasers in that particular year table 1a and 1b traditionally major west european suppliers have had their competitive position in weapons exports strengthened through strong government marketing support for their foreign arms sales ce they can produce both advanced and basic air ground and naval weapons systems th four major west european suppliers have competed successfully for arms sales contracts with developing nations against both the united states which has tended to ll to several of the same clients and with russia which has sold to nations not traditional customers of either the west europeans or the us the demand for u s weapons in the global arms marketplace from large established clie nt base has created more difficult environment for individual west european suppliers to s ecure large new contracts with developing nations on sustained basis furthermore with the decline in demand by key near east countries for major weapons purchases the levels of new arms agreements by major west european supplie rs have fallen off notably as the result of these factors some of these suppliers have begun to phase out production of certain types of weapons sy stems and have increasingly engaged in joint production ventures with other key european weapons suppliers or even client countries in an effort to sustain major s ectors of their indivi dual defense industrial bases even if substantia l portion of the weapons produced are for their own armed forces the eurofighter project is one ex ample eurocopter is another some european suppliers have also adopted the strategy of c ooperating in defense production ventures with the united states ch as the joint strike fighter jsf to both meet their own requirements for adva nced combat aircraft and to share in profits resulting from future sales of this aircraft regional arms transfer agreements major stimulus to new weapons procurem ents in the near east region was the persian gulf crisis of august 1990februa ry 1991 this crisis culminating in war

council gcc for variety of advanced weapons systems egypt and israel continued their modernization and increased their weapons purchases from the united states the gulf states arms pur chase demands were not only response to iraqs aggression against kuwait but re flection of concerns regarding perceived threats from potentially hostile iran it remains to be seen whether gulf states assessments of the future threat environment in the postsaddam hussein era in iraq will lead to longterm declines in their arms purchases in recent years the position of saudi arab ia as principal arms purchaser in the persian gulf has notably leveled off in the peri od from 19972000 saudi arabias total arms agreements were valued at 49 billion for the period from 20012004 saudi arabias total arms agreements

selected weapons deliveries to developing nations 19972004 other useful data for assessing arms transfers are those that indicate who has actually delivered specific numbers of specific classes of military items to region these data are relatively hard in that they reflect actual transfers of military equipment they have the limitation of not giving detailed information regarding either the sophistication or the specific name of the quipment delivered however these data show relative trends in the delivery of important classes of military equipment and indicate who the leading suppliers are from region to region over time data in the following tables set out actual deliveries of fourteen categories of weaponry to developing nations from 19972 004 by the united states russia china the four major west european suppliers as group all other european suppliers as group and all other suppliers as group tables 37 caution is warranted in using the quantitative data within these specific tables aggregate data on weapons categor ies delivered by suppliers do not provide precise indices of the quality andor quantity of the wea ponry delivered the history of recent conventional conflicts suggests th at quality andor s ophistication of weapons can offset quantitative advantage further these data do not provide an indication of the relative capabilities of the recipient nations to use effectively the weapons delivered to them superior tr aining coupled with good equipment tactical and operationa l proficiency and s ound logistics may in the last analysis be more important factor in nations ab ility to engage successfully in conventional warfare than the size of its weapons inventory regional weapons deliveries summary 20012004 the regional weapons delivery data collectively show that the united states was leading supplier of several major classes of conventional weaponry from 2001 2004 russia also transferred significant quantities of certain w eapons classes during these years the major west european suppliers were serious competitors in weapons deliveries from 20012004 ma king notable deliveries of certain categories of armaments to every region of the developing

delivery data reflect the dive rse sources of supply of conventional weaponr available to developing nations even though the united states russia and the four major west european suppliers tend to
