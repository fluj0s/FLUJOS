options and constraints in remote rural areas case study of the great plains region summary although many rural areas fared relatively well over the past decade there remain wide swathes of rural america that continue to decline one of the more significant indicators of this selective decline is the population outmigration in remote rural areas of the great plains where agriculture and natural resourcebased economies are predominant congress is concerned about theses areas and has proposed legislation to address the decline current conditions in much of the great plains suggest continuing and deepening decline in the absence of new sources of competitive advantage this is especially true for remote counties which present distinct challenges for rural development policy in the 21st century this report discusses socioeconomic characteristics and trends of 242 remote rural counties in seven states of the great plains region stretching from texas to the dakotas remote counties are defined here as those with populations under six persons per square mile and on the extreme end of two widely used scales of rurality that categorize counties based on the extent to which they are influenced by urban areas or larger population centers appendices provide individual county level data on socioeconomic trends in population education employment and income for the 242 remote counties remote rural counties in the great plains experienced extensive population out migration over the 1990s with few employment alternatives in the private sector to replace the exodus of jobs from agriculture mining and timbering remote counties are particular concern to policymakers because the remaining population is disproportionately elderly lowincome lowwage and more dependent on agriculture and other natural resources than other rural areas while the great plains area receives higher per capita federal funding than the country as whole most of the funds direct payments to individuals eg social security disability farm subsidies rather than to capitalgenerating areas this does not represent difference from federal spending in nonmetro areas generally but in the great plains programs that promote rural economic development may be even more important than in rural areas with more diversified economies such as those within commuting distance to urban areas the possibilities of regionally based solutions are discussed most rural development researchers agree that the great diversity exhibited from one rural area to another makes crafting effective federal policy especially difficult contributing to this difficulty is the relative dearth of research that might help policymakers understand why some policies seem to work well in some rural areas and not so well in others the united states department of agriculture classifications of rural areas into particular policy types and their dominant economic activity are two of the more widely cited efforts to impose some analytic order on the diversity of rural areas yet they still paint rural areas with very broad brush understanding the particular characteristics and economic conditions of remote

range of issues including agriculture forestry and mining production community infrastructure natural resource conservation and management and socioeconomic development current challenges to and reform of existing federal rural policies are evolving in an environment of increasing concern about national competitiveness new federal political strategies that devolve more power to state and local areas deregulation of financial markets budget constraints and the increasing degree of separation between farm policies and rural economic development policies global socioeconomic changes are being felt especially in rural areas that have historically depended on natural resource based economies including agriculture changing rural america is also producing pressures for different policies and raising new questions about the role congress might play in shaping effective rural development policies for the future the great plains much of rural america lying outside urban commuting zones faces significant economic development challenges as the united states has increasingly become largely urbansuburban and increasingly hightechnology bicoastal economy1 yet the myriad problems facing rural america are often invisible to an urban and suburban world faced with weaknesses in the farm economy persistent poverty and the loss of manufacturing jobs to lower labor costs abroad large expanses of rural america especially those areas sparsely populated and remote from population centers are falling farther behind their urban and suburban counterparts this trend is not new nor are spatial inequalities new phenomenon spatially unequal development characterizes virtually all countries in the developed world as well as the developing world but these spatial inequalities have grown more pronounced in some us regions over the past decade as the united states makes adjustments to the internationalization of markets and the division of labor these patterns are visible throughout the united states nowhere is this perhaps more pronounced than 1 us economic activity is overwhelmingly concentrated along the countrys ocean coasts and great lakes coasts as well as its navigable rivers see jordan rappaport and jeffrey sachs the united states as coastal nation center for international development harvard university july 2001 crs2 in the great plains region especially in that regions remote rural counties see definition and description of remote rural areas on page 5 remote rural areas of the great plains region present distinctive spatial and socioeconomic dynamics that offer stark example of the significant difficulties facing many other rural areas unlike many other rural areas however much of the great plains is undergoing significant population outmigration see

individual remote county level data are provided on population change household income employment and other socioeconomic variables figure 1 demographic decline in the great plains the remote counties discussed here have experienced significant population loss highlighting the fact the nonmetro great plains counties have seen relatively steady population decline while the total population of these 242 counties is just under million representing little over 12 of the nonmetro population in the seven states these counties might be regarded as an extreme case of more general phenomena accompanying

department of commerce as used here the great plains region includes parts or all of texas oklahoma nebraska kansas north dakota south dakota and montana stretching from central texas to the canadian border cycles of growth and decline have long characterized the region in the late 1870s and early 1880s an abnormal abundance of rain led many settlers to the region only to experience few years later the blizzards of 1887 followed by decade of withering drought periods of drought and depression lasted until the beginning of the 20th century which ushered in period of high agricultural commodity prices and good crop years that lasted through the first world war2 following the depression and world war ii another period of strong growth in the agricultural sector again made the great plains an economically competitive region since then the steady decline in numbers of farms and the limited creation of non farm jobs has left the region searching for new ways to rejuvenate local economies over 60 of the counties in the great plains region had population declines from 19902000 in north dakota the state as whole had negative growth rate while the united states grew at an average of over 13 between 19902000 as younger persons migrate from many of these areas in the great plains the elderly population increases proportionately the tax base dwindles public services decline employers close shop and small communities disappear when frederick jackson turner presented his landmark essay the significance of the frontier in american history to the american historical association at the chicago worlds fair in 1893 an area of 6 or fewer persons was the defining criterion of frontier territory despite 2 see walter prescott webb the great plains blaisdell publishing co waltham mass 1931 james r dickenson home on the range century on the high plains new york scribner 1995 crs4 the large population growth of the us during the 20th century there are remote rural areas that have fewer persons living there today than lived there in 18903 these counties are also more dependent on farming than other non metropolitan counties while nonmetro counties in general suffer higher rates of poverty than metrocounties have lower wages than metro areas low population densities andor less diversified economies these 242 counties may fall into distinct category that warrants special attention from policymakers although other states may have lowdensity rural areas and significant outmigration eg delta south and central appalachia the remote rural areas of the great plains represent distinct geographic region in the central part of the united states where farming is still important outmigration is significant employment opportunities are limited environmental amenities are few and the challenges of rural economic development particularly significant rural definitions rural areas when compared to urban and suburban areas are characterized by sparse populations often great distances to population centers and accordingly low scale efficiencies that make the provision of public and private services costly rural areas according to the us census comprise open country and settlements with fewer than 2500 residents the formal definition of rural is essentially residual category rural areas consist of all territory outside of census bureaudefined urbanized areas and urban clusters urbanized areas have an urban nucleus of 50000 or more people they may or may not contain individual cities with 50000 or more in general they must have core with population density of 1000 persons per square mile and may contain adjoining territory with at least 500 persons per square mile the same computerized procedures and population density criteria are used to identify urban clusters of at least 2500 but less than 50000 persons this delineation of builtup territory and small towns and cities is new for the 2000 census metro and nonmetro areas are defined by the office of management and budget metropolitan statistical areas and micropolitan statistical areas are collectively referred to as core based statistical areas cbsas metro areas consist of 1 central counties with one or more urbanized areas and 2 outlying counties that are economically tied to the core counties as measured by worker commuting data outlying counties are included if 25 of workers living there commute to the core counties or if 25 of the employment in the county consists of workers coming from the central counties nonmetro counties are outside the boundaries of metro areas and are further subdivided into micropolitan areas centered on urban clusters of 10000 or more residents and all remaining noncore counties4 3 this result has led to the counterargument to turner that the us frontier not only remains but is growing see deborah popper and frank popper the great plains from dust to dust planning 53 12 1987 4 for statistical details concerning the census bureaus formal definitions of rural and urban see federal register vol 67 51 march 15 2002 pp 1166311670 in june 2003 the office of management and budget promulgated revised definitions of metropolitan statistical areas msas see omb bulletin no0304 june 6 2003 crs5 metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas do not equate to an urbanrural classification all counties included in cbsas as well as noncorecounties contain both rural and urban territory and populations based on the most recent definitions above there were 591 million rural residents of whom 492 lived in nonmetro counties in 2000 there were 492 million nonmetro county residents 59 of whom lived in rural areas nationally 17 of the population lived in non metro counties and 21 lived in rural areas in 20005 for programmatic as opposed to statistical analysis and demographic modeling purposes however rural most often refers to socioeconomic trends and conditions in nonmetropolitan areas6 for example statutory language in the 2002 farm bill pl107171 sec 6020 defines rural and rural area as any area other than an area with city or town over 50000 and the urbanized area contiguous and adjacent to such city or town in this report the terms rural rural area and nonmetropolitan will be used interchangeably to refer to nonmetropolitan areas unless otherwise specified to include the rural residents of metropolitan counties similarly metropolitan and urban areas will be used interchangeably unless specific reference is made to rural areas within metropolitan counties7 remote rural areas are defined in this report as 1 those with county population densities of 6 or fewer persons per square mile and 2 on the far end of ruralurban continuum scale and scale measuring the degree of urban influence on rural area8 these remote counties are arguably even more vulnerable to the tyranny of distance when it comes to attracting residents and businesses that might provide the basis for creating new sources of economic growth and development during the 1990s some rural areas such as the mountain west while sparsely populated and with few large population centers have seen significant population growth stemming from the presence of attractive environmental amenities however in the great plains region containing high proportion of farmdependent counties socioeconomic conditions have continued to decline9 5 john cromartie measuring rurality what is rural usdaers briefing room 2003 httpwwwersusdagovbriefingrurality 6 the bureau of the census and office of management and budget definitions are created solely for the purposes of demographic measurement and analysis keenly aware that this purpose can conflict with policies that target specific populations and geographic regions these agencies have long recommended and encouraged other agencies that use their definitions to modify them to serve the objectives of their particular programs see federal register vol65 249 december 27 2000 pp 8222882238 7 most 91 metro county residents are urban area residents 8 appendix describes two widely used scales developed by usdas economic research service ers that measure rural nonmetropolitan counties by their population their proximity to metropolitan areas and the relative size of population centers within the non metro county in addition appendix also describes two ers typologies that categorize nonmetro counties on the basis of economic and policy types 9 farmingdependent counties are defined by usda as those where 20 or more of total labor and proprietors income stems from agriculture inflation adjusted total personal income in farmdependent counties grew 13 between 1990 and 1998 compared to 21 growth in other nonmetro counties see fred gale how important are farm payments continued crs6 background an important issue for many rural areas is how to create new sources of rural competitive advantage beyond the traditional economies based on commodity agriculture resource extraction and peripheral manufacturing jobs recent survey indicates that while state leaders regard rural economic development as vital to their respective states actual legislative priorities have not placed rural development as central issue of their states legislative agendas approximately half the national sample of rural suburban and urban legislators reported that they personally dealt with rural issues however these legislators also noted that urban and suburban issues often took priority in the legislative agenda they cited lack of opportunity for young people as the most important rural problem followed by decline of family farming 10 yet when asked what legislative work occupied most of their agenda 84 of the legislators reported that quality of education attracted the most legislative attention other areas cited were the environment 70 access to technology 69 access to healthcare 64 and access to transportation 59 while some of these concerns are relevant to rural areas economic development issues per scored considerably lower on the legislative agenda only third of the legislators cited lack of opportunity for young people as key legislative concern the focus on rural oriented economic development policies has not been among the highest federal priorities as measured by federal initiatives since the 1960s and 1970s much national rural policy attempts either to reinvigorate traditional production spheres such as agriculture to build or improve physical infrastructure and to create or preserve small businesses analysis by usdas economic research service ersof data in the consolidated federal funds reports show that when compared to metropolitan areas rural areas receive fewer federal funds per capita for funding that might be characterized as capital investment and more funds that are income support payments11 although nonmetro areas in general receive somewhat less funding per capita than metro areas rural areas also often have even more limited access to important private investment resources because their remoteness and low population densities may increase project risks credit in rural areas for example can often be more expensive and offer fewer financial product options than those available in metropolitan areas rural communities also may have more difficulty in financing infrastructure projects and providing rental and middle income housing construction moreover smaller rural communities often have limited taxing and repayment capacity large infrastructure projects for example may have 9 continued to the rural economy agriculture outlook october 2000 10 the other eight most highly ranked rural problems in descending order are access to healthcare lowwage jobs quality of education sprawl access to technology access to transportation breakup of the family and the environment see w k kellogg foundation perception of rural america national state legislator survey battle

small rural communities simply because there are fewer people over which costs can be spread analysts have sometimes asked the question why invest in rural america12 america today is suburban nation and becoming more so by the decade13 when the united states was younger the rural sector was the frontier in the early 20th century it became the storehouse the geography providing the raw commodities to support growing urban industrial population14 in both periods the rationale for investment and public support was clear the importance of rural areas to the nation as whole today appears to be more ambiguous in the 1960s and 1970s the urban cores of many major us cities eg detroit chicago cleveland new york boston washington dc were faced with the challenges of serious social and physical decline newspapers news magazines and television were awash in stories about urban decline which generated national debate about its causes and solutions over several years congress responded with broad range of innovative polices aimed at reversing the deterioration and reinvigorating much of the countrys older centers the longterm decline of rural america on the other hand is happening relatively more quietly and often out of the public eye yet some would argue that rural challenges today are as great on community level as were the challenges of cities 35 years ago according to the general accounting office the patchwork of programs that constitutes rural policy today is not the outcome of comprehensive and systematically crafted policy goals targeted to rural areas as much as it is extensions and modifications of programs designed for urban areas15 the agricultural and manufacturing sectors remain the primary foci in terms of amounts spent on rural areas some have questioned whether financial support to production agriculture necessarily translates into economically diverse and viable rural communities similarly lowwage and low skill manufacturing that often predominates in many rural areas may be unable to provide these areas with the capacity to rebuild local economies for the future particularly with globalization and outsourcing of production 12 see karl n stauber why invest in rural america and how critical public policy question for the 21st century paper presented at exploring policy options for new rural america center for the study of rural america kansas city federal reserve bank may 2001 13 some observers even argue that the united states has now entered postsuburban era of development see rob kling spencer olin and mark poster

federal programs needs to be reappraised gaorced94165 july 1994 crs8 population change in nonmetro areas during the 1990s approximately 492 million persons resided in nonmetropolitan areas in 2003 174 of the us population16 after years of little or growth in population rural and small towns grew faster than suburban and urban areas in the 1970s in the 1980s however this trend reversed with the 19811982 recession and the farm financial crisis and decline in number of retirees major source of rural population growth moving to rural areas shift occurred again during the 1990s when most nonmetro counties either increased their growth rates shifted from 1980s loss to gain or continued decline although at somewhat reduced rate population growth was highest in the mountain west and lowest or nonexistent in the great plains mississippi delta and corn belt nonmetro counties adjoining metro areas accounted for almost twothirds of all nonmetro growth increasing about 12 on average much of this growth stemmed from metro residents relocating to the adjoining nonmetro areas and from other sources of immigration despite this net inflow of people from metro areas the rate of net migration into rural areas which had steadily increased during the early and mid1990s dropped to one half of 1 during 1997199917 because many lowgrowth farming areas such as those in the great plains lack the attraction of amenities such as those found in the mountain west or florida it is hard to see how they will experience future population growth without new sources of employment during the 1990s population remained stable or grew in those rural areas and small communities able to attract jobs in the service sector the major source of employment growth in nonmetro economies farmdependent counties generally saw little or growth or lost population in the 1990s foreign immigration was the major source of growth in the us population accounting for nearly 20 of the national nonmetro growth in the1990s while about 83 of all residents and nearly 90 of immigrants lived in urban areas in 2003 the immigration into rural and agricultural areas may be more socially significant than these broad data might suggest immigration is important to farming meat packing and textiles and immigrant professionals eg physicians also play an increasingly important role in many rural areas much of laborintensive agriculture is located in the south and in geographically large western counties classified by the census as metropolitan areas crop production fruit and vegetable farming and meat packing industries are reliant on hired farm workers hispanics comprised 42 of hired farm workers in 200218 some are new immigrants from central mexico and nonspanish speaking indians of southern

plants19 the declining opportunity structure of remote rural areas of the great plains population loss throughout much of the rural and farming dependent areas of the great plains region has been persistent and continual for over 50 years out migration of young residents and lower fertility rates of those who remain have led not only to population loss but also to the increased proportion of the aging in the population remaining when low population densities are added to this demographic mix picture of slowly declining region emerges see table 2 the average population in the remote counties in all of the states but montana had negative growth rates between 1990 and 2000 table 2 all the states but montana had growth rates below the national average of approximately 1320 not only did north dakotas remote counties have the lowest growth rate among the 7 states the state average was negative as well population densities in the region as measured by population per square mile average less than tenth of the average nonmetro county average of slightly over 36 persons per square mile 19 for an overview of rural population trends see httpwwwersusdagovbriefing population 20 recent analysis of rural population growth rates showed that rates varied greatly across counties and across decades interestingly the research showed that only about 20 of the variance in population growth could not be attributed to state or nationallevel variables leaving nearly 80 of the variance that must be explained by variables that vary across or within counties see tzuling huang p orazem

rates of poverty an average of 157 in 1999 saw the largest decline in county poverty rates of the various ers county economic classifications from 19891999 probably due to relatively larger farm

the us average for all nonmetro counties in 2000 highschool graduation rates in nonmetro areas have improved over the decade data from the census of population calculated by usdas economic research service showed that in 2000 only 232 of persons 25 and over had less than high school education down from 312 in 1990 it would be misleading to attribute the economic problems of remote rural economies to comparatively lowskilled population alone as table 5 shows the unemployment rates in remote counties with the exception of south dakota are actually lower than the national average these relatively low unemployment rates suggest that rural workers may suffer more from lowwage employment and underemployment than they do from unemployment this in part reflects the types of industries that dominate rural areas peripheral manufacturing extractive industries and lowwage service sector jobs29 even highly skilled rural workers however earn lower wages than their urban counterparts30 in 2000 the percentage of nonmetro adults 25 and older with high school diploma was higher in nonmetro areas than in metro areas 355 vs 269 although only 155 percent of nonmetro adults 25 and older held bachelors degrees compared to 266 of metro residents 25 and older31 according to data from the rural sociological society task force on rural poverty at every level of education average earnings and income are lower in nonmetro than in metro areas32 the low reported unemployment rates could also suggest that due to limited opportunities rural workers have dropped out or never entered the workforce and are 28 continued america boulder co westview press 1995 29 earnings income rates of poverty education and training etc are factors both of the characteristics of the labor force and of an areas industrial structure they can be analyzed separately but the economic characteristics of an area result from both the organization of labor supply and the economic structure of labor demand within region 30 some research suggests that this poses paradox in regard to public policies aimed at raising the level of human capital in rural areas times series analysis of rural areas showed that rural population growth was affected most by improvements in human capital stock over time because urban returns to education appear to be higher than those of rural areas increasing the rural human capital stock actually decreased the workingage population largely because more educated labor moved elsewhere see tzuling huang p orazem and d wohlgemuth rural population growth 19501990 the roles of

counted as unemployed this is undoubtedly true but such bias in measuring unemployment is likely equally true for metropolitan areas as well even though the composition of available employment differs the non farm employment change in remote counties shown in table 6 gives picture of slow growth area relative to the state as whole this could be discouraging to wouldbe workers choosing areas to which they might migrate there is also evidence to suggest that some rural labor market groups such as underemployed workers and discouraged workers respond less to business cycle movements therefore an expansion may be less likely to benefit these individuals in rural areas than in urban areas33 evidence however is lacking that unemployment counts in rural areas are any less or any more accurate than those for metro areas one substantive implication seems clear rural people may suffer less from unemployment than from myriad forms of underemployment eg working less than full time34 while average rates of high school graduation increased in rural areas over the 1990s earnings per job did not the inflation adjusted ruralurban earnings gap as opposed to total income was over 30 greater in 1995 than it was in 197735 there are also other possible reasons for this gap including the lower likelihood of nonmetro workers moving out of low wage jobs than central city residents greater involuntary parttime work among nonmetro workers higher proportion of non metro workers in minimum wage jobs 12 vs 7 and higher rates of underemployment and unemployment among women compared to metro areas36 some recent research also suggests that an increased demand for unskilled largely hispanic labor may have contributed to lower wages for skilled workers largely men with high school education

as lowwage if it fell into the top quintile of rural counties ranked by the share of wage and salary workers in low wage industries while federallydefined poverty unemployment and population growth rates in lowwage counties did not differ significantly from other rural counties lowwage counties were characterized by different mix of jobs industries that tend to pay well on average are less likely to be located in lowwage counties and jobs pay less on average than similar jobs elsewhere with less diverse economies to begin with employers in lowwage counties also have little competition in setting prevailing wage rates unsurprisingly lowwage counties have relatively small numbers of workers and larger proportion of older less educated workers these factors coupled with outmigration of younger higher skilled workers make it difficult to attract the more technologically advanced production sectors that might improve both the wage structure and the level of work skills the northern great plains region has the largest cluster of lowwage counties nearly half are located in north and south dakota and nebraska lowwages and small per capita income growth characterize both lowwage counties and remote counties as defined here counties remote from metro centers and with small pools of skilled workers are not positioned to attract employers who need access to suppliers and customers the absence of skilled workers is also reflected in the lack of economic diversity in lowwage counties nearly half of the 465 lowwage counties analyzed by ers are also classified in the county typology in appendix table 7 as farmingdependent most of these are also located in the northern great plains region this is not to imply that farmemployment per is the source of the lowwages rather farmdependent counties may be lowwage because they are remote have low population densities andor have been unable to diversify their economies outside the traditional agriculture economy few lowwage counties are dependent on manufacturing which generally pays higher wages in rural counties compared to other rural employment options40 residents of remote counties without diverse economies simply have very limited opportunities to improve education and skill levels beyond that required for rudimentary entry level jobs the primary economic base of remote rural areas farmingranching mining forestry and oil and gas extraction is also prone to boombust cycles that not only make earning living difficult but may also help explain the frequent outmigration six of the 10 industries with the largest share of employment in lowwage counties were classified as lowwage industries the 10 largest lowwage industries all have greater shares of employment in lowwage counties than in other nonmetro counties lower wages also exist within each industry so that the same job pays less 39 in the studys sample at least 41 of all workers in these 465 counties were employed in industries paying

elsewhere appendix b presents data on the top 25 industries in rural counties and compares lowwage counties with other rural counties41 while many remote counties are poor and lowwage the dynamics that drive these two processes are not necessarily the same of the 465 counties that ers identified as lowwage only about onethird were persistently poor and only about onethird of the persistently poor counties were lowwage42 this relation suggests that the underlying economic and social conditions associated with significant poverty and lowwages may differ if lowwage earnings employment were the sole source of poverty one would expect lowwage counties to have higher poverty rates on average than non lowwage counties conversely one might expect persistently poor counties to be mostly lowwage counties while it is substantially true that the economies of rural america were historically grounded in manufacturing and agricultural base that produces large numbers of lowwage jobs changes over the last 50 years have resulted in fewer agricultural jobs and more in services still these jobs pay lower wages on average than similar sectoral employment in urban areas in the great plains region remote lowdensity counties are lowwage counties the great plains region and to some extent the greater midwestern region also depends heavily on largescale capitalintensive agricultural production thirty of the 242 remote rural counties are in the leading 100 us counties in total acreage in 41 some observers point to costofliving differences between rural and urban areas to account for earnings differentials or to account for price differences when comparing standards of living between geographic areas conceptual and measurement issues in developing indexes that might estimate geographic costofliving are significant commonly accepted measures such as bureau of labor statistics family budget studies the american chamber of commerce researchers association cost of living index and the bureau of labor statistics city consumer price indexes generally focus on metropolitan areas rural areas in particular are excluded from these calculated measures see laura blanciforti and edit kranner estimating county cost of living indexes the issue of urban versus rural research paper 9718 west virginia regional research institute 1997 for an analysis of the conceptual and measurement complexities of costofliving indexes see national academy of sciences at what price conceptualizing and measuring costof living and price indexes washington dc national academy press 2002 one study of rural and urban residents in wisconsin concluded that metro and nonmetro households spent about the same on such essentials as food clothing transportation utilities and medical care although in the national academy of sciences study cited above constructing an index for medical care proved more difficult than any other component of the consumer price index nonmetro residents lived on less income largely because they were disproportionately elderly and had higher concentrations of households with paidup mortgages than metro areas see linda m ghelfi about that lower cost of living in nonmetro areas usdaers rural development perspectives october 1988 42 persistently poor counties are defined by ers as those counties with 20 or more of their population with poverty level incomes in each of four years 1960 1970 1980 and 1990 crs19 cropland43 policies that have largely targeted farm household income have not produced an economic reversal in this region the evidence of demographic and socioeconomic trends in the great plains suggests to many observers that continuing reliance on commodity agriculture to the exclusion of other better paying employment may be formula for continuing population outmigration fewer service and retail centers and declining living standards for many rural households in the nonfarming sector with significant changes occurring as well in the structure of agriculture leading to further concentration in production nonfarm employment and closer ties between population centers and rural areas more attention to regional solutions may hold greater promise for the great plains in the intermediate term than the traditional state or countybased solutions alone federal funding in the great plains this section relies on 1995 bureau of the census data generated by usdas economic research service44 the data focused on funding for 750 federal programs that were traceable to the county level these programs accounted for 88 of all federal funds including funding to individuals to businesses and to public entities based on an examination of all federal funds received in fy1995 the great plains received more federal funds per capita than the country as whole the great plains region as defined in the ers report in addition to the 7 states discussed in this report also includes parts of eastern wyoming colorado new mexico and western minnesota per capita funds were 10 higher in the region 5447 than in the nation as whole 4973 most of these funds were direct payments to individuals eg social security and disability farm subsidies salaries wages and procurement contracts compared to the nation as whole the region gets relatively more funding from such programs as agriculture and natural resource payments defense and space and community resource programs while retirement and disability payments in the great plains account for slightly less than the nation as whole 32 vs 34 these payments are significant to local economies because of the relatively high percentages of elderly and disabled in the nonmetro population see table 4 above and appendices ci nonmetro counties rather than metro counties accounted for the greater levels of federal funding for the great plains as compared to the national average federal funding to nonmetro counties in the great plains was 19 more per capita than for nonmetro counties nationally and was 8 more per capita for great plains metro counties compared to all metro counties this difference in nonmetro funding is explained by the relatively high level of payments to individuals in farmdependent counties over half 277 of the 477 great plains counties were farmdependent the per capita annual government payments to these farmdependent counties was 6196 the 26 ersdefined governmentdependent counties and the 62 persistent 43 us census of agriculture ranking of states and counties vol 2 part 2 1997 44 see rick reeder f bagi and s calhoun which federal programs are most important for the great plains usdaers rural development perspectives vol 13 1 june 1998 crs20 poverty counties received 6462 and 5886 per capita respectively45 the relatively few nonmetro counties receiving low federal payments per capita tended to be 1 near or adjacent to metro counties 2 specialize in mining and 3 have little farming or were involved mostly in ranching operations aside from retirement disability wages salaries and contracts nonmetro areas of the great plains are distinguished in their receipt of other direct payments which include farm payments nationally other direct payments to nonmetro counties account for only 2 of federal funds and direct loans only about 4 of federal funds for great plains nonmetro counties other direct payments account for 10 of funds and direct loans account for 7 of federal receipts farm dependent counties in the great plains receive 17 of their total federal funds from nonfarm other direct payments and 12 from direct loans farm and nonfarm federal funding in the great plains region may raise questions about the effectiveness of certain rural development strategies or human capital improvements in the region the region receives higher per capita funding than the nation as whole for elementary and secondary education for higher education and for agricultural and natural resource programs much of this latter funding goes to farm dependent counties which are also disproportionately remote counties yet socioeconomic data indicates that despite these programs there has not been strong positive effect in improving the social welfare for most of the residents of these counties see appendices ci there are number of possible explanations in other rural economies outside the great plains the agricultural sector may be important but it is situated in an overall economy that is more diverse thus the agricultural income and employment multiplier effects tend to be diluted in the local economy in the great plains region direct federal payments for agriculture and community resources are significant within the local economy even more so in remote counties46 yet this funding as an income transfer appears to have generally weak effect in building local economic development capacity given that farm payments in the late 1990s provided as much as 60 of farm household incomes in some areas of the united states one can clearly understand their importance to certain families because the populations are so small in remote great plains counties however few farm households receiving disproportionately higher direct farm payments may give very misleading impression about per capita income and earnings for the county as whole the fact that farmingdependency remoteness and poverty are intertwined within particular county may suggest distinctive confluence of socioeconomic forces that limit the development potential of these areas federal payments make up relatively significant share of personal income in the great plains there are also few employment alternatives in the private sector to 45 see footnote 9 above the ers county classification defines governmentdependent counties as those where at least 25 of total county income comes from government see appendix for ers county profiles 46 community resource funding supports economic development community facilities environmental protection housing and transportation compared with nonmetro counties nationally nonmetro great plains counties receive 32 more in community resources crs21 replace the exodus of jobs from agriculture and mining nonmetro counties in general and remote counties of the great plains in particular have relatively high proportions of elderly and disabled residents making the federal funds they receive significantly more important to rural residents and communities changes in medicare federal transportation policies or agriculturalnatural resource programs may in the absence of employment alternatives may have significantly greater effect in the great plains than in other regions nationally the counties with the highest job growth in the 1990s were service based and government based counties from 19951998 these counties grew at rate of approximately 12 miningdependent counties grew at about 07 and manufacturingdependent counties grew at approximately 05 during that period job growth was about 025 in farmdependent counties while the number of farm dependent counties has decreased nationally from over 60 of nonmetro counties in 1950 to about 15 in 2000 most of the counties that remain dependent on agriculture are in the great plains region along with minnesota and iowa policy options for remote rural areas of the great plains current strategies for rural economic development in the great plains are not substantially different from the strategies used in other rural regions given the distinctiveness of the problems facing remote rural areas in the region the effectiveness of current government policies is an important question it might be impractical to suggest that the tremendous diversity characterizing rural america also implies that separate federal policies should be created for each distinctive rural area the range of existing federal loans and grants designed to create or support small businesses improve rural infrastructure and address the most pressing needs of low income populations in housing sewerage and water have made important contributions to rural residents one issue that congress may ultimately face is whether such programs will provide needed economic stimulus in an internationalized economy where us rural areas not only compete with each other but increasingly with foreign countries whose labor costs land and various regulatory structures may give them advantages virtually any state can point to numerous smallscale public and private sector rural economic development initiatives achieving notable successes within their borders new jobs have been created existing jobs retained worker skills upgraded new infrastructure built and small rural communities revitalized based on mix of agriculture smallbusinesses public service employment and entrepreneurial activity larger number of remote rural communities however either are only holding their own or losing ground in terms of quality of life that the areas existing economic structure can provide while their socioeconomic characteristics and histories are quite different they appear to pose some seemingly intractable development problems intractable in the sense that the current set of federal rural policies do not seem to create the necessary local capacities to effect significant change in social wellbeing the remote rural areas of the great plains reveal these challenging development problems perhaps to greater extent than any other region crs22 of the united states manufacturers find remoteness significant barrier to relocating facilities the growth and demand for business and professional services is greatest in urban areas climate and landscape in the great plains offer little to encourage growth of tourismrelated development the result is very few wellpaid jobs to replace lost employment in traditional sectors one overarching strategy that seems to be emerging is to consider rural economic development in regional terms new regional development alliances are appearing throughout the united states discussed below one reason they may be doing so now is because the longstanding patterns of poverty and economic distress that characterize the northern great plains as well as other relatively impoverished and socially isolated areas have not responded as successfully to the existing range of economic development programs as have other rural areas second agricultural production perhaps more so than in other regions is central to the economies of remote great plains counties but the summary of research presented here suggests that unless new initiatives in integrating agriculture and rural development strategies are successful even the longstanding importance of that sector may not reverse the trends now shaping the great plains region finally the remoteness of so much of the great plains is significant factor in frustrating even the most optimistic development strategies continuing role for agriculture it appears that the agriculturedependent counties of the great plains region generally and remote counties in particular may have stark choices before them these areas may remain in agriculture because nonagricultural development strategies have not been as successful in the great plains region as they have been in other parts of the united states this is so even though on per capita basis the counties of the great plains receive relatively high level of federal funds population in this area is declining because modern agriculture does not provide highwage jobs and there are few choices for nonfarm work what nonfarm work is available is generally lowskilled andor pays less than comparable work in urban areas singlesector dominated economies are highly vulnerable to external shocks eg global price declines for raw agricultural commodities cheaper sourcing sites for timber and minerals even in local economies where tourism is important shifts in vacation destinations can damage businesses and related tax revenues more economically diverse areas weather macroeconomic shocks better with most us farm households heavily dependent on offfarm income those in rural areas without diversified economies are at an increasing disadvantage47 this disadvantage is especially severe for farmdependent counties if one assumes that agriculture will remain significant economic sector in the great plains for the foreseeable future successful rural development strategies may need to consider the extent to which agriculture can impede or promote more diverse rural economies rather than 47 only approximately 13 of farm households receive more than 80 of their household income from farming see ashock mishra and m morehart farm families savings findings from the arms survey agricultural outlook april 2002 crs23 focusing largely on policies that aim at bulk production of agricultural commodities policymakers may begin to evaluate nontraditional ways in which agriculture might contribute to healthy rural economies in many areas of the country it may be the case that healthy nonfarm rural economy will become the most effective means of maintaining communities and the future sustainability of the farm population rural development researchers and others observe that because less than 2 of rural residents identify farming as their primary occupation efforts to stimulate economic development through agriculture may not directly address the large majority of the population who have few if any substantial ties to agriculture the great plains might arguably be one area of the united states where greater emphasis on non farm policies might have the effect of integrating agriculture in ways that enhance the overall regional economy48 as discussed above farmingdependent counties are disproportionately represented among remote and lowwageincome counties few development strategies that focus on the nonfarm sector have had pronounced positive effects in the great plains other variables limit the economic development opportunities of the region first the remoteness of the region makes it unlikely that advanced manufacturing facilities will locate there many hightechnology manufacturing enterprises increasingly choose to locate near suppliers or their customer base they also rely on business and professional services that are almost nonexistent in remote rural areas second there are fewer natural environmental amenities such as are found in the mountain west or in many retirement destination areas the plains may hold their own beauty to many but the climate may not be conducive to strategies that rely on attracting and retaining highpaying manufacturing firms with estimates as high as 300000 us communities vying for 15000 firms reportedly seeking to relocate remote areas of the great plains face serious challenge structural changes in agriculture changes in agriculture have led some analysts to suggest new policy considerations for the great plains49 longstanding trends toward fewer larger and more specialized commercial farms and ranches in the united states horizontal integration are well documented not only have these trends been observed for many years recent data suggest they may be accelerating as pressures increase from global competitors and as new agricultural technologies continue to reinforce the substitution of capital for labor some researchers have argued that current trends are leading to farm structure where 10000 acre corn farms may soon become the economically efficient size unit for that commodity50 rapid and increasing consolidation and coordination and deepening vertical integration in agriculture are indicators of more fundamental restructuring occurring in the global food and fiber system today growing

production system formed by agribusiness firms that in its most coordinated form could potentially link each step of food production from proprietary genetic material to the grocery shelf broiler production is the exemplar of this trend approximately 40 firms now contract to produce 97 of all broilers these trends are appearing increasingly in pork production and are beginning in cash grains distinguishing characteristic of supply chains is their reliance on contractual agreements licenses joint ventures integrated ownership and other business arrangements with different segments of the agrofood system these alliances with producers may permit contracting firms to bypass more traditional commodity markets to better insulate themselves from price volatility and dwindling markets many commodity producers are abandoning their independent operations and adopting contract commodity production and marketing arrangements with agribusiness firms according to the usdas economic research service about 35 of the total value of us agricultural production in 1998 was produced under some form of contractual arrangement52 over half of large family farms are involved in some form of contracting and these farms accounted for over 66 of the total value of commodities under contract53 over 90 of the total value of contract production was in 10 commodity groups soybeans corn fruit vegetable nursery cotton cattle hogs poultry and dairy the growth of supply chains has implications for remote great plains counties because of their potential for creating geographically specific production sectors in agriculture that some observers have characterized as hub spoke and wedge cluster54 for example livestockprocessing plant located at hub is built near livestockfeeding operations these feeding operations are supplied by mills drawing their grain and oilseed through transportation and communication spokes connecting crop production wedges in the periphery few clusters may be needed to supply the demand many farming areas that might wish to become hub may not be able to assemble the necessary capital and managerial services to do so the characteristics of remote rural counties of the great plains might make the region compatible with largescale animal operations on the other hand it is possible that only relatively few hubs will be economically feasible under supply chain arrangements other countries eg canada may also become increasingly competitive as supply hubs some industry observers believe that under supply chain arrangement for example 50 or fewer

chains and integrated agrofood chains may pose problems for remote farmdependent areas in the great plains different kind of agriculture however one that is not oriented exclusively to the production of bulk commodities may have some potential in revitalizing the great plains recent workshop on integrating agriculture into rural development strategies pointed to many new agricultural ventures that have been successful57 they tend to be based on smallscale entrepreneurship new marketing strategies and the needs of rural people and consumers new opportunities in valueadded production may also offer remote counties in the great plains way to build production agriculture into new economic development strategies58 given the role that the landgrant system plays in the treadmill of production congress may also consider ways of making publicly funded agricultural research more responsive to the needs of new agricultural enterprises eg nontraditional crops alternative production systems marketing strategies for valueadded agricultural development with the aging of existing farm owneroperators new opportunities for beginning farmers may offer other ways to revitalize the relation between agriculture and rural economic development59 this is not to suggest that largescale agriculture will cease to have significant role in the great plains the great plains may actually offer new competitive advantages for this sector through innovations in environmental control and management technologies directed toward the agricultural sector it has long been central statement of hope and optimism that support for agriculture would translate into strong sustainable rural communities when agriculture dominated the rural economy in the early 20th century this was in large part true but with the exception of some areas of the united states agriculture plays relatively small role in most rural economies now modernizing agriculture has traditionally meant improving production and improving production has been defined almost exclusively as increasing output per unit supported by the landgrant university system research into everincreasing production efficiency has also been 55 g benjamin industrialization in hog production implications for midwest agriculture economic perspectives federal reserve bank of chicago 1997 56 opposition to these industrialization trends is also

order to remain competitive in turn this systematic adoption of technology either reduces or holds prices down for farmers while it increases their cost of production producers who fail to adopt new technology lose their competitive advantage producers who adopt new technology are often rewarded with even lower prices and narrower profit margin see willard cochrane the development of american agriculture historical analysis 2nd ed minneapolis university of minnesota press 1993 61 overview of transportation infrastructure and services in the northern great plains report prepared for the northern great plains regional authority by the northeastmidwest institute 2000 62 the commission on the future of the united states aerospace industry was established by section 1092 of the floyd d spence national defense authorization act of 2002 the commission was formed to study the future of the united states aerospace industry in the global economy particularly in relationship to united states national security and to assess the future importance of the domestic aerospace industry for the economic and national security of the united states crs27 becomes increasingly congested in its stead the commission recommended the further investigation of small aircraft transport system sats essentially an air taxi system such system could link small remote areas within larger region and with capacity for regional travel some of the disadvantages of remote locations might be mitigated whether this innovation could make the great plains more attractive to manufacturers is unknown the sats concept is based on new generation of affordable small aircraft supported by an airborne internet each would operate within system of small airports serving thousands of suburban rural and remote communities the sats concept makes greater use of small aircraft for personal and business transportation sats should be able to do this by increasing the supply of smaller aircraft for flightondemand and for use in pointtopoint direct travel between smaller aviation facilities such as regional airports general aviation and other landing facilities including heliports the sats architecture would incorporate an advanced onboard weather data collection system for any landing facility in the united states sats would use internet communications technologies for travel planning and scheduling sats research is intended to create the possibility of using landing facilities that would not require control towers or radar surveillance the sats architecture would be created to operate within the national airspace system nas but in more automated manner among the 5000 or so existing publicuse landing facilities with total of over 18000 of these smaller landing facilities serving vast numbers of communities in the united states ultimately all of these facilities could employ sats operating capabilities national aeronautical and space administration nasa investments in technologies have led to the emergence of new generation of small aircraft these new aircraft would possess nearallweather operating capabilities and would be compatible with the modernization of the national airspace system the new aircraft would incorporate stateoftheart advancements in avionics airframes engines and advanced pilot training technologies regional approaches to rural economic development introduction regional economic development alliances are enjoying resurgence of interest in many parts of the united states while the concept of such alliances is not new its application to rural areas has been minimal proponents of regional approaches share the view that the historic pattern of communitybased economic development longer addresses the complexity of rural issues that may characterize larger geography the fiscal crises in many states are also creating pressures on many rural communities to seek new solutions to providing essential community services through pooling resources largely the creation of state and regional development entities and metropolitan planning organizations these new regional organizations have adopted two general categories of strategies first strategies based on the types of regions involved ie regional organizations that attempt to address common problems arising between urban and rural areas or that better balance urban and rural needs as these areas overlap second development category is based on the types of projects in which regions are involved eg building crs28 or revitalizing rural cultures developing broadband capacity preserving natural resources enhancing transportation infrastructure63 congress has had long history of support for regional authorities such as the tennessee valley authority tva and the appalachian regional commission arc both the tva and the arc have continued to support economic development and social change in their respective regions substantial body of literature now exists on the impact of these regional authorities while there continue to be differences in opinion about the development successes of these authorities an empirical assessment of arcs impact over 26 years in the regions 391 counties concluded that the programs did produce significant growth using methodology based on paired communities the authors concluded that growth was significantly faster in the 391 appalachian counties than it was in the control counties this also held true for central appalachia the poorest subregion in the arc another reported result was improved local planning in arc counties compared to the control counties64 more recently congress has authorized new regional approaches to common concerns by establishing the denali commission 1998 the delta regional authority 2000 and most recently the northern great plains regional authority 2002 legislation for three other regional bodies was also introduced in the108th congress 1 bill to establish southwest border authority to promote economic development in the border regions of arizona california new mexico and texas s 458hr 1071 2 bill to create regional authority in the southeast hr 141 the southeast crescent authority seca the seca would assist economically distressed communities in alabama georgia florida mississippi north carolina south carolina and virginia and 3 bill to create the delta black belt regional authority hr 678 the bill to create the southwest border authority was referred to the committee on environment and public works in february 2003 the bill to establish the seca was referred in january 2003 to the subcommittee on economic development public buildings and emergency management of the house transportation and infrastructure committee and in february 2003 to the subcommittee on domestic and international monetary policy trade and technology of the house financial services committee in june 2003 the subcommittee on economic development public buildings and emergency management forwarded the measure to its full committee the bill to create the delta black belt regional authority was referred to the subcommittee on domestic and international monetary policy trade and technology on march 10 2003 the northern great plains regional authority ngpra the ngpra is newly created federalstateprovincial partnership that includes iowa 63 for selective overview of five case studies of

planning association 61 3 summer 1995 crs29 minnesota nebraska north and south dakota and the provinces of manitoba and saskatchewan in 1994 congress passed the northern great plains rural development act pl103318 the following year the northern great plains rural development commission was established in 1997 the commission issued its regional development report to congress and the commission was sunset later that year ngp inc was established to implement the commissions recommendations discussions with the regions congressional delegation led to plan to create regional development authority similar to the one congress created for the delta authority the farm security and rural investment act of 2002 pl107171 section 6028 established the ngpra to implement the commissions plan and authorized 30 million to be appropriated each year 20022007 to support the authoritys programs funding however was appropriated for the authority in fy2002 or fy2003 for fy2004 the authority was provided 15 million in funding by the consolidated appropriations act of 2004 pl108199 at the local level the ngpra intends to rely on the existing network of the economic development administrations eda designated economic development districts to coordinate efforts within multicounty area these eda districts known as local development districts ldds are regional entities with extensive experience in assisting small municipalities and counties improve basic infrastructure and help stimulate economic growth they also serve as the delivery mechanism for variety of other federal and state programs such as aging economic development emergency management small business development telecommunications transportation and workforce development programs ngpra economic development strategies the ngpra has identified four areas for their strategic planning 1 agriculture and natural resources 2 economic and policy analysis 3 information technology and 4 leadership capacity development given the central role of agriculture in the regional economy the authority is integrating into its planning shifts in consumer demand toward organic foods recognition of the shift to supplychains in production discussed above and the corresponding need to develop identity preserved commodities and the emerging importance of nonfood commodities ie biobased industrial commodities central objective is to turn the great plains into an internationally recognized center for biomass research and use these agricultural plans are also grounded more broadly in transforming the transportation systems of the regions developing local and regional leadership capacity and expanding the availability and use of information technologies within the region legislation in the 108th congress as with past congresses members of the 108th congress have introduced wide range of bills that would have direct implications for rural areas legislation addressing health care business development medicare community development organizations telecommunications transportation conservation and native american issues among others either target rural areas specifically or are open to all political jurisdictions in addition to these initiatives funds for rural development programs authorized by the 2002 farm bill pl107171 also provide loan and grant support specifically to rural areas for water and waste water facilities valueadded crs30 agricultural development telemedicine rural business development alternative energy native americans and rural housing two bills introduced in the 108th congress hr 2194 and s 602 and discussed below specifically target areas that have suffered significant population outmigration over the past 20 years while not designating remote rural areas per the bills provisions may be of particular interest to remote areas approximately onethird of the 242 remote counties had the population losses in the last decade alone that qualify for assistance authorized in these two bills see also figure 1 above third bill hr 137 targets rural job creation and labor training from regional basis supporters say that regional approaches to rural development may hold particular promise through the increased recognition of the significant ties that exist between urbansuburban areas and their outlying rural areas new homestead act hr 2194 and s 602 these identical bills provide financial assistance and incentives designed to stem population outmigration from rural areas the qualifying criterion is that an individual live in or relocate to county that is 1 outside metropolitan statistical area and 2 has suffered 10 or greater population outmigration over the previous 20 years modeling itself on the original homestead act of 1862 the bill would provide financial incentives to both individuals and businesses provisions include i new homestead opportunities student loan repayments authorizes the secretary of education to pay up to total of 10000 over five years to any person who 1 completes either an associate or bachelor degree and 2 resides in qualifying county and 3 is employed in qualifying county these provisions would potentially have the effect of stemming the loss of the most educated tax incentives for new home buyers provides 5000 tax credit for the home purchases of individuals who locate in qualified areas for five years or 10 of purchase price whichever is lower tax deductions protects home values by allowing losses in home value to be deducted from federal income taxes individual homestead accounts creates taxfavored accounts to help build savings and increase access to credit individuals can contribute maximum of 2500 per year for up to five years and there is governmentmatching contribution of 25100 depending on income tax and penaltyfree distributions can be made after five years for small business loans education expenses firsttime home purchases and unreimbursed medical expenses accounts can grow taxfree and all funds are available for withdrawal upon retirement ii new incentives for main street businesses creates rural investment tax credits to target investments in high outmigration counties states receive 1 million of these credits per eligible county credits are allocated to businesses that move to or expand to qualifying county businesses use these credits to offset the cost of newly crs31 constructed or existing buildings over 10year period businesses can use these credits to reduce their taxes by as much as 80 of their total investment authorizes microenterprise tax credits to aid small businesses 5 or fewer employees in high outmigration counties microenterprises can use the tax credits to reduce their taxes by 30percent of their qualifying new investment limited to 25000 lifetime for equipment purchases tied to rural investment tax credit projects businesses would be able to accelerate the equipments depreciation iii new homestead venture capital fund establishes 3 billion venture capital fund to invest in businesses in high outmigration counties the fund would guarantee up to 40 of private investments in existing business and startups and up to 60 of such investments in manufacturing or hightechnology ventures the fund can take equity positions and extend credit to other approved entities federal government would invest 200 million per year for 10 years states and private investors would be required to provide yearly matching funds of 50 million each or 1 for each 4 of federal funds new homestead economic opportunity act hr 1686 this bill is almost identical to hr 2194 and s 602 it includes the same titles and authorizes the same provisions with some slight modification eg the student loan repayment maximum is 3000 per year rather than 2000 as with the new homestead act this bill also makes living and working in county with 10 population out migration over the previous 20 years the qualifying criterion for assistance rural america job assistance and creation act hr 137 this bill is also aimed at improving the opportunities available to areas where population out migration is significant expands the work opportunity tax credit within designated development zones where population has declined where job growth is low and where poverty is high provides grants to business consortia for developing the work skills of regional workers the training is directed toward the development of skills that are benchmarked to advanced industry practices provides grants for business incubators for newly established small and mediumsized businesses status of legislation in june 2003 hr 2194 was referred to the house agriculture subcommittee on conservation credit rural development and research and s 602 was read twice and referred to the committee on finance hr 1686 was also referred to the house agriculture subcommittee on conservation credit rural development and research hr 137 was referred to the house financial services committee subcommittee on domestic and international monetary policy trade and technology in february 2003 crs32 conclusion some might argue that what is occurring in the remote counties of the great plains region today is the inevitable logic of technological progress the decline of older industries and the existence of more attractive opportunities in urban areas moreover it represents longstanding cycle of economic ups and downs for the region but an argument can also be made that the outputenhancing technologies of public agriculture research were never neutral from this perspective it is necessary to review real tangible costs as well as gains there is ample evidence that relocation decisions are not unidimensional people do not relocate simply to increase income opportunities to increase household income are weighed against competing desires and interests the desire to live in rural community where ones family has long resided are understandable decisions made with conscious tradeoffs people do leave areas however when there are very few choices for gaining livelihood data discussed above indicates that the great plains remains disproportionately farmdependent that it is suffering substantial population out migration that traditional rural economic development strategies have not been notably successful in the region and that the great plains relies heavily on various forms of federal payments while such payments also go to other areas in the united states they are now central to the wellbeing of many residents of the great plains yet the form of payments ie income supports may not have the same longterm impact as capital investment funds in the absence of successful efforts to reverse the decline the result of these various trend lines appears somewhat pessimistic historical evidence reveals how the changing organization of industrial production produces clear winners and clear losers the rise of the textile industry in 18th century britain depopulated rural areas in the course of two generations displaced skilled craftsmen and forever altered the social and spatial histories of that country the long trendline of shrinking farm sector in the united states is not news it has happened in every region of the country but the conditions in the remote counties of the great plains are different in degree if not kind and may require different responses the slow decline of agricultural employment has not been accompanied by significant opportunities in other areas one observer testified before congress the farm and ranch communities of the nations heartland are in the midst of an opportunity crisis65 some analysts and observers would hold that in the absence of evidence that public intervention was necessary correction to otherwise wellfunctioning markets what is occurring in the great plains while disruptive may be inevitable from that perspective the question asked above of why invest in rural america will have been definitively answered by market logic66 not doing anything but allowing existing trends to continue unabated may in effect be public policy the 65 chuck hassebrook testimony on rural development before the senate agriculture nutrition and forestry committee 107th congress 2nd session august 2 2001 66 this is not to imply that economic criteria are the only or even the most important basis for making economic development decisions while market forces remain the dominant means of allocating resources and wealth in the united states they have never been the sole means of making policy decisions crs33 consequences of such policy decision may not have been adequately assessed however the great difficulty is determining what the realistic options are from public policy perspective initial congressional efforts to create new incentives to reverse regional population outmigration would predictably be welcomed by great plains communities in their view reversing population outmigration may be the first order of business67 it can be argued that the great plains is not remote because it is economically undeveloped it is economically undeveloped because it is remote and remains largely dependent on single dominant but declining economic sector new initiatives in regional transportation and developments in broadband telecommunications may offer important if partial solutions to some of the problems of remoteness at their height in the 1960s and 1970s however us regional policies to address ruralurban disparities were still relatively modest efforts68 current congressional efforts to expand on regional solutions in other geographic areas may produce outcomes that the great plains regional authority can adapt to their own circumstances but unless the areas become more attractive for people to live and work such interventions may produce only modest changes69 market changes and the deepening of economic internationalization may direct precisely that outcome yet policymakers rural researchers and rural observers have yet to fully understand how spatial and socioeconomic environments have interacted to produce the existing development patterns in the great plains and retarded alternative patterns70 remoteness is not the only variable in these interactions but it may serve 67 michael lind the new continental divide the atlantic monthly januaryfebruary 2003 68 in contrast europe has embraced relatively ambitious regional programs this regional emphasis in europe may reflect more pronounced disparities between urban areas and rural regions there compared to the united states most recently one can see this policy difference in the eus common agricultural policy reforms where rural development is one of the three central pillars of agricultural reform 69 some regional development analysts have argued that making areas attractive to the creative classes is necessary ingredient for successful economic development in the future conventional economic development models may longer suffice focusing more on why certain cities are declining and others thriving these observers cite the importance of making adaptations in local cultures to attract and retain creative class employees business have begun doing this but civic leaders have generally not grasped that what is true for corporations may also be true for cities and regions see richard florida the rise of the creative class new york basic books 2002 in contrast other analysts have argued that the statistical evidence for the role of the creative class is far less convincing see steve malanga the curse of the creative class city journal vol 14 1 winter 2004 70 it is also the case that what rural researchers often think is effective might be otherwise in late 1980s study of 548 nonmetro counties researchers for the national governors association were surprised to learn that 13 variables widely thought to be important factors in differentiating communities that grew from those that did not eg change in employment federal spending on development county population adjacency to metro area could only explain about 17 of the growth that actually occurred see sandra s batie dewitt john and kim norris brighter future for rural america strategies for continued crs34 as proxy for multidimensional set of characteristics that exerts powerful influence on the possibilities available to the great plains region rural development programs that are placespecific ie that take existing social and economic development programs and modify them to address the particular circumstances of specific rural areas could have value to the great plains region and other distinctive rural areas 70 continued communities and states washington dc national governors association 1988 crs35 appendix measuring rurality rural development researchers have pointed out the importance of developing more analytically sound rural taxonomies for public policy71 probably the most widely cited rural typologies were developed by usdas economic research service these typologies are based on countys general economic specialization and its policy type tables 7 and 8 while they have been very useful for breaking down the great diversity of rural areas into more manageable units they may not be as useful for targeting rural development policies as typologies that are comprised of multidimensional scales linking particular set of rural development policies to varied rural conditions would be aided by the development of rural taxonomy permitting the delineation of one group of rural places from another based on set of particular characteristics of the rural places remote rural areas have characteristics that are different from for example rural areas that are within closer commuting distance to city they do not differ from other rural areas simply in terms of their remoteness although this is significant characteristic rather remoteness seems to be central identifier encompassing multidimensional attributes of these areas for example significant population loss lowwages above average poverty distinctive demographic characteristics singlesector economies andor highunemployment particular combinations of socioeconomic characteristics could be helpful in identifying particular policy regimes to address the particular needs of these areas72 71 see david

degree of urbanization and proximity to metro area the scale permits analysis of trends in nonmetro areas that may be related to population density and the influences from the metro area adjacent nonmetro counties are physically adjacent to one or more of the office of management and budgets omb metropolitan statistical areas msa and have at least 2 of the employed labor force in the nonmetro county commuting to cental metro counties nonmetro counties that do not meet these criteria are classified as not adjacent crs38 table 9 ruralurban continuum codes code description metropolitan

to metro area source usda economic research service table 10 presents second scale based on the evidence that an areas geographic context has significant effect on its development it is somewhat discouraging for rural development researchers to acknowledge that over the past 20 years most successful rural areas became so through some urbanbased influence74 the urban influence codes in table 10 recognize this empirical reality and classify counties both by size and by access to larger economies small rural economies with access to centers of trade finance and communication fare much better socially and economically than remote counties while the internet may make some physical access less important in the future those rural areas with access to dynamic population centers are more likely than remote rural areas to create and maintain diverse and successful economies 74 some researchers regard the city as the essential engine of development see jane jacobs the economy of cities 1969 and cities and the wealth of nations 1984 crs39 table 10 urban influence codes code description metropolitan counties 1 large in metro area of 1 million or more population 2 small in metro area
