specialist in european affairs foreign affairs and national defense division summary article v of the north atlantic treaty does not guarantee the use of force to assist an ally under attack nonetheless the us pledge of collective defense has been the core of the alliance nato views collective defense and not collective security as its core function this study will not be updated article v collective security organization settles disputes among its members in contrast collective defense organization assists member state under attack by an outside country nato is collective defense organization article v states that nato members must consider coming to the aid of an ally under attack however it does not guarantee assistance article v is the treatys key provision and the linchpin binding the united states to its nato allies it states in part that an armed attack against one or more allies shall be considered an attack against them all additional language makes clear that the commitment to assist an ally is not unconditional rather each signatory will assist the ally under attack with such action it deems necessary including the use of armed force1 since the early 1990s nato has begun to adopt new missions such as crisis management and peacekeeping sometimes referred to as nonarticle v missions current members and candidate states however believe collective defense as expressed in article v remains the core of the alliance view likely to endure as long as the possibility of nationalistic aggressive russia remains 1 article v states in full the parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in europe or north america shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that if such an armed attack occurs each of them in exercise of the right of individual or collective selfdefense recognized by article 51 of the charter of the united nations will assist the party or parties so attacked by taking forthwith individually and in concert with the other parties such action as it deems necessary including the use of armed force to restore and maintain the security of the north atlantic area any such armed attack and all measures taken as result thereof shall immediately be reported to the security council such measures shall be terminated when the security council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security congressional research service the library of congress crs2 collective security precursor to collective defense congress was reluctant to engage the united states in either world war in each conflict strong presidential advocacy and growing threats to broader us interests led to eventual involvement after world war i the us senate voted down the versailles treaty and with it involvement in the league of nations because opposition remained strong to entangling alliances the protection offered by the atlantic and pacific oceans contributed to the view that the united states still enjoyed relatively unbridgeable barrier against attack the league of nations covenant embedded in the versailles treaty allowed but did not require signatories to use military force and economic sanctions against an aggressor the league embodied the idea of collective security under which an international organization might seek to settle disputes among its members president wilson and other league supporters emphasized the condemnation of public opinion and moral force as key instruments in international affairs hitlers manipulation of public opinion and his intimidation of neighboring states made mockery of such notions churchill who urged military force against germany from the early 1930s taunted supporters of collective security and the league as guilty of longsuffering and inexhaustible gullibility2 us absence from the league left the institution without the strongest economic and military power after world war i and therefore without effective leadership collective defense evolution of an idea the global depression of the 1930s and the second world war made clear that events in europe greatly affected us economic and political interests from desire to bring global stability there was considerable support in congress for creation of the united nations in 1945 article 1 of the charter outlined resolve to maintain international peace and security and take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace and for the suppression of acts of aggression article 51 stated the inherent right of individual or collective selfdefense if an armed attack occurs unanimous vote in the security council was necessary for collective response and the soviet union blocked meaningful action in the early years in the late 1940s continuing instability in europe led congress and president truman to move towards clear engagement in european security the soviet unions blockade of berlin sovietbacked coup in czechoslovakia and civil war in greece with communists pitted against democratic government were key events arousing us efforts to construct security edifice in 1948 sen vandenberg previously an isolationist sponsored resolution stating that the united states should pursue the progressive development of regional and other collective defense arrangements for individual and collective selfdefense in accordance with the charter the senate foreign relations committee approved the resolution which passed and issued report on the proposed north atlantic treaty that strongly 2 for contemporary view see eh carr the twenty years crisis 191939 new york 1939 crs3 endorsed collective defense the senate approved the treaty which went into force august 24 19493 the foreign relations committee report recommended us association with arrangements for collective defense but laid down three conditions for us involvement first us contributions to collective defense must supplement rather than replace the efforts of the other participants on their behalf this condition frequently noted in senate debate in succeeding years meant that allies must contribute significant forces to their own defense so that the united states would not bear the brunt of the burden second president must follow constitutional processes for the united states to become involved in any security arrangement or conflict signal that the senate wished to exercise its duty to give advice and consent to defense arrangements that might commit us forces to war third for the united states to fulfill collective defense commitment us national interests must clearly be affected4 from natos early days the role and size of us forces in europe were keys to ensuring the viability of article v only small contingents of us conventional forces were in europe at natos origins in 1949 the outbreak of the korean war in 1950 and western europes continuing economic weakness and political instability led president truman to send more us forces to the continent in the early 1950s there was strong opposition in congress to the policy of sending largescale us forces to europe given the long expressed sentiment that the united states should supplement rather than replace allied forces presidents truman and eisenhower eventually prevailed in their desire to maintain sizeable us force in the european theater us officials seeing growing soviet threat desired contribution of west german economic and military potential to the alliance west germany joined the alliance in 1955 nuclear weapons and flexible response the development of nuclear arsenals by both the united states and the soviet union complicated the debate over collective defense from the 1950s through the end of the cold war through the mid1950s the united states had larger and more sophisticated nuclear arsenal than the soviet union while the warsaw pact was thought to maintain conventional superiority however by 1960 the soviets successful space program and their development of large bomber fleet and missile force clearly signalled that the continental united states was vulnerable to nuclear attack in any conflict originating in europe the european allies sought reassurances that the united states would trade washington for moscow if war again came to europe in 1967 under us leadership the alliance formulated the doctrine of flexible response by which nato would use whatever means necessary to deter or repel soviet attack conventional forces would be initially engaged but the united states pledged that it would use its strategic nuclear arsenal to defeat the warsaw pact if conventional forces failed in the defense of western europe succeeding us administrations and congress consistently urged the allies to increase their conventional forces as the principal means to 3 see north atlantic treaty senate foreign relations committee report 81st congress 1st sess washington june 6 1949 4 ibid p 78 crs4 defeat soviet attack and avoid the calamity of nuclear conflict in 1978 for example the alliance agreed upon nonbinding pledge to increase defense spending by 3 year in order to strengthen conventional forces this commitment was only irregularly met by the allies several factors contributed to the europeans failure to strengthen their conventional forces the presence of significant political groupings that viewed increased defense expenditures as provocative in an already tense international atmosphere economic strictures and the stationing by 1980 of over 300000 us forces that carried significant part of the burden conventional forces were expensive to maintain and nuclear forces were relatively inexpensive both france and britain had nuclear arsenals which their political leaders believed contributed to deterrence some observers continue to believe that flexible response was essentially myth in the view of one prominent analyst the attempt to deter conventional aggression in europe with nuclear arsenal controlled by noneuropean power the united states that is itself subject to nuclear retaliation has never appeared to be an example of political or military rationality5 nonetheless in the view of many strategists the us threat to use nuclear weapons served to create sufficient doubt in the minds of soviet leaders to deter an attack the united states deployed some of its nuclear weapons in forward areas such as west german territory to signal the warsaw pact that they might be used early in conflict the presence of significant us conventional forces was itself component of the philosophy of deterrence washington in this view would never allow us troops to be overrun and would ultimately defend them with nuclear systems if the need arose us nuclear systems in europe were step on the ladder of flexible response strategically the united states and its allies sought to enhance the link between us forces in europe and the us strategic nuclear arsenal with the 1979 alliance decision to base us intermediate nuclear forces inf in europe the forward deployment in germany and elsewhere of these mobile and highly accurate missiles was meant to signal moscow and reassure the allies that these systems controlled by the united states could be employed to defeat soviet invasion doubts over the us commitment to article v endured throughout the cold war the strategic defense initiative sdi proposed in 1984 provoked criticism that the reagan administration wished to create system that could shield the united states but not its allies against nuclear attack in the language of the era europeans viewed sdi as decoupling the link between the united states and western europe reagan administration officials countered that sdi by protecting the united states from nuclear attack made easier any necessary decision in conflict to use nuclear systems against the soviets article v after the cold war the collapse of the ussr and the current disarray of the russian military have eliminated any significant threat to western europe and the united states nato has developed new missions relating to crisis management virtually all us nuclear systems have been removed from europe only few hundred nuclear gravity bombs of limited military utility remain official nato doctrine does not describe russia as an enemy nuclear systems are longer targeted on russia and nuclear weapons are now for use 5 lawrence freedman nato myths in george thibault ed the art and practice of military strategy washington ndu press 1984 p 692 crs5 only in last resort different formulation from flexible response where such weapons were strategically mixed with conventional forces and might be used where appropriate to defeat soviet attack6 the soviet threat bound the allies together the risks that have replaced that threat have given rise in the view of some observers to regionalization in nato that could undermine the viability of article v countries in one region of the alliance are concerned about dangers inherent in their geographic neighborhoods that may not directly affect allies in distant corner of europe in 1991 there was concrete example of regionalization when turkey agreed to lend its bases as staging area for airstrikes against iraq in the persian gulf war turkish officials indicated that they might invoke article v if iraq retaliated initially the german government was sharply critical of us efforts to expel iraqi forces from kuwait otto von lambsdorff then key figure in the german coalition government said in response to the turkish inquiry we are convinced that missile attack on turkish territory does not require nato response some members of the german bundestag contended that it was turkey by allowing us aircraft to attack targets from turkish bases that had acted provocatively and that germany must not honor any request from ankara for assistance7 nato expansion and article v the administration continues to describe collective defense as the core of the alliance before the senate armed services committee on april 23 1997 sen kempthorne asked if nato is not antirussian then what is it who is the alliance defending against secretary of state albright responded the threat is basicallythe instability within the region and which has in fact created two world wars but there is also the possibility of an outside threat there is possibility of threats from various parts outside the region to the south we have to guard against and on the off chance that in fact russia does not turn out the way we are hoping it will and its current leadership wants nato is there8 some observers believe that the importance of article v in the absence of russian threat is at least temporarily diminished they express concern that the growing importance for nato of nonarticle v missions is making the alliance more collective security than collective defense organization regionalization in this view could dilute the effectiveness of the alliance natos mission in bosnia has not been undertaken to respond to or prevent an attack on an ally but rather as crisis management reaching unanimity for the long term in bringing stability to bosnia is proving difficult some allies see an element of regionalization in enlargement of the alliance officials from italy greece and turkey 6 see library of congress crs nato nuclear strategy issues for us policy by stanley r sloan crs report 96653 july 25 1996 7 germany reluctant to defend turkey if iraq retaliates washington post jan 22 1991 p a20 ultimately chancellor kohl sent aircraft to turkey to be used to defend turkish airspace but not for attack against iraq 8 hearing on nato enlargement senate armed services committee april 23 1997 unpaginated manuscript crs6 for example have stronger concerns about stability in the balkans than do the norwegians or the danes in the debate over enlargement rome athens and ankara supported the entry into nato of slovenia and romania as means to assure stability the nordics opposed the candidacies of these two countries and the danes urged the admission of the baltic states9 nato remains an organization geared for collective defense and leaders of nato states point out that the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce serves the purpose of collective security through such actions as monitoring human rights arbitrating conflicts and overseeing elections in selective member states nato in contrast insists that candidates for membership resolve ethnic and border conflicts before entering the alliance an exception to this rule has been natos effort to manage tensions between greece and turkey both alliance members agreeing upon cohesive response to threats short of war is difficult due to geography political traditions and economic need article v raises the possibility of range of responses to counter threat an ally may take such action as it deems necessary including the use of armed force to restore and maintain the security of the north atlantic area presumably such action could be an economic embargo or other steps short of force to compel state threatening an ally to adopt more benign policy some administration officials are discussing nuclear proliferation with candidate states as threat that could cause article v to be invoked it is not clear that all allies would agree that article v is appropriate for such threat at the same time the important difference from the era of collective security between the world wars is that the united states is clearly engaged in europe as natos leader and maintains the capacity to deter or defeat an adversary that threatens an allys survival 9 see library of
