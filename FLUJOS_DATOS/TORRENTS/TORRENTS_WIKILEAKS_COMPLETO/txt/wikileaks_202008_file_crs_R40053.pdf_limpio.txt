wikileaks document release httpwikileaksorgwikicrsr40053 february 2 2009 congressional research service report r40053 surface transportation program reauthorization issues for the 111th congress john w fischer coordinator specialist in transportation policy december 4 2008 abstract the most diﬃcult issue likely to be considered during reauthorization is how to ﬁnance it the highway trust fund and the revenue sources that feed it have been reliable mechanism for ﬁnancing highway and transit programs for ﬁve decades but more almost all transportation industry observers see need for larger federal contribution to national infrastructure creation in the years ahead for number of reasons discussed in this report fuel taxes which provide most of the money for surface transportation are unlikely to provide foundation for this desired growth even if congress were to raise them modestly the choice for policymakers therefore is to ﬁnd new sources of income for an expanded program or alternately to settle for smaller program that might look very diﬀerent than the one currently in place debate on the speciﬁcs of the highway program will focus on the donordonee funding distribution issue earmarking and possible programmatic reorganization speciﬁc programs such as the highway bridge program can be expected to receive extensive congressional attention due to public concerns about the condition of the nations transportation infrastructurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsr40053g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and

transportation programs is required by the end of fy2009 although it will likely be difficult to meet that target reauthorization has become difficult undertaking in the last two decades this is primarily due to controversy over how and to whom federalaid highway funds should be distributed the most recent law the safe accountable flexible efficient transportation equity act legacy for users safetealu or safetea pl 10959 was enacted 22 months after previous legislation had originally expired previous reauthorization bills also arrived well after their required reenactment dates the most difficult issue likely to be considered during reauthorization is how to finance it the highway trust fund and the revenue sources that feed it have been reliable mechanism for financing highway and transit programs for five decades but more almost all transportation industry observers see need for larger federal contribution to national infrastructure creation in the years ahead for number of

mode stly the choice for policymakers therefore is to find new sources of income for an expanded program or alternately to settle for smaller program that might look very different than the one currently in place debate on the specifics of the highway program will focus on the donordonee funding distribution issue earmarking and possible programmatic reorganization specific programs such as the highway bridge program can be expected to receive extensive congressional attention due to public concerns about the condition of the nations transportation infrastructure transit industry advocates also seek additional funding in the reauthorization bill many supporters believe the nation is underinvesting in public transit infrastructure and that should be significantly increased to deal with an existing b acklog of projects and other future needs against this backdrop congress can be expected to look closely at existing transit program spending priorities and perhaps modify them other issues such as rural transit paratransit productivity service optimization and competition are likely to arise as well surface transportation program reauthorization also includes number of programmatic and issue areas beyond those specifically associated with funding highways and transit freight issues have been of growing importance in recent years and figure to get significantly more attention as part of the reauthorization debate highway safety motor carrier safety research planning and environmental issues will each be addressed in detail in the months ahead

early 1980s the periodic debate leading to reauthorization of federal surface transportation programs has been primarily about money and its distribution in each of the five reauthorizations that took place during that period 1982 1987 1991 1998 and 2005 the federal fuel taxes and other sources of revenue dedicated to the highway trust fund were reliably providing the various surface transportation programs with more money to spend on an annual basis in 2009 this will not be the case for the first time in decades driving has declined significantly with concomitant decrease in fu tax revenues going forward the program cannot count on new money from the old familiar sources at the same time there is growing concern that investment in the nations infrastructure is lagging against this backdrop the nation is dealing with an ongoing recession the effects of which could play major role in the reauthorization debate reauthorization of federal surface transportation programs is required by the end of fy2009 although it will likely be difficult to meet that target 1 reauthorization has become difficult undertaking in the last two decades this is primarily due to controversy over how and to whom federalaid highway funds should be distributed the most recent law the safe accountable flexible efficient transportation equity act legacy for users safetealu or safeteapl 10959 was enacted 22 months after previous legislation had originally expired2 the bill prior to safetea the transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21pl 105178 as amended by pl 105206 was also passed well after previous legislative authority had originally expired in fact surface transportation act has been enacted on time since the 1970s there are variety of explanations as to why it is becoming more difficult to pass reauthorization legislation in timely manner suffice it to say for the moment that these bills have become increasingly complex in their structure and in their politics as states other program beneficiaries and related interest groups compete for very desirable federal transportation resources in potentially constrained funding environment many observers believe that safetea s alleged excesses its seemingly endless discussions about funding parity among the states the socalled donordonee debate its large number of earmarks including the socalled bridgetonowhere and the funding problems ahead could cause congress to make significant changes to the surface transportation program in this reauthorization this would represent significant change from the last two reauthorization acts which were structurally organized in the same manner as predecessor legislation as will be discussed there are many in the transportation worl d who view this structure as being out of date and more importantly barrier to focusing federal spending and effort on the projects that would do the most to meet the nationss most pressing infrastructure needs 1 surface transportation bills authorize wide variety of fe deral transportation programs but are often referred to as highway bills because the highway program constitutes significant majority of the bills funding provisions

for the unfamiliar the federal surface transportation programs and especially the highway program can be difficult to understand the language of transportation financecontract authority obligation limitations also known as the ob limit and so onare even unfamiliar to many who already have basic understanding of the annual congressional budget process therefore this report begins with discussion of how the surface transportation program is structured and how it is financed those already familiar with the program may wish to skip over these sections

are provided annually to each state department of transportation or equivalent to construct and maintain designated system of roads known as the federalaid highway system the modern federalaid highway program dates to the 1956 enactment of legislation that provided for the construction of the interstate highway system and created the highway trust fund to finance its construction the program has been reauthorized and expanded on numerous occasions during the last fiveanda half decades the federalaid highway program can be viewed as an umbrella term for the separately funded programs administered by the federal highway administration fhwa the programs which are mostly for construction project spending receive their funding in two ways they are either apportioned formula programs or allocated discretionary programs g5g152g155g142g561g507g3g153g153g152g155g157g146g152g151g142g141g508g561g18g155g152g144g155g138g150g156g561 most highway funding is reserved for five major programs which are usually referred to as the core programs they along with the equity bonus program account for the vast majority of highway spending 80 of the amount authorized for the fy2005 fy2009 period covered by safetea these programs are the national highway system program nhs the interstate maintenance program im the surface transportation program stp the bridge replacement and rehabilitation program and the congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program cmaq each of these programs provides funding for specific segments of the federalaid highway system andor other statutorily enunciated activities eg congestion relief projects using cmaq funds safetea created new large program that combines many formerly separate highway safety programs the highway safety improvement program hsip that many believe could also be viewed as core program if hsip is treated as core program the spending for core programs rises to 825 of the total highway program although it does not itself provide direct sp ending for highways the equity bonus program which will be discussed in more detail later in this report could also be thought of as core program because it provides additional funds for each of the five core programs the equity bonus is the largest single highway program in safetea accounting for approximately 20 of all available funding nhs and stp are the next two largest programs by far accounting for 153 and 163 of total funding respectively funds for these programs are apportioned to the 3 this section provides brief overview of the organization of the

are based on criteria established in highway authorization and appropriation law andor subject to congressional earmarking although all of the programs in this category are smaller than the core programs there are nonetheless some programs with significant f unding the largest allocated program is for congressionally mandated high priority projects earmarks this program which has fiveyear authorization of 148 billion is reserved for projects specifically designated in safetea two other large earmarked programs projects of national and regional significance and transportation improvement projects received 178 billion and 255 billion over the same period other relatively good sized programs in the allocated category are the federal lands program the national corridor infrastructure improvement program the interstate maintenance discretionary program the bridge discretionary program and the transportation and community and system preservation program tcsp crs

revenue stream provided by the highway trust fund the trust fund is two separate accountshighways and mass transit the primary revenue sources for these accounts are the 184 cent per gallon tax on gasoline and 244 cent per gallon tax on diesel fuel although there are other sources of revenue for the trust fund truck registrations truck tires etc the fuel taxes provide about 90 of the income to the funds the transit account receives 286 cents per gallon of fuel taxes and there is also 01 cent per gallon fuel tax reserved for an unrelated leaking underground storage tank lust fund over the 50 plus year life of the trust fund there have been several increases in the level of taxation the last increase in the fuel tax occurred in 1993 all of these funds were not actually deposited into the trust fund initially but were deposited in the treasury general funds for deficit reduction purposes until fy1998 other changes have been made in recent years that have modestly increased trust fund revenues the american jobs creation act of 2004 pl 108357 provided the trust fund with additional future income by changing elements of federal gasohol taxation at the time there were estimates that these changes could provide the trust fund with an additional 4 billion per year safetea also included number of tax and other changes that were part of the finance title of the act the revenue increases in this title were viewed as quite modest and derive mostly from cutting back on tax fraud and by transferring some treasury general fund revenues associated with transportation related activities to the trust fund nonetheless it was believed at time of passage that the changes identified in safetea when combined with the changes in gasohol legislation enacted in 2004 and enhanced by expected economic growth would be sufficient to finance the act historically the trust fund based revenue collection system has been reliable and ever growing source of funding for surface transportation in fy2007 for example the highway account received tax revenues of 343 billion while the mass transit account received 5 billion by way of comparison fy2004 highway revenues had been lower 299 billion and transit revenues were just slightly lower at 49 billion for most of their history the trust funds have collected more than has been expended relative to the size of the program defined by congress this situation has been changing in the last few years as spending on highways and transit has exceeded both highway and transit account revenues on regular basis according to the congressional budget office cbo the highwa account will have estimated outlays of 35 billion for fy2007 against the aforementioned receipts of 343 billion 4 outlays have only been able to exceed revenues during the safetea authorization period because the highway account had significant unexpended balance 106 billion at the end of the year in which safetea was enacted the same overall situation also existed for the transit account due to technical and other changes however the transit account has healthier unexpended balance at present than the highway account and its problems are not quite so immediate 4 data provided by cbo from its summer fy2008 baseline highway trust fund projections for fy2008 fy2018

unexpended balance was unsustainable cbo for example was predicting in the summer of 2008 that the unexpended balance at the end of fy2009 would be negative 37 billion responding to this prediction several transportation groups and several members of congress sought to shore up the highway account for the remainder of the safetea authorization period by transferring funds from the treasurys general fund accounts to the trust fund this transfer was opposed by dot and some members of congress as unnecessary for most of 2008 on the grounds that such transfer was premature and perhaps fiscally imprudent 5 the events of mid2008 overtook this debate however changing it from one about fy2009 to one about fy2008 as fuel prices skyrocketed through the spring and summer of 2008 american drivers did something they had done only brie fly during the gas shocks of 1973 and 1979 they reduced their driving and they did so by historic percentages for example driving was off by 44 year over year in september alone6 ultimately revenue collections for the trust fund for fy2008 fell by 3 billion as this shortfall was becoming more apparent late in the summer dot changed its position and reluctantly supported an 8017 billion transfer from the general funds to the highway account the result was pl 110318 enacted september 15 2008 with this legislation in place the unexpended balance in the highway account was positive at the end of fy2008 and there is some hope that this will be sufficient amount to insure that the account is financially sound through the safetea authorization period whether the highway account will remain healthy is an open question fuel prices have fallen dramatically late in 2008 but they have done so as the economy has fallen steadily into recession it remains to be seen therefore whether driving will increase in the months ahead with positive effects for the trust fund or remain below historic levels thereby engendering trust fund crisis before the end of fy2009 g22g145g142g561g21g3g8g7g22g7g3g561g14g142g144g138g140g162g561 the public faces of the safetea debate were the socalled donordonee debate which dominated the legislative discussion and later more public controversy over earmarking the actual process of getting to final passage how ever was complicated by the need to meet the policy imperatives of the large number of interest groups and the programs they specifically support most of which are funded from the highway trust fund but not all of which focus specifically on highways g6g152g151g152g155g550g6g152g151g142g142g561 the donordonee debate as it has evolved over the years focuses on the distribution of federal highway funds amongst the states and more impor tantly the fairness of that distribution donor state is state whose highway users pay more in revenues to the trust fund highway account then the state receives back in federal highway assistance conversely donee state receives more in assistance than the revenues it contributes to the trust fund although this 5 for detailed discussion of the arguments against transfer of funds see httpbudgetsenategovrepublican analysis2008bb082008pdf 6 white joseph b

be straightforward it is far more complicated for example federal fuel taxes are not actually collected at the state level which requires somewhat complicated mechanism that attributes fuel usage and associated revenues to individual states to determine what rate of return any particular state receives7 the donordonee issue has only been resolved in the last three reauthorization cycles by the creation of funding redistribution process of massive proportions and more importantly the availability of new money to make those proc esses work in safetea the new equity bonus eb program designed to provide distributional fairness has become the largest single highway program the eb program is complicated very few individuals understand how the process determines fund distribution partially as result of this complexity and because of other factors some states longer believe they will get the 92 return on receipts promised by the bill during the safetea debate the house and senate versions of the bill took somewhat differing approaches to solving the donordonee dispute previous legislation tea21 promised states 905 return early versions of the house bill promised states 95 return an amount that has become sort of benchmark goal for some donor states and is expected to remain so during the upcoming reauthorization debate the senate however started from lower percentage over the next two years this percentage would change of ten as would the parts of the overall highway program to which it applied until the 92 compromise was arrived at g7g138g155g150g138g155g148g146g151g144g561 the other major debate over safetea was on earmarking when istea was passed in 1991 it included 548 individual highway earmarks with total value of 62 billion in 1998 when tea21 was passed there 1883 highway earmarks adding up to 96 billion in safetea highway earmarking expanded exponentially with over 5600 earmarks accounting for 217 billion in the highway title of the act alone 8 some view earmarks and the equity bonus program as the price of getting bill passed there is some concern however that if their exponential growth continues it will not be long before the earmarks become not the grease for the wheel but the wheel itself and it should be pointed out aside from few notorious earmarks there was very little debate about the benefits or drawbacks of any individual earmark in the bill although they did not receive lot of public noti ce at the time safetea reached final passage there were several new programs added to the overall highway program and transit programs among these were two reasonably large programs the hsip and safe routes to school program as well as number of smaller programs 7 for detailed discussion of the

period fy1998 2003 in reality safetea however was just barely fiveyear bill at the time of its passage only two months remained in fy2005 at that point more useful representation of safetea therefore

become very unfocused and that it is hard to discern how lot of surface transportation spending relates to true national needs in the view of program critics the federal highway program in particular and the transit program to lesser extent have become giant revenue sharing programs in which the states and localities make most of the decisions based not on national requirements for mobility and connectivity but instead on parochial issues the result in the view of critics is that while much infrastructure is created by federal spending the focus is not necessarily on the creation of the infrastructure that would do the most to benefit the national economy those seeking to retain the status quo primarily states localities and other stakeholders with links to specific existing programs argue that changing the existing decisionmaking process would be mistake in this view the federal government long ago decided that the operation of these programs should occur at the state and local level and if anything existing federal regulationssuch as those dealing with environmental issuesshould be streamlined to make project construction and selection easier and less costly

those at the federal level having left the actual operation of surface transportation programs largely to the states and localities often have poor understanding of how federal funds are ultimately being used and whether they are being used in the most efficient and effective manner this is not to say that there are performance and productivity measures in use in the surface transportation programs states and localities have in many cases very robust processes in place to measure and analyze their programs 10 the problem in the eyes of those seeking additional atte ntion to this issue is that the mechanisms are largely internal to the states and localities operating them that there is wide variation amongst the states and localities as to the sophistication and ultimate effectiveness of these measures and that they fail to create data set that allows those at the federal level to determine whether federally provided funds are being spent wisely and well critics of performance standards however express concern that once federal performance measures are put in place states will quickly learn to game the system thus negating their value further issue should congress decide to enforce performance measures by funding penalties would be to come up with structure that would not be counteracted by any equity bonus distribution

the strengths and weaknesses of the program safetea created two commissions to study the program st ructure and the financing imperatives of the program respectively the first of these commissions the national surface transportation policy and revenue study commission surface commission issued its report entitled transportation for tomorrow early in 2008 11 the report called for substantial increase in overall federal transportation spending major reorganization of the entire federal surface transportation program into 10 new program areas often across existing programmatic modal boundaries and controversially called for dramatic increase in the federal fuel tax as well as possible new taxes and fees from number of potential source s the second commission the national surface transportation infrastructure financing comm ission revenue commission has not yet completed its work but is expected to produce its final report in january 200912 the revenue commission released an interim report in february 2008 that discussed the issues it was considering for inclusion in its final report and offered some preliminary observations on the current state of transportation finance13 in mid2008 dot provided its own thoughts on how reauthorization should proceed in report entitled refocus reform renew new transportation approach for america14 the report provided several proposals for new and reorganized surface transportation programs and heavy emphasis on how market forces and the private sector could play an expanded role in the provision of surface transportation infrastructure the views in this report reflect the policy positions of the bush administration it remains to be seen whether the incoming administration will incorporate some of these views into its own policy recommendations in the months ahead additional studies and documents touching on reau thorization have been prepared by wide spectrum of think tanks research organizations and

mentioned earlier the revenue stream for the trust fund is in precarious position although fuel prices have declined in the last months of 2008 the economic situation is such that there is guarantee that fuel use will return to previous levels let alone increase significantly in the future it is the future that perhaps causes th most concern for those seeking increased funding for transportation programs an ongoing change appears to be underway in the us vehicle fleet there is an expectation that sales of hybrids and other alternatively powered vehicles will increase in the years ahead either as result of economic or perhaps government driven forces as result fuel use could decrease on relative basis even if driving increases without an increase in the existing fuel taxes difficult political issue in recent years the fuelbased trust fund taxation system will not be able to support increased surface transportation spending the choice for policymakers therefore is to find new sources of income for the existing or perhaps expanded program or alternately to settle for smaller program that might look very different than the one currently in place in the past nothing has solved the political problems of the highway program faster than plenty of new money tea21 especially benefitted from run up in fuel usage during the boom years of the late 1990s that was at least partially the result of growing suv purchases during the period safetea did not have quite the same financial backing but the authors of the act were nonetheless able to find sufficient new revenues to make the act possible safetea created mechanism for studying the revenue issue and the concomitant programmatic issues the aforementioned national commissions at this writing the revenue commission has not yet forwarded its recommendations to congress the surface commission called for dramatic increase in the fuel taxes indexing these taxes to inflation and the study and potential adoption of wide range of levies including possible vehicle mile traveled vmt tax it is this last item that many in the transportation community view as being most promising for the long term vmt taxes are use taxes hence they are favored by those calling for programs to be funded by user taxes directly related to an individuals use of the transportation system vmt taxes are not the only potential types of user fees available for study for example weight distance taxes which are already imposed in some instances on trucks also fit the definition of user fee the concept of user fees has received significant study in recent years not just by the commission but by other organizations such as the transportation research board trb there are significant technological and other barriers including privacy issues to imposing vmt tax likely enabled by gps tracking systems further the collection of such tax is considered more complicated than the fuels tax collection system ready in place as result the transition to vmt system is viewed as longterm solution to the transportation funding issue that is likely to be mentioned in the next reauthorization act but not likely to provide much by

there is an interest in how congress might proceed with the establishment of national infrastructure bank program as outlined in presidentelect obamas campaign platform and on how such program would interact with the existing surface transportation program number of other taxes and fees have been mentioned by the surface commission aashto and others as worthy of consideration during the reauthorization debate among these are the establishment of freightrelated taxes or fees such as freight waybill tax container fee or terminal facility charge these revenues could be used to address freight bottlenecks similarly some argue that customs duties which are deposited in the general fund should be made available for primarily freight related portofentry infrastructure in addition some believe that transportation in general and perhaps the trust fund specifically should benefit from any revenues generated by broad based carbon tax that might be imposed primarily for environmental reasons if congress chooses not to impose new taxes and fees as part of the reauthorization process it could still grow the surface transportation program by authorizing an annual general fund contribution for highway programs thereby redu cing their dependence on the highway account some express concern however that this would weaken the historic link between the revenue derived from taxes and fees paid by highway users and spending on the nations highways and bridges finally congress could ultimately choose to reduce the highway programs size it could for example relegate some programs currently but not historically funded by the trust fund such as the appalachian roads program to general fund status it could also consider reducing the existing program matching ratios 9010 for inters tates 8020 for most everything else with few exceptions to levels in place in the 1980s or earlier 7225 or 7030 thereby spreading the available federal funds more broadly more dramatically it could consider limiting surface transportation funding to programs that fulfill clear national needs such as the interstate maintenance program or the federal lands high ways program and devolve any other highway program responsibilities to the states crs contacts john fischer bob kirk and will mallett g10g146g144g145g160g138g162g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561

should receive federal highway funding that is roughly equal to the transportation fees and taxes that their states highway users pay into the highway account of the trust fund donor state advocates generally contend that for too many years they have been subsidizing the repair and improvement of donee state infrastructure especially the older highway infrastructure in the northeast most also argue that they are more road dependent and do not benefit from federal transit spending to the same degree as some donee states southern and western donor states also argue that they are fast growth areas relative to most donee states and that consequently their needs are as great or greater finally they argue that with the completion of the interstate highway system there is valid rationale for the donordonee disparity donee state advocates argue that fairness should not be separated from needs they assert that the age of their highway infrastructures especially in the northeast the high cost of working on heavily congested urban roads and large sparsely populated western states with limited financial resources justify their donee status they also argue that there are needs that are inherently federal rather than state and that national highway network cannot be based solely on state or regional boundaries donee states also argue that midwestern and southern states often spend less local and state money on highways than donee states and chide these donor states for pleading for federal funds when they are unwilling to up their own state and local resources the 111 th

more highway account funding was being spent than was flowing into the highway account for these years because of this based on dollarindollarout basis almost all states have become donee states ie the excess of spending over revenues has pulled most donor states ratio to near or above 10 as this situation unfolded donor state advocates began to argue against the dollarindollarout method for determining donordonee status instead they argue that instead of using dollars each states percentage share of tax payments to the highway account should be the benchmark and should be compared to the states percentage share of total highway funding distribution this method of calculation allows most donor states to continue to argue that they still are not getting their fair share donee states generally prefer the dollarfordollar determination of donor or donee status some observers within the transportation community argue that the percentageinpercentageout statistical method is questionable and also note that among its most ardent supporters are some of those who argue that inequitable distribution of highway funds is reason to eliminate the federal highway program and

dots18 hpp earmarks however do not add significant amounts of money to states total belowtheline funding ie the total of core formula funds plus total hpp funds on relative basis this seemingly counterintuitive situation occurs because the belowtheline funding is subject to the equity bonus program eb because the total funding under the line is fixed in th authorization bill this leads to the situation where states that do not get many hpp earmarks tend to receive in relative sense larger distributions from the eb program while states that get high value of hpp earmarks tend to receive relatively smaller eb distributions or eb distribution this means that the total amount received by state belowtheline tends to be roughly the same whether or not they receive high or low dollar totals of hpp funds corollary of this situation is that the more of states total belowtheline funding is derived from hpp funds the less funding is ultimately available to the state for the federalaid highway core formula programs state dots depend on these funds to fulfill their state transportation plans the eb distribution also negates the imposition of penalties that are designed to discourage certain activities of the states for example state that transfers some of its high way bridge program funds to other programs is penalized by having its deficient bridge costtorepair total reduced like amount in the next years formula calculation this was meant to reduce the total used to calculate their apportionment for the hbp however the eb distribution in effect gives back what the penalty takes away 19 the factors used in the distribution formulas for the core highway programs were designed with certain federal goals in mind some observers believe that the equity bonus overlay combined with the extensive ability given states to transfer funds across programs undercuts the effectiveness of the programmatic structure to implement these national goals

changed many times and at least perfecting changes to the eb are also likely in reauthorization an increase in the guaranteed rateofreturn percentage above the 92 level could be considered however the closer the guaranteed percentage comes to 100 of the total program the more difficult an increase becomes expanding the scope of the equity provisions is also something favored by donor states in any case such changes would require growth in program size to fund larger equity overlay unless the underlying core program formulas were rewritten to bring the initial program apportionments more inline with the goals of an increased percentage return guarantee the hold harmless provisions that protect certain donee states from losing share could be retained modified or eliminated again to bring the percentage guarantee closer to 100 would probably require weakening of some of the hold harmless provisions hold harmless provisions however exist primarily due to the practical politics utilized to get the bills through both houses of congress congress could also consider elim inating the counteracting impact of the eb distribution on the highways program penalty provisions by imposing the penalties after the distribution of the eb funding this could affe ct some states guaranteed percentage share however and could be seen by some as creating double penalty 18 most of the rest of the federalaid highway programs that are below the line are formula programs whose funding is administered by the states departments of transportation 19 highway bridge program clearer goals and

over the first 50 years of the life of the trust fund significant amounts of money have been transferred to it from the treasurys general fund20 although much of transferred funding reflected federal interest payments on the trust funds unexpended balances the interest was paid by revenues provided by the general taxpayers not directly by highway user fees some other funds have been transferred to the trust fund for variety of reasons including the impact of compensating the trust fund for lower ethanol tax rates given the sufficiency problems faced by the trust fund general fund support for the federalaid highway program similar to that which is in place for federal transit administration authorization is one of the options likely to be considered the general funds are problematic for the basic donordonee argument based on return on user fees and taxes paid by highway users the pattern of the flow of revenue from the taxpayers in the states to the general fund is different than that for highway taxes and fees the larger the general fund share the harder it is to argue that states should get return based on their highway users payments to the highway account

was major feature of safetea and controversial one especially concerning the socalled bridgetonowhere earmarking has not however always been significant feature of surface transportation bills and is relatively recent issue considering the 50year plus history of the trust fund supported federalaid highway program until the late 1980s earmarks amounted to about 1 of authorized federalaid highway spending21 by way of comparison safetea earmarked almost 22 bill ion or roughly 11 of the 1995 billion highway construction title of the bill the debate over highway project earmarking at times reflects the broader pro and arguments that apply to the discussion of the appropriateness of congressional earmarking in general supporters of earmarking often argue that the fr amers of the constitution believed that congress not the president ie the executive branch should allocate funding for the functions of the federal government and ending congressional earmarking authority would be major transfer of power to the executive branch supporters also argue that members of congress have better sense of their constituents needs than executive branch bureaucrats opponents of earmarking make number of general arguments including congressional earmarking undermines the intent of the programs and activities that congress itself has authorized many earmarks are designated for political reasons rather than for demonstrated needs earmarking may foster corruption many earmarks are inherently local and shortchange projects of national interest and earmarks unduly enhance the role of lobbying firms in the spendi ng process the position of earmarking opponents was bolstered with the findings of 2007 dot re port which suggests that earmarking distorts the operation of the federalaid highway program 22 among the reports findings are the following that the earmarking can reduce the states core transportation programs many low priority earmarked projects are being funded over higher priority nonearmarked projects and projects that do not meet eligibility requirements are sometimes funded despite the steady growth in the number of earmarks and amount of funding dedicated to them during the last three reauthorization acts there is certainty that the same levels of earmarking will be part of the upcoming reauthorization and there are some indications that certain transportation groups such as aashto who were largely silent on this issue during the last reauthorization debate are now taking the position that earmarking needs to be controlled and limited going forward 23 crs

remainder are scattered amongst the remaining surface transportation activities the surface commission would like to see all of these programs combined into 10 broad intermodal programs the surface commission recommendations are only one of many that congress may consider in the months ahead it will be difficult however for congress to make the kinds of program consolidation that many of the studies and other outside observers are recommending partly this is because there are numerous potential and competing organizing rationales that could be applied to the highway program politically however the major complication is that each existing program has its supporters and detractors and that especially for some of the more specialized programs for example cmaq there are specific stakeholders whose support for the overall surface transportation program is associated with the continuation of the mission the program was created to carry out the federalaid highway program has always been partnership with the state dots states have great deal of control over the selection pl anning construction and oversight of federally funded highway projects within this context number of programmatic issues could arise historically the states have argued for increased flexibility in the use of federal funds by allowing for the transfer of funds across the federal highway programs however some in the transportation community argue that there is curr ently too much flexibility allowing states to allocate money between programs for example fro m the bridge program to the stp even though state might have unmet needs in the original program area also broad program flexibility is alleged to allow the spending of federal funds on projects that have evident national purpose in addition some highway supporters advocate the elimination of flexibility that allows fund transfers between the highway and mass transit programs again contending that these transfers mitigate against the original program intents established by congress as part of any program restructuring congress ma also consider project eligibility changes for example some construction interests are arguing for broadening of project eligibility under the congestion mitigation and air quality improv ement act cmaq that would allow more projects designed to increase road capacity to improve traffic flow in congested areas as part of any program consolidation or modification congress might choose to reexamine the programs scope and intent as well as the factors associated with the programs funding formulas alternately congress might opt to replace the ex isting formula programs with true block grant program provided directly to the states some argue that block grants would reduce significant amount of the existing program administrative overhead and give states and metropolitan areas the ability to focus on the needs they have already identified through the mandatory federal planning process subject perhaps only to certain performance standards in addition to restructuring of the existing program many believe that congress is likely to consider some new programs as well some for example have pressed for programs to improve major freight corridors and address bottlenecks g4g155g146g141g144g142g561g18g152g149g146g140g162g561 the sudden collapse of the i35w interstate system

bridge program hbp is the primary federal program to fund the replacement or rehabilitation of structurally deficient or functionally obsolete bridges hbp funds are apportioned to the states by formula based on each states relative share of the total cost to repair or replace deficient highway bridges each state is guaranteed at least 14 of total program allocation and state may receive an allocation greater than 10 the federal share under hbp is 80 except that for interstate bridges the federal share rises to 90 in reauthorization number of programmatic and funding issues are likely to be considered the level of funding will be the major issue the rate of repair and replacement of deficient bridges and the funding needed to support any proposed acceleration of the rate could be an issue the scope of eligibility for hbp funding could be an issue especially in regard to the use of hbp funds for spending on nonfederalaid highway syst em bridges changes in bridge inspection and inventory are likely to be proposed number of states have consistently used the federalaid highway program flexibility provisions to tran sfer hbp funding to nonbridge purposes this could be an issue some have also argued that linking hbp funding to states number of deficient bridges creates perverse incentive for some states to keep their deficiency rates high recent gao report found that the hbp lacks focus performance measures and sustainability congress could consider measures to improve the program 26 crs contacts bob kirk and will mallett

drawn from the general fund of the us treasury although the transit account is in somewhat better financial shape than the highway account it is also projected to go into deficit within few years despite some uncertainty surrounding this projection it is clear that curren t revenue into the transit account will not sustain federal transit administration fta programs and activities at current levels through another four to six year authorization period within this context there are both funding and programmatic issues that could arise during reauthorization 27 the possibility of constrained future federal transit funding is occurring in conjunction with substantial recent increases in transit ridership most likely caused by the spike in gasoline prices in the middle of 2008 despite an increase in revenue from these new riders some transit operators say financial problems may prevent them from expanding service capacity and some have suggested they may instead have to reduce current service levels the immediate reasons for the latest financial problems in the transit industry are the large price increases in fuel and other commodities and flat or declining

like sales taxes or overall government budget conditions but financial problems in public transit are long term issue primarily caused by declining transit system productivity that results in an increasing requirement for government support from all levels of government fares and other operating revenue now only cover about 30 of industry costs for that reason congress may want to consider how the federal transit program and its individual programs can be modified to boost transit ridership at lower cost to the government

construction business and public transit interest groups argue that america is underinvesting in transportation infrastructure including public transit infrastructure28 in their view federal infrastructure investment should be significantly increased to deal with an existing backlog of projects and other future needs both the dot and the congressionally created national surface transportation policy and revenue study commission nstprsc have estimated that the capital cost to maintain and improve the current condition and operational performance of transit systems in the united states is substantially more than is being currently spent on transit systems by all levels of government29 some argue that the overall level of government transit spending has not been dramatically deficient if at all by pointing out that the grow th in transit capacity has outpaced the growth in ridership and that the condition and performance of transit systems have generally improved over the past decade others go further to suggest that governments including the federal government spend too much on public transit relative to the benefits it provides30 these analysts point out that while transit spending amounts to about 16 of all government highway and transit spending and about 14 of federal highway and transit capital expenditure only about 2 of all trips and 5 of commuting trips are made by this mode the effect according to transit critics is to short change highway spending thereby causing hi ghway conditions and performance including highway congestion to be worse than they would be otherwise 31 corollary to this view is that significant proportion of federal transit funding roughly 80 comes from taxes paid by highway users 28for example american

would be to raise the federal fuels tax and dedicate 20 of any increase to the transit account as has been the case since 1983 and which transit supporters are keen to maintain in any future legislation based on existing revenue assumptions the fuels tax would need to be raised by approximately 5 cents per gallon with 1 cent per gallon dedicated to the transit account to close the gap between revenue and expenditures in the transit account for fy2009 32 this allows for growth in the program to deal with growing needs or inflation to improve the current condition and performance according to dots needs estimates would require an extra 36 billion annually this would require 30cent to 90centpergallon increase in the total fuels tax 0618 cents per gallon for the transit account this does not include any additional funding for noncapital expenses currently about 30 of federal transit support

among other things proponents contend that larger local match would help ensure that only the most important projects are supported by state and local officials opponents of lowering the maximum federal share argue that lowering the cap might bias state and local decisionmakers to favor highway projects that have an 80 match some advocate reducing the federal share for both highways and

government funding and estimated investment needs is to encourage more private participation in developing transit projects through publicprivate partnerships ppps and innovative financing34 in both cases ppps and innovative financing the overall difference they may make to the financing of transit system services is likely to be relatively small this is particularly true in transit where the possibilities for generating new revenue streams or profit from operations are limited although other possibilities exist such as land development near transit stations and stops often referred to as transit oriented development or tod the tolling of roads bridges and tunnels is much more likely source of new revenue to make these types of financing ve hicles possible however even on the highway side many believe that private funding might be only able to provide up to 5 10 of needed funds g22g155g138g151g156g146g157g561g21g157g155g158g140g157g158g155g138g149g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561

modernization and bus and bus facilities capital and the urbanized area formula grants program there are many possible ways of restructuring federal public transit programs each an alternative to the possibility of leaving the existing system unchanged one way to reorder federal priorities would be to focus more resources on major capital expenses for the rehabilitation and expansion of transit service in places that are best served by this mode primarily the densely populated parts of large and often heavily congested cities this might entail expansion of the programs that make up the capital investment programthe new starts program the rail modernization program and the bus capital programand cutting back on grants that are spread more broadly and go for smaller and more routine types of expenses under the urbanized and nonurbanized formula progra ms this change would likely result in concentration of resources in few large cities where transit usage is already relatively high an effect that has obvious potential political problems alternatively congress may decide that the era of retrofitting large and mediumsized cities with new transit rail systems is largely over and that resources should now go to supporting and rehabilitating existing services this could entail reduction in spending on the new starts program currently about 18 of the federal transit program and more support for the other capital programs and the formula grants programs the effect of these changes on the distribution of funds is likely to be more mixed and would depend on the share of funds dedicated to the rail modernization program program that includes relatively few cities and the share dedicated to buses and formula programs that include much larger number of places third way to restructure the federal transit program would be to eliminate the capital programs altogether to be replaced with simple block grant that could be distributed based on transit ridership or population this would allow state and local governments to decide how best to allocate transit funding support among existing and new services funds distributed according to transit ridership would reward areas that commit their own resources successfully to providing transit service the distribution of funding in this way would again depend on how this new program is structured but it might also depend on how states and localities react to the changes in terms of how aggressively they promote transit ridership fourth alternative would be to fold most of the transit programs into broader metropolitan mobility program that would distribute federal surface transportation funding to large urban areas say one million people or more on modeneutral basis it would then be up to states and localities to decide how to spend the money be it on transit or highway infrastructure or on some combination of the two

program should incorporate performance measures as central tenet in the distribution of funds the main reason for doing this would be to reward transit agencies for providing more and better service per dollar of public support detractors argue that greater use of performance measures might unfairly reward or punish states and localities on the basis of factors outside their control such as regional economic conditions or climate moreover they say distributing funding in this way might set off cycles that end up concentrating funding in relatively few states and locales others worry about the accuracy of data that would be needed to effectively measure performance the possibilities for data manipulation and other problems with participants gaming the performance measurement

particularly in difficulttoserve areas and that the federal government should encourage them to do so according to this view transit agen cies may also need to consider cutting services that lose the most money except perhaps paratransit service service might be expanded in transitfriendly environments with services that will generate substantial number of new customers in cases where new transit services are appropriate such as along densely populated and congested corridors agencies might look to invest in less costly transit modes particularly buses and bus rapid transit brt g5g152g150g153g142g157g146g157g146g152g151g561 another suggestion is for states and localities to inject more competition into the provision of transit service or to find other ways to reduce costs this usually entails proposals to competitively bid transit service provision and to allow private operators to provide new services to compete with public transit agencies this could be accomplished according to some advocates by making the elimination of local barriers to privatization condition of federal funding in many places these local barriers take the form of state and local laws and

contracts with transit workers unions that often do not allow transit agencies to employ parttime workers or to require splitshifts to cover the peaking of demand in the morning and evening in addition some argue that federal labor protections in transit commonly known as section 13c should be abolished or modified position rejected by unions representing transit workers g8g138g155g142g156g561 another potential way of reducing the need for public assistance is to increase fares where possible to cover costs fares need not necessarily be increased across the board but could be adjusted to more accurately reflect the cost of providing particular service the federal government might encourage transit systems to do this particularly with the use of electronic fare payment technology that makes it relatively easy to collect variable fares g5g152g151g144g142g156g157g146g152g151g561g18g155g146g140g146g151g144g561 it might also be possible to reduce the need for government assistance of public transit by pricing automobile use particularly in congested periods one way to do this is to institute new highway tolls particularly ones that vary based on traffic levels this might encourage some drivers to switch to transit and may provide source of fund s to enhance transit service such road pricing schemes usually make the most sense in severely congested regions where good transit options exist congress therefore might encourage congested metropolitan areas to design comprehensive congestion management schemes that incorporate highway pricing and

economies and the recent spike in fuel prices the immediate concern of freight carriers and shippers was congestion particularly at major gateways experiencing steady runup in import volumes and on certain segments of highway with persistent traffic bottlenecks congestion frustrates freight carriers ability to provide reliable scheduling unreliability is costly because it requires shippers to carry buffer stock reducing an efficient justintime logistics stra tegy to justincase strategy the concern for the capacity of the system to keep pace with rising freight volumes is borne out by

pace with the projected growth in freight traffic have led to calls for st ronger federal leadership in the development of more systematic approach to addressing freight transportation needs many freight stakeholders and some policymakers argue that the federal government needs to articulate coherent national transportation plan that identifies key freight corridors and gives priority to funding these corridors some transportation policy experts have called for the formation of national panel of experts to prioritize federal transportation investments in order to depoliticize the project selection process such panel they suggest could be modeled after the base realignment and closure commission brac that was formed to depoliticize military base closure decisions 37 federal leadership in the development of national transportation strategic plan or in the selection of freightoriented projects to receive priority funding would be departure from the current planning process which relies heavily on state dots and mpos to plan and select which transportation projects to fund in their jurisdictions criticism of addressing freight issues predominantly at the state and local level is that freight bottleneck may be merely relocated to another community rather than addressed holistically as the nations production moves towards higher value goods and international trade becomes an increasingly important component of the us economy us goods are moving longer distances often relying on an intermodal network that is north american in scope 38 unlike commuter trips which generally begin and end within metropolitan area freight trip lengths often exceed the jurisdiction of single mpo or even state thus these planning institutions have difficulty providing corridor or an endtoend approach in addressing freight improvements they also may have disincentive to do so because while they bear the costs of improvements the economic benefits may accrue nationally some hub cities have preponderance of freight that is merely passing through their community rather than serving local producers or retailers land border ports of entry gateway seaports and interchange points in the rail network in particular must live with the negative effects of freight traffic that is largely serving far away locations while one can argue that freight transportation is national issue and thus elevating it to the federal level is appropriate it may not be able to compete with other pressing national priorities such as health care iraq and afghanistan or the recent financial crisis at the local level however especially at major freight hubs like angeles for instance freight transportation may be priority because residents recognize the pollution and congestion caused by port truck traffic and thus support projects to streamline freight movement in the area because freight issues vary dramatically from one hub or region to the next it can also be argued that they are 36

state and local level for instance air cargo hubs such as memphis or louisville face different problems than large railroad hubs like chicago or st louis and seaports are tackling different problems than land border crossings like laredo or detroit rural areas may be more concerned with preserving short line rail access to the transcontinental rail network and the not unrelated issue of upgrading roads to accommodate heavy trucks carrying agricultural and mineral products also local desire to retain jobs that are tied to freight activity and desire to improve the quality of life for their residents may be sufficient incentive for state and local transportation planners to address freight bottlenecks greater collaboration and coordination among mp and state dots could facilitate wider

16 states from maine to florida that is examining ways to improve fluidity on i95 and that also investigates rail and waterborne modes as partial solutions to mitigating i95 congestion the dominance of the socalled donordonee state debate can be an obstacle to developing and improving national freight transportation network in previous surface transportation reauthorization debates the concern that each state receive back from the federal government as close to the full amount of federal gas tax monies it generated dominated the floor debate in congress on the one hand the concern by members of congress for their states rate of return is rational based on the fact that the preponderance of freight shipments especially those over the highway system are of relatively short distance about onehalf of all trucks typically travel to destinations within 50 miles of their base and almost threefourths stay within their base state 39 yet those shipments that are for longerdistance and therefore more likely to cross state lines are not economically insignificant considering that longer distance shipments also tend to be of higher value according to 2002 census data while 34 of the total weight of shipments were interstate nearly 60 of the total value of shipments were interstate40 in 42 states outofstate shipments accounted for more than 50 of the value of the states outbound

efficient goods movement because they carry 65 of the tonnage and 75 of the value of domestic cargo fhwa has attempted to pinpoint locations on the national highway network suffering from recurring congestion problems specifically from the perspective of trucks 43 this study found that the preponderance of truck delays were at urban freeway interchange points and that steep grades signalized intersections and lane drops were other problem areas most states and many urban areas have conducted goods movement studies to better understand the patterns of freight activity in their area and are cognizant of truck bottlenecks such as these some states are evaluating the feasibility of segregating truck traffic from automobile traffic on highways with heavy truck traffic in some cases this idea is under consideration with respect to highways spanning hundreds of miles while in other cases short segments of highway connecting to seaport or other freight hub are under consideration congress might consider the importance of roads linking airports seaports and rail terminals with the interstate highway system all air cargo begins and ends its journey in trucks as does intermodal rail and containerized seaborne cargo these intermodal combinations of freight transport are the fastest growing segments of goods movement in the united states consist of highervalue goods and are closely tied to international trade while these intermodal connector roads are relatively short segments generally less than two miles in length dot studies have found that they often suffer from poor pavement condition and substandard geometrics narrow lanes smallradius curves because the roads often were not originally designed for the heavy truck traffic they handle congress may also consider whether transfer points between ports and railroads and between eastern and western railroad networks that still require container to be trucked drayed in order to make the interchange could not be more efficiently handled if rail connection were available in chicago and to lesser extend in st louis memphis and new orleans where the eastern and western rail networks converge and at many seaports truck drayage generates significant amount of truck traffic that comingles with commuter traffic on beltways and arterials policymakers may consider whether additional ondock or at least neardock rail terminals could be built at seaports to reduce truck drayage and whether steelwheel interchanges could be extended to additional rail interchanges in the midwest the development of logistics parks by

to finance road improvements to support these centers even though railroads are private enterprises that in modern times have been largely privately financed congress may consider whether greater public investment in freight rail infrastructure is warranted trucking firms are among the largest customers of the railroads because they offer lower cost alternative for their long haul customers truck freight on trains has been vital for the overland transport of us containerized imports and exports but the recent spike in diesel prices has pushed more domestic truckloads onto the railroads also domestic intermodal as this traffic is called may be the only freight segment experiencing volume growth in recent months 44 while many argue that railroads have sufficient economic incentive to expand the capacity of their network and they are doing so some of their customers are impatient with the pace of their investment the railroads intermodal customers which generally ship higher value goods that require faster more reliable and more precise scheduling than other rail shippers would like to see route miles with sufficient passing sidings or double tracking increased to better accommodate freight trains traveling at different speeds the railroads which are seeking federal tax incentive to spur investment in their facilities and others believe congress should create dedicated trust fund as it has done with the other transportation modes to boost investment in freight rail infrastructure the increasing demand for commuter trains which often run on freightowned track in metropolitan areas also weighs in favor of expanded rail capacity congress may also consider steering funding toward projects that mitigate the negative affects of increases in freight traffic some cities and towns have experienced significant increase in freight train traffic and frustrations are mounting at some railgrade crossings congress may consider whether additional funding should be directed for gradeseparation projects along heavy use rail corridors and whether the railroads should bear more of the costs for these types of projects crs contact john frittelli

association testified that it would vigorously oppose any effort to repeal an existing sanction the one requiring states to make purchase and public possession of alcohol illegal for those under age 2154 that sanction itself established by congress in 1984 was preceded by an incentive program which did not succeed in getting many of the states with lower minimum purchase ages to change their laws

law or by maintaining seat belt use rate of 85 or betterand the motorcycle safety grant program whose eligibility criteria include reduction in fatalities and crashes though states can qualify for the grant based on other criteria thus states can receive safety grants under these programs without demonstrating progress toward the improving highway safety congress could choose to link the receipt of grant or the size of the grant more closely to states performance not all of the data needed for such change is currently available for example reliable measures of motorcyclist vmt which would be the

inspections of commercial vehicles are considered important in promoting co mpliance with federal safety requirements but there is concern that the resources available to support inspections do not

to improve the effectiveness of programs that prevent drivers from driving while drugged or with serious medical conditions that may impair their driving gao found that it was easy for drivers to avoid detection both because many urine collection sites did not follow regulations intended to reduce the opportunity for drivers to invalidate the test such as substituting other samples or adding contaminants to the sample55 and gao found that drivers who have failed drug test were able to continue driving without submitting to the required returntoduty process by hiding their past drug history from employers many of whom did not conduct thorough background checks of applicants drug testing history among the measur that congress may wish to consider to deal with this issue are the

its 70 million went to support research at university transportation centers 27 million went to the bureau of transportation statistics and 27 million went to support training and education programs

that the amount of federal funding is far below both what is needed and what can be economically justified in light of estimates of over 300 billion in annual costs to society from highway crashes and from the value of time lost to congestion to say nothing of the environmental costs of the surface transportation systemcosts which could potentially be reduced through research they also contend that federal investment in surface transportation rdt can be compared to private industry investment in rdt as share of total federal expenditures on highways around 09 the federal share is significantly below the average of industry rdt spending as share of sales around 33 on the other hand congress faces constraints on the amount of funding that is available for transportation and virtually every

used the extent of earmarking of rdt funding was concern before safetea the research communitys position is that earmarking of research funding should be limited and instead that it should generally be awarded on the basis of peerreviewed competitive applications as this is thought to result in more effective use of the limited resources in safeteas research title congress earmarked more funding than the total amount that was authorized by the title the result was that the individual research programs and projects received less funding than each was authorized in order that the available funding could be stretched to cover all the designated programs and projects another impact was that there was unearmarked research funding left to fund some fhwa projects such as the biennial conditions and performance reports that in previous years had been funded with such moneys other concerns about the effective use of rdt funding include how to improve the implementation and

tribal or federal environmen tal laws such as the clean water act clean air act endangered species act or national historic preservation act during past reauthorization debates environmental requirements have drawn the attention of some members of congress and interested stakeholders eg state transportation agencies transportation construction organizations and environmental groups this attention has been due to both the impact that surface transportation projects can have on the environment and the impact that compliance with environmental requirements can have on project delivery previous reauthorization legislation has attempted to address environmental compliance issues by either authorizing funding for projects that would help mitigate or minimize environmental impacts associated with surface transportation programs or projects or by specifying procedures intended to expedite compliance with certain environmental requirements the upcoming reauthorization process may

the preparation of an environmental impact statement eis for any federally funded project that significantly affects the quality of the human environment if the level of significance of proposed project is unclear the agency must prepare an environmental assessment ea in order to make that determination projects that do not individually or cumulatively have significant social economic or environmental effect and which dot has determined from past experience have significant impact are processed as categorical exclusions dots nepa regulations require the final nepa documentation to

efficiency act istea of 1991 cmaq was reauthorized under tea21 and again as part of safetea it provides funds to states for transportation projects designed to reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality particularly in areas of the country that do not attain national ambient air quality standards naaqs in particular it authorizes funding for programs and projects intended to reduce carbon monoxide co particulate matter and ozone cmaq funds are apportioned in accordance with formula based largely on states population and pollution reduct ion needs during the reauthorization process there will likely be debate regarding the level of cmaq funding and possibly the types of projects eligible for funding from fy2005 to fy2009 the cmaq program provided over 86 billion in funds to state departments of transportation and local transit agencies specific types of projects eligible for cmaq funds include but are not limited to programs for improved public transit traffic flow improvement programs that reduce emissions and programs to control extended idling of vehicles 61 safetea required states and mpos to give priority in distributing cmaq funds to diesel engine retrofits and other costeffective emission reduction and congestion mitigation activities that provide air quality benefits safetea also expanded the program funding eligibility requirements to specifically allow certain types of projects to qualify for cmaq funding safetea also directed dot to evaluate and assess representative sample of cmaq projects in consultation with epa to determine their impacts on air quality and congestion levels and to ensure the effective implementation of the program further safetea directed dot to maintain and disseminate database describing project impacts direct funding was provided for the evaluation or the database in response to safetea requirements in october 2008 fhwa released report that studied the effectiveness of 67 cmaqfunded project

funding projects in these areas unless the projects conform to the sips to demonstrate conformity transportation improvement program tip must show that the projects to be undertaken will not lead to

exceptions highway safety projects rehabilitation and reconstruction of transit facilities purchase of replacement buses and rail cars noise attenuation projects and pedestrian and bicycle facilities are all allowed to proceed whether or not an areas conformity has lapsed but the threat of conformity lapse and the potential loss of highway funds63 has been powerful incentive to get local officials to focus on air quality considerations as they plan transportation projects although environmental advocates and regulators have generally argued that conformity is critical tool for the achievement of the nations air quality goals some in the transportation community have found it burdensome thus in its strategy for reauthorization of safetea64 the department of transportation proposed to set up performanceoriented pilot pop program that would waive conformity and other planning and environmental requirements in up to 10 states or metropolitan areas substituting performance standards in their place65 in effect dot proposed to remove planning requirement in favor of standard that could not be measured until after the project was complete state and local air quality regulators through their national organization the national association of clean air agencies pronounced themselves d eeply disturbed by dots proposals which they said would emasculate transportation conformity and place road block directly in front of state and local clean air efforts it is unclear whether the pop program or other modifications to conformity will be considered in the surface transportation debate crs

require significant reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases ghg66 from transportation sources transportation accounts for about onethird of us emissions of the leading greenhouse gas carbon dioxide co 267 and about 27 of the six major ghgs typically considered co 2 is largely product of combustion the carbon in fuel be it gasoline diesel natural gas or whatever combines with oxygen in the atmosphere when the fuel burns thus the principal method of reducing co 2 emissions from transportation sources is to burn less fuel emissions can also be reduced by substituting fuels that have less carbon substitution of lowercarbon fuels has 63 highway funds are not actually lost in conformity lapse as noted many types of project are exempt from the requirement and go forward as planned other projects face temporary suspension of f unding until they submit conforming tip generally the officials involved refer to this temporary and partial suspension as losing their federal highway funds which undoubtedly speeds their efforts to remedy the situation 64 refocus reform renew new transportation approach for america july 2008 65 the department also proposed changes to the congestion mitigation and air quality grant program 66 greenhouse gases are pollutants that trap the suns heat with effects on the earths climate 67 co 2 accounts for more than 80 of us ghg emissions

emissionseg power plant can significantly reduce its co 2 and other emissions by substituting natural gas for coal the same possibility substituting natural gas or other lowercarbon fuels for gasoline and diesel fuel would lower co 2 emissions from surface transportation in the energy independence and security act of 2007 eisa pl 110140 congress required both improved fuel economy for new cars and trucks and lower carbon content in renewable transportation fuels the law requires that new motor vehicles attain an average improvement of 40 in fuel economy by 2020 with incremental improvements between now and then and that future renewable fuels have lower carbon content on lifecycle basis many are calling for even more stringent standards than those set in eisa as part of an effort to reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions as much as 80 by 2050 surface transportation reauthorization offers the possi bility to look at transportation emissions in broader context and could provide

alternatives to petroleum fuels and ways to use petroleum more efficiently are of key interest especially in light of recent high oil prices the desire to lessen dependence on petroleum imports and concerns over greenhouse gas emissions current fuels taxes and other surface transportation programs favor alternative fuels over petroleum although these incentives may not be enough for these alternatives to be competitive especially when oil prices have dropped dramatically from their high point in the spring and summer of 2008 in the 111 th congress issues surrounding surface transportation and alternative fuels and advanced technologies will likely focus around four key areas 1 fuels taxes 2 incentives for the purchase of alternative fueladvanced technology vehicles 3 infrastructure for new fuelstechnology and 4 other incentives such as hov exemptions key incentive for many alternative fuels is that their use is effectively subsidized through tax incentives for their retail sale andor blending into conventional fuels for example all gasoline regardless of its ethanol content is taxed at 184 cents per gallon however every gallon of ethanol blended into gasoline is subject to credit of 51 cents per gallon scheduled to decrease to 45 cents per gallon in 2009 therefore the effective tax rate on 10 blend of ethanol in gasoline is 133 cents per gallon 149 cents per gallon in 2009 similarly retail providers of natural gas hydrogen and other alternative fuels may claim credit of 50 cents per gallon these various incentives were enacted as provisions in energy and economic legislation however there may be interest in expanding or extending some of these incentives in surface transportation reauthorization further interest is growing in the environmental effects of various alternative fuels therefore there may be some interest in modifying these credits to reflect their performance on environmental measures especially greenhouse gas emissions various incentives exist in the most recent surface transportation legislation and in various energy laws to promote the purchase and use of alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles for example the energy policy act of 2005 established tax credits for the purchase of httpwikileaksorgwikicrsr40053g21g158g155g143g138g140g142g561g22g155g138g151g156g153g152g155g157g138g157g146g152

vehicles further under federal transit administration bus programs additional matching funds are available for transit agencies that purchase alternative fuel and advanced technology busesbeyond those for conventional technology however these incentives have been criticized by some because new advanced diesel buses are considered advanced technology under this program there may be interest in expanding transit options to promote more efficient transport there may also be interest in modifying existing incentives to focus more on their energy efficiency or environmental performance for the use of alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles to expand infrastructure to support them must also grow just as there are incentives for the purchase of new vehicles there are tax credits for retail stations to install refueling infrastructure as part of the surface transportation reauthorization debate there may be interest in providing additional incentives including grants for taxexempt entities eg transit agencies to install additional refueling infrastructure especially if those stations are accessible to the public to promote more efficient highway transport of goods current programs to reduce heavy truck idling eg truck stop electrification may be amended or expanded other incentives for alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles may also be of interest currently states may exempt alternative fuel vehicles and vehicles that achieve 45 miles per gallon or better from high occupancy vehicle hov restrictions under earlier laws some states exempted hybrid vehicles regardless of fuel ec onomy from hov restrictions in those states the hov exemption became key incentive for the purchase of hybrid vehicles there may be interest in expanding or modifying hov exemptio ns to promote certain fuels or technologies other potential incentives may include exemptions from highway or bridge tolls crs contact brent yacobucci
