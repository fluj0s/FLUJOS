theodoredis chiquita executive assigned to investigate the polymer plastipak problems smokestack emits toxins we cry for our children publication cincinnati enquirer date may 3 1998 by mike gallagher and cameron mcwhirter chiquita subsidiary is exposing more than 500 men women and children of barrio paris to toxic chemical that the company knows is spewing from san jose factory smokestack in high quantities internal company records reveal chiquita officials in cincinnati have been aware of the problem for several months but their efforts to solve it have been unsuccessful according to company sources and internal voicemail messages provided the enquirer by highlevel company source the plant manufactures plastic bags impregnated with pesticide called chlorpyrifos the bags are used to cover bananas ripening on plants to protect them from insects community leaders and neighbors in barrio paris have complained to the national health ministry that fumes have caused residents including children and pregnant women to suffer chronic respiratory problems blistered skin and other serious ailments the us epa classifies chlorpyrifos as highlytoxic pesticide that is dangerous to humans if inhaled or if it comes into contact with skin for protracted period of time according to the epa universities and chemical manufacturers chlorpyrifos can cause delayed nerve damage multiple sclerosis loss of use of limbs lung congestion paralysis convulsions dizziness mental disorders blurred vision chest pain loss of reflexes and death for years plant officials of the chiquita subsidiary polymer plastipak have denied those claims to costa rican health officials according to more than dozen letters from company officials and lawyers sent to the ministry of health since 1992 the company has conceded only that the plant emits bad odor despite company claims that the fumes are harmless 1997 costa rican national laboratory report asserted that the company repeatedly failed to conduct governmentmandated air tests to determine whether the plant is discharging the pesticide into the atmosphere and causing health problems for nearby residents the report translated for the enquirer also stated that the companys use of chlorpyrifos results in high risk for health of the neighbors it is proven that extended exposure to this pesticide especially children and pregnant womenproduces health problems to people the report said the march 20 1997 report was prepared by defensoria habitantes costa rican congressional agency created to ensure that other government departments protect citizens on health environmental and other issues testing at the plant conducted by chiquita after the enquirer began questioning company officials about the problem revealed high quantities of chlorpyrifos were being spewed into the air through the plants smokestack the pesticide also is being released inside the plant and into the atmosphere where the bags are cut and separated the enquirer has learned in an oct 3 1997 voicemail message to robert olson chiquitas chief counsel in cincinnati roger theodoredis company executive in cincinnati assigned to investigate the polymer problems confirmed that polymer plastipak was emitting chlorpyrifos into the atmosphere in high quantities at first we had thought it could be the solvent that people were smelling but approximately 16 to 17 samples were taken outside of the plant for chlorpyrifos and 15 of them turned up positive in fairly high quantities mr theodoredis said in the message i wanted to alert you to that there appear to be two sources of chlorpyrifos getting out into the atmosphere one is the smokestack which is part of the process that is when the bags are formed in the extrusion process heated exhaust air goes up the stack and apparently there is chlorpyrifos going up the stack the second unexpected source of chlorpyrifos is taking place in another room of the factory in which the bags are cut that cutting of the bags is causing chlorpyrifos to be emitted he added tape recording of the voicemail message was provided to the enquirer by company source who asked not to be identified because of fear of retribution in the message mr theodoredis also told mr olson of the longstanding problems between polymer plastipak and the costa rican ministry of health over the toxic fumes issue there is history of contention between the plant and the ministry of health on august 8th for example the ministry of health shut down the polymer plastipak plant for about 12 hours due to the smell issue currently the plant is working under temporary suspension of that shutdown order chiquita denied to the enquirer that there is any threat to nearby residents in statement issued through its lawyers chiquita made reference to any concerns about chlorpyrifos levels it or the government may have had about polymer investigation by chiquita and independent consultants hired by the company confirms that the plastipak plant does not pose threat to the surrounding community any concentrations of chlorpyrifos measured at the surrounding residences fall well within the average acceptable ambient air concentrations used in the united states chiquita did not respond to enquirer requests to provide the newspaper with copies of its complete polymer test results additionally the letter said any concentrations of pesticides within the plant pose health threat to workers chiquita officials refused to provide the enquirer with any written test results reports or findings of its independent consultants who performed the tests on the plants emissions and according to defensoria and health ministry officials neither chiquita nor its plastipak company executives have submitted the written findings of its consultants plant emission testings to them for review residents of barrio paris described for the enquirer health problems they attribute to the polymer plastipak plant and their fears for their childrens health we have very huge problem here blanca brenes morales 62 president of the barrio paris neighborhood association said through translator they polymer use chemical that goes right up into the air and we breathe it all of us knew when we moved here that we would live in an industrial area but one not even the government knew or agreed that they could poison us with their chemicals ms brenes said that whenever the fumes become heavy in the air she calls polymer plant officials they always tell they are just changing their filters she said she said most of her fears center around the children in the neighborhood we dont really know how this poison will affect us in the future we cry for our children ms brenes said she and many other residents of barrio paris are too poor to leave their homes and wouldnt be able to find comparable affordable housing elsewhere criticisms in defensorias report were not only aimed only at polymer plastipak defensoria repeatedly criticized offices of the costa rican governments own health ministry for failing to conduct needed blood tests of the barrio paris residents to monitor the harmful effects of the chlorpyrifos in 1993 the health ministry did take blood samples from the residents after repeated complaints that fumes from the polymer plastipak plant were making people ill but necessary followup tests to confirm the levels of pesticide in the residents bloodstreams never were taken because health ministry officials cited lack of manpower according to the defensoria report polymer plastipak officials in costa rica declined requests for interviews from enquirer reporters since the 12hour shutdown in august polymer and chiquita officials have failed to provide the health ministry any documented proof of substantive changes to either the mixture or its filtration system that would prevent further harm to the companys own workers or the residents who live near there said rodrigo alberto carazo director in defensoria mr carazo said that polymer officials have for years not only denied toxic fumes were affecting workers at the plant or nearby residents but also that the nonharmful smell problem had not been contained because of ongoing problems with plant filtration system that has been their excuse for many many years said mr carazo weve been receiving letters like that since at least 1993 or 1994 plastipaks letters hold little sway with gerardo campos cartin 48 who cites his own doctors findings that he has been contaminated by chlorpyrifos chiquitas plant in barrio paris is the only company in that section of the city using chlorpyrifos according to health ministry records walking out to childrens playground located directly behind the polymer plant mr campos talked of respiratory disease he said his doctor has linked to the plants poisonous fumes it is so bad that many times i cannot breathe without help from drugs or respirator mr campos said through translator when the factory is running and the smokestack belches out those fumes i must run inside my house and hide under my bed if i smell the fumes at all i begin choking my skin also turns red with rashes and i become so sick i sometimes want to die but mr campos said his greatest fear is for barrio paris children look at this playground right here by the plant he said pointing to the swing set teetertotter climbing bars and small basketball court all the children play here they have place else to go in another development the enquirer also has learned from company sources that chiquita plans to sell its polymer operations when asked through its attorneys about the plans chiquita officials did not respond in internal company voicemail messages obtained by the enquirer from highlevel company source several chiquita executives and lawyers discuss plans to sell its polymer operations including the plastipak plant in costa rica we dont really know how this poison will affect us in the future blanca brenes morales 62 copyright 1998 chiquita secrets revealed environment the one thing that the enquirer asked that i hedged on was how much did chiquita pay you ci conservation international to do this study i said ill have to check even though i actually know i dont feel that its really any of his the reporters business james nations conservation international some pesticides highly toxic publication cincinnati enquirer date may 3 1998 by cameron mcwhirter and mike gallagher chiquita uses products with low epa toxicity classification for mammalian and aquatic life the company stated to the enquirer through its attorneys however the enquirer found numerous examples on chiquitas own list of approved pesticides of products that have been designated by us government agencies as possibly cancerous to humans or toxic to animals or fish those pesticides all used by chiquita and its subsidiaries in aerial spraying in latin america include propiconazole sold as tilt propiconazole has been classified by the us environmental protection agency epa as possible human carcinogen according to published documents by the us department of agriculture forest service the pesticide can cause skin irritation and substantial but temporary eye irritation the petroleum solvent in some formulations can cause chemical pneumonitis lung complications if breathed into the lungs prolonged inhalation of vapors may irritate throat and nasal passages and cause central nervous system effects which can include headache dizziness confusion and nausea if swallowed abdominal pain nausea gastritis breathing difficulty or diarrhea can occur the department recommends workers exposed to the chemical wash hands before eating drinking chewing gum using tobacco or using the toilet do not get in eyes on skin or on clothing to avoid breathing vapor or spray mist wear nioshnational institute of occupational safety and healthapproved organic cartridge respirator azoxystrobin sold as bankit the epa has ruled this new product is highly toxic to freshwater fish and invertebrates highly toxic to estuarine marine fish and very highly toxic to estuarine marine invertebrates the product labels observed in chiquita storage facilities in southeastern costa rica read clearly marine pollutant and bear symbol of fish with an x through it benomyl sold as benlate this pesticide classified by the epa as possibly cancercausing for humans has been in wide use in the united states and around the world for years but the pesticide has come under increasing attack from people who claim it has harmed them in 1989 and 1991 manufacturer ei du pont nemours company known as dupont recalled dry version of the pesticide benlate 50 df after american farmers reported severe crop damage after using the product the company faced several lawsuits in texas hawaii florida and other states in 1996 florida jury awarded 4 million to john castillo boy born with eyes his mother while pregnant with him was accidentally drenched in the pesticide on florida farm the jury found both dupont and the farm negligent that farm was not connected to chiquita and did not grow bananas chiquita uses the wet soluble version of the pesticide thiophanatemethyl sold as topsin the us department of agriculture found the pesticide to be moderately to highly toxic for various types of fish the us fish and wildlife service has found that the pesticide is hazardous to 10 endangered species in the united states the pesticide was listed as possible carcinogen for humans according to the us department of agriculture it was also found to damage the thyroid gland the department has ruled that people not wearing protective equipment cannot return to field sprayed with thiophanatemethyl for at least 12 hours tridemorph sold as calixin tridemorph is hazard to fish according to the epa mancozeb sold as dithane mancozeb is moderately to highly toxic to fish and aquatic invertebrate animals according to the forest service of the us department of agriculture the department recommends do not apply when weather conditions favor drift wind carrying pesticides away from treated areas do not apply in way that will contact workers or other persons either directly or through drift drift and runoff may be hazardous to aquatic organisms in neighboring areas the department recommends that workers not enter treated areas for 24 hours after spraying copyright 1998 chiquita secrets revealed environment they dont want us doing any research for example water pollution it is better for company to suspect that the water is polluted than to know that the water is polluted professor luisa castillo costa ricas national university pesticide program industry resists curbs but bananas safe publication cincinnati enquirer date may 3 1998 by cameron mcwhirter and mike gallagher commercial banana growers like chiquita use numerous pesticides to combat fungus insects and other pests that could destroy the fruit and they use those pesticides often the reason is simple bananas sold in the united states or europe are almost all one type the gran cavendish the large banana that consumers have grown to expect on miles of plantations from guatemala in central america to ecuador thousands of miles to the south the fruit is genetically identical because the tropical plants are planted in close proximity and come from the same genetic source system known as monoculture farming an outbreak of pests fungi or disease can quickly wipe out plantation it would be as if scientists cloned one person who was likely to get disease if that person got the disease soon all of the clones would catch it as well unless they were given massive amounts of medicine in the case of bananas you use pesticides youre creating an extremely artificial situation youre creating situation that is ripe for some kind of pest or fungal problem to sweep your plantation said dr thomas lacher jr an associate professor at texas ams department wildlife and fisheries sciences and coauthor of recent article on risks to the environment by the banana industry he said the multinational companies including chiquita use pesticides now that are dangerous and toxic or pretty hot when applied but these pesticides dont just go on the plants applied by air or by workers with backpack sprayers pesticides drift through the air they get into the soil and onto workers villagers and animals scientists and environmentalists stress that the industrys pesticide problem is not endangering the consumer but endangering the workers and villagers where the bananas are grown what makes you ill or can even kill you as worker may not affect you as consumer according to colorado state university professor douglas murray author of cultivating crisis the human cost of pesticides in latin america over the decades the banana industry has faced series of problems related to the use of pesticides one of the most highly publicized cases involved dibromochloropropane known by the acronym dbcp which was widely used in the 1970s to combat tiny parasitic worms that attack the roots of the banana plant dbcp through improper application and toxicity allegedly caused sterility in male workers according to lawsuits filed in us courts by 1997 more than 24000 banana workers mostly in costa rica and many of them employees of chiquita or its subsidiaries signed up for class action law suits against the manufacturer dow chemical and users of the pesticide including chiquita the lawsuits stated that many men had become sterile and medical evidence linked their sterility to the pesticide the companies including chiquita which said it used the chemical only in the early to mid1970s have fought efforts to get the case tried in us jurisdiction in june dow chemical offered 22 million in global settlement which worked out to few hundred dollars per worker we continue to dispute our liability dow chemical spokesman dan fellner told the enquirer unfortunately many of the users and purchasers of dbcp did not read the labels or follow the instructions the plaintiffs accepted the offer from dow but cases against the banana companies are pending if we ever get in courtroom well kill them said one of the plaintiff attorneys charles siegal of dallas in statement issued through its attorneys chiquita did not mention litigation but stated it stopped using dbcp in 1977 two years before the epa banned dbcp in 1979 epa records show it ordered dbcp phased out for use in the united states in 1977 the product was banned in costa rica in 1978 the epa ordered complete ban on the product in 1979 meaning any product that tests positive for even trace of the pesticide may not be brought into the united states as consumer consciousness about pesticide use increased over the years the banana industry changed pesticides when problems were brought to the publics attention in north america and europe for example in 1990 the pesticide aldicarb was banned by the epa after levels above epa safety guidelines were found in potatoes being brought to market later excess levels were found by fda checks of some bananas coming to american ports quickly the pesticide was dropped by the entire banana industry professor luisa castillo head of the national universitys pesticide program in costa rica said she and other scientists had complained about aldicarb to banana growers for years with little result chiquita stated that it used the pesticide for only one year aldicarb was very popular but it was causing very high number of pesticide poisonings to workers and it was also causing fish kills and other problems here she said we had already pointed out this problem with aldicarb but nothing had been done it was only in the moment that the residue appeared in the fruit that immediately they growers stopped using aldicarb industry supporters said that banana companies dont misuse pesticides pesticides are very expensive so you only use them if you absolutely have to said robert moore president of the international banana association iba washington dcbased group working for the interests of the american banana industry since the aldicarb scare the banana industry has met safety standards for us food and drug administration spot checks at the ports according to fda reports administration tests from 1992 to 1994 showed traces of pesticides in the bananas sampled but rarely in unsafe amounts the fda checks only fraction of the bananas brought into the united states in 1996 it conducted tests on fewer than 800 shipments during the same period tens of thousands of shipments brought more than 223 billion bananas into the country according to the iba polly hoppin director of agricultural pollution prevention at the world wildlife fund and an expert on pesticides said the fda checks dont reveal much about what is going on at the plantations professor scott witter at michigan state universitys institute of international agriculture said that most pesticides applied these days may show up in fda banana sampling but virtually always within safe amounts for consumers but for the thousands of people working on or living near the banana plantations pesticides threaten their health the people who tend to take it on the nose are the costa ricans or the hondurans or the ecuadoreans who work on the plantations when they are doing the spraying he said theyre in the field their water supplies get contaminated their kids play in the dirt thats contaminated that day ive yet to witness really wonderful program where they say ok were spraying today everybody needs to stay inside chiquita through its lawyers has stated that there is soil contamination problem on chiquita farms scientists complain that figuring out how exactly pesticides are affecting people and the environment on banana plantations is extremely difficult because gathering any hard data is constantly resisted by banana companies they dont want us doing any research said professor castillo at the pesticide program for example water pollution it is better for company to suspect that the water is polluted than to know that the water is polluted the large banana companies resist independent scientific studies on their plantations because they dont want the public to know she contended they are always saying that hard data can affect them in the international market professor castillo said so if it is known that there are pollution and health problems then people wont want to buy the product from our point of view we feel we have to know the situation in order to change it and that we hope that the more educated consumer will change things professor lacher at texas am said he and his coauthors on his recent paper about agrochemicals in the banana industry tried to get the multinational companies to cooperate but could not get anyone to talk with them we didnt publish the industry perspective but you cant get access to industry information said mr lacher if everything is proprietary theres nothing we can do about it mr lacher said the industry is defensive on the pesticide issue nobodys saying you shouldnt grow bananas he said nobodys saying you shouldnt apply chemicals but what you need to do is look at what the major sources of risks are scientists arent the only ones feeling cold shoulder several years ago the intergovernmental group on bananas of the united nations food and agriculture organization set up special committee called the banana improvement project in 1995 report project officials stated that they hoped the major companies would provide the project with money and technical assistance to tackle difficult problems facing banana production including black sigatoka the destructive airborne disease that threatens the entire banana industry and has led major companies to increase aerial spraying on their farms at the intergovernmental groups meeting in rome last may the banana improvement project wrote its own epitaph in the meeting report the lack of financial support from the banana industry is surprising and extremely disappointing the report read copyright 1998 chiquita secrets revealed environment better banana program under attack publication cincinnati enquirer date may 3 1998 by cameron mcwhirter and mike gallagher despite chiquitas promotion of the ecook better banana certification the program has come under increasing attack for what has been perceived by some environmentalists and scientists as sellout to corporate interests chiquita quickly became major force in the program as the only major banana producer to participate while the rainforest alliance has continued to try and present the program as open to everyone chiquitas participation overshadows all others according to scientists environmentalists and former employees of chiquita in material and advertisements in the united states and europe chiquita has been quick to use its rainforest alliance certification to link its products to environmental safety of the 81 farms certified on the program worldwide by january 1998 74 91 percent were directly owned chiquita subsidiaries connie smith who was chiquitas central american environmental coordinator before leaving her post in 1996 said the certification program ran into problems because banana companies were too competitive to cooperate once chiquita began to dominate the program the two other large companies dole and monte lost interest in the idea it all started out on good intentions said ms smith who lives with her family in san jose costa rica it was going to be an industrywide voluntary programbut the banana multinationals are big competitorsthe ecook became an issue of competition if we get the certification and they dont that will differentiate our bananas that should never have happened the program was orginally called ecook but the alliance later changed the name to better banana ms smith said the connection today between chiquita and the rainforest alliance does have tendency to make people wonder about the programs validity she said the program needs to be re evaluated eric holst coordinator of the rainforest alliances better banana program in new york said the alliance receives donations from chiquita but it does accept corporate donations from other companies that it is not certifying it does charge fee for certification the money is paid directly to its costa rican partner fundacion ambio the group that performs the inspections on chiquita subsidiary farms mr holst said fundacion ambio conducts scheduled inspections on farms once year in costa rica and panama mr holst said the group reserves the right to conduct spot checks and conducts between one and 10 year certified plantation ever has had its certification revoked for violations violations are usually not written up and are not made public mr holst said if inspectors find violations plantation managers are notified and asked to correct the problem specific information about the inspections or any violations is proprietary and not available to the public mr holst said this fiscal year fundacion ambio has budget of 312000 according to mr holst about 25 percent of that budget comes from chiquitas fee payments he said mr holst said all of chiquitas subsidiary farms in costa rica are certified under the rainforest alliances program those certifications do not include many associate farms that sell fruit to chiquita in statement issued through its attorneys chiquita stated that as contracts are renewed it is asking associate farms to apply for certification with the alliance about half of chiquitas subsidiary plantations in panama are certified thirteen chiquita subsidiary farms in colombia have also been certified none of chiquitas subsidiary farms or the farms of its associate growers in honduras guatemala or ecuador are certified yet because the program was first tested in costa rica chiquita has publicly committed to bringing all of its plantations into the better banana program by 1999 rainforest alliance officials said they are lining up local environmental groups in those countries to begin inspections in 1996 chiquita paid the washingtonbased environmental group conservation international to send team of eight environmental experts to visit its certified farms in costa rica and panama in response to questions by the enquirer conservation international issued twopage letter to chiquita which was then forwarded to the enquirer it declared chiquitas environmental efforts as an innovative system that looks for environmental improvements in the effects of monocultures singlecrop farms serves as guide for the establishment of environmental measures and promotes gradual changes in land use practices this program should be continued and supported for its goals james nations vice president of mexico and central america programs for conservation international who led the chiquita commissioned study told the enquirer that he found the certification very positive and very aboveboard system after the discussion with the enquirer mr nations called magnes welsh chiquitas director of investor relations according to nov 13 taperecorded voice mailmessage provided to the enquirer through company source he told ms welsh that i gave the reporter very positive story the one thing that the enquirer asked that i hedged on was how much did chiquita pay you ci to do this study mr nations told ms welsh i said ill have to check even though i actually know now i want to know from you and also im going to ask people here pete and karen ci staffers what they think about this idea of actually releasing that information because i dont feel that its really any of his the reporters business so let know what you think about that mr nations did not return followup calls from the enquirer chiquita does support other environmental work outside of the better banana program for example the company is funding the nonprofit organization amigos aves friends of the birds group run by two expatriate americans who work to raise macaws in captivity and then release them into the wild the group stated in an email response to the enquirer that it received about 20000 so far from chiquita as well as weekly free bananas to feed their birds copyright 1998 chiquita secrets revealed environment death on farm shows danger publication cincinnati enquirer date may 3 1998 by cameron mcwhirter and mike gallagher pesticides can kill more than pests take greddy mauricio valerin bustos worker on plantation 96 farm in costa rica owned by chiquitas subsidiary the chiriqui land company on the morning of nov 13 1997 the 18yearold had been working since 5 am collecting piola the thin rope used to support the banana plants at about 730 am according to the police he was found writhing on the ground choking and vomiting up white substance he was dead by 917 am police investigators interviewed one of the coworkers who brought his body to the medical clinic he was working in an area called 50s that had been sprayed with the agrochemical counter the brand name for the pesticide terbufos an organophosphate three days ago miguel herra miranda told police according to translation of the investigation report he mr valerin didnt have any experience in this kind of job and he wasnt using any protective gear like gloves and mask either the autopsy report obtained by the enquirer determined that mr valerin died from intoxication from organophosphates which caused internal bleeding and brain damage chiquita in statement through its lawyers said the company acknowledged that the costa rican government coroner declared the cause of death to be organophosphate poisoning the company also stated it operated the farm safely and the death was an isolated incident although chiquita has attempted to understand the details surrounding mr valerins collapse chiquita is unable to explain and will not speculate how mr valerin might have died chiquita stated under an agreement with the new yorkbased environmental group the rainforest alliance plantation 96 is certified under the better banana program to meet certain environmental and worker safety guidelines but often problems can be hard to detect because the program requires inspectors visit plantations only once year with possible spot checks afterward said eric holst new york coordinator of the better banana program thats one of the weaknesses of certification you cant be there every day mr holst said as rule chiquita and its subsidiaries do not provide protective gear for workers unless those workers are directly involved in the application or storage of pesticides the vast majority receive protective clothing though they are exposed to pesticides in their work on the plantations carl smith publications director and an expert on pesticide exports at the foundation for advancements in science and education fase in angeles said the use of many pesticides like terbufos are legal in the united states but only under strict safety regulations when these chemicals are exported to central america where worker safety and environmental laws are less stringent the result can be dangerous for the workers and the environment when you look at conditions of use in areas like central america there are lot of compounds that are awful dangerous he said its one thing if guy is wearing full moon suit with respirator and gloves its another thing if teenagers are walking around the stuff with shirt nearby plantation 96 is plantation o3 farm that has an exclusive contract to sell bananas to chiquita like other farms in the area the farm owned by proyecto agroindustrial sixaola sa pais ships bananas with chiquita labels and in chiquita boxes the plantation grows bananas only for chiquita and to contractual specifications set by chiquita in statement issued through its attorneys chiquita said it was not responsible for anything that happened on the farm but said it does exert pressure in its contracts to monitor safety and environmental standards chiquita although it is not in any way required to do so is insisting that independent growers adopt chiquitas own strict environmental standards and practices if they want to renew contractual relations with the company the company stated on the farm enquirer reporters saw work team applying terbufos nematicide classified as extremely hazardous to humans by the world health organization terbufos is under restricted use in the united states by the us environmental protection agency epa nematicides are pesticides used to kill nematodes tiny worm parasites that can destroy crops roots according to epa guidelines once the pesticide is put on the ground one should be allowed in the area for at least 24 hours unless wearing protective clothing and respirator children playing but with the air thick with the heavy smell of pesticides the enquirer team observed children from the nearby village playing in the area amid open bags of terbufos and plants just treated with the pesticide warning signs were posted and workers tried to stop the children from playing in the area or passing through the enquirer saw signs with warning in spanish danger nematicide application in this area leaning against the wall of packing plant about mile away when asked about plantation 03 and pais chiquita issued statement through its attorneys declaring the pais farm is owned and operated by costa rican quasigovernmental institution chiquita does not own or operate the farm what the enquirer says it observed at pais should not have happened the company stated that it has since renegotiated its contract with the owners of pais and requires the company to adhere to chiquita standard operating procedures regarding environmental safety enquirer reporters also observed pesticide workers at finca o3 taking off their masks because of the stifling heat mr smith of fase said the protective clothing is fundamental problem in tropical agricultural which neither better banana nor any other program has solved he said the limited safety equipment that has been created for these materials is often heavy rubber suitable for northern colder climates in the tropics mask rubber gloves rubber apron rubber boots long pants and sweatshirt make for incredibly uncomfortable work days on sweltering plantation such heavy clothing itself could be unsafe because of the danger of heat exhaustion mr smith said the equipment doesnt even exist that is suitable for tropical climates he said even workers who wear protective clothing properly are not safe workers told the enquirer on cocobola plantation owned by one of chiquitas costa rican subsidiaries compania bananera atlantica ltda cobal in northeast costa rica pesticide worker emilio colero 41 told enquirer reporters that he was concerned about his health he was issued protective clothing when he applied the ground pesticides but he said through translator that when i bend over some of the herbicide liquid gets on my neck i get rash every time until i take shower mr colero said his wife is constantly concerned about him but he works in pesticides because the pay is better than other field jobs he makes 680 costa rican colones per hectare and sprays about three or four hectares day that salary is about 15 day through its attorneys the company issued written statement that chiquita strictly adheres to safety recommendations of the pesticides that it uses the company said also that it has reduced its use of nematicides like terbufos by more than 50 percent since 1995 demonstrating its continuing commitment to minimizing the environmental impact of its farming operations new chemicals applied another problem is at chiquita packing plants and those of affiliates where the bananas are brought to be boxed before shipment in these processing centers the bananas are washed of chemicals that have been applied in the fields after this washing process the bananas then are sprayed with new chemicals either thiabendazole or imazalil or both to keep the fruit from rotting as chiquita boxes state clearly thiabendazole and or imazalil applied to fruit to preserve quality in transit workers then pick up these pesticidecovered bananas usually with their bare hands and place them in boxes for shipment scientists union officials and workers told reporters of rashes on the arms of women in the packing houses chemical runoff from washed bananas and newly applied pesticides also flows into water passing through plant operations and back into irrigation canals those canals then flow into nearby rivers chiquita stated through its attorneys that it has conducted comprehensive tests of water running off its farms and chiquita never has detected level of pesticides that posed any threat to the environment or people the enquirer visited packing plants on certified plantations of chiquitas subsidiaries in costa rica most did not have containment or treatment systems to remove chemicals from the water supply almost none of the workers had gloves thiabendazole is fungicide that the epa has determined is harmful to fish according to the pesticide users health and safety handbook government laboratory studies have also pointed to the fungicide as possible cause of anemia and possible cancercausing agent in mammals imazalil is classified as moderately toxic compound by the extensions toxicology network cooperative information group on pesticides set up by cornell university and other universities and funded by the us department of agriculture according to network document lab animals fed imazalil have suffered symptoms including muscle incoordination reduced arterial tension tremors and vomiting professor luisa castillo who heads costa ricas national university pesticide program said the two chemicals are major concern for environmental scientists in costa rica scientists in her program have conducted studies of rivers in national parks downstream from banana plantations some of which were operated by chiquita we have found high levels of imazalil and thiabendazole in the water and we have also found toxicity by those two pesticides toward aquatic organisms ms castillo said her programs studies have not pinpointed the specific source of this pollution she said one of the key components of any sincere attempt to improve the environment would be to stop those chemicals from getting into the water supply i would immediately put water treatment plants in the packing plants and not allow that water to flow into the natural courses of water because it is quite polluted ms castillo said in statement issued through its lawyers chiquita stated that it has spent at least 33 million installing special chambers at its packing plants to apply thiabendazole or imazalil to the bananas reducing the amount of these pesticides used and the amount to which workers are exposed the company stated that it has installed these chambers on number of its farms copyright 1998 chiquita secrets revealed environment industry attacks report critical of farm growth publication cincinnati enquirer date may 3 1998 by cameron mcwhirter and mike gallagher report critical of banana farm expansion for causing environmental and social problems at the beginning of this decade was kept from the public for years by the costa rican environmental ministry after the banana industry including chiquita attacked the study now that the report has been released banana plantation owners continue to criticize the internationallyrespected group that wrote it in the early 1990s almost 100 square miles of costa rican grazing land and forests in the northeastern section of the country were bought by banana companies like chiquita and turned into banana fields according to costa rican government statistics 70740 acres were in banana production nationwide in 1990 by 1995 that number had jumped to 1311175 acres an increase of more than 85 percent catholic bishop near the region labor leaders and conservationists publicly expressed concerns about the expansions effect on the environment and the treatment of workers in response the costa rican ministry for environmental affairs commissioned report on the banana industry from the central american office of the international union for the conservation of nature iucn in 1991 the iucn one of the oldest international conservation groups runs conservation projects around the world and counts agencies of 74 governments as members including the united states panama japan and the united kingdom the 129page report parts of which were leaked in 1993 discussed various problems caused by an increase in banana cultivation deforestation one of the biggest problems cited was deforestation the huge increase meant the loss of thousands of acres of cattle farms and more than 13 square miles of primary rain forest according to the report another issue was that the increase in banana plantations led to dramatic rise in pesticide use in an area permeated by rivers and creeks that flow into the caribbean according to the report the new plantations also were located near many sensitive forest preserves and conservation areas environmentalists were concerned about pollution from pesticides causing fish kills and other environmental problems the report said the report also dealt with unemployment prompted by the expansion while workers were brought in initially to build the plantations many were fired afterward because it took fewer people to maintain the farms as result many people moving to remote area of the country found themselves unemployed goal was awareness the goal of the report was to raise awareness of these issues among government officials the public and the banana industry leaders what we would like to see is more environmentally and socially aware banana industry enrique lahmann regional director of the iucn said but the public didnt get to see the report for years when some draft findings were leaked the banana companies declared open opposition and set up their own commission comision ambiental bananera to coordinate the industrys responsea new administration came into office in 1996 and the report was released in early 1997 asked if the government endorsed the report the costa rican embassy in washington dc sent the enquirer an old press release from corbana stateowned banana company condemning the report asked if that represented the governments position the costa rican embassy referred all questions to minae costa ricas environmental department that agency did not respond to repeated phone calls mails and fascimile transmissions in its 1997 official statement on the final iucn report the commission reiterated its longstanding recommendation that the environmental minister must not endorse the diagnostic report as an updated document and suggested that it only be considered an historical document translation if the document was not considered updated it could not be considered by the environmental ministry in its policy decisions as relevant to the banana industry today the statement said mr lahmann said powerful american banana interests have operated in costa rica for more than 100 years and their political influence was applied to hold the report for years there is question that the banana industry has lot of weight in national politics in costa rica mr lahmann said chiquita officials refused to be interviewed by the enquirer about this project including the iucn report through attorneys the company released statement that it never tried to keep the report from the public the statement condemned the iucn report as unbalanced and not based on scientific method but instead solely on casual observation the research team was comprised of 16 scientific and academic teams looking at different aspects of the expansion like pesticide use agroecology legal issues social impact refuse economics and forestry the environmental diagnostic included analysis of high grade maps of the region as well as satellite photographs visited region the teams made numerous visits to the region to interview workers conservation groups medical personnel local government officials health ministry officials and environment ministry officials the teams also held numerous talks with administrators from all the major multinational companies including chiquitas main costa rican subsidiary compania bananera atlantica ltda cobal i dont think that it is unscientific wellknown professionals participated in the report said the iucns mr lahmann who has phd in oceanography from the university of miami and who is an expert in wetlands pollution mr lahmann said that while the iucn came under lot of criticism from the banana companies the report helped raise awareness of environmental issues in costa rica i wonder if that would have happened without this report he said chiquita dismissed the iucn as confederation of environmental interest groups the iucn is federation of conservation groups and government agencies with several important us institutions as official members these members include the us state departments bureau of oceans international environment and scientific affairs the us fish and wildlife service the us department of agriculture forest service and the nature conservancy conservation international which chiquita itself described as highly respected independent environmental organization when it paid the organization last year to critique the companys own environmental program also is member chiquita also said the iucn would not endorse the report mr lahmann said preliminary drafts carried label that the opinions expressed in the report were those of the consultants during discussion once the environment ministry officially released the report this year it was endorsed publicly by the iucn according to mr lahmann report suppressed while chiquita stated that it had nothing to do with keeping the iucn report from the public the company has kept an environmental report in honduras from public review in 1995 the honduran centro estudios control contaminantes the center for the study and control of contaminants audited the banana industry throughout honduras including chiquita plantations dr luis munguia guerrero cesccos director said the audit found serious problems on chiquitas farms but he said he could not release the report because of confidentiality agreement signed with the company he said however that chiquita could release it if it chose the enquirer asked chiquita to see the report the company declined to release it in response issued through its attorneys it stated that cescco conducted an initial audit of the banana industry in 1995 identifying several general areas in which improvement was needed for its part chiquita has taken affirmative steps to address issues raised in the 1995 cescco report copyright 1998 chiquita secrets revealed environment unregistered toxins used despite claims publication cincinnati enquirer date may 3 1998 by cameron mcwhirter and mike gallagher chiquitas environmental partner the rainforest alliance claims that chiquitas better banana certified farms only use products that are registered for use in the united states canada and europe according to the alliances general production standards and agreed to by chiquita but the enquirer found that chiquita systematically uses chemical products on its certified farms that are not registered for use meaning they are not allowed to be used in the united states canada or one or more countries of the european union these pesticides include bitertanol sold as baycor in documents provided to the enquirer chiquita stated that it has used this product since 1993 according to documents provided to the enquirer by the manufacturer the bayer corporation the pesticide is not and never has been registered for use in the united states us environmental protection agency epa spokesman albert heier confirmed that bitertanol is not approved for use in the united states on bananas or any other crop the pesticides full impact on people or the environment is not known at this time because the epa has not conducted tests on the product mr heier said in statement issued to the enquirer through its attorneys chiquita stated that company policy allows only for the use of agrichemicals that are approved by the united states environmental protection agency epa for use on bananas denise kearns spokesperson for the epa on pesticide issues said that the epa has set tolerance level for bitertanol that is the level of detectable pesticide residue at which the epa will allow crop to be imported into the united states but this level set after scientific review does not constitute approval for use in the us on bananas or any other crop ms kearns said bitertanol also is not registered for use in canada according to antony simpson spokesman for health canadas pest management regulatory agency the canadian governments counterpart to the epas office of pesticide programs the pesticide is approved for use in the european union chlorpyrifos sold as lorsban this product is widely used by chiquita to put in plastic bags that hang over the banana bunches as they grow it is registered for use in the united states however the epa is reviewing safety levels for all organophosphate compounds and chlorpyrifos is one product that could be severely restricted because of health and environmental risks according to published reports by the washington state department of agriculture last year the epa declared chlorpyrifos as restricted use product restriction allowing for use only under special circumstances with specific epa approval chlorpyrifos is not authorized for use in finland and sweden according to european union government reports carbofuran sold as furadan this pesticide is used to combat nematodes small worms that attack the banana plants chiquita has used the product since 1975 the product is listed by the epa as severely restricted in the united states according to epa documents the products high risk of danger to people and the environment make it pesticide for which virtually all registered uses have been prohibited by final government regulatory action but it can still be used in some special cases the product also is severely restricted in canada according to health canada its use is not authorized in finland ethoprop sold as mocap this organophosphate also is registered for use in the united states but is being reviewed by epa like chlorpyrifos it has been singled out as facing severe

competitive banana trade chiquita brands has made strong effort to set itself apart as the industrys environmental leader chiquitas brochures posters and company website proudly trumpet its partnership with the rainforest alliance new yorkbased environmental group known worldwide for setting up environmental business partnerships since 1993 the two have worked on the ecook better banana program an environmental certification to assure protection for workers and the environment on costa rican farms of chiquitas subsidiaries compania bananera atlantica ltda cobal and the chiriqui land company the program originally called ecook but later changed to better banana has since expanded to chiquita subsidiary farms in panama and colombia but an enquirer investigation into chiquitas use of pesticides on plantations shows disregard not only of the companys stated environmental guidelines and partnership agreements with the alliance but also the safety of its tens of thousands of field workers the enquirer found aerial spraying when workers are in the fields is practice condemned by the us environmental protection agency epa scientists and even chiquitas environmental partner the rainforest alliance the spraying violates the rules of the better banana program the rainforest alliances policy paper on the better banana program states all workers and neighbors must be warned when pesticides are being applied according to the programs general regulations workers and neighbors are not supposed to be exposed to aerial spraying chiquitas subsidiaries use pesticides in latin america that are not registered for use in the united states canada or europe they do so even though chiquita has issued public statements and agreed to an environmental contract with the rainforest alliance that on its farms certified by the alliance it will only use products that are registered for use in the united states canada and europe chiquita subsidiary farms use pesticides in aerial spraying that are highly toxic to fish and birds contrary to chiquitas stated environmental policies these findings come as the better banana project is under criticism from scientists in central america europe and the united states chiquitas showcase environmental program has been attacked as disingenuous superficial and unverifiable the changes are more aesthetic than anything else said catharina wesseling scientist with the karolinska institute of environmental medicine in stockholm sweden and author of the book health effects from pesticide use in costa rica they dont address the real problems however an executive of washington dc based conservation group conservation international hired by chiquita to visit its certified subsidiary farms called the project very positive scientists critical of the program say it doesnt adequately address problem that the entire banana industry has been wrestling with for decades use of pesticides that endanger the health of workers villagers or the environment in latin america the us food and drug administration which is responsible for checking pesticide levels on bananas imported for american consumers said the overwhelming majority of bananas brought into the united states and tested by the administration show pesticide residue well within safety standards set by epa however scientists and environmentalists said the methods and amount of pesticide use practiced by chiquita and other large banana growers endangers banana workers and the environment where the bananas are grown aerial spraying chiquitas environmental charter states that the company works to protect the rainforest to maintain clean water to minimize the use of agrochemicals to reduce reuse and recycle waste to support environmental education and to ensure our workforce is welltrained and works safely those guidelines also are supported by the rainforest alliance but the enquirer has found that chiquita subsidiaries have sprayed toxic cocktails varying mixtures of potent chemicals on their plantations without removing workers first these aerial sprayings can take place more than 40 times year on plantations that are threatened by widespread banana disease often these pesticides fall on workers nearby villages rivers or forests eric holst coordinator for the rainforest alliances better banana certification program in new york said that aerial spraying while workers are in the fields would be violation of the certification program we require that workers have protection from the application of chemicals that clearly is violation through its attorneys chiquita provided the enquirer with list of chemicals it has approved for use on its banana farms for aerial spraying the company uses the fungicides propiconazole benomyl mancozeb azoxystrobin thiophanatemethyl tridemorph and bitertanol propiconazole and benomyl have both been found to be possibly cancercausing for humans by the epa mancozeb azoxystrobin thiophanatemethyl and tridemorph are considered hazards to fish by the epa bitertanol is not allowed for use on farms in the united states while azoxystrobin and tridemorph are not allowed for use in canada source at chiquitas headquarters in cincinnati provided the enquirer with tape recordings of internal voicemail messages several of which dealt with the issue of aerial spraying while workers are in the fields after the enquirer asked chiquitas attorneys and rainforest alliance official about the companys aerial spraying policy robert kistinger president of chiquita banana group based in cincinnati said in an oct 29 1997 voicemail message to john ordman chiquitas senior vice president of finance that he wanted officials to figure out how quickly we can begin to implement procedure for taking our workers out of the fields when we spray it is something we have to think about getting done fairly quickly for workers the unannounced aerial spraying is constant fear some of the workers are affected by the aerial spraying especially with rashes luis perez jimenez 31 leaf cutter on cobals cocobola plantation said through translator they never tell us about the aerial spraying we just see it coming and boom its here small crop dusters will fly low over the banana trees and emit clouds of pesticides that settle over the tall leafy plants they also settle on workers nearby villagers animals and open water as two enquirer reporters witnessed on recently sprayed farms the air is heavy with stifling chemical stench breathing is difficult and the pesticide residue covers everything at cocobola one of cobals larger farms and nearby cobals gavilan farm hundreds of employees can be working in the fields at any one time the plantation laced with irrigation canals is adjacent to rio sucio large river in northeast costa rica mr perez through translator said that white film gets all over his clothes and body when spraying occurs i dont get any protective clothing said mr perez whose job is to cut diseased leaves from plants the white stuff gets all over my arms and on my clothes i get lot of rashes jose gomez 45 another worker on the cocobola plantation also said the planes come over with warning youre just working and then suddenly you see it coming he told the enquirer as he stood amid lush rows of banana plants i try to hide under the banana leaves when i hear the planes if the chemicals get on i get rashes on my back i try to be careful when the planes come i try to protect myself under these leaves mr gomez through translator said that he was afraid of the longterm impact of the pesticides on his health but this job was the only work he could find in the region under the better banana certification program touted by chiquita workers who apply pesticides with spray packs are supplied with protective clothing and training on how to handle pesticides but thousands of other field workers like mr gomez who do not apply pesticides receive protective clothing enquirer reporters observed and were told by workers union leaders and company officials that field workers not directly involved in the application or storage of pesticides do not receive protective clothing speaking of the industrywide problem of aerial spraying on banana workers sandra marquardt an environmental consultant in san francisco who formerly headed up greenpeace internationals efforts to stop the us export of banned pesticides said these airplanes come over and just nail the suckers dole and monte the two other large us banana companies also employ aerial spraying but neither has joined the better banana program or publicly acknowledged any alliance with an environmental group claiming to limit workers exposure to pesticides in response to enquirer questions chiquita through its attorneys issued threepage statement on aerial spraying but did not address the issue of workers being sprayed in the fields the company stated that the spraying was necessary to combat banana disease called black sigatokathe airborne fungus causes streaks on the plants makes the fruit smaller and eventually kills the plant if unchecked the attorneys said the company has hired environmental consulting groups to conduct water monitoring of nearby rivers and those groups have found almost contamination despite the concerns expressed by mr kistinger in his october voicemail message aerial spraying of fields while workers were in them was still going on four months later in feb 23 voicemail message to mr ordman mr kistinger pointed out the companys political and public relations problem with continuing aerial spraying while workers are in the fields one of the key focuses that we have not been successful so far has been the issue of aerial spraying mr kistinger said the environmental groups the social groups the ngo nongovernmental organizations say it is not right to be spraying people when they are working in the field and so far we have been able to make very little progress in this regard prodding his executives to develop an alternative to spraying workers mr kistinger added that there is enormous buildup of pressure from the public in europe to protect banana workers noting that steps must be taken to curb the practice even if theyre small at this point it is very necessary to do from public relations standpoint chiquita recently has created an environmental website on which it has posted position paper on aerial spraying on the website chiquita states that spraying is necessary to protect the banana crop but the company stated it is working on several methods of applying the pesticides from the ground which it claims would reduce pesticide exposure to workers and the environment earth college science professor jorge arce portuguez said sigatoka has become the major pest threatening the banana industry in recent years earth college is an agricultural science college in central costa rica partially funded by the us government and supported by dozens of major american universities the industrys only answer so far has been to increase the potency and regularity of aerial spraying he said but the disease has adapted quickly becoming resistant to many of the chemicals in 1990 we controlled sigatoka with more or less 25 to 30 aerial sprayings per year he said now seven years later we are dropping by plane more than 40 times per year antisigatoka chemicals make up the bulk of pesticides used on most banana plantations according to lori ann thrupp senior associate and expert on sustainable agriculture at the world resources institute washington dcbased think tank on environmental issues drifting pesticides in 1996 edition of the science journal ambio scott witter associate professor at michigan state universitys institute of international agriculture and colleague carlos hernandez published report on the costa rican banana industry that found that 15 percent of aerial pesticides completely drifted off the studied plantations because of wind 40 percent drifted away from the plants and into the ground and 35 percent washed off in the rain only 10 percent of the fungicide sprayed actually stayed on the plant theres considerable debate about how much drift there is professor witter told the enquirer we had in that article references for as much as 90 percent of it not ending up on the banana plants some of the transnationals say its more like only 40 percent thats lost but still thats lot of fungicides going off into the water supply you have lot of the poor folks who take their water directly from surface sources they end up ingesting these costa rica is blessed with tremendous amount of rainfall and so dilution in many instances becomes solution to some of the pollution but over time it does tend to bioaccumulate in statement issued through its attorneys chiquita stated that it is aware of the drift problem and has worked in recent years to reduce drift by installing special pesticide spray nozzles on its airplanes and other measures in the village of bananito norte in the heart of banana country southeast of the coastal city of limon esther rodriguez anchia lives with her husband and three children in oneroom wooden shack next to chiquitas super amigo packing plant and chiquita subsidiary plantations when the crop dusters come over her family is sprayed with the chemicals she said there is warning mrs rodriguez said through translator it just comes usually once week but sometimes twice my children get very rashy when the planes come i just have them run inside but we usually are stuck with the rashes im very allergic myself so its much worse for i have to visit the doctor all the time she said mrs rodriguez 52 said the aerial spraying has made her hate the village i would love to fly away from here she said copyright 1998 chiquita secrets revealed life on banana plantation

grow millions of bananas every year for consumers in north america and europe the fruit is grown and harvested in laborintensive process that involves an army of workers lots of equipment cropdusting airplanes foam cushions string bags special cartons refrigerated trucks and trains and tons of pesticides while production methods vary slightly from plantation to plantation the basic operations illustrated below remain the same this illustration is composite plantation drawn from enquirer reporters visits to chiquita subsidiary plantations and chiquita affiliated farms in honduras and costa rica as well as interviews with plantation workers and environmental scientists 1 commercial banana plants grow from 15 to 30 feet in height and are grown in long rows on large irrigated plantations most bananas consumed in the united states are grown in the lowlands of central and south america the average banana plant produces fruit about every nine months the stem usually grows to contain about 150 bananas when the manager decides the fruit is cut green from the plant and dropped carefully on the back of worker carrying cushion to stop any bruising of the fruit 2 herbicides to kill off other plants growing around the bananas workers apply herbicides the chemicals are toxic and wash into the ground and ground water during rains 3 nematicides to kill off nematodes small worms that attack banana plants from the roots workers cover the ground around the plants with nematicides these chemicals are highly toxic and make an area extremely dangerous for 24 to 48 hours after application 4 banana plants do not have strong trunks they can easily be knocked over in tropical windstorm to prevent blowdowns workers tie the plants down with string 5 aerial spraying is an integral part of pesticide application in commercial banana farming the main purpose is to combat black sigatoka an airborne fungus that can destroy plantations crop in areas that are infected with the fungus including much of central america airplanes may spray fields more than 40 times year the spray lands on the plants upper leaves the ground irrigation canals streams and rivers and nearby homes workers and residents scientists told the enquirer workers on chiquita subsidiary plantations and other farms producing chiquita bananas told the enquirer that they receive warning when the planes come over and they often hide under banana leaves to escape the pesticide dust nearby villagers complain the aerial spraying often drifts into their yards sending children running into the houses to escape rashes many worker villages are located close to banana plantations 6 the water used in the in the packing plants to wash pesticides off the bananas comes from the irrigation canals and then is routed back out into the water supply chiquita has built berms in recent years on some plantations to limit pesticides from flowing directly into rivers but many irrigation canals laced throughout every plantation remain directly exposed to pesticides 7 plastic bags imbedded with the powerful chemical chlorpyrifos protect the the growing fruit from insects throughout its entire gestation in previous yearsthe bags were simply discarded after use though the major banana companies have now started recycling programs 8 at harvesting the stem is placed on large overhead cable system that runs throughout the plantation workers place foam cushions among the fruit to stop bruising the fruit is then pushed along the cable toward the empacadora the packing plant 9 in the packing plant workers remove the cushions other workers then cut the stems into smaller bunches 10 the bunchesare then put in pila seleccion selecting trough where selectoras usually women choose the bananas and cut them further down to shipping size with small hooked knives 11 larger troughs called pilas des leches milk troughs wash off the pesticides applied in the fields as well as natural fluids from the banana plant 12 new pesticides are applied to the bunches after they are placed on conveyer belt the new pesticides either thiabendazole or imazalil are applied to prevent crown rot fungus that attacks the extremities of the banana bunch on some plantations chiquita has installed small plastic containment systems that save money on pesticide costs and reduce worker exposure to the pesticides but most plantations do not have this system according to chiquita statements issued through its attorneys to the enquirer 13 boxes of banana bunches freshly applied with pesticides are put on large skids for shipment on all the plantations visited by the enquirer most workers viewed by reporters did not wear gloves when handling the pesticidecovered bananas 14 trucks or trains are brought to the plant and loaded with the skids the bananas are taken to port where the large refrigerated containers are lifted onto ships the ships then sail to various destinations usually in north america or europe about ten days to two weeks after being harvested the bananas are on display and for sale at local groceries pesticides in the banana ecosystem the ecosytem of banana plantation is extremely wet and hot the soil is very loose helping the banana plants grow but also making it easy for pesticides to spread throughout the system it often rains in these areas flushing pesticides into the ground and water table the banana industrys answer to this dissipation has been to apply pesticides frequently ways pesticides get into the environment air airplanes drop toxic chemicals regularly from the air pesticides fall on the plants but also on workers the ground and irrigation canals and streams ground workers apply pesticides to the ground around the plants these chemicals seep into the ground with every rainfall water pesticides also get into water that is used to wash bananas in the packing plants that water then flows back into the irrigation canals bags plastic bags with the insecicide chlorpyrifos cover all the banana bunches from their inception the chemical leaks off the bags in rain storms and flows into the ground and water black sigatoka is banana plant disease that plagues most areas where chiquita bananas are produced the airborne fungus eats away at the plant leaves turning them black the disease shrinks the size of the frui and makes it ripen too quickly to be shipped to market eventually the disease kills the plant some researchers are now trying to find sigatoka resistant banana that will still appeal to consumers but nothing has been discovered thus far to date the industrys reaction to the problem has been to increase aerial spraying of powerful pesticides the roots of the banana humans have been cultivating bananas since almost the beginning of civilization varieties of the plant are referred to in ancient chinese and arabic manuscripts believed by scientists to have developed in southeast asia more than 4000 years ago the plant eventually spread to other parts of asia and into africa the species scientific classification musaceae comes from the arabic word for the fruit muuz spanish and portuguese explorers are believed to have come into contact with the plant in their travels to west africa where they adopted variation of local term banana spanish explorers brought bananas to the americas in the 1500s today hundreds of banana varieties thrive in almost every tropical region of the world but more than 90 percent of the bananas found at grocery stores in the united states and europe are one variety the yellow gran cavendish the banana is one of the most productive plants in the world in the right climate and weather it produces year round and for decades at time the plant itself is actually an herb what looks like trunk of banana tree is in fact densely packed leaves growing up from base clump of roots the plants that produce commercial gran cavendish bananas do not produce seeds for reproduction and are sexless perennials planted in rows on giant farms they regenerate after each harvest the plant grows stalk called in latin america madre or the mother which produces purple stem with white flowers from its center the stem transforms into large hand of as many as 150 bananas each the hand which eventually bends over from the weight of the fruit can weigh up to 140 pounds the fruit is harvested before it is ripe and cut into the bunches that are transported to grocery stands once the fruit is harvested the stalk is cut and little stalk called hijo or offspring in spanish sprouts from the same root to begin the process again bananas are comprised mostly of sugary carbohydrates but it is also source of vitamins and c as well as potassium copyright 1998 chiquita secrets revealed politics history about the eu tour that this minister in panama wants to take is just highly dangerous and i was saying that we should if we could politely do it without ruffling too many feathers get that ministers trip cancelled so that would be exactly my program keith lindner chiquita vice chairman on canceling the trip of panamanian foreign minister contributions buy influence publication cincinnati enquirer date may 3 1998 by cameron mcwhirter and mike gallagher carl lindner is well known in this town as big contributor to both democrats and republicans what is he getting for his money mr lindner chairman of the board and ceo of chiquita brands international inc is buying the power of the white house and capitol hill according to advocates of campaign finance reform and opponents of chiquitas trade battles with europe although he has given more to republicans he has also been double giver and double giving is the clearest evidence that this money is not about elections its about buying influence said ann mcbride president of common cause the nonprofit group leading the campaign for finance reform the way carl lindner has given has been to give to both parties so that matter who wins hell have place at the table mr lindner registered republican who has spent at least two nights at the clinton white house certainly has place at the table of the democratic administration as well as both sides of the aisle in congress mr lindner has made large contributions totaling millions of dollars to republican and democratic candidates over the years but that largesse has come under scrutiny since 1993 when the european union established trade preferences limiting how many bananas chiquita could bring to europe chiquita began asking the white house to intervene while also making large donations to the democratic party in 1995 the us trade representatives office of the white house took the companys cause to the world trade organization wto the first case by the united states brought before the newly created international body the us decision to take up an international case on behalf of one multinational company contributed to the recent debate about campaign finance reform dole and monte the two other large us banana producers did not file requests with the white house dole proposed compromise in 1995 to avert the wto action but it was turned down mr lindner and other chiquita officials declined repeated requests to meet with the enquirer to discuss campaign contributions or any other subject through attorneys hired to deal with the enquirer chiquita issued the following written statement neither carl lindner jr nor any other chiquita united brands or american financial official has ever asked for or received any promises in return for political contributions related to the wto world trade organization proceeding or any other matter nor have any such promises or quid pro quos things given in exchange for something else been anticipated or expected by mr lindner or chiquita the white house also firmly denied any improper support for chiquitas case because of mr lindners donations its absolutely not true and has foundation in reality said jay ziegler spokesman for the white houses trade office but the enquirer has obtained through the freedom of information act correspondence between the white house members of congress and chiquita dealing with the european banana issue beginning in 1994 though many portions of the letters have been blacked out by the government the correspondence demonstrates the influence that chiquita exerts on the us trade office the correspondence shows that powerful congressional leaders sent letters to the white house pressuring the administration to support chiquitas position chiquita supporters included us sen john glenn dohio us sen mike dewine rohio us rep and speaker of the house newt gingrich rgeorgia us sen orrin hatch rutah us sen and majority leader trent lott rmiss us sen christopher dodd d conn and others who had received donations from either the lindners their controlled companies or company officials chief support appears to have come from bob dole while he was still the senior republican senator from kansas many of these letters were faxed to the trade office by carolyn gleason chiquitas trade attorney registered lobbyist and key liaison to the clinton administration on this issue on one letter from mr dole dated june 21 1995 then us trade representative mickey kantor scrawled note to his staffers please give way to proceed pressure is going to grow mk chiquitas lobbyist ms gleason sent faxes to the trade office at the offices request providing policy position papers on the banana issue for us embassy staff around the world other faxes show ms gleason writing legislation on this issue for the trade office to submit to the federal register staff of the white houses trade office discussed how to manage the press to chiquitas advantage in an email message sent june 14 1996 ralph ives deputy assistant us trade representative and the clinton administrations point man on the banana issue wrote about segment on the trade dispute that was being planned by public televisions news hour chiquita is urging that we either try to kill this preferable but not sure how or either peter allgeier trade office staffer or i agree to be interviewedi will find out more after talking with chiquita the segment never ran producers at the news hour told the enquirer that they did some initial reporting on the subject but never planned to air segment on the dispute mr lindner held at least two meetings with highlevel staff of the white house in addition chiquitas lobbyist ms gleason had frequent contact with the office in one letter dated july 19 1995 mr lindner and his keith wrote to mickey kantor that they hoped to meet soon to discuss our larger case strategy and to discuss our mutual efforts in greater detail they had meetings before and after the letter senators including mr glenn also met with mr kantor on chiquitas behalf taperecorded internal chiquita voicemails provided to the enquirer by company source also show the influence that chiquita has with the white houses trade office in jan 30 message from keith lindner chiquitas vice chairman to steven g warshaw company president and chief operating officer robert olson chief counsel ms gleason and others mr lindner recommended that chiquita try to cancel the trip of panamanian foreign minister ricardo alberto arias to the european union about the eu tour that this minister in panama wants to take is just highly dangerous keith lindner said adding later and i was saying that we should if we could politely do it without ruffling too many feathers get that ministers trip canceled so that would be exactly my program later that day ms gleason called mr olson and others with voicemail message stating the trip had indeed been canceled chiquita consultant met with the panamanian minister and convinced him that the us trade office could not meet with him on monday but only later in the week she said the later meeting meant the minister would not have time to travel to the eu ms gleason then learned that the us trade office had scheduled meeting for monday ustr the trade office went ahead and scheduled meeting on monday she said that has since been corrected the trade office moved the meeting with mr arias from monday to wednesday meaning the minister would not have time to visit europe according to ms gleasons voicemail message in statement issued through its attorneys chiquita stated chiquita never asked the united states trade representative to reschedule meetings with the panamanian foreign minister minister counselor fernando eleta at the panamanian embassy in washington dc said he could not believe chiquita would do something like that he said he would withhold comment however until he had chance to review the enquirer article today chiquita plays major role in formulating us banana trade policy at the uns food and agriculture organization fao banana conference in rome last may the us delegation consisted of three us trade diplomats and four other people listed as advisers the advisers were michael obrien president of european offices of chiquita manuel rodriguez chiquitas assistant general counsel from cincinnati ms gleason and robert moore the head of banana trade group that represents the entire industry one from monte or dole was represented on the us delegation according to the head of the faos intergovernmental group on bananas delegation advisers are chosen by the individual governments through ms gleason partner in the law firm of mcdermott will emery chiquita presents its views in meetings and telephone calls with amy wynton chief of agriculture for the state department and other top clinton officials the chiquitastate department connection extends even further when an enquirer reporter called the us embassy in honduras to ask about former embassy staffer now working for chiquita embassy staff said they could not provide the information according to an internal taperecorded voicemail message obtained by the enquirer from company source embassy staff informed chiquita of the call later that same day washington favors opponents of chiquitas actions in washington dc say chiquita has bought white house support for cause that will hurt us allies only to help the bottom line of the cincinnati company its clear issue of buying trade favors said randall robinson the head of transafrica forum washington dcbased lobbying group for african and developing world issues the president ought to be ashamed of himself mr robinson initially supporter of president clinton and his wife hazel rossrobinson have taken up the trade issue because they feel that if chiquita can remove europes banana protections developing economies in the caribbean and africa will be severely damaged ms rossrobinson who lobbies for caribbean countries in washington dc has organized visits by several political leaders to the caribbean islands to meet with farmers and has brought farmers from the caribbean and africa to lobby congress mr robinson the leader of the successful boycott effort of apartheid south africa in the 1980s has twice dumped bananas as protest in washington dc to call attention to what he sees as the white house sellout at his urging prominent black americans including bill cosby and jesse jackson have written the white house to express concern about the clinton administrations support for chiquitas position mr robinson and other chiquita opponents point to april 1994 when mr lindner and his associates contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to numerous state democratic parties shortly after then us trade representative kantor took the banana case to the wto the money was donated to state parties and did not have to be filed with the federal election commission fec making it harder to track because the donations were spread among many offices caribbean leaders saw the connection as payback by president clinton to mr lindner there was reason for them to go to the wto said jamaican ambassador to washington dc richard bernal we were given assurances by ambassador kantor that the us wanted to resolve this it was breach of faith with the caribbean recently the council on hemispheric affairs nonprofit research institute focusing on latin american issues called on the federal election commission to investigate mr lindners donations because they said mr lindner has bought himself us foreign policy according to common cause analysis of soft money donations mr lindner relatives and officers of his companies gave total of 3164460 in soft money donations to republican and democratic national fundraising committees from 1988 through the first six months of 1997 most of the money went to republicans soft money donations can be given in an unlimited amount to political committees contributions to individual candidates for national office are restricted in march 1998 common cause ranked american financial group and related companies as the fourth largest giver in soft money to both parties in 1997 tobacco firm philip morris was the top giver the group reported that american financial its subsidiaries and executives gave 310000 in soft money to republicans and 75000 to democrats in 1997 alone soft money donations are legal but they have become the focal point in the debate about campaign finance reform ms mcbride said mr lindner was one of the biggest soft money givers and one of the pioneers in double giving mr lindners donations have favored republican candidates but he also has given millions to democrats and stayed in the lincoln bedroom twice at the invitation of president clinton mr lindner was called by vice president gore in october 1994 while the white house was considering diplomatic action against the european union on the trade issue white house records reviewed by the associated press show that in the following weeks lindner companies and associates donated 250000 to the democratic national committee dec 2 1994 white house memo referred to the october calls made by the vice president from the white house mr lindner one of the persons named in the memo was listed as giving 150000 apparently part of the 250000 according to the associated press another memo indicates that mr lindner invited vice president gore to stay at his florida estate according to the white house mr gore did not take mr lindner up on his offer mr lindners and chiquitas reach in washington dc goes beyond campaign contributions chiquita also has hired the influential lobbying group public strategies washington inc paying it 27940208 in 1996 alone carl lindner and chiquita are giving hundreds of thousands of dollars to both democrats and republicans and are getting people to support them said courtenay rattray executive director of the jamaican banana exporting company jamco this is just money politics but as mr lindners supporters have pointed out in the past mr lindner was involved in money politics long before the banana trade issue in europe he was major contributor to richard nixon he contributed heavily to ronald reagans candidacy and helped fund both of his inaugurations he also gave heavily to george bushs 1988 and 1992 campaigns the center for public integrity public interest group stated in report that mr lindner was one of the major career patrons of sen bob dole mr lindner and chiquita officials heavily supported mr doles 1996 presidential bid mr dole was also frequent passenger on mr lindners private jet despite recent calls for campaign finance reform mr lindner still makes large contributions according to fec reports on 1996 election cycle donations mr lindner and other leading chiquita and subsidiary officials gave to the congressional and senate campaigns in at least 35 states they also gave soft money contributions to political committees on both sides of the aisle the bulk of the donations were given to republican candidates but substantial funds went to democratic softmoney organizations for example mr lindner himself gave money to the national republican senatorial committee and also to the democratic senatorial campaign committee the clinton gore campaign the democratic national committee the dnc services corporation and other soft money groups also received hundreds of thousands of dollars from mr lindner his family and officials of his companies according to fec records stored on the computers of nonpartisan public interest group the center for responsive politics for the 19971998 election cycle fec records show that as of april 1 mr lindners american financial group has given 150000 in soft money to various committees making the company the largest soft money contributor in ohio the second largest soft money contributor in the state is mr lindner himself with 125000 in donations mr lindner his relatives and company officials also have given thousands to various candidates and political action committees candidates receiving money so far in the 199798 election cycle include mr dewine sen alphonse damato rnew york rep rob portman rohio rep steve chabot rohio and rep john boehner r ohio gary ruskin who runs the congressional accountability project washington dcbased interest group that tracks financial contributions in congress said that he sees mr lindners name repeatedly when reviewing campaign finance filings the guy is fascinating he said he shows up all the time mr lindners name often comes up in capitol hill discussions about campaign finance reform the senate governmental affairs committee planning hearings on campaign finance reform issued subpoenas to mr lindner and chiquita for documents regarding campaign contributions last august but the hearings were dropped in november when chairman sen fred thompson rtenn announced that his committee would not pursue the issue citing lack of cooperation from other politicians and lobbyists the majority of sen thompsons committee had firsthand knowledge of mr lindners political giving both mr thompson and mr glenn the ranking democrat had received direct contributions from mr lindner so had five of the other 10 committee members the world trade organization the world trade organization was created in january 1995 to implement the goals set out in several world trade agreements particularly the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt the objective of gatt is to reduce trade barriers among countries that have signed the accord so that eventually nations can trade as freely as possible the united states the european nations and most of the major industrial economies of the world are members of gatt one of the key functions of the wto headquartered in geneva switzerland is to resolve trade disputes between nations nation that feels another gatt member is not trading fairly can ask for special wto panel to investigate and resolve the matter only nations can bring this request to the wto so chiquita had to enlist the help of the united states and several latin american governments to present its case against the european unions banana trade restrictions copyright 1998 chiquita secrets revealed politics history if chiquita come in we are way they will do us in we dont know who to believe anymore and we dont know the future humbert nicholson small banana farmer in grande rivere st lucia island economies on the line publication cincinnati enquirer date may 3 1998 by cameron mcwhirter and mike gallagher chiquitas efforts to end european trade protections for bananas grown in the carribean could devastate string of tiny island nations whose economies depend on small independent farmers who know nothing else we afraid but we are still planting bananas because that is all we know said nicholas espirit 42 who farms four acres in the north island village of bells we scared about this chiquita business its pressure man its pressure mr espirit worries about how to feed his five children if the banana business the vast bulk of the regions exports goes bust that scenario could happen if chiquita gets its way in world trade dispute with the european union eu currently several developing nations including the tiny caribbean islands of dominica st lucia and st vincent receive preferences for their bananas because they were former colonies of europe since 1993 the european union has imposed an elaborate importing system that granted preferences to former colonies that export bananas while limiting access to the european market for banana exporters with large operations in central and south america chiquita backed by the clinton administration wants to end those protections both chiquita and the clinton administration which has formally taken chiquitas objections to the trade dispute panel of the world trade organization wto have stated repeatedly that their argument is with the europeans not the caribbean but farmers on these islands are convinced that if chiquita gains larger share of the highly profitable european market their tiny economies will be crushed through its attorneys chiquita issued statement that the banana regime set up by the european union benefitted mainly european banana distributors rather than caribbean or african nations removing the european protections wont just hurt these small islands it would have severe impact on at least 10 independent nations and european territories from the caribbean to africa combined population of almost 35 million the island nations of the eastern caribbeandominica st lucia and st vincent would be among the hardest hit if the wtos ruling stands and the system is dismantled im not very emotional man peter carbon dominicas minister of agriculture and environment told the enquirer but if we lose bananas there will be country the islands provide only small percentage of bananas to europes protected market at most 3 percent annually all the countries and territories that receive the protections account for only about 15 percent of all the bananas that go to europe according to the eu if chiquita were to grab this market share the european consumer probably would notice little change at the local grocery but the business loss would have catastrophic implications for nations like dominica st lucia and st vincent the worst case scenario is you have increased poverty increased hunger educational opportunities for children declining said lawrence grossman an expert on the eastern caribbean banana industry and an associate professor at virginia tech what chiquita will gain compared to what will be lost in the caribbean well it truly creates tragic situation bananas bananas were introduced to the eastern caribbean by the british at the turn of the century the crop did extremely well on the mountainous humid islands for the first time farmers had large export crop that would grow easily on the hillsides banana plants could not survive hurricane but they would grow back after only nine months or so for small farmers bananas have become perfect crop because they can be farmed yearround today the government of dominica estimates that at least 20000 people out of workforce of 35000 depend on the banana or fig as it is known in the patois of that part of the world the estimates on st lucia and st vincent are considered about as high while bananas help the regions economy poverty still reigns the per capita gross domestic product on dominica is estimated at about 2100 less than onetenth the almost 25000 per capita gross domestic product of the united states signs of poverty are visible everywhere on these islands from the open sewers in the capital to the shack homes of villages however internal chiquita documents obtained by the enquirer show that the company has made major political efforts in the islands since 1994 that year the company sent representatives to st lucia to make the offer of joint venture with local growers under the deal chiquita would have become the exclusive european distributor of these islands bananas chiquita hired g philip hughes former ambassador to the islands under the bush administration to meet with government and banana industry officials in the eastern caribbean according to company records his mission was to persuade them to create joint venture with chiquita and transfer the islands special banana export licenses to chiquita those licenses allow growers to ship certain number of bananas duty free to europe mr hughes said he was hired by chiquita as consultant for about nine months i knew the leaders in the governments intimately and i knew the issues that they confronted economically said mr hughes who currently is an executive for the association for international practical training based outside washington dc chiquita had lot to gain from the venture as it listed in one of its executive summaries on the issue it would get the islands european banana trade licenses allowing chiquita to send up to 25 million more tons of bananas to the lucrative european market it would save money in shipping and in sending bananas to southern europe while shipping its latin american bananas to the wealthier markets of northern europe in its documents sent to island officials chiquita stressed that it would provide the islands with technical support offer slightly more for bananas and other benefits mr hughes the former ambassador had reconnaissance meetings with government officials in the eastern caribbean as well as washington and new york but despite lobbying efforts by mr hughes officials on st lucia and other islands turned down chiquitas offer chiquita was offering terrific deal mr hughes said but they had one problem the mindset of the caribbean leaders the leaders really had negative mindset about chiquita they really considered it almost their enemy when the island governments rejected the offer chiquitas agents went to the growers associations and in some cases to the farmers themselves the banana growers associations refused the offers because they didnt trust chiquitas intentions according to rupert gajadhar chairman of the st lucia banana growers association mr gajadhar said the offer from chiquita agents was attractive to some farmers and caused split in the farmers movement tensions between some farmers and the government led to violence strikes and riots in 1993 two farmers were shot and killed and another 25 were wounded when police opened fire on roadblock set up by the banana salvation committee grassroots group of banana farmers mr gajadhar said he believed the salvation committee today is supported by chiquita and that the groups leader patrick joseph meets regularly with chiquita officials mr joseph newly elected senator for the labour party told the enquirer that he has met many times with chiquita but denied the company was funding his operation i always maintain that if chiquita had given money and it means that it would help the cause that i am fighting i would accept the money he said but so far they havent offered money neither am i asking them for any mr joseph said he and his supporters see the caribbean banana industry as lost cause chiquita will destroy west indian banana production because it can grow bananas cheaper in central america he said the government should focus its energies on helping banana farmers find some other work we do live in capitalist society and in capitalism the strong eat up the weak basically thats what it is about he said mr hughes said the company was simply trying to obtain island licenses so it could sell more bananas under the banana protection scheme created by the european union but many banana farm leaders on st lucia see chiquita as sinister force out to crush west indian banana growers for the sake of profit elias john president of the st lucian national farmers association said farmers initially thought the chiquita agents simply wanted to buy their bananas but then farmers began to believe chiquita wanted to get control of the islands banana import licenses to europe when we begin to get the truth things were coming out about the amount that they used for the american presidential campaign and all that we lost our faith and began to realize they were just after us to destroy us he said gripping rusty cutlass while propping himself next to banana plant farmer humbert nicholson surveyed his 15acre hillside farm in grande rivere st lucia if chiquita come in we are way said the 53yearold farmer they will do us in standing in worn rubber boots caked with mud wearing grimy pants and shirt so old the armpits have worn out mr nicholson is typical eastern caribbean banana farmer hard working and poor we dont know who to believe anymore mr nicholson said and we dont know the future decision could devastate islands if the caribbean banana industry collapses the problem also could hit the united states in powerful way dramatic increase in illegal drugs coming through the region at the end of the day when you have destroyed the economies of the islands and other countries what is the fallback position crime drugs mass migration insecurity of property said grayson stedman 56 the owner of dominican banana plantation and former chief financial officer of local banana farmers cooperative this view isnt just being espoused by citizens of the caribbean in 1996 us gen john sheehan commander of the us atlantic command responsible for drug interdiction efforts in the caribbean told washington dc policy forum that the caribbean banana industry must be maintained for us interests if you start deteriorating the economic infrastructure in the region it is going to become my problem he told the group the caribbean islands are strategically located along key drug shipment points from colombia drug enforcement agency officials report that colombia supplies most of the cocaine and much of the marijuana for the us illegal drug market desperate farmers with empty fields and hungry children could make eager recruits for the drug cartels officials say caribbean islands worry about enonomic future farms the economies of the windward islands in the eastern caribbean have been dependent on bananas for much of this century if european union banana protections opposed by chiquita are overturned the islands expect their already weak economies to collapse below are two islands that will be hit the hardest dominica population 83000 size 290 square miles top

enquirer date may 3 1998 by cameron mcwhirter and mike gallagher the busy produce section of the gb supermarket in evere middle class neighborhood in brussels holds the key to understanding the bitter dispute between chiquita and the 15nation european union eu chiquita alone among americas giant banana companies has waged an international fiveyear campaign to overturn the eus banana trade restrictions the restrictions are complex system of tariffs and quotas that place limits on how many central american bananas can be brought into western europe the reason for the campaign is simple the amount of profit that chiquita realizes for its bananas is greater in europe than anywhere else in the world and chiquita dominates the european market in the evere gb typical store in the european unions capital chiquita bananas sold for 89 belgian francs per kilogram on april 24 or about 110 pound the average american price is about 50 cents pound some us stores sell bananas as low as 19 cents pound next to the chiquita bananas sit the gb brand bananas selling for 20 francs less or about 85 cents pound shoppers from elderly pensioners to teenagers overwhelmingly reach for chiquita despite the higher price chiquita sells well making up more than half of the 120000 to 150000 kilos sold every week by gb belgiums largest supermarket chain chiquita has dominated the european market for decades its brand recognition means the companys product commands high price from the 250 million consumers who live in the european union the quality is not better said johan vos gbs auditor responsible for purchasing bananas other bananas have the same quality its only the name only the namein belgium we can sell chiquita for high price europe accounted for majority of the companys net revenues in the 1980s although major setbacks in the past five years have sharply reduced profits the continent still generates more net revenue for chiquita than any other market at the beginning of this decade chiquita had hoped to turn europe into an even greater financial engine by selling even more of its relatively expensive bananas there the eu was consolidating its trade policies and eastern europe was opening its markets after the fall of communism as the leading banana exporter to continent with almost twice as many consumers as the united states chiquita was brimming with optimism the company had seen sustained profits and growth ever since cincinnati financier carl lindner took complete control in 1984 in great part due to growth of sales in europe wall street expected expanded operations there would swell chiquitas profits even further our leadership in the european marketplace enables us to continue our growth in the highpotential markets of eastern europe and to benefit from the transition to single market economy in the european community mr lindner and his keith then president and chief operating officer wrote to stockholders in the companys 1991 annual report but far from the predicted bonanza the 1990s have been financial disaster for the company chiquita blames losses as far back as 1992 on the eus banana trade protections first drafted that year and implemented in july 1993 the protections have blocked chiquita from importing as many bananas as it wants into europe from central america the eu also has placed tariffs on the bananas that chiquita does bring in the company claims to have lost more than 355 million since 1992 most of it as direct result of the banana protections according to chiquita annual reports and the us trade representatives office which has argued the companys cause since 1994 the issue led the clinton administration to take chiquitas case to the world trade organization wto an international trade court in geneva which last year ordered europe to alter its system but others including former highranking chiquita officials say chiquitas losses also are due to errant business decisions and poor planning by company officials still others argue that chiquita which has hired lobbyists and lawyers on both sides of the atlantic to fight the european protections may have won pyrrhic victories in court rulings that will do little to help its bottom line in the near future sinking in the 90s in 1992 chiquita reported losses of 2217 million number that shocked wall street and sent chiquita stock plummeting from the high forties into the teens the company claimed that increased competition prior to the new protections led to much of that loss in 1993 it reported losses of 518 million and in 1994 843 million the companys stock continued to skid in 1995 the company turned profit of 279 million mostly through selling assets and laying off workers according to its own reports filed with

profit this year was 411 million down 22 million from the previous year chiquitas stock closed friday at 1425 per share the stock is trading roughly for what it was worth in 1987 while the overall stock market has seen one of the largest growth periods in its history analysts have little good to say about the companys performance you tend to crawl before you walk and you tend to walk before you run said john mcmillan industry analyst for prudential investments in new york theres doubt that chiquita is still in hospital bed tim ramey industry analyst for deutsche morgan greenfell in new york and long critic of chiquita told the enquirer recently that chiquita has been disaster of managementthey have an amazing ability to shoot themselves in the foot one argues that chiquita has been losing lots of money what they argue about is how the company has been losing it chiquita traces its problems to the creation of the european union banana protections the eu council of ministers the main law making body of the eu ended years of internal debate in 1993 by reaching compromise on how the eu would collectively import bananas some countries in the eu advocated free trade of bananas other countries advocated system to protect banana trade for developing countries that were former colonies these nations were dependent on the banana trade for economic survival but could not produce bananas that successfully competed with production from larger corporate farms in latin america prior to the eu policy many individual countries had provided these protections for their former colonies the two sides battled to compromise regulation 404 as it was called guaranteed certain section of the european market was reserved for these poorer nations mostly in the caribbean and africa under the system central and south american countries where chiquita grew most of its bananas had heavier tariffs imposed on all their bananas and limit to how much they could import to europe the system also created complex array of import licenses that favored european importers an important provision was that these protections would last for 10 years and then an open market on bananas would go into effect throughout the eu the changes still left chiquita as europes largest banana importer but it restricted the amount that the company imported and imposed higher tariffs on bananas that it brought in from latin america chiquita issued statements through its attorneys that the eu banana import regime challenged by chiquita is illegal and an unfair trade practice chiquita was right to oppose it poor business decisions opponents of chiquita on the trade issue politicians and former chiquita employees argue that chiquita made unsound business decisions and now it wants developing world banana growers to pay for them by cutting out european protections they point to the huge capital investments that chiquita made in the early 1990s in anticipation of an eastern european banana boom that never happened in 1990 the company reported to the sec that it had longterm debt of 4941 million in 1991 the figure jumped to 123 billion an increase of more than 135 percent in one year the next year it climbed to 141 billion since then the companys longterm debt has remained more than 1 billion for 1997 the company reported its longterm debt at approximately 11 billion much of this money was used to buy and lease ships and expand plantations in central america in anticipation of huge growth in european sales according to clyde stephens who retired as chief of chiquitas banana research division in 1991 after working for the company for decades i thought this was crazy mr stephens said but i was ordered from the top to go along with itand they went ahead and just spent untold millions of dollars in expansion pretty soon the whole damn thing blew up on them now to this day they are stuck with lot of these properties they bought that they never should have bought they invested heavily in ships because they said hey were going to europe and were going to break that european market wide open and were going to eastern europe those bankrupt countries are going to be in the money and the soviet union it was gross mistake and theyre paying for those mistakes right now he added eastern europe has opened up to banana imports with sales moderately increasing according to the food and agriculture organization but many eastern european consumers dont have enough money to afford bananas as steady part of their diet the belief that chiquita caused its own financial problems is also widely held by banana producers in the former colonies these competitors say they stand to lose their market share if the banana regulations are overturned chiquita has made some errors when the common market was created said mbarga atangana european representative of the association of cameroon banana producers they want now that all the growers in the acp africancaribbeanpacific countries pay for their mistakes economic studies done europe show that chiquita made mistakes in not preparing for the creation of the european protection system while other american companies did dole by strategically purchasing banana plantations in eu protected countries like cameroon has been able to acquire chunks of chiquitas market share 1995 report by auditors arthur d little who were hired by supporters of the european banana restrictions said that chiquitas market share in europe had dropped from 25 percent in 1991 to 185 percent almost all of that decrease had been lost to dole since the new banana restrictions chiquita has bought some plantations in the ivory coast and other places where banana imports have low tariffs to europe chiquita did not provide specific numbers on its european market share the eu has severely attacked and cut into chiquitas market position there is doubt about it whereas dole was very pragmatic said jeroen douglas project officer for bananas for solidaridad dutch christian group that aids development in poorer countries dole chiquitas largest competitor refused to comment for this series but analysts like mr ramey of deutsche morgan grenfell point to doles relative success in the stock market in recent years with profits up as of april 21 doles stock was trading at more than 45 per share accounting for stock split in 1995 the stock has increased more than 77 percent since 1990 according to bloomberg news meanwhile chiquita stock was trading at about 14 per share on april 21 at the close of 1990 the stock was trading at 32 per share decrease in value of 5625 percent according to bloomberg news chiquita has not had stocksplit since 1988 dole has said we cant do whole lot to fix the political solution mr ramey said instead they said lets just adapt to the situationmeanwhile chiquita continues to stagnate while they are fixated on this wto world trade organization decision chiquita fights chiquita was the only major banana producer to fight against the eu banana restrictions and it has fought fiercely marshaling top lobbyists in brussels washington dc and elsewhere it has hired top lawyers in washington dc to petition the clinton administration and congress to fight the eu protections meanwhile coalition of european human rights activists small importers and others have banned together to counter chiquitas efforts since 1994 the white house has been strong supporter of chiquitas position successfully arguing its points at the world trade organization wto in 1996 the white house won wto ruling and the eus appeal of that ruling ordering the eu to change its system to be less restrictive the white house position is simple at this point europe has to change the system ralph ives deputy assistant us trade representative and the clinton administrations point man on the banana issue said the administration doesnt care whether the changes help chiquita or not just as long as they are consistent with principles of international free trade our line for the last four years has been we just want the eu to adopt system that is consistent with the international rules of trade he said so we havent been wedded to any particular systemthis is hurting latin america its hurting growth in bananas its hurting our companies so just abide by the rules politics and money but chiquitas competitors think the clinton administrations aggressive pursuit of this issue is direct result of mr lindners healthy contributions to the democratic party tim cuniff montes director of marketing for north america said chiquita is trying to cover its own financial mistakes by blaming it on the european restrictions lindner paid ton of money supporting presidential campaigns and he thought that he was going to get some type of favors he said now hes got to start calling in some marks to show that he was doing right by his shareholders european supporters of the banana protections also see political contributions as the driving force behind the white house efforts the government of the united states has itself invested lot of time people and money to this conflict when there is domestic export to the european union so this is from our point of view little bit strange said alvaro gonzalez cossio brussels delegate for asprocan the association for banana plantations on the canary islands you can see that the lobbyists there have worked very well for the big company for chiquita changes coming politics aside the eu must change its system or face severe trade sanctions under the wto ruling the eu has stated that it plans to change the system but just how it will comply is uncertain mr gonzalez of asprocan said that if the eu proposes changes that his farmers dont like the organization will work to block ratification in the european council under the current representation spain portugal france and the united kingdom would have blocking minority in the council it doesnt matter if the council has done something that makes the americans and chiquita very happy he said if we dont like it there will be major political problem banana trade experts say the contentious nature of the dispute means that chiquita is unlikely to prevail anytime soon if ever phillippe binard delegate general of the european community banana trade association an organization that represents chiquita and other large producers as well as smaller banana producers said chiquitas victories at the wto may mean little to chiquitas bottom line these political battles will go on for the next two or three years he said but its not surprising the system has been seriously challenged from the very beginning but it has not stopped us from operating within the limits that have been put on us from the beginningthe banana protection regime will not disappear this is for sure in january the eu council announced proposal that kept its system intact but altered the way its licenses were given out mr ives at the white house said the clinton administration was not satisfied with the eu proposal and would continue to fight for full compliance before the wto it would be very naive to assume that the wto decision will be meaningful help to anybody in the near to medium term said mr ramey at cj lawrence it the wtoeu negotiation is going to be marathon footdragging what is the european union the european union is group of 15 nations most of them in western europe committed to political economic and monetary union in coming years more countries are expected to join the goal is to become united states of europe with trade barriers or economic restrictions between the member states after world war ii countries in europe began to talk about reducing political and economic barriers to reduce the chances of another world war in 1992 the nations involved then only 12 countries signed the maastricht treaty which recognized the formal union with government headquartered in brussels it also committed the member states to full economic integration with single currency by 1999 the fifteen members states are france germany the united kingdom italy spain sweden finland denmark the netherlands belgium austria portugal ireland greece and luxembourg the eu government operates through executive commission with rotating president and council whose members are appointed by the states as well as european parliament whose members are elected directly by the people of europe while the goal of the eu is unity the process of getting to that unity has often been divisive with individual countries balking at certain policies such was the case with the current banana trade policy value of chiquita stock yearend close and close on friday may 1 1998 chart

reyes santos rosalio argueta and raul antonio gutierrez iris gisela flores discua lawyer who represents tela and also the four company guards has argued in court filings that the guards fired in selfdefense against people who shot at them but reports by police investigators state the guards had shot up their own truck in an apparent attempt to make it look like they were attacked also police found evidence to show the victims were armed police ballistics also showed that one of the guns used by the security guards in the shooting was an ak47 assault rifle weapon that under honduran law may be used only by military personnel police report filed with the court reads in translation that with the reconstruction that was made it is established that the people driving the car saw the offended from the beginning and therefore could prevent the criminal act from happening it has been proven by the judgment from ballistics that all six empty cartridges found in the place where the situation happened match the ak47 rifle confiscated from the san alejos security chief chiquita officials refused to be interviewed for this series and directed all questions to outside attorneys in statement issued through its attorneys chiquita distanced itself from the shooting that it described as tragic event of the utmost seriousness the security guards involved in the august 16 1996 shooting at san alejo were under the direction and supervision of joint venture company managed by chiquitas joint venture partner not tela railroad company or chiquitathe security guards involved in the shooting were not employees of chiquita or tela railroad company the statement read the company also stated that immediately after the incident the joint venture dismissed the four security guards who were involved according to documents filed with the court by ms flores discua all four men were fired four days after the shooting not because of the murder of mr castro but as the signed letter stamped tela railroad company states they did not show up to work and their whereabouts are unknown translation from spanish they did not show up to work because they were in jail where they remain to this day according to the countrys main human rights organization comite defensa derechos humanos honduras codeh court records filed by tela and obtained by the enquirer state that the guards involved were employees of the palm operations of the tela railroad company in document filed with the court 10 days after the shooting ms flores discua acting in my condition as legally appointed representative of the tela railroad company and the division of african palms san alejotranslation asked the court to charge three villagers josque moises castro diaz then dead lisandro antonio juarez coto shot in the back and cesar augosto juarez coto with attacking the guards first in the document the tela attorney identified the guards as security agents working for the company whom i represent translation she also filed documents with the court identifying herself as the defense attorney for the accused statement issued by chiquita to the enquirer made reference to the lawyer retained by tela for the case or the guards connections to tela the company statement maintained that it is unclear how the altercation developed or whether security personnel were acting in self defense court delays have kept the case from being tried and the guards remain in the central jail of ceiba in northern honduras according to codeh in the statement issued by chiquita through its attorneys the company stated that shots fired on aug 16 may have come from an automatic weapon the possession of which is prohibited by honduran law based on that investigation chiquita and its joint venture partner concluded that it was necessary to restructure the security operation of san alejo the company stated that the security operation has since been completely rebuilt with more than 10 people including the chief of security being dismissed the company stated it and its joint venture have since hired an outside security firm to assist leonel milla 22 hasnt seen much of the changes on the san alejo plantation in another shooting incident he reported to officials of codeh that his right foot was blown apart by security guards gun in the afternoon of april 2 1997 as he his cousin and two friends tried to pushstart their brokendown truck mr millas cousin and one friend were arrested and charged with stealing he said their charges were dropped after one night in jail and mr milla was never charged in the incident he said we had nothing and they still shot us mr milla said through translator they just ran out after us shouting stop you sons of bitches mr milla said he ran from the guards for simple reason fear plantation guards had already shot mr castro i didnt want to end up dead too he said since the shooting mr milla has to hobble wherever he goes tela never paid for any treatment or care or anything he said government doctors have told him that further operations might help him walk little better chiquita did not respond to enquirer questions about this specific incident other villagers in the 16 communities spread out amid the plantations said the harassment continues in september 1996 leaders from the various communities signed public letter complaining about san alejo security guards treatment of villagers and livestock adalid garcia 45 cattleman from the tiny village of citronella amid the plantation said security guards harass him and his cows and pigs he produced photographs of dead pigs he said one had been shot and one had been poisoned through its attorneys chiquita released statement that the plantation has problem with trespassing animals who can damage the palm plants by eating their roots the statement said that company security has detained animals on occasion in accordance with honduran law and sent farmers to the local court where the court not chiquita issues fine security personnel at san alejo have never impermissibly fined or arrested neighboring persons the statement read if however persons or livestock are trespassing or damaging san alejo property the security personnel have the right to detain them in further response chiquita stated through its attorneys that it was aware of an incident in which security guard shot bull owned by mr adalid garcia an exemployee as the bull charged at the guard the bull survived andres pavon murillo 34 regional coordinator for codeh said his group has received numerous complaints from citizens about mistreatment by the plantation security tela or its joint venture have done little to solve problems he said he said most of the disputes arise over control of the roads security has guard houses at the main entrances so people cannot leave or enter without their approval even though the miles of unpaved roads are publicly owned he said mr pavon took enquirer reporters to an open area on the plantation which he described in spanish as security training ground the area on san alejo palm land was littered with thousands of spent and discarded rifle shells including those fired from one or more automatic weapons codeh concluded spme of the shells probably were fired from ak47 assault rifle while it was not determined who fired the weapons ownership and firing of such weapons by anyone other than the honduran military is violation of honduran law through its attorneys chiquita stated that after the shooting of mr castro evidence suggested that the plantations chief of security had an automatic weapon his possession of the automatic weapon which had not been issued or purchased by his employer had been without the knowledge or permission of his employer or chiquita the statement read chiquita stated that the man was dismissed chiquita denial chiquita completely denies and rejects any assertion that it has ever committed any illegal or violent actions against any person in any country or that it has ever instructed others to do so chiquita attorney shooting at san alejo 1 in the early morning hours of aug 16 1996 three young villagers who lived

squalid camps and towns among the sweltering flatlands of banana territory workers interviewed by the enquirer said that in recent years working to produce chiquita bananas has meant less pay either in real money or because of inflation fewer benefits less union representation unenforced employment protections and little job security an enquirer investigation into chiquitas business practices found that in the late 1980s and early 1990s officials at the companys cincinnati headquarters formulated policies that diminished union influence on farms controlled by chiquita and created plans to limit workers wages and benefits these business practices include using computerized hiring logs in honduras that alert chiquita controlled farms when to rotate some workers at supposedly independent companies before they can receive statemandated salary and health benefits the companies are all in fact controlled by chiquita though the percentage of workers affected by this policy is unknown the rotations also create an unstable workforce on the plantations making union organization difficult according to amilcar castejon former administrator for the company that manages the farms firing union activists and suppressing union activity in honduras costa rica and guatemala in recent years complaints have been lodged by unions in those countries severe strikes over chiquita business practices have occurred in honduras guatemala and panama financing the solidarismo movement in costa rica the movement is workers association partially funded by chiquita and other multinational companies that supplants unions takes management on its boardwill not provide legal representation to protect dismissed workers and does not authorize workers to strike chiquita officials declined to comment for this story referring all questions to their attorneys in statement issued through its attorneys chiquita officials said that it treated all workers union or otherwise fairly and provided the workers and the regional economy with good jobs and other benefits we believe that our record of contributions to the quality of life in central america is unsurpassed by any corporation the company stated rotating workers under honduran law workers become permanent employees of company after six months entitling them to company benefits like 13th month of pay for every 12 months worked and severance if dismissed mr castejon who was records administrator for compania bananero ltd sa cobalisa company secretly controlled by chiquita said the workers are fired and then rehired shortly thereafter at another subsidiary farm of cobalisa this rotation of workers keeps benefits down but also creates permanent instability for the workers making it difficult to unionize he said the jobs are not permanent they are only for six months said mr castejon who said he spoke to the enquirer because he was angry at chiquitas policy how are they workers going to have anything to do with the unions if every six months they are changing over the personnel thats exactly why they are doing it to avoid the unions according to company executives who spoke to the enquirer on condition of anonymity chiquita and its subsidiaries save money in benefits every year by terminating honduran workers and flipping them from one secretly controlled chiquita farm to another once many of those workers get close to the six month deadline to become permanent we fire and then later flip them to our next farm said an official of the tela railroad co chiquitas main subsidiary in honduras who provided documents to the newspaper the main use of this policy in honduras is with farms under cobalisa which employ about 15000 workers workers are shunted from one farm to another in cobalisa to avoid payment of benefits according to mr castejon as well as sources within chiquita and tela the officials requested anonymity cobalisa has employed thousands of nonunion workers while chiquitas directlyowned farms have been cutting thousands of union jobs in recent years chiquita neither has fire or rehire policy nor does it engage in the mass firing of workers chiquita stated through its lawyers to the enquirer the countries where chiquita operates are heavily unionized or operate under analogous collective bargaining structures and as practical matter such policy or practice would not be tolerated by these associations or the constituent labor force however highlevel chiquita official has provided the enquirer with tape recordings of chiquita internal voicemail messages that discuss rotating workers on the cobalisa farms in an april 7 voicemail message to robert olson chiquitas general counsel and others chiquita attorney david hills stated cobalisa does have permanent staff corporate staff of employees but the workers that actually work on the banana farms are not employed by cobalisa instead they are employed on rotational basis by the underlying farm companies computerized printouts the enquirer obtained from highranking chiquita official list cobalisa subcompanies and workers the printouts all in spanish also list date of entrance date of termination and the parameter date time remaining before they reach the sixmonth period while many workers on the printout passed the sixmonth date others were being let go just prior to the six month period the enquirer could not determine the exact number of workers being rotated in statement issued through its attorneys chiquita did not address the issue of rotating its workers but said it did pay high salaries the statement said wage scales for chiquitas workers are substantially higher than those for other agricultural workers in central america chart showing chiquita wages in various central american nations is attached the chart dated oct 15 1997 listed minimum salaries by law in honduras panama and costa rica then listed chiquitas actual average salary in all cases the chart shows chiquita was paying substantially higher than the minimum wage however the chart did not detail salaries by job category or whether the employees were management or union the companys response also did not include any reference to workers on any of its secretly controlled banana farms throughout latin america including its cobalisa operations in honduras by not including in its salary chart the lower nonunion wages of its secretly controlled farms chiquitas average wage figures appear higher than they actually are while helping to prepare chiquitas response to the enquirer magnes welsh chiquitas director of communications in an oct 31 voicemail message asked an executive of the tela railroad co chiquitas main honduran subsidiary if telas financial figures included those of the secretly controlled farms does that number include cobalisa payroll cobalisa worker social security workers compensation that sort of thing she asked if it does we need to be able to subtract that number out besides many workers bringing home less money because they work on nonunion farms all workers in honduras have seen real loss in buying power through substantial inflation honduras one of the poorest nations in the western hemisphere has seen doubledigit inflation throughout the 1990s according to statistics from the honduran central bank in january the central bank reported inflation rate of 128 percent down from 253 percent in 1996 costa rica and panama also have experienced high inflation in statement issued through its attorneys chiquita said its main subsidiary in honduras the tela railroad co has good relations with its union sitraterco sindicato trabajadores tela railroad company through together is better program of mutual cooperation but officials of cosibah coordinadora sindicatos bananeros honduras an umbrella organization of banana unions that includes sitraterco told the enquirer that they didnt agree with chiquitas view they said the relationship has been combative much like relationships between unions and companies in the united states battles often have ended up in court in july 1994 after month of labor unrest following chiquitas announcement that it would close four farms and cut more than 800 jobs chiquita fired 58 union leaders several took severance packages but 43 filed suit claiming chiquita had unlawfully fired them for their union activism in 1996 honduran courts ruled that the firing was improper and ordered the company to rehire the 43 the court also ordered chiquito give workers back pay for their time off according to court records and press accounts the company did rehire the workers but few months later it fired all 43 citing economic reasons the group has sued again but the case remains unresolved in the courts in statement issued through its attorneys chiquita said tela has made efforts to improve relations with workers in recent years and the company encourages open communications between employees and management strikes and union complaints against chiquita and its subsidiaries also have occurred in recent years in guatemala costa rica and panama in guatemala recent labor disputes severely disrupted production at two farms under exclusive contracts to provide bananas to cobigua company secretly controlled by chiquita on feb 12 22 workers all members of union executive committee attempting to organize on the farms finca arizona and finca alabama were fired the unions alleged the firings were illegal and filed complaints with the courts because the company did not have court order to override an injunction against taking such action the us guatemala labor education project chicagobased group concerned with labor issues in guatemala has written letter of protest to chiquita but has received response the guatemalan embassy in washington dc issued statement this month that the ministry of labor is committed to continue mediating to bring the parties to an agreement through dialogue in statement issued through its attorneys chiquita said that it had connection to the farms and it is inappropriate for chiquita to comment as to the cause of any labor unrest at these farms in costa rica the banana workers union has several court cases against the company for alleged illegal firings of union activists in panama 4600 workers in the pacific coast division for chiquitas subsidiary the chiriqui land company have been on strike since february miguel angel tejada 52 one of the fired honduran union officials who is suing tela said he wished

employers through more informal discussions cooperative planning and implementation of employee job improvement recommendations more than 1000 companies and 150000 workers participate in solidarismo associations throughout costa rica according to solidarismo records critics of solidarismo including traditional labor unionists call the movement an attempt by big business to eliminate the strong unions in place in costa rica banana workers with ties to traditional unions said solidarismo chapters on chiquita farms often are controlled by the company since it helps fund the organization chiquita executives along with worker representatives jointly hold top positions in the movements local chapters soldiarismo officials said they get money from chiquita but denied they are beholden to the company those officials also say however they have authority to force chiquita to institute any corporate changes retain any employee or provide lawyers or financial assistance to chiquita employees who believe they have been wrongly fired or forced to resign solidarismo is nothing more than front for chiquita to control or eliminate workers who dare to speak out for better wages or working conditions said gilbert bermudez general secretary of sindicato trabajadores plantaciones agricolas and founder of coordinating committee of banana unions it can do nothing to protect the workers it has power only what chiquita allows it to do ms guerrero of barrio brooklyn said she paid dues to solidarismo while working for chiquita she said she doesnt think the organization will protect her she found that out when she was let go because she had rights union representation money to hire lawyer ms guerrero said she left her job now living in extreme poverty without an income ms

lax company security in colombia blamed for smuggling publication cincinnati enquirer date may 3 1998 by mike gallagher and cameron mcwhirter taking advantage of chiquitas lax security system colombian drug lords are using the companys ships to smuggle large amounts of cocaine into europe despite knowing of the problem chiquitas subsidiary officials have been reluctant to tighten security and inspections at the companys santa marta colombia shipping center where most of the smuggling originates highlevel chiquita sources told the enquirer that the company does not willingly or knowingly ship the illegal drugs asked about the drugs smuggled on chiquita vessels chiquita through its attorneys declined to discuss the specifics of its drug interdiction policies and procedures chiquita however solicited letter from the us customs service attesting to its cooperation chiquita is leader among commercial ocean carriers in cooperating with the us customs service regarding the prevention of drug smuggling on company operated vessels the letter said drug enforcement agents and customs officials in belgium and the united kingdom found total of more than ton of almost pure cocaine hidden in at least seven chiquita ships in 1997 according to european custom services and chiquita sources the seized cocaine is worth up to 33 million in its pure form and valued at more than 100 million if sold on the streets according to van quarles of the us drug enforcement agency in washington dc in internal communications company officials cite sloppy security and shiploading operations by chiquita employees in colombia as the main reasons that smugglers can get the drugs on board the ships the most recent drug seizure verified by the enquirer was made in belgium on the chiquita bremen on oct 31 when the ship reached europe more than 500 kilos of cocaine were discovered in the insulation of large container packed with boxes of fruit according to chiquita and belgiums custom service records the smugglers in colombia had peeled back half of the interior wall of the container removed the foam insulation replaced it with packets of cocaine and then resealed the wall according to belgian officials and chiquita records based on standard quantity purity price estimates of the us drug enforcement agency dea the cocaine found on the bremen had value of up to 18 million in its pure form and more than 50 million if sold on the streets in written statement issued through its lawyers chiquita told the enquirer that the security and smuggling concerns that chiquita faces in colombia are not unique to the company or even the banana industry however the drugs are being found on chiquita ships sailing to europe and not those of its bananashipping competitors according to nov 1 voicemail message sent to john ordman chiquitas senior vice president for finance from dale ploughman chiquita executive in antwerp responsible for company ship transportation issues lets see if we can tighten things up in colombia mr ploughman said it seems like drugs that are coming into europe are primarily on chiquita vessels rather than on other peoples vessels lets put it this way they have only been detected on chiquitas vessels and not on other peoples vessels but even so it does seem that we have high incidence of drug finds on our vessels spokesmen for the dea and customs agencies in belgium and united kingdom confirmed that seizures of illegal drugs there in 1997 were made on chiquita ships and not on those of its competitors such as monte dole or the irish company fyffes that also ship fruit from south and central america us customs service spokeswoman erlinda bird said check of seizure records reveals drugs have been found on chiquita vessels at us ports during the past three years ged coleridge chiquita official at the companys belgium office detailed the smuggling problem to mr ordman in nov 1 voicemail report theres been about seven drug finds on our ships in the course of this past year which amounts to total of at least about ton of cocaine mr coleridge said and customs is telling that it is only the chiquita ships its all exsanta marta and its only chiquita ships in his report mr coleridge then tells mr ordman about another large cocaine shipment found on the chiquita bremen after it arrived in england belgium custom agents picked up frenchman wandering around the port mr coleridge said in the voicemail he had container number in his pocket on piece of paper in his pocket they located this container it also had been sent to england and they advised the customs in england and and behold they found 21 kilos of cocaine in that container criticizing chiquitas security and fruitloading operations in colombia and comparing it to dole mr coleridge recommended increasing security at the companys colombian facility look at the installation that dole has in santa marta versus the chiquita operation in santa marta for containers dole is very well run and orchestrated operation where ours is somewhat of mismatch he said in the voicemail so whether or not that is something to think about i dont know its food for thought however mr coleridge said that company officials in colombia didnt want to make extra security checks chiquita colombia officials seemed to think at that stage it might be little bit too dangerous for our chaps to be doing that mr coleridge said they said they check them when they arrive here belgium chiquita lawyer who requested anonymity said he believed that if it became wellknown that we have this problem it could result in tighter scrutiny of our ships by foreign law enforcement officials which could cost us time money and customers we compete in global market with perishable product that has to get to market quickly or our competitors take our customers its that simple ship route of chiquita bremen drug lords hid cocaine in banana containers aboard chiquita bremen in santa marta colombia which then sailed to antwerp and the united kingdom where drug finds where made in each port copyright 1998 chiquita secrets revealed violence drugs mr stalinski and his

guatemala carlos ermelindo veliz tobar secretary of agreements for the workers union at plantation called chinook was shot to death in broad daylight by two men who drove onto the nearby kickapoo plantation the men then drove off and escaped arrests have been made police in guatemala continue their investigation both chinook and kickapoo farms are controlled by company called cobigua and sell bananas exclusively to chiquita through its attorneys chiquita declined to define its relationship with cobigua citing competitive reasons however documents provided to the enquirer by chiquita sources show that cobigua in fact is controlled by chiquita chiquita issued statement through its attorneys that the company had knowledge of or any involvement in the shooting of mr veliz the countrys presidential human rights committee copredeh also investigated the murder and issued report quoting union official that the case was not an act of violence against the union movement and was probably the result of personal problems but the banana workers union union sindical trabajadores guatemala unistragua has issued formal statement labeling mr velizs death an assassination translation and demanding the government find his killers the union also attacked the copredeh report and stated that the murder was not personal matter but instead an attempt to quell union activity the union noted that cobiguas security force has strict control over all vehicles entering and leaving the plantations however the killers drove onto the plantation repeatedly shot mr veliz and then drove away with cobigua security guard recording the arrival or departure of the vehicle according to the union statement usbased human rights group with offices in guatemala also has investigated the killing the group sent representatives to interview workers on the farm the us guatemala labor education project chicagobased nonprofit group supporting workers rights in guatemala concluded that facts of the killing make it appear anti union in nature according to robert perillo the groups representative in guatemala on nov 4 1994 stephen coats executive director of the project wrote to carl lindner chiquitas chief executive officer asking him to inquire into the shooting one of the disturbing aspects of this case is that security guards failed to record in their log the arrival or departure of the vehicle suggesting possible collusion between plantation personnel and the killers he wrote mr coats went on to state that he hoped chiquita officials would tell the owners of the chinook farm to improve security since other workers said they had received death threats mr coats did not know that chinook was controlled by chiquita through cobigua but he did know the farm sold its bananas exclusively to chiquita given the element of danger and fear involved we would appreciate your response to our request as soon as possible mr coats wrote chiquita never responded according to mr coats

mcwhirter and mike gallagher nothing remains of tacamiche but few concrete foundations one lives here any more but lizards and crows the churches are gone the homes of the banana workers are gone even the streets are overgrown with tall grass after six decades as community among chiquitas banana fields in northeastern honduras the village was plowed under in february 1996 by about 500 honduran soldiers former residents have not forgotten their village nor have they forgiven chiquita and its subsidiary for the fact that soldiers with bayonets and bulldozers forcibly evicted more than 600 people before wiping tacamiche off the map villagers had been told to leave when they refused chiquitas subsidiary tela railroad co obtained courtorder to evict them when they still refused to leave tela brought in the army tela announced in 1992 it planned to close the tacamiche plantation because it was longer suitable for banana production companywide strike forestalled the closure in 1994 tela once again announced it was closing the tacamiche farm claiming the plantations land was bad the company stated it had to close the farm plus three others all located in honduras sula valley and sell off the land the company said it would evict the villagers from those farms tela officials claims that the tacamiche land was longer conducive to the cultivation of bananas in the quantity and quality required by tela and chiquita for the world market were based on internal tela soil tests according to chiquita officials in written response to the enquirer but the enquirer has obtained 1989 chiquita legal document outlining plan to close companyowned farms in honduras to eliminate costly unions while the document does not name the farms to be closed it does refer to specific group of farms in the honduran division at the time almost all of chiquitas banana plantations in honduras including tacamiche were located in the sula valley the enquirer also has learned that chiquita has leased the tacamiche land with an intent to sell it to trusted former employee who continues to grow bananas on the land when asked about the leasing chiquita in statement issued through its attorneys stated that the former employee henry murray is using farming method called croptiming planting bananas so they can be picked and sold when the market is at premium mr murray sells his bananas exclusively to chiquita chiquita stated that croptiming can be profitable on small scale but it has not been demonstrated to be successful over the long term and is not suitable for large scale producer like tela to clear the way for the leasing and future purchase of the land chiquita and tela insisted on the removal of tacamiche village despite the impact on its inhabitants whom the company referred to as squatters tacamiche village was destroyed but three other villages were not all the four tela farms were closed chiquita left us without any past said john sevilla connoley 43 lifelong resident of tacamiche and the former villages schoolteacher they erased all evidence of our childhood in august 1997 mr sevilla connoley visited his former village for the first time since the eviction this is the street where i lived these roads i walked them as child looking for firewood i know them like i know my heart speaking through translator mr sevilla connoley said the eviction ripped him away from his roots the village had been created by chiquita then called the united fruit co in the 1930s to house workers for its farms the company acquired the land in 1936 for 1 from the honduran government as part of larger land deal until tacamiche was destroyed the majority of the villagers continued to work for chiquita in the fields and many had lived in the village most of their lives several other villages also were set for demolition but tacamiche was the first to go after getting final court order for eviction chiquita asked honduran military police to remove the 123 families in 1996 the decimation of the village on chiquitas orders was hot political issue in honduras and was condemned by human rights groups around the world chiquita has responded that the tacamiche closing was regrettable but unavoidable decision based on hard economic reality the land was good but an april 12 1989 legal memorandum by manuel rodriguez chiquita lawyer detailed plan to close honduran farms in order to reduce labor costs the memo deals with farm closures in the companys honduran division but does not mention any farm by name under section titled labor issues mr rodriguez states only feasible grounds for termination of employees is liquidation or permanent closing of company or establishment mr rodriguez also stated chiquita subsidiary tela should seek honduran government approval for sale and immediately thereafter sever the workers should be simultaneously as possible though for legal reasons closing of farms must be completed first tela has never implemented closing of farms and termination of workers in the size and nature of this proposed project the memo continued review with local honduran counsel the procedure to effectuate terminations our recommendation is to terminate all the workers at affected farms rather than follow procedures of labor contract and or honduran labor code the enquirer made repeated attempts to contact mr murray for comment on the tacamiche closing and his proposed purchase of the land he did not respond to the interview requests mr rodriguez also did not return enquirer calls for comment in march 16 internal voicemail message from robert olson chiquitas general counsel to mr rodriguez mr olson said he did not want mr murray talking to the enquirer mr olson also said that if the enquirer did reach mr murray he should not tell the reporters that chiquita officials had told him not to speak with them chiquita statement issued through its lawyers described mr murray as the prospective buyer of the tacamiche land and an associate producer of tela chiquita defines an associate producer as an independent grower with contract to supply chiquita with bananas chiquita records obtained by the enquirer show that mr murray was longtime employee of tela company records reveal mr murray was the administrator in the early 1990s of honduran company gropecuaria petare sa that was secretly controlled by chiquita tacamiche gone the tacamiche villagers did not dispute the companys right to the almost 3000 acres of plantation surrounding the village what they did dispute was chiquitas claims that the company owned the 925 acres of the village proper honduran courts however upheld chiquitas claim to the entire property in 1994 the 6000strong honduran union for chiquita banana workers sitraterco struck over the proposed closings but settled several months later chiquita offered workers jobs on other farms or buyouts but did not make offers to the hundreds of villagers who were relatives or descendants of chiquita workers who lived in tacamiche in statements issued through its attorneys to the enquirer chiquita said the company requested honduran military police to evict the villagers as appropriate legal action to protect its property and business interests chiquita tried to enforce its court eviction of the village several times but villagers refused to leave the military came into the village in february 1996 with tear gas bulldozers and rifles in statement issued through its attorneys chiquita stated that the february eviction took place peacefully and one was hurt tacamiche villagers dispute that claim arguing that shots were fired and tear gas used photographs of the event show soldiers with assault rifles forcibly removing women and children as bulldozers destroy the village several villagers claimed to the honduran and international media at the time that they were beaten chiquita in its written statement said that it eventually issued more than 360000 in relocation costs and buyouts to set up new tacamiche on the land of sugar company several miles away each family was paid about 500 by chiquita as relocation subsidy the company also paid money to build houses or move those that had been knocked down chiquita emphatically denied through its attorneys that it paid the military police who raided tacamiche however in an oct 11 voicemail message by tela employee jorge mendoza to chiquita attorney david hills in cincinnati mr mendoza detailed inkind payments to the military for their services we did have feeding expenses for the personnel and soldiers who were in all that process there they were paid uh the food was bought by us from restaurantcar rents were paid for some of the movements that were to be done when all the necessary equipment was not available and some cars were rented by us fuel was administered to the army trucks that were mobilizing the soldiers and this was done before during and after this thing was calming down in its official statement the company claimed that many of the squatters were in fact new people who had come into the village to cause trouble villagers disputed this allegation regardless of such arguments tacamiche was public relations disaster for chiquita the situation was covered widely in the honduran press after the tacamiche incident chiquita stopped plans to remove other nearby villages for the tacamiche villagers now ensconced in their new village miles away from their home chiquitas decision to destroy their homes is unforgivable once you are longer useful they discard you said juan pablo barahona romero 66 who said he had worked for tela since 1946 before being evicted and fired if the president of chiquita were ever to come down here all i would tell him is that we want our land to recover the place that we have always known where we have lived our whole lives mr romero was let go from chiquita after the eviction his severance package for lifetime of service was about 3200 plus house in the new tacamiche copyright 1998 power money control chiquita secrets revealed at the end of the day this has cost us tremendous amount of money from the standpoint of our reputation in the marketplace once again with the honduras fruit and once again one ends up paying the piper is what it comes down to robert f kistinger chiquita banana group president overripe fruit hurts reputation bottom line publication cincinnati enquirer date may 3 1998 by mike gallagher and cameron mcwhirter chiquita lost millions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of boxes of bananas damaging relations with corporate customers worldwide because of breakdown of its quality control operations in honduras late last year the problem contributed to chiquitas 1997 fourth quarter losses of more than 56 million chiquita did not report the problem publicly and it was not legally required to do so company officials did not say how much of the 56 million loss resulted from its honduran problems the fruit that was shipped from honduras one of chiquitas largest operations in central america arrived overripe at its ports around the world and resulted in many customers refusal to accept or keep the bananas chiquitas sales people today are still dealing with the aftermath of the problem as they try to persuade customers to accept once again the honduran fruit according to company records asked about the problem by the enquirer chiquita responded through its attorneys that the process of harvesting and shipping perishable products is delicate one and we carefully monitor quality at each stage of production nevertheless temporary supply disruptions can occur in the produce industry internal taperecorded voicemail messages of chiquita employees obtained by the enquirer showed the company lost business over the honduran fruit problem chiquita stated to the enquirer that it did not lose any customers because of the problems the companys reputation was hurt with customers around the world chiquita banana group president robert f kistinger chastised employees of chiquitas main honduran subsidiary the tela railroad co because of their failures according to chiquita records obtained by the enquirer in nov 5 voicemail message to benjamin paz chiquita official mr kistinger said to the bigger issue here is the total lack of discipline the lack of responsibility the lack of accountability on the part of the people in honduras not to allow things like this to happen because its just not right im prepared to make changes in honduras this type of behavior is just unacceptable the ongoing honduran fruit problem reached crisis point in october and november when customers in greece syria turkey canada and russia either refused to accept or returned boxes of overripe chiquita bananas chiquita had to negotiate lower price for the bananas or look for other buyers for the problem fruit in many cases the company had to destroy hundreds of thousands of boxes of the worthless product according to company records after cincinnatibased company officials threatened to replace their honduran managers the quality of the honduran banana shipments began to improve in december and january according to company records chiquitas efforts to stop the substandard fruit from being boxed in honduras regain customers and generally improve the quality of the honduran fruit shipped to europe canada and russia has come with large price tag according to mr kistinger and jeff filliater chiquita marketing executive first chiquita bolstered its qualityassurance program by putting highlevel company employees on the honduran docks to check each load of fruit before it was placed on company ships secondly chiquitas new efforts resulted in 70000 to 100000 boxes of bananas left rotting on honduran docks each week because the fruit did not survive the greater scrutiny imposed by the companys cincinnati officials the cost to chiquita for each box of unusable or returned bananas depends on its contracts with independent growers time of year quality of fruit the companys own production costs etc chiquitas cost per box averages between 5 and 7 sources said mr kistinger in nov 5 voicemail message to mr paz said at the end of the day this has cost us tremendous amount of money from the standpoint of our reputation in the marketplace once again with the honduras fruit and once again one ends up paying the piper is what it comes down to this is process we have to stop and change because apparently one is paying attention by slapping them on the wrist he said and this is incredibly significant its in short period of time involving tremendous amount of fruit and some very key customers you know and i know that you can deliver somebody good fruit for 20 weeks straight and then one or two bad weeks taints your whole reputation and that is what the honduran division has successfully done providing examples of how serious the honduran situation was taras kowalczyn chiquita logistics expert told arnaldo palma general manager of chiquitas honduran operations in nov 6 voice mail message we recently had two shipments leave out of honduras kowalczyn said the first shipment was going to the med mediterranean mainly to turkey greece and syria the last shipment was going to st petersburg russia referring to the mediterranean shipment mr kowalczyn said of the 136000 boxes that were loaded for that ship we find approximately 23500 boxes that were either destroyed had claims problems on them or some other action there were 6900 boxes destroyed at the berth prior to even being sent to customer primarily these were found to be in the very very late stages of ripening another approximately 16500 boxes were in fact shipped to customers and we have found that since then customers are either calling in complaints claims on these items or in turn just want to return them he said that represented 17 percent of the entire shipload he added mr kowalczyn suggested way to lessen chiquitas financial losses on the returned fruit we could just try and send them to someone else to mitigate our losses describing the fallout over the problem fruit mr kowalczyn said right now there is an issue that our customers have with honduras fruit some of its perception some of its based on the reality that the number of claims and complaints weve been getting on honduras fruit has escalated proportionately week in and week out and has kind of hit crescendo and even though chiquita has instituted tighter quality control measures on the honduras fruit mr kowalczyn said the companys sales staff was having hard time recouping past customers many customers said that they would only do business with chiquita if they were guaranteed not to get honduran fruit he added the customers told our sales people they would rather go to the montes and doles of the world who have plenty of fruit in the marketplace and purchase it from them since they have very little confidence in the honduras fruit mr kowalczyn said the quality of honduran fruit improved after the company criticized its honduran employees and changes were made for stricter fruit inspections but mr filliater the marketing executive told mr kistinger of ongoing problems in nov 11 voicemail message the major issue is that theyre honduran workers leaving behind on the docks somewhere between 70000 and 100000 boxes week in honduras right now mr filliater said referring to the boxes of substandard honduran fruit found unacceptable for shipment result of all that leftover problem fruit he said was that chiquita packing stations were ordered to reduce cutting and boxing of bananas mr kistinger in several voicemail messages to company employees including chiquitas honduran officials pleaded for an effort to regain and maintain shipments of highquality fruit we have to work together to regain what we have lost this is serious problem for all of us copyright 1998 power money control chiquita secrets revealed we can only fire him renaldo escobar with cause because of his involvement in the colombian problem if we file criminal charge against him with colombian authorities clearly we would not want to do that because we would be implicating ourselves david hills chiquita lawyer discussing how to deal with subsidiary company lawyer involved in colombian bribe scheme bribe scheme covered up publication cincinnati enquirer date may 3 1998 by mike gallagher and cameron mcwhirter an enquirer investigation has found that chiquita made business decisions in latin america to cover up bribery scheme involving company and subsidiary employees helped foreign growers try to evade taxes and ran into tax problems corrupt activities committed by us companies abroad may fall under the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa the act passed in 1977 followed series of international scandals in which american companies operating overseas were caught bribing foreign officials paying kickbacks for contracts and committing other acts that would be illegal in the united states the act prohibits united states companies or their employees from offering bribe to influence foreign government officials acts or decisions the act also requires that us companies maintain accurate records of their foreign operations bribery the bribery incident involved paying government officials in turbo colombia to help the companys colombian subsidiary banadex obtain use of large government storage facility company records and highlevel sources within the company described how after learning of the scheme company officials took action to hide it us securities and exchange commission sec investigators have issued subpoenas to chiquita seeking documents reflecting how chiquita obtained access to the colombian governmentowned storage space chiquita through its lawyers stated chiquitas policy is not to make illegal payments to any government officials sources told the enquirer that two chiquita executives have been forced to resign douglas walker vice president for operations and renaldo escobar company lawyer in colombia jorge forton chiquita executive in medellin colombia who is now in the united states also is being forced to resign but company officials including chiquita president and chief operating officer steven g warshaw have allowed him to stay on temporarily while he seeks other employment in the us highlevel chiquita sources said mr escobar and mr walker were given generous severance packages and have signed confidentiality agreements preventing them from discussing any company business including the colombian incident after leaving chiquita mr walker was hired by corporex companies inc in northern kentucky as part of mr escobars severance package he has been hired as an outside lawyer in colombia for chiquita company records revealed one highlevel chiquita executive provided the enquirer with recorded internal company voicemail messages to back up his information citing fear of losing his job and company retaliation the executive requested confidentiality prior to leaving the company mr escobar in dec 13 1997 voicemail message to chiquita lawyer manuel rodriguez described how and why banadex chiquitas colombian subsidiary became involved in the incident that included payments to colombian customs agents he also explained chiquitas need to obtain the colombianowned storage facility mr escobars message was spoken in spanish and translated for the enquirer the customs area chiquita was allowed to use after paying colombian customs agents is both an enclosed and open area in which the imported cargoes we bring in to colombia are stored mr escobar said while the nationalization process takes place we bring fertilizers fungicides etc in pretty big amounts the nationalization process is when cargo arriving in colombia from other countries is kept stored at an indoor outdoor facility controlled by colombian customs officials the cargo remains in the customs area until it is inventoried recorded and all taxes are paid to the colombian government the customs agents then release the cargo so the company that owns it can deliver it to its operations in that country if we didnt have the customs storage area we would have to ask third party to give us the service of having this cargo in storage while the nationalization process happens mr escobar said it would cost banadex more than 1 million year to obtain similar storage facility for imported cargo during the nationalization process he said responding to suggestions by chiquita officials in cincinnati that they may want to shut down the colombian government storage operation due to concerns that the way that the use of the property was obtained would surface mr escobar in his voicemail message responded im afraid theres an excess of prevention in this almost paranoia i personally dont find it logical to shut down ours storage operation so third party will give the service it is better to leave it as is or let it die by itself but not using it frankly makes sense to discussing how payment was made to colombian customs agents to secure the storage area mr escobar said what happened remember manuel was that the company for security reasons delivered what had to be delivered to the customs agents who gave it to third party and this party to its final destination which means lot of time without being traced i see risk maybe one in thousand that this thing could mean that we are in trouble mr escobar said if whomever found about this inside the company decides to make scandal out of it thats another thing that you will be able to analyze better than in nov 17 1997 voicemail message from mr walker to robert olson chiquitas general counsel in cincinnati mr walker confirmed the bribery issue as the reason he was leaving the company in the message mr walker also expressed concern that other chiquita employees were learning of it after promises the matter would be kept confidential he said one of his best friends chiquita finance executive had asked him about gossip that he walker was fired for being involved in colombian bribery scheme mr walker chiquitas vice president of operations in his voice mail message said his friend had heard that jorge forton and myself had been fired for bribing colombian official for warehouse facility in turbo so he has it pretty close to accurate if not completely accurate noting that he had signed confidentiality agreement with chiquita prohibiting him from discussing the matter with anyone mr walker said in his voicemail message so here i am by contract totally precluded from being able to address with my closest friends information theyre hearing in the most mundane fashion through the office and obviously its extremely disturbing to extremely frustrating to and i dont know what at this point you guys can do about it but i hope youre able to do something mr walker did not return repeated telephone calls from the enquirer in dec 10 1997 voicemail message to mr olson and chiquita president warshaw chiquita lawyer david hills described conversation he had with outside lawyers in colombia regarding renaldo escobar and the ways in which his employment could be severed due to the colombian incident mr hills advised against firing mr escobar because the only way to legally do that would alert colombian authorities to the fact the bribery occurred additionally he added notifying colombian authorities would publicly tie chiquita to the bribe mr hills message in part said we can only fire him escobar with cause because of his involvement in the colombian problem if we file criminal charge against him with colombian authorities clearly we would not want to do that because we would be implicating ourselves so basically the only thing we can ask renaldo to do is to basically have were basically asking him to resign which doesnt put us in the best legal position chiquita in written response through its lawyers to the enquirer declined to discuss the colombian incident the resignations of the employees or whether the company violated the us foreign corrupt practices act chiquitas code of conduct for associates requires employees to comply at all times with the laws that affect the companys business the response said it is chiquitas policy and consistent practice to take appropriate disciplinary action where employees fail to abide by this standard of conduct employment information however is strictly confidential chiquita respects the privacy and personal interests of its employees as result it is chiquitas policy and practice not to discuss with the media or anyone else its relationships with particular employees or the circumstances in which person may then leave the companys employment tax schemes other internal documents indicate that chiquita may have helped foreign brokers and banana growers evade or avoid taxes in their respective countries for example an oct 17 1991 internal report marked confidential from marco garcia former chiquita financial analyst to mr hills explained how chiquita maintained financial records in miami for the purpose of helping ecuadoran growers with whom it had contracts evade taxes the report detailed the growers financial transactions with chiquita subsidiary called agricola guayas under section called purpose of offshore books miami account it reads competitive pressures growers want dollars offshore to evade taxes and to avoid converting to sucres ecuadoran currency at the official rate which is 5 to 8 less than the free market rate in another case series of taperecorded voicemail messages among chiquita lawyers company executives and employees reveals chiquitas plan to help broker avoid paying taxes on an anticipated commission payment from the company according to chiquita records company called corporacion midori sa in san jose costa rica was hired in 1996 to help sell some of chiquitas honduran and colombian companies land and equipment prior to agreeing to broker the sales deals representatives of midori and chiquita subsidiary called chiquita brands inc of delaware signed contract to allow midori to search for potential buyers and negotiate possible deals according to chiquita records midori then signed similar contract with one of chiquitas colombian subsidiaries the records show eugene rodriguez chiquita executive coordinating the midori deal told chiquita officials in cincinnati in an oct 11 1997 voicemail message that the company had agreed to pay midori its commission offshore in deal where they dont have to pay taxes in his voicemail message to mr hills mr rodriguez said actually we asked the guys to provide deal for us an offshore deal deal where they dont have to pay taxesthey midori didnt want to pay taxes and we always said that they would have the payment offshore highlevel source within chiquita who was involved in the midori payment scheme confirmed how the deal was arranged an offshore account would be used to pay midori so the colombian government would not have access to any paperwork such as invoices etc to prove how much if anything midori would be paid for its commission he said but in early october problem arose after midori negotiated the sale of chiquita banana operation in colombia called shangrila when midori asked about its commission experts in chiquitas tax department in cincinnati questioned whether chiquita was legally obligated to withhold 35 percent in taxes from the commission per colombian tax laws according to several internal chiquita voicemail messages to avoid jeopardizing the sale chiquita officials devised plan to pay midori its commission without withholding the colombia required tax midori had complicated the commission payment problem by signing brokers agreement to sell chiquitas colombian property with both chiquita brands inc and its colombian subsidiary according to company records that problem had to be overcome if midoris commission was to be paid without withholding the colombian tax according to mr hills in an oct 11 voicemail message to john ordman chiquitas senior vice president of finance and others to solve the legal dilemma chiquita officials came up with plan to pay midori its commission without taking out taxes the plan was described in an oct 20 1997 voicemail message from mr hills to mr ordman chiquita would obtain every copy of midoris contract with chiquitas colombian subsidiary all copies of the contract would be sent to cincinnati headquarters where officials would annul it kill it mutually terminate it said mr hills chiquita wanted to hide the fact that midoris commission was going to be paid offshore according to an oct 20 1997 voicemail message to mr hills from scott wittman chiquita tax specialist we have consulted with counsel and gotten their input on this transaction they feel that we have position that we can take it says because this agreement is between cbi chiquita brands inc and midori that the withholding tax would not apply the one thing they caution us on is definitely do not include in the land sale agreement anything related to the brokerage commission and the fact that it is getting paid offshore we obviously dont want to highlight that mr wittman said company records did not reveal the amount of the proposed land deal or the proposed brokers fee at the last minute midoris deal to sell the shangrila property apparently fell through according to march 23 voicemail message from john ordman to mr hills mr ordman said that more than five months after the midori commission tax issue surfaced chiquita still owned and controlled the shangrila property its not perfect secret mr ordman said there are people who know that chiquita owns shangrila but it is not generally known in colombia and its particularly not generally known among the popular groups if you will in colombia there is probably place that i can think of that this company has more exposure to an easy 10 million loss than shangrila if shangrila were to be invaded by squatters or as you know it is in bit of guerrillaactive area it could really become extremely difficult to protect weve had some near misses there in the past its one of the things that really keeps awake at night in chiquita response to enquirer questions issued through its attorneys the company stated that information provided to the enquirer was false and that any implication of wrongdoing on the part of chiquita in connection with these alleged transactions is false chiquita further stated that chiquita has not sold the property referred to by the enquirer and has not terminated any contract with midori honduran tax problem chiquitas main subsidiary in honduras also has run into tax problem there in early 1997 the honduran tax department completed an investigation of the tela railroad co to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in asset taxes from at least 1992 according to chiquita records and honduran officials after unsuccessful attempts to get the company to pay honduran tax officials took their case against chiquitas subsidiary to court according to several voicemail messages of chiquita tax specialist david hochwalt to mr hills mr ordman and others that action was confirmed for the enquirer by jorge ramirez mendoza honduran tax department spokesman in november chiquita threw in the towel and agreed it had indeed failed to pay asset taxes of 87 million lempiras about 700000 us since 1991 according to mr hochwalt in nov 14 1997 voicemail message to mr olson chiquitas general counsel and senior vice president the company paid its disputed taxes in late november to keep from paying an additional hundreds of thousands of dollars in penalties and interest on the unpaid taxes chiquita lawyers asked honduran officials to eliminate those charges under honduran tax amnesty plan according to mr hochwalt in statement issued through its attorneys chiquita said that the companys subsidiary and the honduran government had divergent views on the taxes owed and the company was challenging the amount in court the subsidiary eventually elected to participate in national tax amnesty program by paying the tax in dispute about 700000 participation in the program eliminated the risk of interest or penalties that might have resulted if the legal challenges had not succeeded if whomever found about this inside the company decides to make scandal of it thats another thing that you will be able to analyze better than renaldo escobar chiquita lawyer discussing the possible fallout from the colombian bribery scheme chiquitas problems with brokered land deal in colombia chiquita officials in cincinnati approved hiring san jose costa rica company to find buyers for the banana giants noncore assets in colombia and honduras problems arose when the costa rican company midori found buyer for chiquitas shangrila plantation in colombia but insisted its commission be paid offshore as

bananas edgardo zepeda president of the honduran banana workers union locals front for chiquita publication cincinnati enquirer date may 3 1998 by mike gallagher and cameron mcwhirter in addition to using interlocking trusts to hide control of latin american companies chiquita has used system in which local citizens are named as company shareholders but secretly sign over their shares in blank thereby allowing the cincinnatibased banana giant to exercise control the company used this method to avoid restrictions of national security laws and limits on land ownership by foreigners and to reduce political and union pressure called nominee ownership the system was first widely used by chiquita in honduras in 1990 it has since been spread by the company to operations in other latin american countries including guatemala and colombia according to company records obtained by the enquirer report entitled honduras operations legal structure description and rationale written in february 1992 by chiquitas legal department to the companys lawyers and executives in honduras explained how the system worked the farms are set up with five honduran nominees as owners and with their shares signed in blank over to the chiquita company signing shares in blank is analogous to person endorsing check without designating payee under the honduran civil law system nominee system may be illegal if the purpose or intent is to circumvent the law however cases could be found in the honduran legal system where this specific issue was decided in court chiquita arranged for company called compania bananera limitada sa cobalisa in lima honduras to be the management service company to handle personnel cash flow tax issues and other functions of the supposedly independent honduran companies amilcar castejon honduran lawyer who was in charge of cobalisas internal records spoke openly to the enquirer in february when he said chiquita set up the farm companies and is hiding its control to get rid of its honduran labor union which would save the company millions of dollars hide its assets because the countrys agrarian law limits foreign ownership of agricultural land and shield itself from liability for such things as worker lawsuits and child labor violations mr castejon said he was hired by chiquita to oversee all cobalisa payroll and personnel records time sheets benefit reports and other internal financial and corporation records at cobalisa chiquita officials in cincinnati declined to discuss cobalisa velmi irias cobalisas personnel director denied any

showing mr obregons connection to chiquita in cincinnati the source told the enquirer that he is one of several executives with authority over company voicemails he requested anonymity in an april 6 message from chiquita lawyer david hills to robert olson chiquitas general counsel and senior vice president mr hills said bob jose obregon is the general manager of cobalisa in honduras i looked into his hr human resources status and he is actually an employee of chiquita brands inc he obregon has had previous postings in panama where he was the chief financial officer for chiquitas chiriqui land co he was then sent to honduras where he was i believe the chief financial officer of tela before he became the general manager of cobalisa also in an oct 25 1997 message from tela executive ernesto interiano to mr hills mr interiano said jose obregon is not on telas payroll he is being paid by cincinnati it is direct payment between chiquita headquarters and him and i want to confirm to you that raul schrunder who is the person in charge of agricultural operations in cobalisa is one of our employees telas employee he is in fact on our payroll chiquita officials refused to answer several enquirer questions about the connection between mr obregon chiquita and cobalisa citing competitive reasons the company response did state chiquita has not violated the honduran agrarian reform law or the national security provisions of the honduran constitution chiquitas control of cobalisa was unknown by the honduran labor community said german edgardo zepeda president of coordinadora sindicatos bananeros honduras cosibah which coordinates unions that represent honduran banana workers both chiquita and our government have assured us that chiquita has nothing to do with cobalisa other than to

on catholic institutions not to accept donations from carl h lindner jr or chiquita chiquita meanwhile issued statement sunday defending itself as good corporate citizen notwithstanding the unfair and inaccurate assertions of the enquirer but bishop thomas gumbleton an auxiliary bishop of detroit said the enquirers findings reflect what he saw firsthand on chiquita farms he visited in honduras last year member of the us catholic conferences social justice committee bishop gumbleton is an internationally known spokesman and investigator for the catholic church on human rights and social justice issues the catholic conference is the social policy arm of the national conference of catholic bishops on sunday bishop gumbleton called for catholic leaders to reject donations from chiquita and mr lindner the companys chairman and chief executive officer he said such gifts involved blood money earned off the backs of the poor peasants of central america the bishop made his comments after reading the sunday chiquita stories on the enquirer web site in the 18page special section sunday the enquirer described the findings of yearlong investigation into the cincinnatibased banana giant among those findings chiquita secretly controls dozens of supposedly independent banana companies in latin america it uses elaborate business structures to hide its control avoiding restrictions on land ownership and national security laws the structures also are aimed at limiting unions on the farms chiquitas subsidiaries engage in pesticide practices that endanger the health of banana workers and nearby residents despite an agreement with an environmental group to adhere to certain safety standards those practices include aerial pesticide spraying while workers are still in the fields security guards of chiquita subsidiaries and their jointventure partners have used brute force to enforce their authority on plantations the violence by these guards has resulted in the death and wounding of unarmed peasants including children chiquita is an evil institution for exploiting the poor bishop gumbleton said i saw people living in dismal situation what i would ask the catholic leaders of cincinnati and elsewhere is how can you take money from corporation or chairman of corporation who is doing that kind of thing to perfectly good and totally innocent people and depriving them of chance to get decent livelihood in october mr lindner and his family donated 15 million to the archdiocese of cincinnati to provide computers for innercity catholic schools efforts to reach

chiquita brands international inc were not returned robert olson chiquitas general counsel spoke with an enquirer reporter but would not say whether the company would issue statement in response to bishop gumbletons comments bishop gumbleton said the 2000mile distance that separates chiquitas banana farms and its cincinnati headquarters is excuse for allowing the problems in latin america to continue it doesnt take big effort for carl lindner to go down there and just find out whats going on at his plantations i dont believe that person like carl lindner is the only corporate leader in this country doing this kind of thing he said but the evidence uncovered by the enquirer and what i have personally observed makes it clear that he and his company must make changes to protect the very lives of the people who made them so wealthy chiquita brands statement on sunday may 3 the cincinnati enquirer published sensational and highly inaccurate story impugning the reputation and business practices of chiquita brands international chiquita is known globally as leading international producer of wholesome and healthy foods and as good corporate citizen investing in local communities building schools and improving the quality of life for tens of thousands we are proud of the success we have had in providing benefits and wages in latin america that far exceed those available from other jobs and protecting the environment in manner that has earned praise from the most prominent independent environmental organizations chiquita is proud of its work and denies the false implications of the enquirers article the information contained in the enquirers story was selectively edited incomplete and presented out of context and portrays false and highly inaccurate image of chiquita chiquita and other independent sources made extraordinary efforts to provide facts and documents which demonstrate the true record unfortunately the enquirer ignored the hundreds of pages of documents detailing the facts regarding chiquitas sound business practices instead the enquirer has affiliated itself and worked in concert with persons having financial political and economic motives to damage chiquita chiquita adheres to the highest standards of product quality and social responsibility applying worldclass standards regarding associate relations product quality

enquirer reports that chiquita brands international inc is involved in wide range of questionable business practices in latin america the eus commission on agriculture is the 15nation european unions lead agency in dealing with the banana industry on sunday the enquirer published an 18page section detailing the overseas operations of cincinnatibased chiquita those operations include secret control of supposedly independent banana companies bribery scandal in colombia and the buying of political influence with campaign contributions it just makes very angry said glenys kinnock member of the european parliament for wales weve just been to the commission now and met with the director general about this they are very keen to see these stories they are not very happy with chiquita mrs kinnock has been longstanding opponent of chiquitas efforts to roll back eu banana protections those protections in place since 1993 favored small banana growers from former european colonies in africa and the caribbean but those protections have hindered sales for chiquita the largest banana provider to europe mrs kinnock made her remarks on the opening day of the international banana conference gathering of banana producers environmentalists governments and union groups concerned about problems in the industry the threeday gathering in brussels capital of the eu has drawn more than 300 delegates from 44 counties to discuss issues from pesticide use to market protections to corporate codes of conduct delegates also include scientists major banana distributors industry consultants and representative of chemical company most of the worlds major banana companies have sent representatives including dole monte and the irish banana company fyffes chiquita sent delegate though public relations firm that has represented the company in europe has sent an observer government representatives are here from the united kingdom and several other members of the european union and costa rica the us trade representatives office was invited to send delegate but as of monday us representative had registered ralph ives deputy assistant us trade representative and point man on banana issues for the clinton administration did not return calls monday seeking comment on the united states absence from the conference mrs kinnock told the enquirer she wants the european union parliaments legal services division to investigate the newspapers findings the issues are of interest here because the us trade representatives office in support of chiquita has led efforts to overturn the eu banana restrictions among the enquirer findings chiquita acquired land in latin american countries for expanded banana production even though those nations laws prohibit and or limit chiquita from directly buying property employees of chiquita and subsidiary were involved in bribery scheme in colombia that has come to the attention of the us securities and exchange commission chiquita chairman and chief executive officer carl h lindner jr his family and associates made legal but controversial contributions to political figures at time the company desperately sought us backing in the trade dispute over the eu banana restrictions european and caribbean critics of president clintons support for chiquitas position have pointed to large campaign donations that mr lindner has made to the president and the democratic party the united states working closely with chiquita has carried the case to the world trade organization wto an international body set up to mediate trade disputes the wto has ruled that the eu protections run counter to the principles of global free trade and must be altered the eu council body of ministers that serves as the organizations executive branch is expected to submit an alternative plan to the wto in june in addition to mrs kinnock philip lowe the eus director general for development said he also was looking into the newspapers findings claire godfrey policy adviser of oxfam international british charity organization concerned with hunger in the developing nations of the world has long been supporter of the eu protections and said the information published in the enquirer puts the us trade office on shaky ground in the eu trade dispute if the us or the latin americans want to take the case back to the wto in june i think their credibility is going to be weakened she said ron oswald secretary general of the genevabased international union of food and agricultural workers which represents more than 36 million duespaying members worldwide said the findings provide insight into how some global companies operate in the 1990s the concept of trying to create virtual companies that control only marketing and strategy and therefore can wash their hands of all responsibility of what happens on the ground is becoming quite common he said the structure of ownership is obviously extreme in the chiquita case he said his union takes the position that companies should not be able to hide ownership at the expense of employees in the developing world i think that as soon as company makes money out of an arrangement i dont care how complex or clever the ownership structure they set up they have social responsibility chiquita criticizes use of tapes the following statement was issued monday by chiquita brands international yesterday chiquita denied the highly inaccurate account in the may 3 cincinnati enquirer regarding the companys business practices in so doing the enquirer virtually ignored chiquitas record of providing among the most competitive wages and benefits of any major employer in latin america of being major engine of progress building roads schools and hospitals and and of being singled out for praise by independent environmental groups for its progressive policies the enquirer based its article on selective out of context voice mail messages that were stolen from private voice mail boxes of chiquita employees steven g warshaw chiquitas president and chief operating officer said we at chiquita are shocked by the enquirers admission that it obtained more than 2000 messages containing confidential privileged and proprietary information that was stolen from the private voice mail boxes of chiquita employees this behavior raises serious moral and legal questions we doubt that any citizen of cincinnati is comfortable with newspaper thinking it appropriate to obtain stolen private voice mail messages much less selectively and inaccurately publishing them newspapers are supposed to guard against big brother not be big brother enquirer responds in response enquirer president and publisher harry m whipple issued the following as explained in sundays package of stories the enquirers investigation into chiquitas business practices was supported by multiple sources inside and outside the company and by extensive documentation the documentation includes the executives own words contained in copies of taped voicemail messages copies of these tapes were provided to enquirer reporters by highranking chiquita executive who was one of several with authority over the companys voicemail system these voicemail messages were essentially internal memoranda the source who requested confidentiality for fear of retribution also provided the same

his acceptance of 15 million donation from carl h lindner jr and his family after prominent catholic bishop characterized it as blood money archbishop pilarczyk said through spokesman that he thought it was all right to accept the lindner money despite call by detroit auxiliary bishop thomas gumbleton for catholic institutions to refuse such donations because mr lindner is chairman and chief executive officer of chiquita brands international bishop gumbleton said chiquita earns its money off the backs of the poor peasants of central america where bananas are produced bishop gumbleton is member of the us catholic conferences social justice committee his statement was in response to revelations in sundays enquirer about chiquitas latin american business practices those findings included aerial spraying of pesticides while workers were still in the fields brute force used on peasants by guards on banana plantations and failure to adhere to established health and safety standards for workers the archdiocese of cincinnati was aware last fall that concerns of social justice were being raised in conjunction with the operations of chiquita brands international archbishop pilarczyk said in statement issued through spokesman dan andriacco those concerns were considered by the archbishop before he decided to accept the gift of 15 million from members of the carl and edith lindner family which controls chiquita on the basis of the information available there seemed reason to refuse the gift the money from the lindner family is being used to fund computer technology and equipment for seven innercity catholic schools serving 1327 children 75 percent of whom are black 70 percent of whom are noncatholic and 64 percent of whom have family incomes below the poverty level the archbishop declined to speak directly with the enquirer for this story when asked whether the archbishop had any additional concerns about chiquita based on the enquirers report mr

is europes largest importer chiquita officials did not respond to enquirer requests for comment tuesday according to the enquirer report chiquita set up structures to avoid the restrictions of honduran land ownership and national security laws as well as to limit or eliminate unions on its plantations this system included trusts being set up in the channel islands and liechtenstein two wellknown european tax and trust havens and in honduras with the involvement of large honduran banks another form of control was the formation of farm companies involving five trusted honduran citizens with ties to chiquita subsidiaries these honduran citizens were made shareholders of the farm companies but once those companies were established and shares issued the shares were signed in blank and then given to chiquita chiquita has used similar legal structures in other latin american countries including colombia and guatemala one company involved in these schemes was compania bananera limitada sa cobalisa which is based in lima honduras headquarters of chiquitas honduran banana operations the truth is we didnt know about cobalisa said mr funes who also lives in lima we

lawsuits or public campaigns with the help of other unions around the world he said the union if it determines the enquirer findings are true will lodge complaint with the united nations and the international labor organization ilo world body dealing with employees rights he also said the issues will be raised at the unions contract negotiations with tela set for august mr funes said tela had

colombian probe was fidel cano the colombian embassys press attache my government will want answers to what is going on in this matter with chiquita this will all be looked into the colombian authorities said they learned of the alleged bribe scheme after the enquirer published an 18page special section sunday describing the findings of yearlong investigation into questionable business practices by chiquita the bribery incident involved paying customs agents in turbo colombia to help chiquitas colombian subsidiary banadex obtain use of large government storage facility the enquirer detailed the bribery scheme in its sunday report the voicemail tapes and highlevel chiquita sources described how after learning of the scheme company officials took action to hide it the tapes reveal that two company executives have been forced to resign douglas walker vice president for operations and reinaldo escobar lawyer for chiquitas banadex subsidiary jorge forton banadex executive in medellin colombia also is being forced to resign but company officials including mr warshaw allowed him to stay on temporarily while he sought other employment in the united states according to the tapes highlevel chiquita sources and the voicemail messages show mr escobar and mr walker were given generous severance packages and signed confidentiality agreements preventing them from discussing any company business including the colombian incident mr forton also signed confidentiality agreement the tapes show after leaving chiquita mr walker was hired by corporex cos inc in northern kentucky as part of mr escobars severance package he has been hired as an outside lawyer in colombia for chiquita company records revealed one highlevel chiquita executive provided the enquirer with the voicemail messages to back up his information citing fear of losing his job and company retaliation the executive requested confidentiality mr walker in nov 17 1997 voicemail message to mr olson confirmed the bribery issue as the reason he was leaving the company in his message mr walker said friend had told him that he heard jorge forton and myself had been fired for bribing colombian official for warehouse facility in turbo so he has it pretty close to accurate if not completely accurate mr escobar in dec 13 1997 voicemail message to mr rodriguez said colombian custom agents were paid so banadex could use the government compound for storage thus saving the company more than 1 million in private storage costs at the colombian port discussing how payment was made to colombian customs agents to secure the storage area mr escobar said what happened remember manuel was that the company for security reasons delivered what had to be delivered to the customs agents who gave it to third party and this party to its final destination which means lot of time without being traced mr walker mr escobar and mr forton declined repeated enquirer requests for comment mr cano the colombian embassy press attache said the colombian government does not lease or rent space at its custom facilities including turbo to private companies such as chiquita that is strictly for use by our government mr rodriguez in an oct 16 1997 voicemail message to john ordman chiquitas senior vice president of finance described what sparked the company officials decision to offer the three men incentives to resign in lieu of being fired mr rodriguezs message was in spanish and was translated for the enquirer hey john ordman there was an article in tiempo newspaper in colombia where it was reported that ten custom officials were arrested for alleged corruption and paybacks mr rodriguez said it is important that you know this because apparently there has been several others 3060 custom people were arrested and are being investigated and will obviously make statements against other officers and it is going to come to light regarding all types of corruption mr rodriguez then discussed why it would be good idea to allow mr escobar to resign and give him chiquita consulting contract instead of fining or firing him for his involvement in the colombian incident we have to give him that consulting contract for many reasons but the other additional point is that if reinaldo questions this action we would have to prove his termination to the colombian authorities which means that we have to reveal the fact that the payment was made and try to justify the firing this has legal repercussions but in addition it has greater political repercussions he said particularly given that colombian president ernesto samper wants to make an example against the multinationals and what better time than to declare war on chiquita over this point this would have international repercussions therefore it is very delicate issue let tell you that the same situation can be made in relation to walker and forton if they decide to fight this forced resignation i dont see that we have any other option up to certain point were risking that possibility chiquita lawyer david hills in dec 10 1997 voicemail message to mr olson and mr warshaw also advised against firing mr escobar because the only way to legally do that would alert colombian authorities to the fact the bribery occurred additionally he added notifying colombian authorities would publicly tie chiquita to the bribe mr hills message in part said we can only fire him escobar with cause because of his involvement in the colombian problem if we file criminal charge against him with colombian authorities clearly we would not want to do that because we would be implicating ourselves so basically the only thing we can ask reinaldo to do is basically have were basically asking him to resign which doesnt put us in the best legal position chiquita in written response through its lawyers to the enquirer declined to discuss the colombian incident the resignations of the employees or whether the company violated any us laws the company response did say chiquitas code of conduct for associates requires employees to comply at all times with the laws that affect the companys business corrupt activities committed by us companies abroad may fall under the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa the act passed in 1977 followed series of international scandals in which american companies operating overseas were caught bribing foreign officials paying kickbacks for contracts and committing other acts that would be illegal in the united states the act prohibits us companies or their employees from offering bribe to influence foreign government officials acts or decisions the act also requires that us companies maintain accurate records of their foreign operations the sec and the us justice department have

newspaper reported that chiquita subsidiary farms used several pesticides in violation of stated alliance policy in documents provided earlier to the enquirer the alliance stated in its general production standards for its better banana program that certified farms can only use products that are registered for use in the united states canada and europe to be banned by the epa or the european union means chemical cannot be used anywhere in the world on produce shipped to the united states or europe restriction that must be adhered to by food importers according to us and european law but the alliances previously issued general production standards held producers to higher standard if chemical is not registered for use in the united states it cannot be used on farms in the united states but may be used on produce being shipped from overseas the list of banned chemicals is far shorter than the list of chemicals not registered by the epa or authorized by the european union the enquirer reported may 3 that several pesticides on chiquitas own list of approved chemicals were not registered for use in the united states canada or one or more nations of the european union in contradiction to stated rainforest alliance policy those pesticides included bitertanol sold as baycor pesticide that chiquita and its subsidiaries use in aerial spraying both the company that manufactures the product as well as the epa stated that bitertanol is not and never has been registered for use in the united states on bananas or any other crop under the standards released tuesday

newspaper quoted workers on chiquita subsidiary farms for that story mr holst told the enquirer we require that workers have protection from the application of chemicals that clearly is violation the enquirer also published statements from tape recordings made from internal chiquita voicemail messages in which company officials discussed that chiquita subsidiaries are conducting aerial spraying while workers are in the fields those tapes were provided to the enquirer by highlevel source in chiquitas cincinnati headquarters in the united states aerial spraying while workers are in the fields is banned by the epa epa spokeswoman denise kearns said the epa will on rare occasions allow an individual dressed in full safety gear to flag for cropdusting airplane but all other workers are removed asked why the epa had such regulations ms kearns said because of the acute reactions to pesticide applications of this kind and also over time you have all kinds of chronic effects that creep
