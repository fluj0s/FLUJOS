most obvious in the new products and new companies or merged older companies that have come onto the market it can also be seen in the changes made to the laws and regulatory structures that govern the financial services firms in the united states the grammleachbliley act glba of 1999 significantly changed the legal requirements applicable to insurers banks and securities firms while leaving the structure of the regulato ry agencies for those industries essentially unchanged for both the securities and the banking industry this has proven relatively uncontroversial as both industries had established national systems of regulation the insurance industry in th united states however has national system of regulation the 1945 mccarran ferguson act gave regulatory authority to the

prudential regulation revolves around seeing that firms remain fi nancially sound and ab to fulfill future promises this often involves specific oversight of both assets and liabilities of financial firms market conduct regulation revolves around how the firms interact with customers countries have also instituted socalled twin peaks model whereby regulation of banks insurers and securities is combined but there are two different functional agencies one focuse s on prudential regula tion while the other focuses on market conduct another area of significant difference am ong countries is

the report addresses the following principle questions is there combined regulation of bankssecuritiesinsurers or do different agencies regula the different firms is regulation including prudentia l regulation and market conduct regulation split between nati onal and regi onal levels is the regulation for solvency nd for market conduct under the same agency or split is there regulation of the prices of insurance and the policy forms that are used is there different re gulation in this regard for different types of insurance is there guaranty fund in the case of insurer failure if so is it private or public mandatory or voluntary how is it funded does it build up balance or is the funding postfailure these questions are designed to shed light on the issues arising out of the current efforts to change the system in the united states the first three points are fairly clear focusing on who carries out th regulation the four th addresses one of the central issues in the debate in the united states where industry group are strongly against the substantial rate and form regulations that exist at the state level whereas consumer groups are equally adamant that this regulation is necessary for consumer protection the final point is meant to illuminate key issue if the united states were to institute federal charter for insurance companies namely what might behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33439crs3 4 paul v virginia 75 us 8 wall 168 1868done with the current system of state guaran ty funds that protect policyholders in the event of an insolvency table 1

19th century the first landmark wa s an 1868 supreme court decision4 determining that insurance did not fall under the inters tate commerce clause of the constitution this decision left regulatory power to the individual states which created their own regulatory bodies and statutes in the followi ng years while the precise nomenclature differs from state to state most have so division of the state government with specific oversight and regulatory responsib ility for insurance companies the heads of these insurance departments often known as insurance commissioners are generally either elected in statewide elec tions or appointed by the governor private association of insurance co mmissioners now known as the national association of insurance commissioners naic was created in 1871

httpbakerhousegovhtml contentcfmid408 9 senator ernest hollings s 1073 in the 108th congressin 1944 the supreme court reversed its earlier decision and found that insurance was interstate commerce and thus subject to federal regulation in particular to the federal antitrust laws5 this provoked quick reaction from both the industry and the state governments who prevailed upon congress to pass the mccarranferguson act of 1945 which specifi cally granted the states the authority to regulate insurance and granted limited exemption from the federal antitrust laws there has been limited federal intrusion into the insurance regulatory system over the past 60 years6 but while bills have been introdu ced in various congresses to provide the federal government increased general regulatory authority over insurance none has been enacted in general therefore the states continue to exercise primary authority to regulate insurance in the united states the precise aspects of insurance regula tion among the 50 different states plus the district of columbia and four territories differ substantially the naic and the national conference of insurance legi slators ncoil produce model laws on various topics and the naic has been very active in promoting other steps such as single point of electronic filing for insurance forms and an interstate compact to create uniform standards fo r life insurance products7 neither ncoil nor naic however has any real authority to compel states to enact laws that are in line with their standards in general insurance is highly regula ted in the united states on both prudential and market conduct grounds market co nduct regulation frequently differs among lines of insurance with commercial insurance being less regulated than insurance purchased by individuals st ates require licenses for insurance companies brokers and agents including separate licenses for insurers who are headquartered in another state for some types of insurance par ticularly compulsory lines such as workers compensation and auto many states have created some form of state insurance entity or enacted specific regulations to ensure that this insurance is available state regulation of rates and forms s been major issue for insurance companies and for groups representing insura nce consumers some in congress have called specifically for federal preemption of state control of insurance rates8 while others would extend rate and form regulation to the federal level9 the exact type of state regulation varies significantly it extends from strict prior approval in which any rate change must be approved in advance to nofile system where there is direct oversight of rates in between are approaches such as flex rating filehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33439crs5 10

information on guaranty funds in the united states 12 see crs report rs21372 the european union questions and answers by kristin archick for an overview of the european union 13 while an eu directive is enacted in legislative process it does not directly preempt individual national laws as federal law might do to state law in the united states instead an eu member states government is requi red to enact law harmonizing that member states national laws with the eu directive an imperfect analogy in the united statess insurance regulation would be that of the m odel laws that are adopted by the national association of insurance commissioners whic h must then be enacted by the state legislatures to take effect the key differe nce however is that eu member states are required by international treaty to enact laws following eu directives whereas us states are under little or compulsion to enact naic model lawsand use and use and file which allow insurers some flexibility to change rates while still requiring so filing with the state insura nce regulator the insurance information institute lists 31 states with prior approval requirements for at least some lines of insurance and 30 states plus the district of columbia with filing requirements for at least some lines of insurance10 most states have some lines that fall between the two extremes as well insurance guaranty or guarantee funds have been created in every state to provide protection for policyholders in case of an insurer insolvency participation is generally requirement for licensure in each state these funds are generally run by the state departments of insurance and ar responsible for satisfying claims against an insurer once an insurer is declared insolvent by the states insurance commissioner most of the state guaran ty funds rely on pos thoc assessments on insurers operating in the state to pay fo r policyholder claims that are beyond the insolvent insurers remaining assets the one exception to this is new yorks fund which does prefund to some extent11 should multistate insurer become insolvent the insurers home state fund takes the lead in managing the insolvency but the other states funds are responsible for settling the claims that arise from within their state european union12 since it began as an agreement covering only the coal and steel industries of six european countries the eu has expanded both geographically 25 current members and into other economic and political sphe res including insurance regulation in most areas where the eu exerts influence on member state laws one sees mix of 1 harmonization of national laws and laws enacted by the eu13 known as directives and 2 mutual recognition by the eu member states of the laws or regulations that are in place in other eu member stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33439crs6 14 the first directive on solvency for exampl was issued in 1973 and the first on the establishment of insurance companies in 1964 15 see crs report

httpeuropaeuintcomminternal_ marketinsurancesolvency2index_enhtm 17 ibidthere is direct regulation of insurers by the eu however directives on insurance regulation date back many years14 in the 1990s as part of the creation of the european single market eu directives introduced mutual recognition based on common minimum standards of supervision and the system known as the single passport for insurers essentially licensed insurer in one eu member state is authorized to do business in any other eu state on the basis of simple notification and without the requirement fo r separate license the one exception to this is for lines that are compulsory in particular nation eg auto in surance prudential regulation of eu insurers is the responsib ility of the home member state while market conduct responsibility is somewhat mixed contract law which specifically governs the interpretation of insurance policies is generally the domain of the country in which the contract is signed eu directives specifically disallow any requirements for prior appr oval of rates and forms whatever market conduct regulation of insurers that might occur must follow the fundamental principle of national treatment foreign insurers from within the eu are treated the same as national insurers in 1999 the eu began project to overhaul the entire regulatory structure for the financial rvices industry known as th financial services action plan15 fsap the insurance component of the fsap has centered on two areas to date solvency regulation nd regulation of reinsurance euwide minimum solvency requirements for propertycasualty insurers were first established in 1973 and for life in surers in 1979 these standards were relatively low and were not updated until after the beginning of the fsap the so called solvency i directive adopted in 2002 updated and indexed the minimum requirements for inflation and generally increased the minimum capital needed by insurers solvency i also introduced some riskbased capital requirements and allowed regulators to take action in cases where an insurers financial position was deteriorating even if it continued to meet the minimum requirements while solvency i certainly strengthened the requirements it did not change the framework of the previous directives to large degree it essentially just changed the formulas that were in place as suggested by the title however solvency i was not the end of eu directives regarding this issue solvency ii has been proposed to be much broader than solvency i it contains fundamental and widera nging review of the current regime in the light of current deve lopments in insurance risk management finance techniques fina ncial reporting etc16 solvency ii is currently envisioned to be adopted in july 2007 and to codify and replace the previous directives on insurance including solvency i and the directive on reinsurance while drafts of the directive can be found on the eu website17 the new standards remain work in progresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33439crs7 the most recent insurance directiv adopted in september 2005 is on harmonizing regulation of reinsurance previously reinsurance was not the subject of euwide regulation the reinsurance directive essentiall applied the single passport framework under which primary insurers operate to reinsurers thus reinsurer domiciled in one eu country is now able to operate throughout the eu without hindrance except for supervision by its home country regulator the directive contains specific prudential requi rements that national regulators are to apply in overseeing reinsurers including regulation of reinsurer investments of particular note it also requires the remo val of any national collateral requirements that had been applied by one eu mber state on companies from another eu member state this removal is significant since the existence of us collateral requirements has been matte r of contention between european reinsurers and us regulators by removing all internal collateral requirements the eu strengthens its argument against us collateral requirements the eu has specifically cited desire to improve access to foreign markets as rationale for adopting the reinsurance directive over the past few years there has b een significant amount of work done on the idea of an eu directive governing in surance guaranty funds to this point however conclusion has been reached bout either the desirability of such directive or what the precise contents of such directive might be many of the eu member states have national guaran ty funds in place although some have implemented such funds in the same time fra that discussions at the eu level have taken place on the topic united kingdom following the countrys tradition of unita ry government regu lation of financial institutions is generally carried out centrally today financial institutions including banks insurers and securities firms are regulated by the financial services authority fsa an independent nongovernmental agency afforded statutory powers to regulate the financial services industry the fsa was created in 1997 following change in the uks government reacting to many of the changes in the market the new government expressed concerns that the old system was costly inefficient and confusing to both customers and the regu lated institutions in addition the drive to create new regulator was also spurred by scandals such as the failure of barings bank and the misselling of pension products the fsa initially consolidated nine ba nking and securities regulators under single institution before 1997 the depar tment of trade and industry oversaw the prudential aspects of life nd propertycasualty insurance following four years of interim arrangements the fsa obtained full statutory powers in 2001 when the financial services and mark ets act of 2000 fsma came into force while the market conduct of life insure rs selling investment products was supervised since the late 1980s statutory supervision by the fsa of the market conduct of propertycasualty general insurers was introduced in january 2005 this followed the implementation by the uk of an eu directive on insurance intermediaries prior to 2005 the sale and marketing of prope rtycasualty insurance was overseen by general insurance standard

sole direct regulator for insurance in the uk it has responsibility for both prudential and market conduct regulation its approach is an integrated one encompassing both regulatory aspects within the in surance directorate of the agency on the prudential side regulation by fsa takes proactive risk based18 approach it also focuses signifi cant attention on the managerial soundness and internal controls of individual companie s on the market conduct side the focus is on accurate disclosures by the compan ies to consumers and fair treatment of customers both pre and postsale fsa s the legal authority to review insurance contracts for unfair term s and indicates that it will take action working with insurance firms where possible19 to change these terms if found to be inappropriate the fsa does not interv ene in individual cases between the policyholder and an insurer this is ft to the court system or an independent ombudsman as discussed below ther is rate regulation of any kind while fsa is the sole direct regulator there are two other bodies that have some influence on insurance regulation in the uk coming from above as previously discussed are the european unions various directives on insurance laws and regulations in the uk are required by the eu treaties to comply with these directives and the uk has generally done so in the time frame that is required by the eu the other agency that could have some effect on the consumer side of fsas insurance regulation is the uk financ ial ombudsman service fos the fos was created by statute as an independent nonbi nding arbiter of consumer complaints outside of the court system essentially it examines complaints brought by consumer and attempts to mediate solution if mediation fails an arbitrator then makes decision on an appropriate remedy the firm involved in the dispute must accept the ombudsmans decision up to limit of 100000 approximately 18000020 the consumer involved has the option of rejec ting the settlement and opting for the court system to settle the dispute the fos is funded through fees and assessments on the financial services industry there is char ge to consumers for bringing complaint although the fos focuses solely on individual cases it has been recognized that some fos decisions could have wider impact the fsa and fos have signed memorandum of understanding on how to jointly proceed in such cases in 2000 guaranty fund the financial rvices compensation scheme fscs was created as provided for by the fsma although separate entity the fscs covers the range of busine sses banks insurers insura nce brokers mortgage banks investment firms that are regulated by the fsa the fscs operates on payas yougo basis with assessments levied each year on the industry based on expected need for the upcoming year each of the five industry groups has its own sub scheme and assessments ar based on the amounts needed for each industry there is crossindustry subsidization as fo r example between healthy banks and insolvent insurers each industry group has particular rules and limits for claims withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33439crs9 21 from the german bundesanstalt für

noncompulsory general insurance for example the fscs pays in full the first 2000 approximately 3600 and then 90 of the remaining claim germany germanys federal structure gives significant sovereignty to its 16 states while retaining large areas of governance for the federal government the majority of supervision over all financia l services is done by the federal government however insurance regulation is legally shared with the states the federal financial supervisory authority bafin21 is the primary federal regulator for financial services bafin was created in 2002 out of three previous regulators for banking securities and insurers it is responsible for overseeing all private insurers that are of material economic significance22 as well as any staterun or other public insurers that operate in more than one stat the states are responsible for single state public insurers and small private insu rers as with other eu states germany is responsible for harmonizing its insurance law with eu directives although now single entity bafin conti nues to have three separate structures overseeing banks securities firms and in surers it has created crosssectional departments on issues such as overall financial stability risk analysis and consumer issues bafin is responsible for both prudential and market conduct issues for federally regulated insurers and insurance intermediaries insurers may engage only in insurance and insurancerelated activities and there must be legal separation between life and propertycasualty insurers banks and insurers may be associated under the same holding company structure bafin conducts onsite examinations and has wideranging powers in cases where company violates either market conduct or prudential standards going as far as replacing the companys management or shutting company down following eu di rectives there is prior approval of either rates or forms but bafin does have the authority to examine forms that are in use for consistency with consumer protection laws for example there must be cooling off period with life insurance policies where the insured can cancel the policy with penalty and ther are various disclosure re quirements as well bafin does not have the authority to intervene in specific consumer complaints and there is governmentsponsored ombudsman as in the uk there are however private ombudsman services that seek to fill the sa role providing an alternative dispute resolution service with the private services companies are bound to accept the ombudsmans decision but only up to the sum of 5000 approximately 6200 less than 5 of the amount in the uk germany has private industryrun guaran ty fund for the life insurance industry which began in 2002 partic ipation in the life insurance fund

propertycasualty insurers it is possible that other insurers might step in and take over an insolvent insurer but there is legal requirement that this occur the netherlands following significant legal and market changes during the previous two decades including the removal of prohi bition on bankinsurer mergers in 1990 the netherlands began reforming its financia l services regulation in 2002 and largely completed the reform in 2004 three prev iously separate regulators the dutch central bank dnb the pension and insura nce supervisor and the investments board were consolidated into two regulators operating on the twin peaks model that was pioneered by australia few years befo re one regulator the dnb was made responsible for prudential re gulation while second th authority for financial markets afm was created to oversee market conduct regulation the dnb and the afm are the only direct regulators of insurance in the netherlands due to the countrys size and unitary governmental structure there are subnational structures playing role in insurance regulation the dnb licenses insurers separately for ven different life insurance lines and 18 different nonlife insurance lines specific legal entity cannot hold both life and nonlife insurance license the dnb has authority over all aspects of prudential regulation including testing for solvency capital requirements and investment rules it is implementing fair market value standard for both assets and liabilities and increasing its attention to the fitness and trustworthiness of comp any management in the case of insurer difficulty or insolvency it is authorized to direct an insurer to take specific steps to protect policyholders or can go as far as appointing receiver for the company and liquidating the company to pay off policyholders claims the costs relating to insurance oversight are funded by the insurance industry the afm oversees the market conduct of in surers and insurance intermediaries it issues licenses for those dealing with in surance consumers oversight by the afm is largely limited to enforcing information disclosure about insu rance policies with extra disclosure required for policies with an investment component it does not have authority to regulate insurance forms or ra tes the afm is funded through levies on the industries it oversees proportionate to the cost of the oversight there is insurance guaranty fund in the netherlands canada while much smaller than the united states canada shares somewhat similar federal structure with 10

regulate insurers although some facto sp ecialization at the different levels has occurred on the federal level the office of the superintendent of financial institutions osfi has authority over all federally chartered financial institutions osfi was created in 1987 through merger of separa offices overseeing banks and insurers osfis focus is prudential oversight th rough the formation and application of regulations ongoing risk assessment of financial institutions and intervention when necessary to mitigate risk canadian law regarding financial regulation is reviewed every five years in 2001 this periodic review resulted in new legislation strengthening osfis position as the primary federal regulator and increasing its oversight powers part of the reason for increased powers was change in the legal structure for financial institutions allowi ng increased concentration including for example holding company structure under which banks nd insurers can be owned by the same entity also in 2001 new agency the financial consumer agency of canada fcac was created to enforce federal consumer pr otection laws and promote consumer education osfi rema ins the prudential regulatory body and is the larger of the two entities according to their websites23 osfi employs approximately 425 people while fcac empl oys 35 both agencies receive their funding primarily through ssessments and fees on the in stitutions they regulate while osfi and fcac regulate at federal level each province or territory has legal authority to regulate provincially chartered insurers for both solvency and market conduct the provinces and territories also have the authority to regulate the market conduct of federally ch artered insurers including requiring provincial licenses and reviewing forms the precise struct ure varies between the different provinces and territories some have separate agency for financial institutions some regulate through the department of finance or ttorney general the canadian council of insurance regulators ccir serves similar function to the naic in the united states seeking to develop and harmonize insurance policy and regulation across jurisdictions24 like the naic however the ccir has authority to compel provinces and their regulators to follow its efforts at harmonization the legal structure may appear very dupli cative with both vels of government having somewhat overlapping oversight pow ers the system however has largely developed into split system wherein the federal government oversees the solvency regulation of almost all insurers even pr ovincially chartered one s and the provinces oversee the market conduct regulation of ll insurers osfi provides oversight of more than 90 of life insurance compan ies and more than 80 of property and casualty insurance firms as measured by assets some of this split is due to the fact that many insurers particularly life and h ealth insurers have c hosen to be federally chartered which puts them solely under ofsi for solvency regulation but it is also due to the choice by three of the provin ces including the largest ontario to voluntarily accept federal oversight of the solvency of provincially chartered insurers on the consumer side the fcac is recently created agency and is mandated tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33439crs12 25 apra website about apra home available at httpwwwapragovauaboutapraensure compliance only with federal consumer legislation given this and its relatively small staff it seems to be expected that the bulk of consumer regulation will continue at the provincial level one important difference when comparing the consumer regulation in canada and the united states is the issue of rate regulation while many us states require prior appr oval for rate changes or otherwise regulate rates for many lines of insurance rate regulation in canada is limited solely to automobile insurance rates and not every provinceterritory regulates these rates canada has two guaranty funds one for propertycasualty insurers the property and casualty insurance compensation cor poration pacicc and one for lifehealth insurers assuris while both funds are pr ivate entities run by the insurance industry all propertycasualty companies and nearly all lifehealth companies are required to be members as condition of licensure this applies to both provincially and federally chartered companies the funds keep some liquid assets on hand cdn120 million 104 million for assuri s and cdn62 million 54 million for pacicc but otherwise operate on post hoc basis they would be bolstered by assessments on the insurance industry in the event of an insolvency that required more assets than remained on the books of th insolvent insurer as is typical with many guaranty funds the canadian funds aim to ensure that smaller policyholders are protected to greater degree than larger policyholders in the event of an insurance company failure australia following significant deregulation of th financial system in the 1980s and early 1990s australia undertook reform of its financ ial regulatory bodies in the late 1990s financial system inquiry was created in 1996 and reporte d recommendations in 1997 many of these recommendations were put into place in 1998 including the abolition of the previous bodies supervisin g insurance banks and securities and the creation of two new federal agencies to oversee all financial institutions while the federal government is the preeminent insurance regulator the six states and two territories retain authority to regulate two main classes of insurance personal injury motor accident and workers compensation the two federal insurance regulatory ag encies focus on different areas the australian prudential regulation authority apra as the name suggests focuses on prudential regulation ensuring that f inancial promises made by institutions apra supervises are met within stable efficient and competitive financial system25 apra is responsible for granting and revoking insurer licences and has broad regulatory powers including setting minimum capital requirements assessing insurer assets and liabilities and reinsurance arra ngements should an insurer become insolvent apra oversees the insolvency and the settling of the companys affairs apra is largely funded throug h assessments and fees on the industry it oversees the australian securities and investments commission asic focuses on the market conduct of all fi nancial institutions it is responsible for the licensing of insurance agents and brokers its forcement power includes both investigating complaints brought by consumers and selfinitiated investigations it currentlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33439crs13 26 there are standard forms but an insurer ca n use make any changes to these forms as long as the changes are disclosed to the insuredsemploys about 1570 employees asic is funded in the australian federal governments general budget states play only small part in regulating insurance in australia their role is largely limited to two lines personal injury motor accident and workers compensation these two lines of insu rance are compulsory for drivers and employers respectively some of the state governments have created staterun monopoly insurers to provide for the insuran ce in others ther is state involvement in an insurer of last resort while allowing competition among private insurers for the rest of the market in general there is relatively little rate and form regulation by australian insurance regulators26 the primary exceptions to this however are the two lines that are stateregulated par ticularly in those states that run monopoly insurers both rates and forms for personal injury motor accident and workers compensation are set by the state regulators in the aggregate the rates are generally set to match claims so there is direct public subsidy to insurance consumers for these two lines forms for some other lines motor vehi cle home building and contents sickness and accident consumer credit and travel insurance are governed by statute with specific coverages and exclus ions required other lines are essentially unregulated with regard to forms there is guaranty fund in australia technical study on the possibility of fund was begun in 2004 policy conclu sions however have been reached in the case of an insurer insolvency the insurers remaining assets are liquidated and policyholders claims ranked with other unsecured creditors to be satisfied out of these assets policyholders do however enjoy priority with regard to any reinsurance proceeds subject to the discretion of the court there is priority for smaller policyholders japan japans financial services regulation like the rest of the governmental structure is centered in the national government in tokyo there is little subnational regulation of financial services firms in 1996 japan implemented significant deregulation of the financia l sector and shortly thereaf ter began restructuring of financial regulators prior to 1998 oversight authority fo r and regulation of private sector banks insurers and securities firms rested with the ministry of finance in 1998 the financial supervisory agency fsa was created under the direction of the prime ministers office the fsa was made responsible for supervision and inspection of financial services firms its power was expanded in 2000 and 2001 with the addition of responsibility for overa ll planning for the financial system and authority to dispose of fa iled financial institutions in 2000 the name was changed to the financial services agency unlike ma ny other countries th at have restructured their systems japan did not combine previ ously separate regulators or

and insurance intermediaries must be licensed but licensure is not limited to singlepurpose entities insurers may offer both life and nonlife insurance products and subsidiaries of ba nks and commercial firms may apply for insurance licenses the limitation to private insurers however is significant the japanese post office has acted as both bank and life insurer for many years in 2005 it held almost 39 of the life insurance assets in the country27 postal privatization law was passed in late 2005 when the japan post life insurance operation is pr ivatized it will come under fs authority up to this point however this share of the market has not been regulated by fsa or the ministry of finance before it in add ition there are cooperatives known as kyosai whose estimated share of nonlife insurance is as high as 25 of nationwide direct nonlife premiums28 these cooperatives are not s ubject to fsa regulation although legislation has been suggested to put th em under the fsa umbrella there are also governmentrun insurance programs incl uding the entire workers compensation insurance system and reinsura nce program for earthquake risks prior to financial sector deregulation in 1996 insurers in japan were required to follow the rates and forms published by cooperative rating bureaus and approved by the government as part of the dere gulation this system was abolished now rating bureaus publish suggested rates but in surers are not required to follow them prior approval of forms has been replaced by notification system allowing insurers to use forms after notifying and allowing fsa to review them specific regulation of rates and form s continues with the govern mentrun or required lines of insurance ie workers compensation eart hquake and compulsory
