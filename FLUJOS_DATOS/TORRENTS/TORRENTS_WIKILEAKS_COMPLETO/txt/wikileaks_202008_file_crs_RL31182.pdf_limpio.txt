established program for restructuring fhainsured mortgages for section 8 proj ectbased contracts which expire on or after october 1998 and have abovemarket re nts by restructuring mortgages and lowering rents the program reduces the federal costs of oversubsidized section 8 properties the 1997 law also created th office of multifamily housing assistance restructuring omhar in hud even though the act was signed into law in 1997 director for omhar was not appointed until year later and ope rating procedures for implementing the program were not establis hed until april 1999 for these and several other reasons the section 8 marktomarket program did not begin assign ing properties for restructuring until july 1999 in addition ow ners of properties with mortgages that qualified for the debt restructuring were very skeptical of participating in the program as it was initially operated by hud since then omhar has streamlined the procedures and guidelines of the program and has created an incentive package encouraging owners to participate in th past year momentum of the program has increased as of june 6 2002 accordin g to omhar 2159 projects have entered the restructuring process

background when the section 8 assisted housing program began in 1974 it was project based rental subsidy program designed to encourage developers to build apartments which would provide affordable housing fo r lowincome residents under this program the tenants paid 25 later raised to 30 of their monthly income as rent with the balance of the rent paid by the federal government dir ectly to the owner of the development the subsidy was attached to the unit not given to the tenant so that when one tenant moved out of the unit another eligible tenant could move in and the subsidy would continue many of the pr ojects rents were set higher than market rents of comparable unassisted units in the area permitting these higher rents was the federal governments way of encour aging the building of affordable housing throughout the 20 years of the original cont racts many of these properties received adjustments to the set rents when property costs increased due to heating and cooling bills or the need for rehabilitati on the rent also increased resulting in an increase of the section 8 subsidy in 1997 congress became concerned about the large number of insured multifamily properties in the federal hous ing administration fha portfolio that were also receiving section 8 assistance an examination of the portfolio found that approximately 10000 of these properties were receiving section 8 projectbased rental assistance and that substantial number of these had rents higher than the rents of comparable unassisted rental units in the same rental housing market congress believed that if changes to the section 8 projectbased program were not made the renewals of expiring contract s for section 8 assist ance would consume an increasingly large portion of the discretiona ry budget of hud in future years the problem facing congress was how to restru cture the program in way that would be beneficial to the families living in these projects costsaving for the federal government and attractiv to project owners in its investigation of the assisted multifamily properties congress also discovered that many of them were financially or physi cally distressed including number that were being managed congress decided that the economic physical and management problems of these federally insured and assisted projects could best be solved by reforms that reduced the cost of federal assistance while retaining the lowincome affordability and availability of the housing stock as result of these findings congress designed markto market restructur ing program which reduces the federal subsidies to owners of properties in sured by fha lowers the abovemarket rents payable to these owne rs and restructures the mortgages of properties so that owners can ope rate effectively on less incomehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31182crs2 this restructuring plan was known as the multifamily assisted housing reform and affordab ility act it was passed by congress as title v of the vahud

participating administ rative entities paes the multifamily housing reform act au thorized hud to enter into portfolio restructuring agreements with housing fi nance agencies public entities and nonprofit or forprofit organizations hud was require d to evaluate each of these agencies qualifications to administer the restructuring of mortgages and to notify the applicants as soon as possibl of their acceptance or rejec tion to act as pae paes must be involved in all cr itical functions of the restructuring process such as developing the rental assi stance plan screening owners and properties for markto market and monitoring the portfolio after restructuring hud is to utilize qualified housing finance agencies as much as po ssible for paes because they had shown expertise in providing affordable housing in the past the act also encouraged interested public and nonprofit organizations to form partnerships with other entities including public housing authorities phas private financial institutions and hous ing organizations such as fannie mae freddie mac and the federal home loan banks if they wished to act as paes screening owners and properties the mortgage restructuring program is voluntary and owners with expiring section 8 projectbased contr acts have the option of not renewing them if owners have expressed an interest in participating in the program paes are to screen owners to see if their properties are economically viable nd in good physical condition owners of properties that are approved by the pae then work with the pae in developing rental assistan ce plan for the development if properties have not b een properly maintained and the pae believes that federal funds for the project have not been us ed efficiently contract with that owner is not renewed hud can provide owners with the opportunity to remedy the situation and improve thei r properties or hud may tr ansfer the property to qualified purchaser usually tenant or ganization or tenant endorsed community based nonprofit agency the new owner is then eligible to participate in the restructuring program if contract for section 8 property is not renewed re sidents of the project will be informed early in the process and th ey will be given enhanced vouchers so that they may remain in their units owners who choose not to renew their section 8 contracts must notify hud and the tenants i n writing not less than 1 year prior to terminating the contract nd hud will provide tenantbas ed assistance for tenants residing in that property in addition th owner must send second notice to tenants of nonrenewal of the section 8 contract at least 120 days prior to contract termination if this second notice is not sent the owner may not evict the tenants nor raise their rents until 120 day notice of in tent to terminate the contract has been given and the time has lapsed concern of many tenant s has been having enough time to find affordable housing if an owner does not want to renew hi s contract in answer to this concern the reauthorizing legislation requires not only the owner but omhar or paehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31182crs4 1us congress house committee on appropriations department of veteran affairs and housing and urban development and independe nt agencies appropriations bill 1998 conference report 105297 105th congress 1st session washington us govt print off 1997 p 137 designated by omhar to notify tenants as soon as it is known that contract will not be renewed and also to inform the tenants of any assistance that will be available to them the mortgage restructuring plan originally the mortgage restructuring plan applied to section 8 projectbased properties with fhainsured mortgages and rents exceeding market levels as stated in the conference report on the 1997 act th program is an effort to reduce rent levels to those of market rate properties or at least to lower them to the minimum level necessary to support propert operations and maintenance1 properties undergoing mortgage re structuring and resetting rents to market levels are called full participants in the program the debt restructuring is designed to reduce the outstanding mortgages of section 8 property owners so that they can charge lower rents with reduced section 8 assistance this is done by restructur ing the mortgage debt into two mortgages the first mortgage is intended to be for an amount that the pae determines would be sustainable at lowe r rent levels the second mo rtgage is for the difference between the first mortgage and the orig inal amount of inde btedness immediately before the restructuring however if this amount is excessive the second mortgage can be limited to the amount that the pae determines the owner can be reasonably expected to repay the interest rate fo r the second mortgage is determined by the pae or hud but it can be higher than th applicable federal rate to make it easier on the owners of section 8 proper ties payment on the second mortgage is deferred until the first mortgage matures unless there is evidence of excessive project income if the second mortgage is held by hud and the project is purchased by tenant organization nantendorsed communitybased organization or public entity hud may modify terms of the mortgage or forgive all or part of the indebtedness owners who participate in the mortgage restructuring program must agree to maintain affordability and use restri ctions in accordance with regulations promulgated by hud which are intended to keep the property as affordable housing for lowincome tenants for at least 30 years the section 8 contract is also renewed for 20 years as amended in pl 107116 properties other than section 8 projectbased projects can now apply to participate in the marktomarket restructuring program properties receiving assistance under the emergency low income housing preservation act of 1987 or the lowincome housing preservation and resident homeownership act of 1990 may participate in the restructuring program ifhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31182crs5 2fair market rents are rent levels established by hud based on the rents of comparable unsubsidized units in standard metropolitan statistical area participation would facilitate the sale or transfer of the properties to other owners who agree to participate in the section 8 program rent restructurings some section 8 prope rties are physically and fina ncially sound so that owners do not have to restructure their mortga ges in order to operate successfully at restructured marketlevel rents owners of these properties are referred to as lite participants in the program unlike prope rties undergoing full restructuring of mortgages properties undergoing only rent restructuring have affordability or use restrictions on their properties in restructuring rent levels for expiri ng section 8 contracts paes are given great flexibility but any determination of rent levels is to be made in consultation with project owners and tenants in determining rent levels for restructured properties paes are to compare assisted units to similar units of unsubsidized properties and t rents at market levels if comparable units can be found in market area the restructured rents are to be set at 90 of the fair market rent levels2 if property with an expiring section 8 contract has rent vels that are below comparable market rent levels they are restructured at the market level and the contract is renewed for at least 5 ears hud has the discretion to conduct comparison of rents once during the 5year c ontract period to see if any adjustments to the rent are necessary if property has rents equal to or greater than the market rents for the area the rent restructuring for thes properties will permit rent s sufficient to cover budget based cost increases these budgetbased rents are intended to provide owners of the property reasonable rate of return after an adjustment is made for operating costs the act states that 20 of the projects being restructured may have budgetbased rents of up to 120 of the fa ir market rent for the area certain projects are exempt from these restructuring rent levels they include projects insured by state and local gove rnments projects funded under section 202 section 515 or the mckinney homeless assist ance act and properties with expiring contracts that house tenants who are partic ularly vulnerable such as the elderly disabled or large families and are located in areas where tenantbased assistance is difficult to use because of low vacancy rate s high return of unused vouchers or lack of affordable housing these projects if restructured are allowed to operate on budgetbased rents at higher level if n ecessary to keep the property as affordable housing hud is required to renew all budgetbased contracts for 5 years at the end of the 5year period hud will once again compare the property rent levels with comparable market rents to see if adjustments are needed httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31182crs6 some owners who would like to participate in the restructuring program may be told by the pae that their properties need to be rehabilitated in order to meet physical standards before their mortgage can be restructured contracts for such projects are to be renewed at budgetbased rents with an operating cost adjustment factor there are provisions in the re structuring program to aid owners with rehabilitation costs these provisions in clude the retention of residual receipts project reserves debt restructuring and the rehabilitation grant program concern of many owners when considering participating in the restructuring program has been the amount they have to contribute to the rehab ilitation of their property under the program the reauthoriz ing legislation main tains current law in requiring the owner to pay 25 of rehabilitation costs this provision was included in the law as safeguard against excessive rehabilitation costs and to prevent abuse the new law also states that if pae determines that significant new features beyond the rehabilitation are needed elevators r oof replacement aircond itioning etc the owner may be required to pay up to 25 of the cost as determined by the pae implementation of the restructuring program although the restructuring program wa s authorized in 1997 omhar was very slow in getting organized and the office did not begin to assign large volume of properties for restructuring until 1999 the law authorized hud to spend 10 million year for tenantoutreach on the mechanisms of the marktomarket program because the program was slow in gettin g started only about 15 million was spent in the first year omhar continued to pprove grants assuming that they would be paid for with unused funds carried over into the next fiscal year some legislators interpreted the original law as limiting fundi ng for the restructuring program to 10 million in any fiscal year with carry over of funds and omhar was accused of violating the antideficiency act which pr ohibits obligating government funds that have not been appropriated as re sult omhar underwent opm audits and an investigation by the inspector general of hud these audits and investigations concluded that there was wrong doing on the part of omhar because of this conf lict in allocating funds the r eauthorizing legislation clearly authorizes the secretary of hud to make available more than 10 million annually for the program in addition to any amounts carried over from previous years there are other factors which have cont ributed to slow start of the program for example some owners and paes have criticized the extensive requirements contained in omhars operating procedures gu ide as well as level of review and oversight which many paes believed slowed the proce ss down but did not result in improvements to the restructuring plans another major factor in delaying imple mentation of the program was the lack of interest or unwillingness of section 8 property owners to participate in the restructuring program many owners felt that they had incentive to commit their properties to the longterm use agreement that accompanies full mortgagehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31182crs7 3us general accounting office multifamily housing issues related to marktomarket program reauthorization gao01800 july 2001 p17 4ibid p19restructuring also many owners knew that rehabilitation would be necessary to bring their properties up to sta ndard for renewals of contract s and they were reluctant to contribute the required 25 of rehabilitation costs as prescribed in the law according to omhar some paes we re also responsible for the slow implementation of the program omhar claims that some of the paes were slow in submitting restructuring plans and that many of these plans were unacceptable omhar also noted that some paes did not have enough staff working only on the marktomarket plans without number of competing priorities3 finally omhar reports that at the time they were processing contract negotiations with some paes significan t number of propertie s entered into the marktomarket program causing processi ng delays and the need to temporarily extend some section 8 contr acts at above market rents omhar has taken action to address these factors attributed to the slow implementation of the restructuring program it has streamlined its operating procedures and revised its guidelines fo r appraisals and physical inspections of property in reviewing the restructuring plans omhar staff ve been instructed to ensure the reasonableness of the pa underwriting and compliance with the regulations rather than to spend time rewriting the restructuring plan4 in an effort to encourage section 8 owners to participate in the program omhar has put together an incentives package including monthly capital recovery payments and performance fees for dem onstrated sound management practices since these incentives have been offered there has been an increase in the number of section 8 owners requestin g full mortgage restructuring finally omhar has sought to aid paes in the completion of restructuring transactions by dispatching experienced unde rwriters to assist them and by providing specialized training for staff of paes at their request or if omhar sees need for such training as of june 6 2002 2159 properties d entered omhars marktomarket program of these about 52 are underg oing full mortgage restructuring and rent resetting levels 48 are undergoing lite restructuring only of their rents according to omhar there are appr oximately 3800 section 8 projectbased contracts which have above market rents and are pot entially eligible for the restructuring program pl107 116 reauthorizes om har through september 30 2004 and the restructuring program through september 30 2006httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31182conclusion without reauthorization of the rest ructuring program hud would still be required to renew section 8 contract rent s and many of them would have to be renewed at rents exceeding market levels or number of fhainsured properties could face foreclosures the result woul d be higher federal subsidies under the section 8 program while the beginnings of the restructuring program were slow once omhar overcame obstacles in setting up the office selecting paes and offering incentives to owners to particip ate in the program the volume of owners requesting restructuring has increased
