recommendations summary the house approved hres 463 on june 18 1998 to create the select committee on us national security and militarycommercial concerns with the peoples republic of china prc the committees sixmonth investigation looked beyond whether the satellite export policy resulted in missile technology transfers to china it also examined other transfers including high performance computers and nuclear weapon knowhow the committee made 38 recommendations for action by congress or the administration on december 30 1998 the bipartisan committee unanimously approved the final classified report issued on january 3 1999 the committee then released 3volume declassified version on may 25 1999 according to the committee the prc has stolen classified information on the most advanced us thermonuclear weapons giving the prc design information on thermonuclear weapons on par with our own the information includes classified information on seven warheads including every currently deployed thermonuclear warhead in the us ballistic missile arsenal on the neutron bomb and on number of us reentry vehicles the prc acquired information on seven us nuclear warheads including the w88 the most advanced miniature us nuclear warhead deployed on the trident d5 submarinelaunched ballistic missile the committee reported that us information accelerated prc nuclear weapon modernization and helping its efforts to fabricate and successfully test its next generation of nuclear weapons designs these warheads give the prc small modern thermonuclear warheads roughly equivalent to current us warhead yields the committee said that after three failed satellite launches in 1992 1995 and 1996 us satellite makers hughes and loral transferred missile design information and knowhow to china without required export licenses from the department of state in violation of the international traffic in arms regulations the firms gave technical information that has improved the reliability of chinese rockets used to launch satellites with civilian and military purposes the information is also useful for the design and improved reliability of future prc ballistic missiles there are number of questions for possible further study raised by the report including implications for us national security arising from the status of chinese nuclear weapons missiles intelligence and military technology the report noted that the united states retains an overwhelming qualitative and quantitative advantage in deployed strategic nuclear forces over the prcs up to two dozen css4 icbms nonetheless the report stated that in crisis in which the united states confronts the prcs conventional and nuclear forces at the regional level modernized prc strategic nuclear ballistic missile force would pose credible direct threat against the united states the cox report also noted that assessing the extent to which design information losses accelerated the prcs nuclear weapons development is complicated because so much is unknown representative spratt of the cox committee said that it is reach to say that stolen us nuclear secrets give the prc design information on thermonuclear weapons on par with our own he also noted that the report concludes that chinas rockets and missiles may have gained reliability but not range payload or accuracy contents origins and

computers and other dualuse technology the report made 38 recommendations this crs report summarizes the cox committees major findings discusses some issues for further study raised by its declassified report and summarizes the committees recommendations origins and scope of the investigation the new york times reported in april 1998 on the justice departments ongoing criminal investigation into whether loral space and communications ltd and hughes electronics corporation violated export control laws by helping china improve its rockets in reviewing an explosion that destroyed loralbuilt satellite in february 1996 the times also said that in february 1998 president clinton had waived sanctions imposed after the tiananmen crackdown in order to allow loral to export satellite despite the ongoing department of justice criminal investigation of lorals alleged earlier unauthorized transfer of missile guidance technology to the peoples republic of china prc the reports further said that bernard schwartz chairman of loral was the largest individual donor to the democratic party during the 1996 crs2 election cycle1 loral acknowledged that contrary to its policies loralled review committee provided report to the chinese before consulting with the state department export licensing authorities but says that it did not violate the law nor damaged national security loral said that schwartz was not personally involved and political favors or benefits of any kind were requested or extended 2 in addition to hearings held by number of committees in the 105th congress the house and senate began separate investigations in mid1998 those in the senate were led by senator shelby chairman of the intelligence committee which released its unclassified report on may 7 19993 house speaker gingrich announced on may 19 1998 that he would establish select committee headed by representative cox to investigate the various allegations on technology transfers to china the house approved h res 463 on june 18 1998 to create the select committee on us national security and militarycommercial concerns with the peoples republic of china hereafter the cox committee or committee and authorized it 25 million the committee had five republicans representatives cox goss hansen bereuter and weldon and four democrats representatives dicks spratt roybalallard and scott the committee carried out sixmonth investigation that included 34 meetings to conduct business or hear briefings from june 25 to december 30 1998 the investigation looked beyond whether the satellite export policy resulted in technology transfers to china it also examined other transfers including high performance computers hpcs machine tools and nuclear weapon knowhow4 on december 30 1998 the bipartisan committee unanimously approved the final 700page classified top secret report h rept 105851 that was issued on january 3 1999 the committee then worked with the clinton

appendices major findings the original focus of the investigation was on whether us satellite firms transferred technology useful for chinas missile program and on related policies of the clinton administration the committee broadened its examination to include events in the last two decades and subsequently turned its attention in crucial direction to examine whether china acquired nuclear weapon secrets after donald rumsfeld indicated problem in that area on october 15 1998 the committee then took testimony on two days november 12 and december 16 1998 from the department of energy doe the central intelligence agency cia and the federal bureau of investigation fbi on chinas suspected acquisition of us nuclear weapon information6 in early 1999 news media began to report on those more controversial concerns the following is summary of the reports major findings with the committees judgments of benefits for the chinese military the peoples liberation army pla questions for possible further study are discussed later nuclear weapons according to the committee since the late 1970s and almost certainly continuing today the prc has pursued intelligence collection that includes not only espionage but also review of unclassified publications and interaction with us scientists at the does national laboratories including alamos lawrence livermore oak ridge and sandia the prc has stolen classified information on the most advanced us thermonuclear weapons giving the prc design information on thermonuclear weapons on par with our own the information includes classified information on seven warheads including every currently deployed thermonuclear warhead in the us ballistic missile arsenal on the neutron bomb and on number of reentry vehicles of us missiles the prc acquired information 6 former secretary of defense donald rumsfeld led commission to study missile threats jeff gerth and tim weiner tracking the suspicions of chinas nuclear spying new york times may 23 1999 statement of representative spratt release of the select committee report on technology transfers to china may 25 1999 crs4 on seven us nuclear warheads including the w88 the most advanced miniature us nuclear warhead deployed on the trident d5 submarinelaunched ballistic missile slbm w88 deployed on the trident d5 submarinelaunched ballistic missile slbm w87 deployed on the peackeeper intercontinental ballistic missile icbm w78 deployed on the minuteman iii icbm w76 deployed on the trident c4 slbm w70 previously deployed on the lance shortrange ballistic missile srbm w62 deployed on the minuteman iii icbm w56 previously deployed on the minuteman ii icbm the committee focused on potential implications for us national security judging that the prc will exploit elements of the us design information on the prcs next generation of thermonuclear weapons the prc successfully tested smaller thermonuclear warheads in 1992 to 19967 prior to its july 1996 announcement of nuclear testing moratorium and its september 1996 signing of the comprehensive test ban treaty ctbt the committee reported that information lost from the doe labs accelerated chinese nuclear weapon modernization and helped the prc in its efforts to fabricate and successfully test its next generation of nuclear weapons designs these warheads give the prc small modern thermonuclear warheads roughly equivalent to current us warhead yields the prc could begin serial production of such weapons during the next decade in connection with the development of its next generation of solidfuel mobile icbms including the df31 that may be tested in 1999 and could be deployed as soon as 2002 although the prc currently deploys nucleararmed icbms with stolen us technology the prc has leaped in handful of years from 1950sera strategic nuclear capabilities to the more modern thermonuclear weapons designs regarding whether the prcs nuclear program continues to require testing the committee judged that if the prc successfully steals us nuclear test codes computer models and data and uses them with the us hpcs already imported the prc could diminish its need for further nuclear testing to evaluate weapons and proposed design changes as for the strategic balance the report noted that the united states retains an overwhelming qualitative and quantitative advantage in deployed strategic nuclear forces over the prcs up to two dozen css4 icbms nonetheless the report stated that in crisis in which the united states confronts the prcs conventional and nuclear forces at the regional level modernized prc strategic nuclear ballistic missile force would pose credible direct threat against the united states on the question of whether having smaller nuclear warheads would facilitate chinese development of multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles mirvs for its nuclear missile force the committee reported that it had information on whether the prc currently intends to develop and deploy mirvs missile and space technology 7 for information see crs report 971022 chinese nuclear testing and warhead development by jonathan medalia crs5 according to the committee the prc has stolen or otherwise illegally obtained us missile and space technology that improves the prcs military and intelligence capabilities after three failed satellite launches in 1992 1995 and 1996 us satellite makers hughes and loral transferred missile design information and know how to china without required export licenses from the department of state in violation of the international traffic in arms regulations the us firms gave technical information that has improved the reliability of chinese rockets used to launch satellites with civilian and military purposes the information is also useful for the design and improved reliability of future prc ballistic missiles specifically the committee found that in 1993 and 1995 hughes illegally recommended to the prc improvements to the fairing nose cone that protects the payload and in 1996 loral and hughes helped the chinese improve the guidance of failed chinese rocket and in so doing deliberately acted without the legally required license and violated us export control laws regarding hughes the committees report printed an unclassified assessment completed on december 18 1998 by the state departments office of defense trade controls that office concluded that in reviewing the chinese launch failure of january 1995 that involved lm2e space launch vehicle slv and the apstar ii satellite hughes engaged in technical discussions with the chinese without us government monitors that resulted in significant improvement to the chinese spacelift program and contributed to chinas goal of assured access to space moreover the lessons learned by the chinese are inherently applicable to their missile programs as well since slvs and icbms share many common technologies as for loral and hughes activities in 1996 the committee reported that 1998 interagency review determined that the technical issue of greatest concern was the exposure of the prc to western diagnostic processes which could lead to improvements in reliability for all prc missile and rocket programs the improvements to chinas missile program could come from increased production efficiency and improved reliability through adoption of improved quality control and reliabilityenhancing measures in design and manufacturing that were introduced after the accident investigation including some that the loralled independent review committee advocated the committee judged that the guidance system of the long march 3b rocket reviewed by loral and hughes in 1996 is among the systems capable of being adapted for use in the prcs planned roadmobile intercontinental ballistic missiles ie the df31 there were previous concerns that after the explosion that destroyed the loral built intelsat 708 satellite in 1996 classified us encryption boards were lost to china the committee reported that while the two fac3r encryption boards were not recovered from the crash site by loral they most likely were destroyed in the explosion while it is not known whether the chinese recovered the boards even if they did it would be difficult for the prc to determine the cryptographic algorithm that was imprinted on them and reverseengineering of damaged board would be even more difficult thus the national security agency remains convinced that there is risk to other satellite systems now or in the future resulting from having not recovering the fac3r boards from the prc contrary to earlier allegations of us assistance for chinas development of multiple satellite dispensers and mirvs the committee determined that motorola crs6 did not provide the prc with information on how to design the smart dispenser rather the prc built the smart dispenser indigenously to motorolas specifications the cox report agreed with earlier public assessments of the administration that in the 1990s the prc has deployed total of approximately 20 css4 icbms in silos but contrary to the white houses june 1998 announcement of detargeting agreement with china most of those icbms remain targeted on the united states nonetheless the report noted previous statements by us intelligence that the css 4s are deployed in their silos without warheads and without propellants during dayto day operations the committee judged that within 15 years chinas missile modernization program could result in the deployment of up to 100 icbms moreover if china aggressively developed mirvs it could deploy upwards of 1000 thermonuclear warheads on icbms by 2015 confirming suspicions of problems in chinas slbm force the committee reported that while china developed jl1 slbm to be launched from the plas xiaclass nuclearpowered submarine the prc has not yet deployed the jl1 slbm prc intelligence chinas pervasive efforts to obtain us military technology by any means pose challenges to the us counterintelligence and lawenforcement agencies the committee reported that johnny chung us businessman and democratic fundraiser told federal prosecutors that in 1996 he received 300000 from liu chaoying pla colonel aerospace executive and daughter of retired general liu huaqing and general ji shengde head of pla intelligence the committee determined that col lius payment to johnny chung was an attempt to better position her in the united states to acquire computer missile and satellite technologies on the question of chinese front companies the committee concluded that government and nongovernmental estimates of pla companies in the united states ranging from 2 to 30 have been far below the true figure and there are more than 3000 prc corporations operating in the united states some with links to the pla state intelligence service or with technology targeting and acquisition roles the committee revealed that in 1995 the cia obtained someplace outside of the prc secret prc document containing design information on the w88 and technical information on another five us thermonuclear warheads from walk in directed by prc intelligence the walkin volunteered various materials to the cia violations of technology safeguards and nonproliferation agreements in addition to alleged violations of us export control laws by us firms the cox report raised instances of violations by us firms and the chinese of the us china technology safeguards agreement first signed on december 17 1988 with new agreement signed on february 11 1993 including numerous lapses in security at the chinese launch sites crs7 the committee noted that there have been reports of additional possible chinese violations of the missile technology control provisions of us laws additional sanctions however have been imposed as result while some reports have raised possible chinese missile or space assistance for north korea the committee alleged that china may have helped north korea to build satellite that it claimed was launched on august 31 1998 but did not discuss chinese missile technology transfers to north korea dualuse export controls the committee noted that chinas chief source of military equipment is russia and that until recently the united states has lawfully transferred little military technology to the pla in part because of sanctions imposed after the tiananmen crackdown of 1989 however illegal transfers of us technology have been significant significant transfers of us military technology included those through the reexport by israel of advanced technology transferred to it by the united states the committee looked at dualuse both civilian and military technology and reported that us and multilateral export control policies and practices have facilitated the prcs efforts to obtain militarily useful technology during the bush administration the transfer of licensing authority over some commercial communication satellites from the state department to the commerce department in 1992 resulted in divided jurisdiction between commerce and state over satellite export licensing that facilitated the loss of us technology to the prc while remaining licensing authority over commercial communication satellites was transferred to commerce in 1996 during the clinton administration legislation passed by congress in 1998 properly reversed that decision us policies on satellite exports that rely on corporate selfpolicing to prevent technology loss have not worked because of the inherent conflicts of interest and lack of priority placed on security in comparison with other corporation objectives the united states has relaxed export control restrictions on hpcs since 1996 but the united states has effective way to verify that hpc purchases reportedly made for commercial purposes are not diverted to military uses the committee judged that china has in fact used hpcs to perform nuclear weapons applications hpcs could be useful for production of chinas next generation nuclear weapons and for maintaining the current chinese nuclear weapon stockpile for which test data exists although the exact mtops millions of theoretical operations per second range needed is unclear in addition to nuclear weapon applications the committee reported that the prcs use of hpcs for its military modernization poses risks to us national security the committee raised concerns about diversions of militarily sensitive technology from hong kong to china the cox report stated that with the reversion of hong kong to chinese sovereignty export controls on the prc were effectively liberalized on july 1 1997 permitting the transfer of many additional technologies of potential use to the pla without prior review by the department of commerce the committee said that us trade officials report that inspections by the hong kong regional government nor by any other government including the united states are permitted when pla vehicles cross the hong kong border the committee reported crs8 indications that sizeable number of hong kong enterprises serve as cover for prc intelligence services the report reviewed two previouslyreported cases of chinese acquisitions of machine tools from mcdonnell douglas in 1994 and of jet engine technology from allied signals garrett engine division in the late 1980s and early 1990s however the review did not assess the degree to which the prc has enhanced it aerospace and military industrial capabilities through the acquisition of us technologies and equipment in addition the report discussed chinese attempts to acquire composite materials and structures technology the report also noted that the prc probably cannot build stealth aircraft or missiles with the same capabilities as the f117 and b2 now or in the near future moreover the report said that even acquisition of these elements will be insufficient to permit the prc to build effectively stealthy aircraft or missiles system integration of stealth is major additional task facing the prc some questions for further study there are some questions for further study raised by the cox report these questions pertain to findings related to nuclear weapons missile and space technology prc intelligence and dualuse transfers nuclear weapons publicly the cox committee and the intelligence community agree that china has obtained classified information on more than one nuclear weapon including the w88 and the neutron bomb and on more than one nuclear reentry vehicle including the trident ii slbm china may have successfully tested and produced at least one new nuclear warhead based on us information but it reportedly has not deployed such weapon in its current arsenal according to the intelligence communitys damage assessment as publicly reported by the director of central intelligence dci8 us information has likely accelerated chinas program to develop future nuclear weapons and there is apparent modernization of the chinese deployed nuclear missile force or new nuclear weapons the cox report also stated that the main application of the stolen us thermonuclear warhead information will likely be to the prcs nextgeneration intercontinental ballistic missiles on whether china has obtained classified information on seven us nuclear warheads us intelligence and the administration have not publicly confirmed this extent of chinese acquisition the dci reported that the intelligence community found that 8 central intelligence agency the intelligence community damage assessment on the implications of chinas acquisition of us nuclear weapons information on the development of future chinese weapons unclassified release april 21 1999 hereafter the source for the dcis conclusions crs9 china obtained at least basic design information on several modern us nuclear reentry vehicles including the trident ii w88 china also obtained information on variety of us weapon design concepts and weaponization features including those of the neutron bomb we cannot determine the full extent of weapon information obtained for example we do not know whether any weapon design documentation or blueprints were acquired we believe it is more likely that the chinese used us design information to inform their own program than to replicate us weapon designs responding to whether china stole classified information on every deployed us warhead energy secretary richardson said on nbcs meet the press on may 30 1999 that certainly they stole information relating to the w88 and another warhead but there is evidence beyond that and the jury is still out on the extent of the damage he added that there are three confirmed cases of espionage in the 70s and the 80s the neutron bomb and the 90s is still being assessed he commented further that there is question that the chinese got some of our nuclear secrets on all seven i think that we still have to be absolutely sure representative spratt of the cox committee said that it is reach to say that stolen us nuclear secrets give the prc design information on thermonuclear weapons on par with our own9 he also stated that the prc has tested neutron bomb and w88 derivative but the prc has not replicated the w70 or the w88 he noted that there was too little time to conduct an independent investigation of chinese espionage targeted against us nuclear weapon secrets and the committee relied on few witnesses and did not substantiate their testimony with experts at the national laboratories or interagency review as result there are statements in the report that will not bear scrutiny he reported on the intelligence communitys best estimate of what the prc has obtained late 1970s design information on the w70 enhanced radiation warhead 19841988 design information on the w88 warhead and its reentry vehicle 19841988 classified but not design information on reentry vehicles and weighttoyield ratios of the w62 minuteman ii w76 trident c4 w78 minuteman iii and the w87 peacekeeper on the committees report that china stole additional neutron bomb data from us national weapon laboratory reported by us intelligence in 1996 news report said that the us government reportedly has evidence that china has been able to improve its neutron bomb nor that any of the nuclear weapon labs was involved in this case10 representative spratts statement on the release of the cox report added that the evidence is limited on the loss of neutron or enhanced radiation technology in the mid1990s and the information if stolen is esoteric physics that may have little military application 9 statement of us representative john spratt dsc release of the select committee report technology transfers to china may 25 1999 10 gerth jeff and james risen intelligence report points to second china nuclear leak new york times april 8 1999 crs10 beyond what specific information china obtained there is the issue of how the threat from chinas nuclear force might have increased the committee found that china stole modern us nuclear weapon information that accelerated chinas nuclear modernization and helped the prc in its efforts to fabricate and successfully test its next generation of nuclear weapons designs giving the prc small modern thermonuclear warheads roughly equivalent to current us warhead yields the cox report also noted that assessing the extent to which design information losses accelerated the prcs nuclear weapons development is complicated because so much is unknown moreover the full extent of us information that the prc acquired and the sophistication of the prcs indigenous design capabilities are unclear and there is the possibility of third country assistance to the prcs nuclear weapons program which could also assist the prcs exploitation of the stolen us nuclear weapons information in addition the dci reported that the intelligence community found that as of april 1999 the aggressive chinese collection effort has not resulted in any apparent modernization of their deployed strategic force or any new nuclear weapons deployment while the development of future nuclear weapons has probably accelerated because of the classified us information while the committee noted that experts believe that the prc currently has the technical capability to develop and deploy silobased ballistic missiles with mirvs there are still the questions of why china has not yet deployed mirvs and when china will deploy small warheads on mirv system the dci reported in april 1999 that china has had the technical capability to develop mirv system for its large currently deployed icbm for many years but has not done so us information acquired by the chinese could help them develop mirv for future mobile missile there could be implications for us national missile defense arising from future chinese modern nuclear missile force with mirvs there are the questions of whether china will continue its moratorium on nuclear testing and what are the implications of lack of further testing for chinas maintenance of older nuclear weapons as well as modernization of newer warheads representative spratts statement on the cox report said that the ctbt would impose major impediments on china while imposing minor impediments on us as the committee reported since signing the comprehensive test ban treaty ctbt in 1996 the prc has faced new challenges in maintaining its modern thermonuclear warheads without physical testing the report said that the prc likely does not need additional physical tests for its older thermonuclear warhead designs but maintenance of the nuclear weapons stockpile for these weapons does require testing the committee judged that the prc has likely developed only very modest complement of codes from inputting its own testing data into high performance computers the prc would therefore be especially interested in acquiring us thermonuclear weapon codes for any new weapons based on elements of stolen us design information the department of energy reports that the prc has in fact acquired some us computer codes indeed since the committee approved its report at the end of 1998 the fbi discovered that the prime suspect in the w88 case us scientist wen ho lee had transferred largely from 1994 to 1995 enormous volumes of files containing millions of lines of highly secret computer codes on nuclear weapon designs legacy codes crs11 from classified computer to an unclassified computer11 the fbi made that discovery upon checking lees computers in march 1999 after he was fired from alamos lab on march 8 and energy secretary richardson temporarily shut down the labs computers on april 2 1999 for security reasons one question is whether china has accessed us legacy codes missile and space technology while citing hughes alleged technology transfers to china the committee nonetheless noted uncertainty about potential military implications there are differing views within the us government as to the extent to which the information that hughes imparted to the prc may assist the prc in its ballistic missile development there is agreement that any such improvement would pertain to reliability and not to range or accuracy it is not clear at present whether the prc will use fairing that was improved as result of hughes disclosures in current or future ballistic missile program currentlydeployed prc ballistic missiles do not use fairings and the prcs future mobile landbased intercontinental ballistic missiles will probably not use fairing however fairings are used by the prc in launching military communications satellites and could be used for submarinelaunched ballistic missile the cox report also noted three issues for further investigation concerning hughes the kind of information that may have been passed to the prc beyond what appeared in the materials reviewed by the department of defense dod the application if any of coupled loads analysis to improving the accuracy and range as well as the reliability of prc ballistic missiles the likelihood that the prc will in fact incorporate this knowhow into their future missile and space programs as for lorals assistance to china in 1996 the committee noted that the inertial measurement unit imu of the lm3b rocket is considered an unlikely choice for the prcs next generation of icbms which require relatively small and lightweight imus although experience in improving the lm3bs imu will almost certainly benefit its designs of icbm guidance systems in the future the cox report noted that an interagency team concluded in july 1998 that the technical issue of greatest concern was the exposure of the prc to western diagnostic process and that the long march 3b guidance system on which loral and hughes provided advice is not likely candidate for use in future prc icbms representative spratt member of the cox committee noted that the report deals with the launch failure investigations of hughes and loral in detail and concludes that chinas rockets and missiles may have gained reliability but not range payload or accuracy moreover he added that china has acquired technology from loral and hughes that will improve the reliability of its rockets 11 risen james and jeff gerth us says suspect put data on bombs in unsecure files new york times april 28 1999 crs12 but the greatest contribution to reliability probably comes from having its rocket launches 28 to date paid for by someone else he stated that the most significant technology that hughes transferred to china was not the structural fix proposed for the fairing but the tutorial they gave their chinese counterparts in failure analysis and diagnostic techniques the same is true of loral the gain is hard to quantify because it goes to reliability and not the range payload or accuracy of chinese rockets and missiles12 the committee implied that exporting satellites to china for launch has harmed us national security interests saying that those interests would be advanced by avoiding the need for foreign launches through increased domestic launch capability the committee seemed to call for reassessment of the policy of satellite exports to china the reagan administrations decision to permit launches in the prc was affected by two factors insufficient domestic launch options in the aftermath of the challenger disaster and the perception of the prc as strategic balance against the soviet union in the context of the cold war these factors are longer applicable today launching western satellites has provided the prc with additional experience that has improved its space launch capabilities even in the absence of any loss of us technology such experience benefits potential longrun competitor of the united states it is uncertain how much us firms may have improved the plas launch operations as the committee noted pla personnel are involved in both rocket and icbm launches in the prc us firms have interacted with chinas commission of science technology and industry for national defense costind13 and its subordinate china launch tracking and control cltc and dualuse launch sites such as the xichang satellite launch center xslc while the committee reported that china is developing two roadmobile icbms and one slbm discussion included only the df31 icbm with mention of the df41 icbm reportedly under development for later deployment14 the status of the development of the df41 is left unclear prc intelligence there is agreement between the cox report and the intelligence communitys findings on the role of chinese espionage in obtaining classified information on us nuclear weapons at the same time the intelligence community found that the contribution of espionage relative to other efforts eg open collection and 12 statement of us representative john spratt dsc release of the select committee report technology transfers to china may 25 1999 13 for information on costind until it became civilian organization under the state council in march 1998 see crs report 96889 china commission of science technology and industry for national defense costind and defense industries by shirley kan 14 crs report 97391 china ballistic and cruise missiles by shirley kan crs13 indigenous development cannot be determined the cox committee also reported that china has used mosaic approach in its intelligence efforts that capitalizes on the collection of bits of information by large number of individuals and information on us nuclear weapons is obtained through espionage rigorous review of us unclassified technical and academic publications and extensive interaction with us scientists and department of energy laboratories issues for countering chinas varied collection efforts include how successful chinese espionage has been relative to acquiring opensource materials and how china conducts what one expert has termed an unconventional espionage program that tries to develop as many sources as possible15 there are questions about the credibility and motivation of the walkin who provided documents showing chinese possession of us nuclear weapon secrets as the cox report noted there is speculation as to the prcs motives for advertising to the united states the state of its nuclear weapons development chinese intelligence could have sought to raise the credibility of the walkin increase the credibility of chinas nuclear arsenal as deterrent to us intervention in regional crisis trigger disruptive spy hunt in the united states or raise suspicions of chinese students working in the united states to bring them back to china16 also china could have made major blunder or had another unknown objective in addition rival of the prc could have planted the documents in taiwan17 or the walkin could have sold them in selfinterest in any case as the cox report said chinese nuclear tests conducted from 1992 to 1996 had already raised suspicions in us intelligence that china had stolen us nuclear weapon information and the information provided by the walkin in 1995 definitely confirmed those suspicions regarding continuing penetration by chinese intelligence of the us national laboratories there are those who question how successful the effort will be given efforts to improve us counterintelligence on the may 30 1999 meet the press program representative cox addressed the energy secretarys denial that there is penetration by saying that penetration means simply that there are agents in place what secretary richardson i think will tell you is that the counterintelligence plans that we are now executing are designed to frustrate that espionage so that its unsuccessful while the committee concluded that there are more than 3000 chinese front companies in the united states the issues of the extent of those companies and their actual roles have been subjects of debate beyond the complications presented by the chinese presidents july 1998 ban on pla businesses estimating the total number of pla companies in the united states depends on whether the parent companies or their proliferating subsidiaries are counted depending on how they are set up it is also difficult to identify which companies are owned by the pla each of the 15 moore paul d spies of different stripe

technologies and xinxing corporation as reported by the defense department study by the aflcio found that eight of these parent companies may have number of us subsidiaries study by the rand corporation estimated that between 2030 of the plas companies are operating in the united states some estimate that almost 800 small chinese businesses are seeking technology and intelligence in the united states including some plaowned companies18 some observers say that many prc businesses in the united states including those owned by the pla are engaged in legitimate operations violations of technology safeguards and nonproliferation agreements the cox report cited instances of violations by us firms and the chinese of the uschina technology safeguards agreement including numerous lapses in security at the chinese launch sites questions concern the seriousness of violations of that agreement and the appropriate us response today to questions about the value of the agreement including whether new one should be negotiated the committee noted that the prc has proliferated nuclear missile and space related technologies to number of countries questions concern whether china has engaged in weapon proliferation and the administrations response and whether china might pass us nuclear weapon secrets to third countries such as pakistan and iran which have benefitted from chinese arms sales and other cooperation19 the intelligence communitys assessment noted that the answer is not known but cautioned that having obtained more modern us nuclear technology the chinese might be less concerned about sharing their older technology the committee also reported that there is information on further prc proliferation of missile and space technology but the clinton administration determined that the information cannot be publicly disclosed without affecting national security chinese retransfers of us nuclear or missile knowhow could present additional or greater threats to us security dualuse export controls the committee reported that while china agreed in june 1998 to allow us postshipment verification for dualuse exports including hpcs the usprc agreement is wholly inadequate the clinton administration denied the committee 18 crs report 98197 chinas militaryowned businesses by shirley kan hearing of the senate foreign relations committee november 6 1997 fiedler

pending as of november 12 1998 moreover the committee called into question the value of verifications in china noting that postshipment verifications establish only the physical presence of an hpc not its actual use as for the committees concerns about the prcs acquisition of militarily sensitive technology through hong kong the report noted that state department officials say that the current level of diversion activity is consistent with that which occurred before hong kongs reversion to prc rule the plas new role in hong kong and hong kongs post1997 customs enforcement may require closer monitoring recommendations upon approving the final report in late 1998 the cox committee made 38 recommendations for action by congress and the clinton administration the administration has acted or

enduse and enduser of such hpcs without notice by us nationals designated by the us government failure to establish such system by that date should result in the us governments lowering the performance level of hpcs that may be exported to the prc the denial of export licenses for computers destined to the prc or other appropriate measures an independent evaluation of the feasibility of improving enduse verification for hpcs in the prc and preventing the use of such hpcs for military purposes 28 recommended that congressional committees report legislation that requires efforts by the
