report 95669 by nancy jones 20 usc 1415e39discipline pl 10517 generally expands the authority of school officials to disciplin students with disabilities various protections however are built into the discipline provisio ns in order to safeguard the rights of disabled students the senat committee rep ort describes the provisions as striking careful balance between the leas duty to ensure that school environments are safe and conducive to learning for all children including children with disabilities and the leas continuing obligation to ensure that childr with disabilities receive free appropriate public education7 under prior law children with disabilities were not immune from disciplinar procedure s but neither were those procedures identical with those for childre n without disabilities due to history of exclusion of children with disabilities fro m education idea contains stayput provision that requires that during th e8 pendency of any due process proceedings conducted pursuant t this section 615 unless the state or local educational agency and th parents of child with disability agree the child shall remain in the then curren t educational placement of such child9 this provision was at issue in the supreme court case of honig v doe 484 us 305 1988 the court there dealt with case involving two chi ldren with disabilities who had engaged in activities such as breaking windows choking another student an d extortion the court found that there was dangerousness excep tion to the stay put rule but noted that the schools were not powerless to deal with dangerous children since they coul d suspend child for ten days use timeouts and ask court for n injunction to move the child if necessary in 1994 an amendment to idea often referred to as the jeffords amendment allowed schools to place chil d with disability who brings firearm to school in an interim alternative placement for 45 days if the parents request due proces s hearing this interim alternative placement is where the child remains during th pendency of any proceedings conducted pursuant to section 615 pl 10517 modifies the provisions in idea relating to changing the placement of children with dis abilities for disciplinary reasons although as noted in the section below on cessation educational services to children with disabilities may not cease one of the most controversial changes relating to placement is allowing hearin g officer to order change in the placement of child for not more than 45 days if the hearing officer determi nes that the public agency has demonstrated by substantial evidenc that maintaining the current placement of such child with disability i s substantially likely to result in injury to the child or others substantial evidence is defined as beyond preponderance of the evidencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97535crs6 osep memorandum 9516 22 idelr 531 june 1 199510considers the appropriateness of the childs current placement considers whether the public agency has made reasonable efforts to minimize the risk of harm in the childs current placement including the use f supplementary aids and services and determines that the interim alternative educational setting meets certai n requirements including services and modifications described in the child s current iep in addition to the new authority given to hearing officer pl 10517 als expands the use of interim alternative placements prior law is codified so schoo l personnel are given explicit authority to order change in placement or suspension for not more than 10 days to the extent such measures would be applied to children without disabilities school personnel may order change in placement to n appropria interim alternative educational setting if the child carries weapon t school or school function or knowingly possesses or uses illegal drugs or sells r solicits the sale of controlled substance while at school or school function thi s action may be for the same amount of time that child without disability would be subject to discipline but for not more than 45 days either before or not later than 10 days from taking this action the local educational agency lea must eithe r review an existing behavioral intervention plan or convene an iep meeting to develop an assessment plan to address the behavior pl 10517 provides that the alternative educational setting is to be determined by the iep team and that this setting must meet certain requirements the new legislation also contains specific language regarding manifestatio n determinations idea previously did not discuss what consequen ces occur depending on whether childs behavior is manifestation of disability or not however ed in its interpretation of the stat ute has found that school officials have more discretion in applying the same standards to children with disabilities as pply to children without disabilities if the action of the child with disability was not manifestation of that childs disability pl 10517 essentially tracks the existing ed interpretation but10 also provides fo r an expedited hearing when parent disagrees with determination that childs behavior was not manifestation of disability pl 10517 discusses where the child shall be placed during appeals regarding disciplinary action if the child has been placed in an interim alternative educational setting and the parents request hearing the child shall remain in that setting pending the decision of the hearing officer or until the expiration of the time periods specified whichever occurs first if the child is placed in an interim alternative educationa l setting and school officials propose to change the childs placement after th expiration of the interim alternative educational setting and hearing is requested the child shall return upon the expirati on and remain in the current placement that is the childs placement prior to the interim alternative educational setting if schoo l officials maintain that it is dangerous for the child to be in the current placemen thttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97535crs7 for more detailed analysis of this case and the issue of cessation generally e11 cessation of educational services and the individuals with disabilities education act crs report 97258 by nancy jonesduring the pendency of the due process proceedings the lea may request n expedited hearing these provisions differ from pri or law as expressed in the jeffords amendment in that the child will not remain in the interim alternative educationa l setting for an indefinite period of time while waiting for an appeal to be decided issues involvin g the discipline of children with disabilities have been among the most contentious in the reauthorization process pl 10517 reflects an attempt to balance concerns based on history of exclusion of ensuring the provision of n appropriate education for children with disabilities with concerns regarding schoo l safety school officials have often argued that the previous process of obtaining an injunction to remove an allegedly dangerous child if the parents do not agree is too burdensome on the school the legislat ion addresses this issue by providing for new but limited authority to hearing officers some have argued that this is too muc h authority to b vested in hearing officer who may tend to be more favorable to the schools on the other nd this approach especially with the limitations enunciated in the new language arguably provides for quick and impartial solution t maintaining safe schools cessation of educational services the cessation of educa tional services for children with disabilities has also been one of the more controversial issues during the reauthoriza tion of idea pl 10517 does not allow the cessation of ed ucational services for children with disabilities who are expelled the legislation specifically requires t hat to be eligible for assistance under idea the state m ust ensure that free appropriate public education is available to l children with disabilities residing in the state including children who have bee n suspended or expelled from school ed has interpreted the requirement for free appropriate public educatio n fape in prior law as meaning that educational services must continue for l children with disabilities even those who are excluded for misconduct that was not manifestation of disability however the department found that these educational services could be provided in the home an alternative school or in another setting eds interpretation was called into question by the fourth circuit court f appeals decision in virginia department of edu cation v riley 106 f3d 559 4 cirth 1997 in this case the court found that the plain language of idea does t condition the receipt of idea funds on the continued provision of educationa l services to children with disabilities who are expelled or suspended and that therefore educational services are not required for these children the legislation11 changes this result by providing specific language prohibiting cessation attorneys feeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97535crs8 for more detailed discussion of

relating to any meeting of the iep team unless such meeting is conven ed as result of an administrative proceeding or judicial action as under prior law the legislation provides that in any action or proceedin g brought under section 615 court in its discretion may award reasonable attorneys fees as part of the costs to the parents of ch ild with disability who is the prevailing party these fees are to be based on rates prevailing in the community in which the action or proceeding arose for the kind and qu ality of services provided and bonus or multiplier may be used attorneys fees are not to be awarded for service s performed subsequent to the time of written offer of settlement if the offer is made within certain specif ied times the offer is not accepted within 10 days and the court or administrative officer finds that the relief finally obtained by the parents is not more favorable to the parents than the offer of settlement attorneys fees including for services performed after rejected offer of settlement may be paid to parent who is the prevailing party and who was substantially justified in rejecting the settlement offer attorneys fees may also be reduced in certain circumstances including where the parent unreasonably protracted t he final resolution of the controversy however fees may not be reduced if the court finds that the state or local educational agency unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the action or proceeding or there was violation of section 615 there are some new provisions on attorneys fees for example althoug h courts have been split on whether attorneys fees can be awarded for iep meetings the measure specifically limits such awards in addition as discussed in the section below on mediation awards for attorneys fees may be limited for mediation in some circumstances new provision is added allowing for the reduction of attorneys fees where the parents attorney did not provide the school district with the appropriate informa tion in the due process complaint adding the provision requiring tha t12 information be provi ded was described in the senate committee report as facilitating an early opportunity for schools and parents to develop common frame of reference about problem s and potential problems that may remove the need to proceed to due process 13 mediation pl 10517 adds specific sections to idea

allocation formulas pl 10517 substantially changes both the state and substate formulas in th grants to states and preschool programs in general awards will be based on broader populati on factors rather than counts of disabled children served because of th significant cha nge in formula factors several additional provisions are added to help mitigate shifts in allotment patterns among states grants to states program the measure outlines new scheme to distribute aid under the grants to states program key features of the new distribution system are trigger appropriations level of 49 billion that would have to be reache d before the new state formula would take effect new state formula with broader population factors that would distribut new money states would receive base amount equal to their awards in the year before the trigger appropriations level was reached broader population factors that would distribute 85 of new money on the basis of total population within the age range that states provide fape eg 321 years 15 of new money would be distributed on the basis of total population in poverty within the age range that states provide fape minimum grant provisions that would ensure that each state received at least some increase in the first year that there is new money and in any year that there is more new money to distribute than the year before maximum grant provisions that would limit state grant increases in the firs t year that there is new money and in any year that there is more new money to distribute than the year before new substate formula for distributing aid to l ocal school districts and eligible state agencies that would take effect wi th the new state formula leas would receive base award equal to what their grant would have been in the last year before the trigger was r eached as if the state had distributed 75 of its award to leas new money would be allotted 85 on the basis of public an d private school enrollment within leas and 15 on the basis of the number of childre n living in poverty within leas there would be minimum r maximum grant provisions for leas preschool program the measure also contai ns new formula provisions for the preschoo l program in general the new provisions for the preschool program ar identical to those outlined for the grants to states program the key difference is that there is trigger appropriations level that must be reached before they becom operational the base year is fy1997httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97535crs11 educational improvement pl 10517 attempts to improve educational results for chi ldren with disabilities the measure focuses these effort s in three main areas ieps performance goals and assessments the iep is mandated document for each child with disability that amon g other things spells out the specific special education and related services to b provided to the child among the more significant changes made by the legislation concerning the development and contents of the iep are the iep team each childs iep must be developed by team of educators the measure expands the membership of the iep team to include i f appropr iate the teacher of the regular education classroom where the chil d would be placed special fac tors the measure requires the iep team to take into account five factors in the p reparation of the iep these factors address the special needs of disabled students who have behavior problems are limited englis h proficient blind have special communication needs or special technolog needs contents of the iep the measure requires that each childs iep relate th programming for the child to achievement in t he general education curriculum further the iep must include the modifications needed to allow the child to participate in state or districtwide assessment programs or an explanation of why the child would not participate and how the child would be assessed in addition the iep must reflect any parental input prior law did not call for performance goals under the measure states ar required to establi sh goals for the performance of children with disabilities further states must establish performance indicators to gauge progress toward the goals states must report on their progress in meeting the goals every 2 years prior law was silent on the participation of disabled students in assessment s given to students at large under pl 10517 states are required to include children with disabilities in general state and districtwide assessment programs wit h appropriate accommodations states and local districts must develop alternativ assessments for those disabled children who would not be able to take the genera l assessments by july 1 2000 states are required with certain exceptions to publish reports on the performance of disabled students on regular assessments by late r than july 1 1998 and on the performance of disabled students on alternativ assessments by later than july 1 2000 local relief pl 10517 seeks to provide relief to local school districts from the expense s associated with idea the three m ain areas where new provisions attempt to lessenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97535crs12 the funding burden are the maintenance of effort requirement fiscal accountabilit rules and interagency coordination of the financial responsibility for services under prior law leas generally had to expend at least as much on specia l education and relate d services as they did in the previous year this is known as the maintenanc of effort requirement the measure allows local districts to spend certain amount less then they did in the pr evious year when federal appropriations for the grants to states program exceed 41 billion and larger local awards result in any year that more than 41 billion is appropriated then lea may reduce it s expenditure of local funds by an amount equal to up to 20 of the increase in it s idea allotment from the prior year for instance if the grants to states progra m appropriation was above 41 billion and that resulted in an idea allotment to lea 100000 larger than its allotment the previous year then the lea could reduce its local spending on special education by 20000 20 of 100000 in effect some of the benefit from rise in federal appropriat ions over 41 billion would go towards local relief under certain circumstances however state would be authorized t prevent lea from taking advantage of this new relief provision some critics of idea have argued that its accountability rules unnecessaril restrict practices that could benefit other students while doing harm to disable d children pl 10517 reflects this view and sanctions incidental benefits flowing from the use of idea grants leas are specifically allowed to use idea aid fo r special education and related services for disabled pupil in regular class even i f nondisabled students benefitted on an incidental basis as under prior law states must have interagency agreements on the financia l responsibility of state and local public agencies for the services guaranteed to disabled children under idea the measure strengthens state coordination of interagency resources among other things each states interagency agreement or mechanis m must ensure that public agencies assume the finan cial responsibility for idea services that they also provide before leas are required to pay further public agencie s otherwise obligated under federal or state law or assigned the responsibility t provide or pay for service required under id ea would have to fulfill that obligation or responsibility special purpose programs pl 10517 significantly alters the special purpose programs of idea th number of special purpos programs decreases from 14 to 3 in new part d of the three new programs one represents new federal initiative while the other two are merging and consolidating of previous programs the state pr ogram improvement grants program is new idea initiative the program will m ake competitive grants to states for special education reform states would use at least 75 and under limited
