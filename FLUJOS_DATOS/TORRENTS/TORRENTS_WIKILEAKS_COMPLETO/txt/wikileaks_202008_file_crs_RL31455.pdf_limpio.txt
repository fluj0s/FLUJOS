congress at least once every 10 years according to an explicit schedule that grouped functionally related activities together in the house the sunrise approach which emphasized clear statements of

96th congress s 2 as passed by the senate in 1978 was re introduced and again reported among 70 other sunset bills introduced was hr 5858 which incorporated elements both from s 2 and from sunrise proposals and thus was said to represent combined approach to improved oversight sunset measures continued to be introduced in each congress but interest declined in the 1980s when growing federa l budget deficits d to preoccupation in congress with appropriations decisions however recently sunset has received renewed attention in the 1990s the enactment of various reform laws such as the government performance and results ac t of 1993 107 stat 285 which reflected aspects of the sunrise perspective evid enced resurgent concern with oversight of federal programs in 1998 for the first

definition sunset is the popular name for statute which provides for the periodic termination of gove rnment agencies unless they are able to justify their existence3 the idea of sunset thus st resses legislative oversight of government agencies so as to further economy and effici ency and control the growth of government or bureaucratic sprawl4 sunset measures typically contain two basic components an acti onforcing mechanism carrying the ultimate threat of elimination and framework or guidelines for the system atic review and evaluation of past performance with sunset programs and agencies automatically terminate on periodic basis unless explicitly rene wed by law termination of budget authority for program or agency after specified time is perhaps the most commonly employed mechanism othe r possible actionforcing tools include periodic expiration of the orga nic statute establishing an agency or of the rules and regulations issued by an agency ideally the timetable for

example in federal legi slation of the nascent sunset concept occurred in the federal advisory committee act of 1972 faca5 the sunset provision in faca called for the termina tion of each advisory committee after two year period unless some othe r duration was provided in statute or unless it was formally renewed for another two years the sunset idea was refined and populari zed by the colorado chapter of the public interest group common cause as consequence of the frustrations experienced in efforts to reform colorado s regulatory structure perhaps borrowing from the western imagery of the cowboy riding off into the sunset agencies subject to sunset provisions were to fade into the sunset unless following oversight review the legislature acted to extend their existence or sunset might be viewed as the inescapable end of the day for terminated agencies however the basic rationale underlying the sunset concept was not new in 1976 article by bruce adams then with co mmon cause the sunset mechanism was commended as having the potential to provide the incentive and the discipline necessary to motivate public officials to increase program evaluation but its roots were traced back at least to the administr ation of president franklin d roosevelt former justice william douglas th chairman of the securities and exchange commission proposed to pres ident roosevelt that every agency should be abolished within ten years of creation the pr ophetic douglas suggested that otherwise the regulatory agencies would be captured by the very industries they were established to regu late according to douglas roosevelt would always roar with delight at that and of course never did anything about it6 in 1976 colorado became the first state to enact sunset law by 1982 sunset measures had been considered in all 50 state legislatures and 36 states had enacted some version of the sunset review process representing remarkably rapid diffusion of state innovation7 however state experiences proved to be mixed by 1990 12 of the 36 states with sunset laws had ceased the use of this legislative oversight mechanism because of high monetary and temporal costs of sunset review intensive lobbying by vested interest s unfulfilled expectations of agency termination low levels of citizen par ticipation and other pe rceived problems s till the study stated results indicate that suns et has resulted in some ag ency terminations and more importantly numerous substantive procedural and crosscutting modifications aimed at increasing accountability efficiency nd effectiveness in

the process so as to shift the emphasis away from occupational licensing and regulatory boards to major state agencies downplay the goal of terminating agencies use sunset to conduct program ev aluation and commit sufficient staff resources to conduct the thorough reviews of agency operations9 unintended consequences of sunset have proved significan t as legislatures expand and sharpen oversight capabilities when the lawmakers come to realize that eliminating agencies need not be the only measure of sunsets effectiveness in addition for some states sunset provi des the primary

on emerged and grew quickly during the 94th congress when many bills were intr oduced pr oposing various types of sunset arrangements18 the first federal sunset bill s 2067 limiting the period of authorization of new budget authority and requiring comprehensive review and study of existing programs for which conti nued budget authority was proposed to be authorized by committees of congress wa

committee which broug ht him to the realization that budget reform must not be viewed as an end in its elf but as part of broader effort he continued i have come to believe that matter how successful the new budget process is the statement of national priorities which is the federal budget will not be complete until congress improves control over the services which the budget is intended to buy s 2925 has been offered as framework through which congress can begin to exert such control19 senator roth the ranking minority member on the subcommittee voiced concern also mentioned by others as reason to s upport sunset the pro liferation of federal programs during the past decade congress in its desire to address national legislative priorities has enacted hundreds of new programs aimed at specific social or economic problems each program has added new legislative objectives more spending and an administrative apparatus in the executive branch to achieve the legislative purpose set forth while each of these programs may have considerable merit and while much of our spending for national needs is well spent the practical effect of this pr oliferation of programs has been chaos20 as the leadoff witness for the senate hearings in 1976 roy ash former director of the office of management and budget omb also considered it noteworthy that s 2925 follows hard on th heels of the highly desirable reforms made in the congressional budget pr ocesses he testified further authorizing programs and appr opriating money is not enough for each program the simple questions to be kept in front of us are what are we trying to accomplish how much will it cost is it worth it are we actually accomplishing what we intended should we change something in order to achieve better match of objectives and results this is the closed circle model of program management in its essence21 after acknowledging his full agreement with the principles and philosophy underlying s 2925 ash offered some sugge stions for improving the mechanisms involved in so doing his testimony pr ovided preview of the 33 witnesses who followed almost everyone supported sunset principles but had some problem with details of the procedural framework ie sunset mechanics for example comptroller general elmer staats and others from the general accounting office gao supported the purposes of sunset but then

voted unanimously to re port s 2925 favorably with additional amendments on august 4 1976 the bill as reported retained its two key sunset components termination of federal programs unless periodically reauthorized coupled with mandatory review of prog rams grouped functiona lly by congressional committees specifically the measure directed the compilation of an inventory of all federal programs establishe d multiyear schedule for re view of programs grouped by functional budget categorie s and prohibited the obliga tion or expenditure of new budget authority for any program not sp ecifically reauthorized under the sunset rubric however significant changes occurred as result of full committee amendments including extendi ng the review and termination cycle from four to five years extending the coverage of the s unset review process to tax expenditure provisions and adding new title to cr eate temporary hoovertype commission to study the organization of the gove rnment and recommend program changes consolidations and eliminations on the day it was reported from the senate government operations committee s 2925 was rereferred to the committee on rules and

the be ginning of the report the committee is reporting s 2925 without prejudice but is st rongly advising the senate that much more time than is available in this cong ress should be devoted to the consideration of this apparently desirable but most farreaching proposal22 at the beginning of september 1976 sena majority leader mike mansfield dmt announced the leaderships intenti on to consider s 2925 on the floor later in the month the bill by this time had 55 cos ponsors however given the numerous reservations on procedural grounds outlined in the report of the senate rules committee and

ideological spectrum the short title of s 2 as introduced was sunset act of 1977 but it was changed more than once dur ing subsequent consideration in the senate the senate subcommittee on intergovernmental relations held six days of hearings on s 2 in march 1977 and on ap ril 28 1977 voted favorably to refer the bill as amended to the full committee action by the governmental affairs committee occurred on june 28 1977 and c oncluded with unanimous vote to report the bill favorably with additional amendments including renaming it as the program evaluation act of 1977 one am endment relating to the review and evaluation provisions reflected compromise between those who contended that sunset must be comprehensive and those who argued that to be effective sunset must be selective under title i all programs which are to be reauthorized must first be reconsidered by the authorizing committees with an eye toward answering certain basic questions about the program under title iii the senate and house committees can select from among these programs few which they believe ought to receive special attention thus the bill guarantees that the application of the sunset process can be both comprehensive in its requirement for reauthorization and selective in the program areas subject to intensive evaluation23 other amendments to s 2 adopted by g overnmental affairs lengthened the sunset review cycle to six years deleted the title covering tax expenditure provisions exempted regulatory functions and the fe deral judiciary from sunset review and added language protecting ci

in s 2 as reported by the rules committee the reauthorization schedule was lengthened to 10 years five congresses contemporaneous article appearing in congressional quarterly provided this perspective on the rules committees consideration of sunset legislation in the 95th congress in 1977 s 2 had little trouble winning approval from the governmental affairs committee but muskie could not persuade rules committee chairman howard w cannon dnev to set deadline for committee action cannon opposed automatic termination of federal programs which muskie considered the heart of the bill when cannon moved over to chair the senate commerce committee in 1978 muskie found more sympathetic leader on rules but the new chairman claiborne pell dri still took several months to move s 2 through committee27 supporters of sunset in the senate f aced additional challenges once the rules committee had reported s 2 as amended apparently both majority leader robert byrd dwv and majority whip alan cranston dca among others still had reservations about sunset and wanted to see some further changes in s 2 according to the same congressional quarterly article theyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31455crs10 28 ibidwere concerned that procedures established by the committee bill would make some federal spending programs highly vulnerable to presidential vetoes or filibusters to calm these fears and get his bill scheduled muskie devised procedural safety valve that would allo w congress to vote for continued funding of program one year past its sunset date if the programs reauthorization bill ran up against veto or filibuster28 following further negotiations senator muskie introduced an amendment in the nature of substitute for s 2 on ptember 26 1978

committee added new title to s 2 to be called sunrise and embodying two basic features 1 congress should state specific legislative objectives when enacting new legislation or reauthorizing existing

measures during this period received continuing support from the carter administration candidate jimmy carter ndorsed the idea of sunset laws during the 1976 campaign and reaffirmed this commitment on various occasions for example in his 1979 state of the union address he stated my administration will again work with the congress to enact sound sunset bill under such bill each federal program would have to be carefully re examined on periodic basis to determine whether its continued existence is justified through such procedure the american people can be assured that unnecessary government programs and agencies will be ended rather than continued through the force of inertia and other programs and agencies will be improved34 later in the spring of 1979 as the house rules committee

in 19811982 however interest in sunset measures declined in the 1980s when growing federal budget deficits led to preoccupation in congress w ith appropriations decisions as result the authorization phase of the budget process so central to the sunset framework received relativel less attention in the 1990s the environment was changi ng enactment of various government reform laws such the

measures renewed interest in sunset accompanying these developments there appeared to be renewed interest in the sunset concept for example at the end of 1997 an article appeared in insight on the

for the periodic review of the efficiency and public need for federal agencies to establish commission for the purpose of reviewing the efficiency and public need of such agencies and to provide for the abolishment of agencies for which public need does not exist was introduced by representative kevin brady rtx and eventually had more than 80 cosponsors modeled on the state sunset process in texas the bill called for establishment of 12member federal agency sunset commission to review and ma ke recommendations at least every 12 years regarding the reorganization or abolishment of each federal agency with the schedule for review to be determined by the commi ssion the speaker of the house and the majority leader of the senate were to appoint the members each naming four congressional members and two private citizens with experience in the operation and administration of governme nt programs each agency was then to be abolished later than year after completion of the review by the commission unless congress acted to continue the agency criteria for review by the commission were set forth including the extent to which the agency was complying with the provisions of the government perfo rmance and results act at the hearing on hr 2939 held on september 14 1998 testimony was received from congressman brady and other mbers in support of the bill from patricia gray then vicechair of th texas sunset commission and from edward deseve ombs acting deputy director for management ms gray stressed that sunset is process rather than an event her statement provided examples of how sunset had b een used as tool for uncovering fraud waste and abuse she also noted the value of sunset reviews in locating duplication of services as well as highlighting discre pancies and gaps in services in sum according to ms gray the sunset process is an efficient way to respond to increased public demand for accountability from elected officials40 mr deseve from omb stified that the clinton administration opposed the bill in their view the provisions of hr 2939 raise serious constitutional concerns are counterproductive to many recent improvements congress and the administration have made to support government reform and accountability and duplicate existing structures for evaluating agency performance on the part of authorizing and appropriating committees of congress as well as by the executive branch41 arguably the most serious criticism of the bill raised at the 1998 hearing concerned potential constitutional problems with the commission framework

provided for th record referenced the ins v chada decision by the supreme court in 1983 and concluded because this bill hr 2939 would allow the abolishment of statutorily created executive agency not through legislation passed in conformity with article i but at the discretion and in accordance with timetable imposed by twelvemember commission composed of eight members of congress and four persons selected by the speaker of the house and the majority leader unless congress affirmatively decides to adopt legislation preserving the agency it violates the constitutionally required separation of powers42 similarly examination of the bill by the ameri can law division of the congressional research servi ce ended with this view as noted above the statutory scheme pr oposed by the federal sunset act hr 2939 is suspect due to the circumventi on of the bicameralism and presentment requirements of article i in light of the supreme courts ruling in ins v chada and subsequent cases it seems that the federal sunset act in its present form constitutes an impermissible assignment of legislative authority and will not survive constitutional scrutiny43 in the 106th congress congressman brady along with 92 cosponsors introduced hr 2128 revised version of the sunset commission legislation this new bill contained provisions not found prev iously in hr 2939 first new subsection was added under r eview and abolishment of federal agencies relating to extensions that would have allowed th deadline for abolishment of the agency absent congressional action to reauthorize it to be extended for an additional two years if approved by supermajority of the house and the senate second new section was added providing for compila tion by the three congressional support agencies of program inventory in language reminiscent of federal sunset measures dating back to the 1970s the sec tion would have directed the comptroller general of the general accounting office and the director of the congressional budget office in cooperation with the director of the congressional research service to prepare an inventory of federal programs within each agency for the purpose of advising and assisting congre ss and the commission in carrying out the requirements of the act on june 28 2001 congressman brady with 33 cosponsors reintroduced virtually the same bill now called the abolishment of obsolete agencies and federal sunset act of 2001 in the 107th congress as hr 2373 on april 23 2002 the house government reform subcommittee on civil service census and agency organization held

commission as outlined in the legislation was similar to the proposal fo r sunset review board that president bush endorsed during the 2000 campaign furt her according to the testimony from omb sunset review process could tie in with the presidents management agenda particularly in the governmentwid initiative for budget and performance integration45 three witnesses from the private sect or also testified in favor of the measure46 afterword the initial enthusiasm with which the sunset review process was greeted in the 1970s has been tempered by mixed experien ces in the states from high of 36 states with some sort of sunset proce ss in the early 1980s the number has declined to fewer than 20 that have indisputable sunset review provisions still operating in 2002 of course from the outset sunset laws varied greatly among the states in terms of comprehensiveness types of ag encies or programs covered as well as regularity reviews on predictable fixe d schedule versus sporadic evaluations the record of the sunset process in texas is of particular interest because sunset review there is considered among the most expansive in the nation according to presentation at the national conference of state legislatures annual meeting in 2001 overall the sunset review process has been very successful in xas due to several factors including strong legislative support and the fact that all state agencies are subject to this type of review47 in assessing whether sunset remains an effective and necessary tool ken levine assi stant director texas sunset advisory commission suggested looking at whethe r the sunset review makes government work better smarter and fast er saves money and conti nues to challenge the status quo and eliminate bureau cratic inertia48 as noted

legi slative oversight function as lawmakers came to realize the eliminating agencies was not the only measure of sunsets effectiveness another state that signifi cantly revamped its sunset process is washington as originally established in 1977 the proces s focused mainly on minor or inactive programs so most sunset studies had little impact performance was also often difficult to assess due to lack of measures or data the sunset process was scheduled to expire in june 2000 but rather than terminating it the decision was make to streamline and strengthen the process the new law sought to place greater responsibility on agencies to demonstrate performance results by requiring them to submit performance measures and data collection plans to the joint legislative audit and review committee jlarc49 comprehensive sunset law for the fede ral government has been the subject of continuing interest for nearly three decades most recently there was hearing by house subcommittee in april 2002 but such legislative proposal has progressed further than passage by one house the senate in 1978 however as noted above the 1993 enactment of the governme nt performance and results act

information about fe deral programs and performance in turn they establish new mechanisms and means for congressional oversight or the review monitoring and supervision of the imple mentation of public policy51 at the recent hearing on hr 2373 the omb representative referred to the presidents management agenda and the initiative directed to budget and performance integration with the related
