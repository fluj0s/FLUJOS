summary in november 9 meeting charge kubiske and minister of defense nelson jobim discussed next steps in the united statesbrazil bilateral security relationship the potential sale of usorigin fighter aircraft and regional security jobim showed strong interest in furthering security cooperation by signing the defense cooperation as soon as possible and completing an information security agreement jobim told charge that there would not be any decision on fighters until sometime after his return from international travel on november 23 and said that capability technology transfer benefit to brazils industrial capacity and price would be the criteria for decision he offered signs of encouragement that the us bid would be chosen 2 c speaking of regional security issues jobim all but acknowledged presence of the farc in venezuela offered suggestion for building colombiaecuador confidence along their border and possible bordermonitoring arrangement for combating the drug flow between colombia and brazil jobim indicated concern about the contents of an usaf budget document which linked us military access to bases in colombia with unfriendly governments as evidence of lack of understanding of latin america he believed that recent inflammatory statements from presidents uribe and chavez are aimed at domestic constituencies on the eve of upcoming elections and called potential uribe run for third term terrible precedent for bolivarian governments in the region presidential foreign policy advisor marco aurelio garcias public offer only two days later to monitor border activities as way to reduce tensions between colombia and venezuela shows jobims influence despite the gobs tendency to blame colombia for current tensions its efforts to maintain peace are sincere and should be encouraged end summary structuring the usbrazil security relationship 3 c brazilian defense minister jobim expressed support for moving forward with usbrazil security cooperation first by signing the defense cooperation agreement dca then moving on to other arrangements including information security agreement gsomia jobim said he would see secdef gates at the international security forum november 20 in halifax and could sign the dca there if it were ready if not jobim would like to sign before the december 1011 bilateral working group jobim also favored moving forward with an information security agreement saying he would be discussing the issue with the ministry for external relations mre note polmiloff discussed the information sharing agreement with mre polmil advisor marcos pinta gama last week pinta gama was interested in moving forward as well and planned to consult with the mod end note fx2 fighter competition 4 c asked about the fx2 competition minister jobim repeated previous statements that the fx2 fighter competition would be based on capability technology transfer benefit to brazils industrial capacity and price technology transfer will be evaluated in terms of how it will contribute to brazils future industrial capacity the charge reiterated and deepened advocacy points in each of these areas calling decision to select the us bid an accelerator for an already growing usbrazil military and commercial relationship jobim informed the charge that he and president lula will review the brazilian air forces technical analysis of the three competing bids after he returns from international travel november 23 jobim will then make recommendation to president lula lula in turn will make decision and inform the national defense council for its concurrence brasilia 00001315 002 of 002 the uscolombia dca and regional implications 5 c jobim said he was aware of the purpose of the agreement giving the united states access to colombian bases but the availability of an air force budget memo over the internet which cited unfriendly countries in the area had complicated matters he said the document showed complete lack of understanding of latin america and said he had had to discuss the issue with the president to urge moderation from lula 6 c jobim then went into lengthy discussion of security in the andean region including colombiabrazil colombiavenezuela and colombiaecuador dimensions with colombia at the center of the regions potential instability he noted that both presidents uribe and chavez have been making statements aimed at domestic constituencies that have contributed to tensions between them jobim also was critical of uribe seeking third term move which he thought set bad precedent for the bolivarists jobim stressed brazils moderate approach and willingness to build confidence in particular by providing aerial surveillance of border regions and by sponsoring exchanges of information on military movements in border areas asked about the presence of the farc in venezuela jobim said that were he to acknowledge its presence there it would ruin brazils ability to mediate 7 c comment minister jobim was eager to discuss security agreements and animated about the regional issues but was clearly not comfortable talking about the fx2 competition while he has been prominent in the press in recent days saying that past problems with usg tech transfer in reality export licensing cases undermined confidence in usg assurances about the super hornet sale he did not raise this concern with charge and avoided the opportunity to discuss any lingering concerns he might have in discussing the eventual fx2 decision he tried to downplay the importance of price but instead highlighted contributions to brazilian industrial capacity given that the boeing offer would integrate brazilian companies with boeings global business and thus offers excellent potential for longterm economic gain this should be good news and we pointed that out however president lula may choose different means of evaluation brazils 2008 defense strategy requires that purchase of foreign made aircraft be made only if such purchase will lead to indigenous production of more advanced aircraft should the political goal that brazil should someday export fighters to its neighbors even if market conditions make this possibility remote trump brazilian air force analysis of the aircraft and real economic possibilities lula and jobim will most likely favor the french or swedish offers both of which highlight the possibility of export production 8 c comment continued within two days of the charges discussion with jobim presidential advisor marco aurelio garcia went public with brazils willingness to help ease colombiavenezuela tensions through border monitoring including aerial surveillance this announcement shows jobims closeness to lula on security issues and once again highlights brazils desire to be the continents peacemaker although the gobs continued questioning of the intent of the uscolombia dca and insistence on painting uribe as the primary source of andean tensions may limit the gobs effectiveness we believe the gob genuinely seeks to reduce tensions and we should encourage these efforts kubiske
