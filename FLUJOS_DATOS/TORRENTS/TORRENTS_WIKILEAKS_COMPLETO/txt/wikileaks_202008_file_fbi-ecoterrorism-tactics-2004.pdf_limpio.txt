sensitive unclassifiedlaw enforcement sensitive unclassifiedlaw enforcement sensitive intelligence assessment april 12 2004 tactics used by ecoterrorist s to detect and thwart law enforcement operations u environmental extremists consistently study and disseminate the methods tactics and legal guidelines under which law enforcement offi cials operate in an effort to expose law enforcement undercover agents sources and cooperating witnesses literature appearing in print form or on websites sympathetic to the anim liberation front alf earth liberation front elf stop huntingdon animal cruelty shac and anarchist groups provides detailed instructional material on variety of topics including ways to evad andor thwart law enforcement methods u one of the earliest examples of this type of instructional material is david foremans eco defense field guide to monkeywrenching segments of which cont inue to circulate on the internet within the anarchist and radical envi ronmentalist communities foreman was founding member of earth first in the 1980s despite being written in 1985 th book is still referenced by anarchists and animal rightsenvironmental ex tremists as useful howto manual u law enforcement officials should be particular ly cognizant of the sections of ecodefense that deal with the identification of undercover law enforcement officers confidential informants and cooperating witnesses among the admonishme nts listed in the book are the following monkeywrenchers term used to designate saboteurs are urged to study who has access to information now believed to be in the hands of the police and notice anyone who suddenly attempts to distance themselves sic foremans book notes often confidential informant is used to introduce the infiltrator to the group so that she will be more readily ccepted thus law enforcement officials should recognize that merely using an existing source to gain access for an undercover agentofficer might not be sufficient for establishing the officers credibility ecodefense warns that potential undercover officer s may assume roles outside the target organization that could incr ease access for the officer the book further advises favorite is to pass themselves off as writers or members of the news media or even as someone hoping to produce documentary fo r public access televi sion ecodefense also suggests that undercover agents may pose as fense attorneys in an effort to gather information from recently arrested activists the book also asserts that undercover agents fr equently pose as utility workers or phone company repairmen for the purpose of gaining ccess to suspects living quarters the book asserts that once access is obtained the ag ent is free to plant listening devices or observe illegal activities to justify search warrant the book advises readers to demand identification and verify th repairmans legitimacy unclassifiedlaw enforcement sensitive unclassifiedlaw enforcement sensitive finally ecodefense warns incarcerated activists that jailhouse snitches may seek information for law enforcement authorities u ecodefense offers several ways to detect law forcement sources or undercover officers including applying strict operational security measures in preparation for acts of ecoterrorism the book cautions activists to compartmentalize operational plans and to limit foreknowledge of the target to one person within the cell revealing the target only route to the action the book further admonishes that in such cases be spicious of someone who suddenly has to make phone call after learning the target or other plan ssuffice it to say that such operations should only be undertaken by small groups of people who have known each other for years and have previously operated together u with individuals suspected of being an in formant or undercover agent the book recommends tactic known as baiting essentially providing the suspected agentinformant with singular information designed to provoke law enforcem ent response specifically the book suggests concocting fictional future attack and providi ng the details of the attack to the suspected informantagent according to ecodefense if the suspected undercove r agent is the only one provided with this information and the police make the appropriate respons you have reasonable proof that the suspect is indeed an agent the book suggests that this process can be employed against several people at one time by providing each individual with similar but slightly different information asserting that the law enforcement re sponse will indicate which i ndividual is acting as an informantundercover agent u ecodefense identifies additional methods by which informants or undercover officers may expose themselves including seeking information for which they have need to know attempting to get people to repeat previous in criminating statements ostensibly to record the statements casting suspicion on others to di vert suspicion from themselves volunteering for clerical or leadership roles within an organization in hopes of gaining access to information about the group showing nervousness during an action leaving meetings or actions briefly to make phone calls probing for detailed information eg names time s dates locations etc indicating that an informantagent may be taping the conversation repeatedly discussing illegal activities even after conversa tion has shifted to unrelated matters regularly inquiring about individuals believed to be leaders of group expressing particularly radi cal or inflammatory ideas u to thwart the efforts of law enforcement officials specifically undercover operations and confidential sources the book provi des several tips to current or prospective ecoextremists unclassifiedlaw enforcement sensitive unclassifiedlaw enforcement sensitive activists are urged to follow needtoknow ru in which detailed information regarding planned direct actions is compar tmentalized and restricted to the individuals involved in the action activists are advised that when an individual wi thin the group expresse s reservations about specific direct action that indi vidual should be removed from th direct action cell this removal should be done gradually without stroying personal bonds to the individual thereby reducing the individuals incentive to retaliate by cooperating with law enforcement authorities the book cautions activists to be leery of i ndividuals that introduce new members to the group and then suddenly disassociate themselves from the organization the suggestion is that the new member may be an undercover agen t and that the existing member may in fact be law enforcement informant similarly activists are advised to be suspic ious of group members that are arrested for criminal charges with connection to the groups goals or objectives for instance individuals arrested on drug char ges become vulnerable to law enforcement recruitment with promises of leniency in return for cooperation finally activists are encouraged to sever any contacts with the socalled criminal element such as violent gangs or drugtraffickers wa rning that such groups are teeming with law enforcement informants u in addition to the methods and tactics discusse d above ecoterrorists promote and follow strict operational security with respect to comm unications employing encryption in electronic communications and avoiding telephonic conversati ons about criminal activity ecodefense also illustrates that ecoextremists are aware of tradi tional law enforcement investigative techniques including analysis of telephone r ecords mail covers vehicle track ing and consensual recordings u ecodefense is merely one of the many documents within the ecoextremist movement demonstrating the movements indepth study an d knowledge of law enforcement techniques and methods of operation by closel scrutinizing potential informants and undercover agents eco terrorists are more capable of th warting successful law enforcement penetration law enforcement officials should be cognizant of the abovementi oned tactics and recogn ize that ecoterrorists closely study law enforcement tactics procedures and policies as result creative undercover scenarios must be carefully pla nned and adequately backstopped this assessment was prepared
