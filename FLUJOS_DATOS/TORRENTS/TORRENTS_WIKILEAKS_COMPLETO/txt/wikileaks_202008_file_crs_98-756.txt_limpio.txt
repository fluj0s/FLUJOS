information research specialist knowledge services group defense authorization and appropriations bills fy1970fy2008 summary the passage of the department of defense dod authorization and appropriations bills through congress often does not follow the course laid out in textbooks on legislative procedure tracking dod authorization or appropriation bills can often be confusing and timeconsuming this has been particularly true in recent years when continuing resolutions crs containing the dod and other appropriation bills have been passed in lieu of the 12 regular appropriations bills for the entire us government this report is research aid which lists the dod authorization bills table 1 and appropriations bills table 2 for fy1970fy2008 this report includes all the pertinent information on the passage of these bills through the legislative process bill numbers report numbers dates reported and passed recorded vote numbers and vote tallies dates of passage of the conference reports with their numbers and votes vetoes substitutions dates of final passage and public law numbers key definitions are also included this report will be updated as legislative activity warrants contents the dod authorizationappropriations process 1 methods of voting 2 definitions 25 list of tables table 1 authorization bills 3 table 2 appropriation bills 15 defense authorization and appropriations bills fy1970fy2008 the dod authorizationappropriations process congress oversees the defense budget primarily through two yearly bills the defense authorization and defense appropriations bills tables 1 and 2 present the department of defense dod authorization and appropriations bills the authorization bill establishes the agencies responsible for defense and sets the policies under which money will be spent it authorizes the money to be spent the appropriations bill actually appropriates the money ideally the authorizationappropriations process should proceed in an orderly sequence with each step of the process generating part of the paper trail all of these steps should be documented in the congressional record as well as in many other official documents of congress in private publications such as congressional quarterly weekly report and united states code congressional and administrative news usccan and on the internet httpthomaslocgov in the simplest case the process begins with the presidents submitting his proposal initially formulated by dod and formally submitted by the president through the white house office of management and budget to the defense authorizing and appropriations committees then for example for the defense authorization bill hearings are held by the appropriate house committees and subcommittees the bill is marked up and an authorization bill is reported out usually with written numbered report this bill is debated in the house amended or not as the case may be and passed by the house with the vote noted in the congressional record in the simplest situation this bill would then be sent to the senate debated and passed however the senate can amend the house bill or report out its own bill debate amend and pass it if each chamber passes its own version the stage is set for conference committee to harmonize the two versions this usually results in printed conference report which is then voted on by each chamber to complete congressional action on the bill which then is sent to the president for his consideration ideally after the authorization bill is passed the appropriations bill goes through this same process although conceptually sequential process authorization and appropriations bills can be considered at the same time or even passed in reverse order crs2 other patterns also emerge for instance the senate can report out bill then substitute the text of the senate bill for the text of the bill passed by the house while retaining the house bill number the house can also use this procedure senate or house bill can also have part of the other chambers bill inserted into it or can be so heavily amended that it is unclear whether it is the senate or house bill that is really being passed other circumstances can also occur which make it hard to track bill and its contents bills are sometimes reported out without reports instead of recorded votes in which each member is recorded as voting for or against the bill voice votes can be taken in which individual members vote can be identified bills can be approved by unanimous consent even though they may contain thousands of separate provisions thus making it impossible to say for sure if member really supported particular provision senate bills can be reported out before house bills an appropriations bill can be passed before an authorization bill sometimes after the september 30 fiscal year deadline has passed and work has not been completed on the regular appropriations bills congress passes continuing resolution cr instead of some or all of the 12 separate bills that fund the operations of the government the cr can be temporary or permanent each year is unique and it is rare that the usual pattern is followed there are several types of votes voice votes teller votes division votes and unanimous consent votes but only when there is recorded vote will there be vote number and vote tally in the congressional record the section below is based on methods of voting in the house and senate putting members positions on the record from congressional quarterlys guide to congress 4th ed 1991 pp 430 431 methods of voting division vote those in favor or opposed stand and the chair takes head count only vote totals are announced and there is record of how individual members voted recorded vote members vote electronically each recorded vote is given sequential number and vote totals plus how each member voted are recorded in the congressional record teller vote an older method in which members were counted as they passed between chair appointed tellers for the ayes and noes only vote totals announced and record of how individual members voted unanimous consent vote usually reserved for noncontroversial legislation voice vote the presiding officer calls for the ayes and then the noes members shout in chorus on one side or the other and the chair decides the result crs3 table 1
