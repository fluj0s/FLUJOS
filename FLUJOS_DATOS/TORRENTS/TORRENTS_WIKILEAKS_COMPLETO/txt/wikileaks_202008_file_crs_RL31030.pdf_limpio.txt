organization by contract or grant for sectarian worship instruction or proselytization with one exception the 1996 welfare law all measures require religious organizations to segregate government

prohibit discrimination by faithbased provider against beneficiary for refusal to actively participate in religious practice prohibiting denial of services for this refusal hr 7 does not contain this prohibition hr 7 alone explicitly allows faithbased provider notwithstanding any other law to require its employees to adhere to its religious practices hr 7 and the two substance abuse measures require the g overnment to notify beneficiaries and applicants of their right to an alternate provider the 1996 welfare reform law is the only measure to state that its charita ble choice provisions do not preempt any provision of state law that prohibits or re stricts spending of state funds in or by religious organizations httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31030contents background 1 major arguments of

voucherscomparison of proposed charitable choice act of 2001 with current charitable choice law background charitable choice is set of provisions in law intended to allow religious organizations to provide fe derally funded services from specifically named programs on the same basis as any other nongovern mental provider without impairing the religious character of the organizations or the religious freedom of recipients charitable choice does not cont ain special funding for faith based organizations and it applies only to programs designated by congress the 1996 welfare reform w pl 104193 put the first charitable choice language into federal law applying it to the block grant program of temporary assistance for needy families tanf2 in 1998 congress extended charitable choice rules to grants under the community services block grant act pl 105285 and in 2000 to grants for prevention and treatment of substance abuse under the public health service act pl 106310 and pl 106554 the 2000 republican platform proposed to apply charitable choice to all federal social service programs in their 2000 pl atform democrats said they believed that faithbased programs should augment not replace government programs hr 7 proposes to apply charitable choice rules somewhat modified from those of the tanf law to 11 program areas and activities tanfs charitable choice rules apply to wide range of activities some of which may overlap with activities listed in hr 7 sponsored by representative watts and introduced on march 29 as the community solutions act of 2001 hr 7 was referred to the committees on ways and means and the judiciary the m easure embodies two major components of president bushs faithbased initiative namely tax incentives to expand private giving title i and expansion of charitable choice title iii pr oposes permanent program of individual developm ent accounts financed with tax credits the hr 7 charitable choice proposal has resulted in several congressional h earings the first ever conducted on charitable c hoice and has aroused much controversy as of june 25 the charitable choice act had not been introduced in the senatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31030crs2 major arguments of supporters to fund only secular programs discriminates against religious programs it is just as inappr opriate for government to favor non religion as to promote one religion over another faithbased programs can attract large amounts of volunteer time staff have sense of mission that inspires those they serve these organizations often help in ways that government cannot providing love as well as services guidance and friendship as well as meal or training charitable choice has been carefully written to protect constitutionalvalues charitable choice rules protect the religious character of faithbasedproviders they specify that relig ious organizations shall retain control over the definition developm ent practice and expression of their religious beliefs charitable choice rules protect the religious liberty of beneficiariesthey require that if recipient objects to the religious character of the provider the government must provide an alternate and accessible provider major arguments of opponents charitable choice may lead to unconstitutional use of governmentfunds to promote specific religious practice or belief since money is interchangeable government funds given for secular purpose could indirectly help to fund the organizations religious purposes undermining g overnmental neutrality toward religion charitable choice rules would require government to decide what is legitimate religion and what is not what is preaching and what is not direct government grants to re ligious groups could make churches dependent on government eroding their mission and tending to secularize them charitable choice promotes gove rnmentfunded discrimination by allowing religious organizations that receive federal dollars for their services to hire and fire on the basis of religious beliefshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31030 crs3 table 1 comparison of charitable choice act of 2001 with current charitable choice law
