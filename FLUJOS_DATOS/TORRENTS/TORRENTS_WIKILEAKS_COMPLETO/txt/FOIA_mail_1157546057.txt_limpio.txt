from michael mann mannmeteopsuedu to tim osborn tosbornueaacuk subject re followup date wed 06 sep 2006 083417 0400 replyto mannpsuedu cc scott rutherford srutherfordrwuedu keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk xflowed tim thanks bunch this all sounds very good were finalizing pseudoproxy paper for jgr based on the various tests w the csm simulation i showed in wengen and will send you guys copy once its finalized natural followup would be similar analysis applying to the echog simulation and we would enjoy collaborating w you and keith on this we were also thinking of doing some mixed signal analyses where the pseudoproxies represent combinatiiion of temp and precip including limiting cases of pure temp and pure precip this might be natural way to incorporate the echog results well let you know if we have any trouble w format etc thanks again mike tim osborn wrote hi mike and scott below are details about accessing the echog data from the sop webarchive there are time series plots of various variables and regions that might be useful for quick overview of whats going on plus the temperature fields and fields for other variables can be accessed in netcdf format hope that format is ok if not i can make conversion for you but that wont be till next week id like to add to keiths reasons why wed like to be involved in the outcome of analysis of these data the extra reason is that we keithme are free to use these data and thus by extension you can too provided we collaborate fidel gonzalezrouco or gkss arent yet ready to make them completely open access preferring to consider each 3rd party request and decide on that basis i did ask eduardo zorita about making them available for pseudoproxy challenge after the wengen meeting but i havent yet followed up to find out his decision the bottom line is that they might well make them available for you to do your own thing with but if you are happy to collaborate with us then you can definitely use them immediately the data are available from here httpwwwcruueaacukcruprojectssoapdatamodelechoghtm near the bottom you will find the link to the passwordprotected model data this includes the time series plots too the login details for this are soapech od2004 the 2m air temperature is 3rd in the list of variables erik is the simulation will all forcings enat just has natural forcings through to the present the easiest way to get all the monthly 2m air temperature fields for erik is to use wget there is help for how to use wget if you arent familiar the site was designed to be fairly self explanatory hope you find it so if not please just ask best wishes tim at 1830 05092006 michael mann wrote sure thing keith thanks and of course well keep you fully in the loop on our findings im copying to scott as hes the one who will probably obtain the data from tim thanks again got to go teach now mike keith briffa wrote mike simply missed the first and been away since second message forwarding to tim to arrange access to these data i am assuming hans will not mind but best not say anything yet we wish to be involved in this follow up please as it will be soap product and tim especially and i did stuff to get these data produced and in form for dissemination i am rushing now to austria for week cheers keith at 1351 28082006 you wrote keith i didnt receive response to my previous inquiry so im resending also copying to phil in case you havent been reading email for some reason we would like to run our regem analysis through the echog simulation results it appears that the results of that simulation have been widely disseminated to other groups and yet they are not publically available to our knowledge as per your previous suggestion we would be grateful if we could acquire the surface temperature field for the simulation from you for some analyses were doing thanks in advance for any help mike michael mann associate professor director earth system science center essc department of
