in miami during december 1994 34 leaders of the western hemisphere agreed to create free trade area of the americas ftaa by 2005 at the second summit of the americas held in april 1998 in chile the leaders formally launched negotiations to create ftaa in accordance with the march 1998 san jose ministerial declaration this report evaluates the status hurdles and opposition to this objective absence of us fast track negotiating authority remains key obstacle to more rapid movement in this direction this report will be updated periodically hemispheric free trade status hurdles and opposition summary at the 1994 summit of the americas in miami 34 countries in the western hemisphere agreed to complete negotiations to create free trade area of the americas ftaa later than the year 2005 since the summit two approaches have emerged for promoting hemispheric free trade the first approach involves the expansion and deepening of subregional groupings such as mercosur the southern cone common market and the proliferation of bilateral free trade agreements most all countries of the western hemisphere except the united states have been active in this process the second approach entails formal negotiations to construct the ftaa by progressively reducing barriers to trade and investment under this approach the trade ministers from the 34 countries agreed on the structure organization and venue for the ftaa negotiations at meeting held march 17 1998 in san jose costa rica and the negotiations were officially launched by the heads of state at the second summit of the americas held april 1819 1998 in santiago chile there are at least two different perspectives on how much overall progress has been made over the past four years in advancing hemispheric free trade some observers maintain that the official launching of the negotiations at santiago combined with the proliferation of subregional groupings and bilateral free trade agreements are all strong evidence of accelerating hemispheric integration other observers hold that the formal ftaa negotiations are likely to lose momentum or drag on interminably and that hemispheric integration may be evolving in manner that is hurting us interests if one assumes hemispheric free trade is desirable objective several major hurdles stand in the way of moving more rapidly in that direction the most important obstacle is absence of fasttrack procedures for implementing trade agreements tacit assurance that congress will not demand changes in trade bargains struck by the president is considered key to persuading us trade partners to engage in substantive negotiations in addition vast differences in size and interests of the negotiating countries combined with the possibility that new round of multilateral trade negotiations may be launched in the near future could undermine the ftaa negotiations while the vision of hemispheric free trade was put forth by president bush eight years ago the amount of popular support in the united states for this goal remains unclear 1996 public opinion poll found that 57 of the american public was opposed to new free trade agreements with latin america while 1998 poll found 36 opposition sources of opposition within the united states can be seen in continuing debate on the benefits and costs of hemispheric free trade as well as on the efficacy of regional free trade agreements per contents status of movement toward hemispheric free trade 1 progress in harmonizing norms 3 movement toward free trade 5 hurdles 6 fasttrack authority 6 divergent country interests 7 opposition 8 benefits and costs of hemispheric free trade 8 economic benefits and costs 8 geopolitical benefits and costs 11 debate over regional free trade agreements 12 hemispheric free trade status hurdles and opposition this report provides current assessment of the movement towards hemispheric free trade in three parts the first part evaluates the status of efforts to create free trade area in the western hemisphere by 2005 the second part assuming that hemispheric free trade is desirable objective discusses the major hurdles to achieving such free trade area the third part examines sources of opposition to the proposal status of movement toward hemispheric free trade the objective of establishing hemispheric free trade area was formally adopted at the december 1994 summit of the americas held in miami at the summit president clinton and 33 other leaders of the western hemisphere agreed to complete negotiations to create free trade area of the americas ftaa later than the year 2005 in addition the leaders agreed to make concrete progress toward that objective by the year 20001 if the ftaa were established in 1998 it would have 34 members cuba is not included with 757 million consumers the population would be more than twice the 370 million that comprise the now 15nation european union the ftaa would also have combined economic output of more than 9 trillion with the 7 trillion us economy accounting for more than 75 if the total while the summit produced declaration of principles and plan of action that provided some general guidelines for the negotiations neither document provided blueprint or precise plan for achieving the ftaa subsequently hemispheric free trade is being promoted through two different approaches or processes2 the first approach involves the expansion of existing subregional agreements such as mercosur the southern cone common market or the andean community this approach entails adding countries to existing agreements with view towards eventually combining or amalgamating the agreements into larger accord through direct negotiations under this approach the clinton administration 1 for an analysis of the decisionmaking to convene the summit see feinberg richard summitry in the americas institute for international economics washington dc 1997 261 p 2 moss ambler and lande stephen critical year for hemispheric free trade can countries agree on blueprint the northsouth center university of miami 1997 p9 crs2 initially hoped to expand the north american free trade agreement nafta southward beginning with the accession of chile3 the second approach attempts to harmonize diverse provisions and rules of the various existing regional groupings and potential members with view towards eventual convergence into an overarching or general agreement this process of formal ftaa negotiations entails acceptance of tariff and nontariff obligations by various subregional groupings and countries with an eye over time toward blending these provisions into comprehensive free trade agreement under this approach the trade ministers from the 34 countries agreed on the principles and framework for the negotiations the san jose declaration in march 1998 and the negotiations were officially launched by the leaders at the second summit of the americas in santiago chile in april 1998 there are at least two different perspectives on how much overall progress has been made over the past two years in advancing hemispheric free trade some observers argue that the process on balance is ontrack and others judge that the process is offtrack progress in expanding subregional groupings since the summit of the americas most countries in the western hemisphere with the exception of the united states have been actively involved in expanding sub regional groupings mercosur led by brazil has been the most active at the same time number of countries have negotiated additional bilateral free trade agreements with mexico and chile leading the way over the past three years mercosur which consists of argentina brazil paraguay and uruguay has reached free trade agreements with bolivia and chile that are designed to serve as steeping stones for full membership into mercosur mercosur has also signed an agreement with the andean community to negotiate free trade deal by 2000 and it continues to explore negotiating trade agreement with the european union eu the main obstacle to beginning negotiations is the insistence by some eu members to exclude the cereals beef and sugar sectors from the negotiations these are all sectors in which mercosur countries are very competitive4 mercosur hopes to expand its membership to all of south america thereby creating south american free trade area safta the creation of safta 3 president bush unveiled vision of free trade in the americas on june 27 1990 proposed as the cornerstone of his enterprise for the americas initiative eai president bush envisaged the creation of free trade system that links all of the americas north central and south free trade zone stretching from the port of anchorage to the tierra fuego the southern tip of chile the extension of the uscanada free trade agreement to mexico what became nafta was to be the first step in creating this hemispheric free trade zone 4 see congressional testimony of regina k vargo deputy assistant secretary of commerce for the western hemisphere before the subcommittee on international economic policy of the house international relations committee on april 29 1998 crs3 could position mercosur and particularly brazil to play much more important role in regional and world affairs mexico for its part has been equally active hoping to become commercial hub between north and south america mexico has reached trade agreements with colombia and venezuela creating the socalled group of 3 and with bolivia costa rica and chile in addition mexico has initiated talks with mercosur and number of central american countries mexicos growing web of free trade agreements have entailed trade and non trade obligations that are deeper and more rigorous than those undertaken by mercosur and its free trade partners for the most part mexico has negotiated agreements that are relatively equivalent to its nafta obligations5 chile which envisions itself as bridge between asia and south america and europe and south america has been similarly active on bilateral basis it has concluded agreements with mercosur mexico colombia venezuela canada and ecuador and intends to start similar negotiations with central america the united states is the major exception to this trend of expanding free trade agreements in the hemisphere while the administration initially expected to pursue hemispheric integration actively under this approach beginning with an invitation to chile to negotiate accession to nafta at the summit of the americas the absence of fasttrack authority has prevented movement in this direction from taking place although negotiations with chile were formally launched in july 1995 chile subsequently suspended its participation because the clinton administration did not have fast track authority situation that chile feared could force it to negotiate twice with the united states once with the executive branch and once with the congress6 the rapid increase in free trade accords in the hemisphere an estimated 30 agreements have been concluded since 1990 has been accompanied by rapid acceleration of exports latin american intraregional trade has grown particularly fast rising on average by 18 per year from 19901997 this compares to an average growth of 9 per year to countries outside the region7 progress in harmonizing norms 5 moss ambler and lande stephen critical year for hemispheric free trade can countries agree on blueprint p 9 6 fasttrack authority allows the president to negotiate trade agreement with assurances that the legislation implementing the agreement will be treated in congress under special floor procedures including amendments 7 interamerican development bank integration and trade in the americas periodic note august 1998 p 31 crs4 in the nearly four years since the first summit of the americas in miami western hemisphere trade ministers have met four times under the ftaa process the first meeting was held in denver in june 1995 the second in cartagena colombia in march 1996 the third in belo horizonte brazil in may 1997 and the fourth in san jose costa rica in march 1998 while number of decisions were made at all the meetings the most significant preparatory work occurred at the san jose ministerial at the san jose meeting the 34 ministers responsible for trade in the hemisphere unanimously recommended that the leaders formally launch the negotiation of the ftaa at the second summit of the americas in santiago as provided by the san jose declaration ministers agreed that negotiating groups are to achieve considerable progress by the year 2000 with conclusion set for december 31 2004 the san jose declaration also provided recommendations on the initial structure objectives venues and principles of the negotiations8 canada was designated as the chair of the overall negotiating process for the initial 18 months may 1 1998oct 31 1999 and the united states and brazil were named cochairs during the final two years of the negotiations november 1 2002 december 31 2004 as head of both the ministerial and trade negotiations committee tnc the chair will provide overall direction and management to the negotiations consisting of the 34 vice ministers for trade the first meeting of the tnc will be held later than june 30 1998 the ministers elected to establish nine initial negotiating groups which cover all the tariff and nontariff barrier issue areas identified by the leaders at the miami summit of the americas these groups are market access agriculture services government procurement investment intellectual property subsidies competition policy and dispute settlement in addition the ministers created two committees and consultative group committee on electronic commerce comprised of both government and private sector experts was established to make recommendations on how to increase and broaden the benefits to be derived from the electronic marketplace committee on civil society was established to receive input at the hemispheric level from labor and environmental groups and academic consumer and other nongovernmental groups and consultative group on smaller economies was established to bring to the attention of the tnc the interests and concerns of the smaller economies the united states miami will provide the venue for the negotiating groups and the administrative secretariat supporting those meeting during the first three years the last four years of the negotiations will be held in panama and mexico the san jose declaration contains general principles for the negotiations as well as general and specific objectives in addition to transparency during the negotiations the ministers agreed that the ftaa should improve upon wto rules and disciplines wherever possible and appropriate this provision was an attempt to ensure that any final agreement will break down the most serious trade barriers in the region and provide single set of rules for hemispheric trade it was agreed that 8 information on the ftaa can be accessed at an official website httpwwwftaaalcaorg crs5 bilateral and subregional agreements such as nafta and mercosur can coexist with the ftaa only to the extent that the rights and obligations under those agreements are not covered or go beyond those of the ftaa it was also agreed that the negotiations will be single undertaking in the sense that signatories to the final ftaa agreement will have to accept all parts of it ie cannot pick and choose among the obligations as expected president clinton and 21 other presidents and 12 prime ministers of the western hemisphere agreed at the santiago summit in april 1998 to launch the trade negotiations in accordance with the san jose declaration the first meeting of the nine negotiating committees took place in miami during september 1998 movement toward free trade assessments differ widely on whether this combined movement toward hemispheric free trade is ontrack or offtrack the former basically positive perspective maintains that solid foundation and structure for ftaa negotiations has been agreed to and that ongoing efforts to expand subregional groupings are accelerating hemispheric integration the latter mostly skeptical perspective holds that the united states lacking fasttrack authority has been unable to provide the kind of leadership that is necessary to ensure that the ftaa negotiations proceed according to schedule or in manner that is supportive of us interests those who see positive developments over the past three years point to the accomplishments of the san jose trade ministerial and the second summit of the americas in getting the ftaa negotiations off to an official start while some critics doubt much progress can be made in the negotiations until the us obtains fasttrack negotiating authority others point out that the absence of fasttrack may have made the us negotiating position more compromising and diplomatically effective to date this view holds that brazil and other latin countries may not have agreed at santiago to begin formal ftaa negotiations if the united states had not been willing to change its original negotiating positions on agriculture and some other issues the ontrack perspective also points to continuing trend of greater market opening at both the bilateral and subregional level as contributing to an expansion of trade flows in recent years intrahemispheric trade has been growing more rapidly than exports to the rest of the world this trade growth in turn has bolstered the economic performance of the countries of the region and enabled latin american leaders to negotiate with the united states more confidently as well as to embrace the longterm goal of hemispheric free trade those who judge that the process is offtrack make several points the first is that the united states lacking fasttrack authority has not been able to promote its preferred approach the expansion of nafta to hemispheric integration instead it has been relegated to the sidelines as other countries and subregional groups have continued to reach preferential agreements these agreements in turn are said to be discriminating against us exports and making it more difficult to eventually negotiate comprehensive hemispheric free trade agreement in the continuing absence of fasttrack this view also holds that the ftaa negotiations will lose momentum or drag on interminably crs6 hurdles those who identify the creation of the ftaa as desirable objective cite two major hurdles to rapid movement in that direction these are the absence of fasttrack authority and divergent interests of key countries involved in the negotiations fasttrack authority many observers doubt that formal ftaa can be negotiated by 2005 in the absence of an extension of fast track authority from the congress such authority allows the administration to negotiate trade agreement with assurances that the legislation implementing the agreement will be treated under special procedures strict time limits on consideration and bars on amendments increase the probability of passage tacit assurance that congress will not demand changes in trade bargains and compromises struck by the president is considered indispensable for persuading us trading partners to engage in substantive negotiations while foreign countries in the past have agreed to begin trade negotiations without fasttrack authority in place it is considered unlikely that they would offer sensitive concessions in trade talks if they were unsure that us negotiators could live up to their end of the bargain9 fast track authority was first adopted in 1974 and it has been renewed five times however since its expiration in 1994 efforts first by the clinton administration and second by the house republican leadership have been unsuccessful in winning its renewal president clinton transmitted to congress draft fasttrack bill in the fall of 199710 the proposal and subsequent versions reported out of both the house ways and means and senate finance committees proved controversial lacking the votes for passage the president on november 10 1997 elected to suspend efforts to gain its passage in the 1st session of the 105th congress the most recent attempt to pass fast track bill occurred on september 25 1998 when the house defeated hr 2621 by vote of 180 to 243 the inability to obtain bipartisan majority in favor of fasttrack bill has stemmed primarily from divisions on the treatment of labor and environmental standards in future trade agreements many democrats maintain that future trade agreements should contain strong labor and environmental standards particularly with developing countries that maintain tight control over labor markets and lax standards on environmental protection many republicans believe that these issues should be addressed in different fora and ways without narrowing of the gap concerning the proper relationship between labor and environmental standards and international 9 for full discussion see schott jeffrey j ed restarting fast track institute for international economics washington dc 1998 10 for description of the presidents fasttrack proposal see us library of congress fast track authority debate over the presidents proposal by george holliday report 97876 crs7 trade efforts to pass an extension of the fasttrack authority may continue to prove difficult in the future the terms of any potential fasttrack consensus of course could have direct consequences for the ftaa and us relations with latin america on the one hand fasttrack extension that entailed strong labor and environmental provisions in future trade agreements could encounter strong opposition from ftaa negotiating partners most latin american leaders have made clear that they view any labor or environmental provisions that are enforceable by trade sanctions as being potentially protectionist and have vowed not to negotiate such agreements similarly fast track extension that contained authority only for multilateral negotiations could obviously gut the ftaa process on the other hand fasttrack extension that was accompanied by measures to help american workers adjust to increased competition could help build domestic political support for the ftaa divergent country interests even if fasttrack negotiating authority is renewed in some form movement toward hemispheric free trade likely will be constrained by the divergent interests of two key countries in the hemisphere mexico and brazil in addition there is growing concern that the possible launch of new round of multilateral trade negotiations could effectively divert the attention of negotiators and countries away the ftaa process both mexico and brazil appear to have an interest in goslow approach to the ftaa negotiations mexicos interest in prolonging the negotiations is straightforward preferential integration with the us economy through nafta has been major boon to its trade and economy at least in the shortrun it has clear cut commercial interest in seeing that the value if its preferential access to the us market is not eroded by the creation of hemispheric free trade area11 for brazil timeconsuming and extended negotiation would provide it with significant advantages not the least of which would be an opportunity to expand mercosur into larger south american trade bloc buttressed by the diplomatic support provided by larger mercosur brazil could be better positioned to negotiate with the united states from position of strength this is particularly important because brazil together with argentina wishes to extract from the united states concessions limiting washingtons use of unfair trade practices remedies ie antidumping and countervailing duties and to improve its access to the us market for agricultural products in addition because mercosur currently protects number of sectors such as financial services telecommunications and government procurement longer period of time would provide these sectors with more leeway and capacity to adjust to increased import competition 11 for example venezuela and colombia two frequently mentioned candidates in the past are now experiencing considerable problems venezuela is struggling to return to path of economic reform and revitalization and colombia is deeply troubled by guerilla and drug related violence and corruption crs8 final consideration is that gaining unfettered access to the us market may not be as important for brazil and its principal mercosur partner argentina as it is for many other countries in central and south america for both countries the european union is more important trading partner than the united states which accounts for only 20 of brazils exports and 9 of argentinas exports for this reason both countries calculations of the benefitcost ratio of special hemispheric relationship may by lower than of other countries that are more dependent on the us market12 the possible launch of new round of multilateral trade negotiations under the aegis of the world trade organization wto could also divert the attention of key countries from the ftaa process wto ministerial meeting scheduled for 1999 is expected to decide whether and when to initiate new round opposition while the vision of hemispheric free trade was put forth by president bush eight years ago and subsequently embraced by president clinton the amount of popular support in the united states for this goal remains unclear for example public opinion poll taken in 1996 found that 57 of the us public is against new free trade agreements with latin america while 1998 poll showed 36 opposition13 sources of opposition within the united states can be seen in controversies relating to the benefits and costs of hemispheric free trade as well as to the efficacy of regional free trade arrangements in supporting us interests benefits and costs of hemispheric free trade the debate over the benefits and costs of hemispheric free trade tends to divide along economic and geopolitical considerations those that emphasize the economic benefits and costs often view hemispheric free trade as an end in itself while those who emphasize geopolitical costs and benefits tend to view hemispheric free trade as means to achieve other objectives economic benefits and costs the clinton administration and most supporters of hemispheric free trade emphasize the extent to which movement in this direction will help expand us exports which in turn will create more and better paying jobs the statistics cited in support of this contention include the following exports over the last 5 years have accounted for nearly 40 of us economic growth 12 ahearn raymond j trade and the americas crs issue brief 95017 updated regularly 14 p 13 green paula study 57 of us public against freetrade pacts with latin america journal of commerce september 8 1996 p 2 and schumacher edward meeting of minds from peoria to patagonia wall street journal april 16 1998 p a19 crs9 exports support an estimated 113 million us jobs and over 14 million of these jobs were generated by increased exports over the last 4 years exportrelated jobs are good jobs paying 1316 more than non traderelated jobs us exports to the western hemisphere including canada and mexico have accounted for twothirds of us export growth in 1997 us exports to latin america and the caribbean the 31 other countries which the us does not have free trade agreement with have increased by 150 since 1990 making this region one of the the fastest growing markets for us exports as result the us now sells more to brazil than it does to china and more to chile than it does to india because latin america and the caribbean have relatively higher trade barriers than the united states tariffs that are four times higher american companies will have the most to win from reciprocal reduction of barriers beyond the potential direct gains from freer trade proponents see danger for us exports and investments arising from the movement towards preferential trade agreements in the region without us participation they cite free trade agreements that chile has concluded with canada mexico and mercosur as contributing to an estimated 500 million in lost us exports the effect reportedly is due to the fact that us exporters are subject to price disadvantage imposed by the 11 chilean duty that chiles preferential hemispheric free trade partners do not have to pay14 opponents and skeptics can respond that supporters overstate the potential benefits and underestimate or ignore the potential costs regarding the potential benefits they make the argument that latin america and the caribbean excluding mexico because it is already member of nafta represent relatively small market for us exports in 1997 for example the region accounted for only 9 or 63 billion of total us exports although it may be fastgrowing market the relatively small trading relationship the united states has with these countries indicates that hemispheric free trade could have only modest impact on economic activity including export growth in the united states as result opponents can argue that movement in this direction is not going to create large numbers of exportrelated jobs concerning the dangers of inaction opponents can point out that the trade data to date do not support the assertion that the united states is losing market share as result of being excluded from preferential trade agreements for example in the case of chile which has negotiated preferential trade agreements in recent years with mexico canada bolivia venezuela colombia and ecuador and the four members of mercosur argentina brazil paraguay and uruguay the us share of chiles 14 see congressional testimony of regina k vargo deputy assistant secretary of commerce for the western hemisphere before the subcommittee on international economic policy of the house international relations committee on april 29 1998 crs10 total imports has shown little change in recent years the us market share grew from 178 in 1990 to 238 in 1995 averaged 231 in 1996 and 232 in 1997 thru the first three quarters opposition to new free trade agreements in general is closely linked to perceptions of how nafta is working for example 1997 wall street journalnbc news poll showed that 43 of americans believe that nafta has had negative impact on the united states while 28 believed it has had positive impact in 1998 poll plurality of those polled again believed that nafta was having negative impact of jobs and wages15 opponents of nafta and the ftaa appear to fear that agreements with low wage countries absent strong labor and environmental provisions that are fully enforceable by the threat of us trade sanctions can lead to loss of us jobs put downward pressures on us wages and divert investment capital abroad in particular many democrats labor unions and environmental groups are reluctant to support new trade agreements on the grounds that the nafta is working to lower the standard of living of us workers and encouraging businesses to relocate in mexico to take advantage of lower wages and weak enforcement of environmental laws16 opponents also point to the huge turnaround in the bilateral trade balance with mexico going from 14 billion surplus in 1994 to 175 billion deficit in 1997 as sign that the agreement is having negative impact on employment in the united states17 huge increase us imports from mexico is estimated by opponents to have resulted in loss of an estimated 250000 us jobs18 proponents of hemispheric free trade both the administration and many republicans counter that nafta is working they point out that in the three plus years nafta has been in effect the us economy has created 85 million new jobs and that there has been stampede of investment capital from the united states to mexico in 1995 for example when total foreign investment from all sources in mexico was 7 billion total foreign direct investment into the united states was over 15 schumacher edward meeting of minds from peoria to patagonia wall street journal april 16 1998 p a19 16 for

private investment in the us economy was over 1 trillion19 despite the data confirming strong us employment and investment performance economywide since nafta went into effect there may be growing sense of anxiety among seemingly larger segment of the american work force concerning trade agreements with lower wage countries while the anxiety perhaps could be allayed by the existence of viable retraining or adjustment assistance programs the concerns appear deeply intertwined with the way more internationalized and global economy threatens job security and places downward pressures on wages and benefits20 recent analysis asserts that these anxieties may also be bound up with variety of other underlying forces that are transforming the employment relationship in the united states including deregulation technological change deunionization and the weakening of domestic safety nets new responses to the social challenges posed by the increased mobility of firms and capital across borders thus may be necessary if public support for accelerating economic integrationt is to be bolstered21 geopolitical benefits and costs although there appears to be broad domestic consensus that us economic interests should receive the highest priority with regard to future trade agreements the concept of hemispheric free trade confronts skeptical and perhaps indifferent american public as concerns about future free trade agreements have become intertwined with generalized anxieties associated with more open and globalized economy the question arises whether future regional trade agreements may need larger geopolitical justifications to gain the support of the american public22 historically us free trade agreements have relied on combination of interests with considerable variation in the relative importance attached to economic and geo political objectives the two most recent agreements nafta and the gatturuguay round accord were motivated primarily by economic considerations but larger political justifications played role at critical junctures in each debate the 1993 nafta debate focused on employment and investment considerations nevertheless prime us interest was that more democratic and increasingly prosperous and stable mexico would provide sounder 19 testimony by ambassador ira shapiro deputy us trade representative before the subcommittee on

immigration and the environment similarly the rationale for the 1994 uruguay round agreement was its impact on the overall us economy specific industries and workers but as the gatt vote drew closer just as the nafta debate attention shifted to broad political arguments concerning the impact that approval might have on the us role and leadership in the world economy some proponents of hemispheric free trade argue that similar geopolitical arguments should be given primacy in todays trade debate while the clinton administration justifies its support for hemispheric free trade as well as for fasttrack extension primarily on building prosperity at home through export expansion it also has made the case that stronger trade ties support broader us interests as well but the administration according to some critics has failed to consistently and forcefully articulate clear vision of what those interests are in relationship to latin america accordingly some supporters argue that hemispheric free trade would strengthen democratic forces and institutions throughout the region and solidify recent moves toward marketoriented regimes they argue that this is important for helping to create world that is less hostile to us interests and for contributing to the economic development of the region democratic and prosperous region that is bolstered by closer trade ties in turn is viewed as necessary condition for increasing the disposition of these countries to cooperate on range of issues that are of critical importance to the united states drugs immigration corruption and alleviation of poverty23 opponents of this line of reasoning believe that the united states stands to derive benefit from close or special association with the other countries of the americas this benefit point of view has long history in viewing the region primarily in negative terms not as place of economic opportunity24 adherents to this doctrine today can argue that any special relationship will likely involve the united states more in the instabilities class tensions and economic turmoil of many latin american countries and they can point to some problems that continue to bolster these perceptions these include the persistent inflows of illegal immigrants drugs and crime into the united states as well as continuing widespread poverty income inequality and corruption in many of these

feinberg richard summitry in the americas chapter 1 25 schrieberg david dateline latin america the growing fury foreign policy spring 1997 pp 162175 crs13 second controversy affecting support for hemispheric free trade revolves around the relative merits of regional trade agreements in promoting us interests while us policy in principle has supported regional free trade arrangements as means to bolster the multilateral trading system it has also been clear that these arrangements could lead to some undesirable outcomes this potential for mixed outcomes has played role in the evolution of support among academics and policymakers for creating an ftaa via the expansion of subregional agreements the clinton administration initially viewed the expansion of subregional groups to wit nafta as the most effective approach for promoting us interests this view was that the united states could expand nafta southward as countries or sub regions became ready to accept the agreements relatively comprehensive and binding obligations absent fasttrack authority the clinton administration however has been excluded from pursuing hemispheric integration in this way seeking to obtain an extension of fasttrack authority the clinton administration argued in 1996 and 1997 that the proliferation of nonnafta regional trade agreements in latin america may be undermining us interests according to united states trade representative charlene barshefsky number of these agreements were not consistent with wto rules the ustr also argued that the proliferation of preferential agreements without us participation was creating morass of conflicting rules for us business diverting trade and undermining us leadership in the region specifically the administration maintained that tangled web of rules governing tariffs intellectual property rights and product classification will make it harder for us companies to do business in the region the administration also expressed concern that the expansion and operation of mercosur may be diverting substantial trade from more efficient producers outside the region presumably with an adverse impact on us exports and the administration argued that the inactivity of the united states in expanding nafta southward has left large vacuum that is being filled by european countries and japan in carving out special economic arrangements with the countries of the hemisphere26 ustr barshefshy more recently has expressed more benign view on the expansion of subregional pacts to the extent that the agreements open markets she has argued that they tend to support us interests even in those cases where the united states is not member27 whether the proliferation of subregional groupings that exclude the united states on balance support or hinder us interests and the global trading system is difficult to determine with any certainty much depends on whether trade is diverted from lowercost producers to highercost producers an issue that can be determined only on casebycase and productbyproduct basis 26 maggs john barshefsky makes case in congress for expansion of trade authority journal of commerce may 1 1997 p a2 27 srodes james charlene
