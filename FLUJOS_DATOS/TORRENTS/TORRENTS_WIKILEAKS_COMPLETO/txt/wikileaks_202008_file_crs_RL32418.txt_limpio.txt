four principal categories of combat ships that traditionally have helped define the size and structure of the us navy the other three are aircraft carriers surface combatants eg cruisers destroyers frigates and littoral combat ships and amphibious ships the navy also includes mine warfare ships and variety of auxiliary and support ships submarines can be powered by either nuclear reactors or nonnuclear power sources such as diesel engines or fuel cells all us navy submarines are nuclear powered submarines use of nuclear or nonnuclear power as its energy source is not an indication of whether it is armed with nuclear weapons nuclearpowered submarine can lack nuclear weapons and nonnuclearpowered submarine can be armed with nuclear weapons roles and missions us navy submarines fall into three types nuclear powered ballistic missile submarines ssbns nuclearpowered cruise missile submarines ssgns and nuclearpowered attack submarines ssns1 ssbns the ssbns basic mission is to remain hidden at sea with their nucleararmed submarinelaunched ballistic missiles slbms and thereby deter strategic nuclear attack on the united states2 as of the end of fy2008 the navy included 14 ohio ssbn726 class ssbns which are commonly called trident submarines because they carry trident slbms each trident ssbn can carry 24 trident slbms ssgns the navys four ssgns which are recent addition to the fleet are former trident ssbns that have been converted ie modified to carry tomahawk cruise missiles and special operations forces sof rather than slbms although the ssgns differ somewhat from ssns in terms of mission orientation with the ssgns being strongly oriented toward tomahawk strikes and sof support while the ssns are more generalpurpose in orientation ssgns can perform other submarine missions and are sometimes included in counts of the projected total number of navy attack submarines3 1 in the designations ssbn ssgn and ssn ss stands for submarine n stands for nuclear powered b stands for ballistic missile and g stands for guided missile such as cruise missile 2 although this mission is often associated with the cold warera nuclear competition between the united states and the soviet union it has continued with some modifications in the postcold war era for discussion of us strategic nuclear weapons policy and force structure see crs report rl31623 us nuclear weapons changes in policy and force structure by amy f woolf 3 for more on the navys ssgn conversion program see crs report rs21007 navy trident submarine conversion ssgn program background and issues for congress by continued crs3 ssns the ssns the focus of this report are generalpurpose submarines that perform variety of peacetime and wartime missions including the following covert intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr much of it done for nationallevel as opposed to purely navy purposes covert insertion and recovery of sof on smaller scale than possible with the ssgns covert strikes against land targets with the tomahawk cruise missiles again on smaller scale than possible with the ssgns covert offensive and defensive mine warfare antisubmarine warfare asw and antisurface ship warfare during the cold war asw against the soviet submarine force was the primary stated mission of us ssns although covert isr and covert sof insertionrecovery operations were reportedly important on daytoday basis as well4 in the postcold war era although antisubmarine warfare remains mission the ssn force has focused more on performing the other missions noted on the list above attack submarine force levels forcelevel goal in february 2006 the navy proposed achieving and maintaining in coming years fleet with total of 313 ships including 48 ssns and 4 ssgns for review of ssn force level goals since the reagan administration see appendix historical force levels the ssn force included more than 90 boats during most of the 1980s peaked at 98 boats at the end of fy1987 and then began to decline the force included 85 to 88 boats during the early 1990s 79 boats at the end of fy1996 65 boats at the end of fy1998 57 boats at the end of fy1999 and 56 boats at the end of fy2000 it has since numbered 53 to 56 boats the decline in the number of ssns since the late1980s has roughly paralleled the decline in the total size of the navy over the same time period force level as of end of fy2007 the 53 ssns in service at the end of fy2007 included the following 47 angeles ssn688 class boats 3 seawolf ssn21 class boats and 3 virginia ssn774 class boats angeles ssn688 class ssns total of 62 angelesclass submarines commonly called 688s were procured between fy1970 and fy1990 and 3 continued ronald orourke 4 for an account of certain us submarine surveillance and intelligencecollection operations during the cold war see sherry sontag and christopher drew with annette lawrence drew blind mans bluff new york public affairs 1998 crs4 entered service between 1976 and 1996 they are equipped with four 21inch diameter torpedo tubes and can carry total of 26 torpedoes or tomahawk cruise missiles in their torpedo tubes and internal magazines the final 31 boats in the class ssn719 and higher are equipped with an additional 12 vertical launch system vls tubes in their bows for carrying and launching another 12 tomahawk cruise missiles the final 23 boats in the class ssn751 and higher incorporate further improvements and are referred to as improved angeles class boats or 688is as of the end of fy2007 15 of the 62 boats in the class had been retired seawolf ssn21 class ssns the seawolf class was originally intended to include about 30 boats but seawolfclass procurement was stopped after three boats as result of the end of the cold war and associated changes in military requirements the three seawolfclass submarines are the seawolf ssn21 the connecticut ssn22 and the jimmy carter ssn23 ssn21 and ssn22 were procured in fy1989 and fy1991 and entered service in 1997 and 1998 respectively ssn23 which was built to lengthened configuration compared to the other two ships in the class was originally procured in fy1992 its procurement was suspended in 1992 and then reinstated in fy1996 it entered service in 2005 seawolfclass submarines are larger than angelesclass boats or previous us navy ssns5 they are equipped with eight 30inchdiameter torpedo tubes and can carry total of 50 torpedoes or cruise missiles virginia ssn774 class program general the virginiaclass attack submarine was designed to be less expensive and better optimized for postcold war submarine missions than the seawolfclass design the virginiaclass design is slightly larger than the angelesclass design6 but incorporates newer technologies virginiaclass boats currently cost about 28 billion each to procure the three virginiaclass boats in service as of the end of fy2007 entered service on october 23 2004 september 9 2006 and may 5 2007 past and planned procurement

multiyear procurement myp arrangement requested by the navy and approved by congress in fy2008 the five virginiaclass boats procured in fy2004fy2008 were also procured under multiyear procurement myp arrangement the four boats procured in fy1998 fy2002 were procured under somewhat similar arrangement called block buy the boat procured in fy2003 fell between the fy1998fy2002 block buy and the fy2004fy2008 myp crs6 joint production arrangement virginiaclass boats are built jointly by general dynamics electric boat division gdeb of groton ct and quonset point ri and the newport news va shipyard that forms part of northrop grumman shipbuilding ngsb7 under the arrangement gdeb builds certain parts of each boat newport news builds certain other parts of each boat and the yards take turns building the reactor compartments and performing final assembly of the boats gdeb is building the reactor compartments and performing final assembly on boats 1 3 and so on while newport news is doing so on boats 2 4 and so on the arrangement results in roughly 5050 division of virginiaclass profits between the two yards and preserves both yards ability to build submarine reactor compartments key capability for submarineconstruction yard and perform submarine finalassembly work the joint production arrangement is departure from past us submarine construction practices under which complete submarines were built in individual yards the joint production arrangement is the product of debate over the virginia class acquisition strategy within congress and between congress and dod that occurred in 19951997 ie during the markup of the fy1996fy1998 defense budgets the goal of the arrangement is to keep both gdeb and newport news involved in building nuclearpowered submarines and thereby maintain two us shipyards capable of building nuclearpowered submarines while minimizing the cost penalties of using two yards rather than one to build submarine design that is being procured at low annual rate costreduction effort the navy is working to reduce the cost of virginia class submarines so that two boats can be procured in fy2012 for combined cost of 40 billion in fy2005 dollars goal referred to as 2 for 4 in 12 achieving this goal involves removing about 400 million in fy2005 dollars from the cost of each submarine the navy calculates that the unit target cost of 20 billion in fy2005 dollars for each submarine translates into about 26 billion for boat procured in fy2012 and about 27 billion for boat procured in fy2013 the navy says that in constant fy2005 dollars about 200 million of the 400 million in the soughtafter cost reductions would be accomplished simply through the improved economies of scale eg better spreading of shipyard fixed costs and improved learning rates of producing two submarines per year rather than one per year the remaining 200 million in soughtafter cost reductions the navy says is to be accomplished through changes in the ships design which will contribute roughly 100 million toward the costreduction goal and changes in the shipyard production process which will contribute the remaining 100 million or so toward the goal some of the design changes will be introduced to virginiaclass boats procured prior to fy2012 but the navy says the full set of design changes will not be ready for implementation until the fy2012 procurement 7 gdeb and the newport news shipyard are the only two shipyards in the country capable of building nuclearpowered ships gdeb builds submarines only while the newport news shipyard also builds nuclearpowered aircraft carriers and is capable of building other types of surface ships crs7 changes in the shipyard production process are aimed in large part at reducing the total shipyard construction time of virginiaclass submarine from 72 months to 60 months if the ship spends less total time in the shipyard being built its construction cost will incorporate smaller amount of shipyard fixed overhead costs the principal change involved in reducing shipyard construction time to 60 months involves increasing the size of the modules that form each submarine so that each submarine can be built out of smaller number of modules the navy says that the goal of reducing shipyard construction time to 60 months is mediumrisk goal meaning that the navy believes that there is moderate as opposed to low or high risk that the goal will not be achieved because the full set of design changes and the reduction in construction time to 60 months will not be achieved until fy2012 the navy says that the 20 billion goal cannot be fully met for boats procured prior to fy2012 even if those boats are procured at rate of two per year the navy says that if improved economies of scale and changes in the ships design and in the shipyard production process are not sufficient to achieve the 20 billion target the navy may consider reducing the capabilities of the virginia class in certain areas until the target is achieved8 the navys goal to reduce the cost of each virginiaclass boat to 20 billion in constant fy2005 dollars is goal that the navy has set for itself while congress may take this goal into account it need not control congressional action in december 2007 it was reported that the navy believed it had reduced the estimated cost of each boat planned for procurement in fy2012 to within 40 million of the 20 billion goal9 in march 2008 it was reported that the navy believed it had reduced the estimated cost of each fy2012 boat to within 30 million of goal10 the costreducing design changes are to be implemented in part through an effort known as the technology insertion program tip in march 2008 the government accountability office gao reported that 8 for more on the navys plan for reducing the procurement cost of the virginiaclass design see statement of ms allison stiller deputy assistant secretary of the navy ship programs and rdml rear

indicated that the navy may have difficulty achieving its virginiaclass cost target the technology insertion program was delayed to reduce cost and schedule risk and further evaluate technologies the tip consists of three systems advanced electromagnetic signature reduction advanced sail and conformal acoustic velocity sensor wide aperture array the first of which is scheduled for insertion in 2010 the advanced electromagnetic signature reduction aesr is software package that uses improved algorithms to continuously monitor and recalibrate the submarines signature similar software has been demonstrated in british submarines but the technology is considered immature because modifications to the software will require additional testing software modification is expected to begin in october 2008 and insertion is scheduled for fiscal year 2010 once development is complete aesr will be retrofitted on all virginiaclass submarines the advanced sail is redesign of the structure that sits atop the main body of the submarine the new design provides expanded space to carry weapons antisubmarine systems and communications systems external to the hull development began in june 2006 and the composite material used to construct the sail has been demonstrated under separate program however insertion of the advanced sail has been delayed because related costs may exceed budget limits new bow design that also adds payload space for weapons and systems will be used on submarines starting in fiscal year 2009 the navy will await testing of the new bow before completing new sail design the conformal acoustic velocity sensor wide aperture array caves waa is intended to be more costeffective sensor array caves waa consists of two developmental technologies fiber optic sensors and integrated panels that house them and manage their signature that will be integrated together both technologies are still immature to save costs the insertion schedule has been deferred 2 years to fiscal year 2014 in fiscal year 2009 the navy will conduct atsea testing of caves waa integrated panel being used as part of another application but not in the form necessary for the virginiaclass submarine the navy hopes to reduce construction time from more than 80 months to just 60 months while ssn 778 and ssn 779 are expected to be delivered in 72 and 68 months respectively construction time must be reduced by another 17 and 12 percent respectively in order to meet the 60 month target historically construction efficiencies tend to be captured in the early part of production run but ssn 778 and ssn 779 are the fifth and sixth ships being built additionally recent navy estimate indicates that construction for the ssn 784 may take 6 months longer than target according to program officials about 79 percent of the programs target savings for construction and design has already been achieved approximately 158 million however recent cost analysis of the program indicated that the navy may have difficulty achieving target costs in fiscal year 201211 11 government accountability office defense acquisitions assessments of selected weapons systems gao08467sp march 2008 pp 171172 crs9 submarine construction industrial base general in addition to gdeb and newport news the submarine construction industrial base includes scores of supplier firms as well as laboratories and research facilities in numerous states about 80 of the total material procured from supplier firms for the construction of submarines measured in dollars rather than pieces parts or purchase orders comes from single or sole source suppliers observers in recent years have expressed concern for the continued survival of many of these firms for nuclearpropulsion component suppliers an additional source of stabilizing work is the navys nuclearpowered aircraft carrier construction program12 in terms of work provided to these firms carrier nuclear propulsion plant is roughly equivalent to five submarine propulsion plants design and engineering portion the part of the submarine industrial base that some observers have been the most concerned about in recent years is the design and engineering portion much of which is resident at gdeb and newport news small portion is resident at some of the component makers with virginiaclass design work now winding down and other submarinedesign projects underway the submarine design and engineering base is facing the nearterm prospect for the first time in about 50 years of having major submarinedesign project on which to work navy and industry officials members of congress and other observers are concerned that unless major submarinedesign project is begun soon the submarine design and engineering base will begin to atrophy through the departure of experienced personnel rebuilding an atrophied submarine design and engineering base navy and industry officials believe could be timeconsuming adding time and cost to the task of the next submarinedesign effort whenever it might begin concern about this possibility among some navy and industry officials was strengthened by the uks difficulties few years ago in designing its new astute class ssn the uk submarine design and engineering base atrophied for lack of work and the subsequent astuteclass design effort experienced considerable delays and cost overruns submarine designers and engineers from gdeb were assigned to the astuteclass project to help the uk overcome these problems13 projected ssn shortfall size and timing of shortfall the navys 30year ssn procurement plan if implemented would not be sufficient to maintain force of 48 ssns consistently 12 for more on this program see crs report rs20643 navy ford cvn78 class cvn21 aircraft

vessels for fy 2009 p 8 the potential for the navys longrange ssn procurement plan to produce shortfall in the ssn force over the long run has been discussed by crs since 1995 in the form of testimony to congress in 1995 1997 1999 2000 2002 2004 2006 and 2007 1997 crs presentation to defense science board task force on the submarine of the future which issued its report in 199814 19992000 crs report15 2002 crs report16 and this report since its inception in 2004 navy study on options for mitigating projected shortfall the navy in 2006 initiated study on options for mitigating the projected ssn shortfall the study was completed in early 2007 and briefed to crs and the congressional budget office cbo on may 22 200717 at the time of the study the ssn force was projected to bottom out at 40 boats an 8boat shortfall the addition of second submarine to be procured in fy2011 has since reduced the projected shortfall to seven boats as shown in table 3 principal points in the navy study include the following the daytoday requirement for deployed ssns is 100 meaning that on average total of 10 ssns are to be deployed on dayto day basis18 14 us department of defense office of the under

the navy stated in the briefing was the current requirement at the time the study was conducted crs11 the peak projected wartime demand is about 35 ssns deployed within certain amount of time this figure includes both the 10 ssns that are to be deployed on daytoday basis and 25 additional ssns surged from the united states within certain amount of time19 reducing virginiaclass shipyard construction time to 60 months something that the navy already plans to do as part of its strategy for meeting the virginiaclass costreduction goal see earlier discussion on costreduction goal will increase the size of the ssn force by two boats so that the force would bottom out at 42 boats rather than 4020 if in addition to reducing virginiaclass shipyard construction time to 60 months the navy also lengthens the service lives of 16 existing ssns by periods ranging from 3 months to 24 months with many falling in the range of 9 to 15 months this would increase the size of the ssn force by another two boats so that the force would bottom out at 44 boats rather than 40 boats21 the total cost of extending the lives of the 16 boats would be roughly 500 million in constant fy2005 dollars22 the resulting force that bottoms out at 44 boats could meet the 100 requirement for daytoday deployed ssns throughout the 2020 19 the peak projected wartime demand of about 35 ssns deployed within certain amount of time the navy stated is an internal navy figure that reflects several studies of potential wartime requirements for ssns the navy stated that these other studies calculated various figures for the number of ssns that would be required and that the figure of 35 ssns deployed within certain amount of time was chosen because it was representative of the results of these other studies 20 if shipyard construction time is reduced from 72 months to 60 months the result would be oneyear acceleration in the delivery of all boats procured on or after certain date in program in which boats are being procured at rate of two per year accelerating by one year the deliveries of all boats procured on or after certain date will produce onetime benefit of single year in which four boats will be delivered to the navy rather than two in the case of the virginiaclass program this year might be around 2017 as mentioned earlier in the discussion of the virginiaclass costreduction goal the navy believes that the goal of reducing virginiaclass shipyard construction time is mediumrisk goal if it turns out that shipyard construction time is reduced to 66 months rather than 60 months ie is reduced by 6 months rather than 12 months the size of the ssn force would increase by one boat rather than two and the force would bottom out at 41 boats rather than 42 21 the navy study identified 19 existing ssns whose service lives currently appear to be extendable by periods of 1 to 24 months the previous option of reducing virginiaclass shipyard construction time to 60 months the navy concluded would make moot the option of extending the service lives of the three oldest boats in this group of 19 leaving 16 whose service lives would be considered for extension 22 the navy stated that the rough orderofmagnitude rom cost of extending the lives of 19 ssns would be 595 million in constant fy2005 dollars and that the cost of extending the lives of 16 ssns would be roughly proportional crs12 2033 period if as an additional option about 40 ssn deployments occurring in the eightyear period 20252032 were lengthened from six months to seven months these 40 or so lengthened deployments would represent about onequarter of all the ssn deployments that would take place during the eightyear period the resulting force that bottoms out at 44 boats could not meet the peak projected wartime demand of about 35 ssns deployed within certain amount of time the force could generate total deployment of 32 ssns within the time in question three boats or about 86 less than the 35boat figure lengthening ssn deployments from six months to seven months would not improve the forces ability to meet the peak projected wartime demand of about 35 ssns deployed within certain amount of time to meet the 35boat figure an additional four ssns beyond those planned by the navy would need to be procured procuring four additional ssns would permit the resulting 48boat force to surge an additional three ssns within the time in question so that the force could meet the peak projected wartime demand of about 35 ssns deployed within certain amount of time procuring one to four additional ssns could also reduce the number of sevenmonth deployments that would be required to meet the 100 requirement for daytoday deployed ssns during the period 2025 2032 procuring one additional ssn would reduce the number of 7 month deployments during this period to about 29 procuring two additional ssns would reduce it to about 17 procuring three additional ssns would reduce it to about 7 and procuring four additional ssns would reduce it to 2 the navy added number of caveats to these results including but not limited to the following the requirement for 100 ssns deployed on daytoday basis is current requirement that could change in the future the peak projected wartime demand of about 35 ssns deployed within certain amount of time is an internal navy figure that reflects recent analyses of potential future wartime requirements for ssns subsequent analyses of this issue could result in different figure the identification of 19 ssns as candidates for service life extension reflects current evaluations of the material condition of these boats and projected use rates for their nuclear fuel cores if the material condition of these boats years from now turns out to be worse than the navy currently projects some of them might longer be suitable for service life extension in addition if world conditions over the next several years require these submarines to crs13 use up their nuclear fuel cores more quickly than the navy now projects then the amounts of time that their service lives might be extended could be reduced partially to zero or to less than zero ie the service lives of the boats rather than being extended might need to be shortened the analysis does not take into account potential rare events such as accidents that might force the removal an ssn from service before the end of its expected service live23 sevenmonth deployments might affect retention rates for submarine personnel funding additional ssns alternative funding methods alternative methods of funding the procurement of ssns include but are not necessarily limited to the following two years of advance procurement funding followed by full funding the traditional approach under which there are two years of advance procurement funding for the ssns longleadtime components followed by the remainder of the boats procurement funding in the year of procurement one year of advance procurement funding followed by full funding one year of advance procurement funding for the ssns longleadtime components followed by the remainder of the boats procurement funding in the year of procurement full funding with advance procurement funding singleyear full funding full funding of the ssn in the year of procurement with advance procurement funding in prior years incremental funding partial funding of the ssn in the year of procurement followed by one or more years of additional funding increments needed to complete the procurement cost of the ship and advance appropriations form of full funding which can be viewed as legislatively locked in form of incremental funding24 23 in january 2005 the angelesclass ssn san francisco ssn711 was significantly damaged in collision with an undersea mountain near guam the ship was repaired in part by transplanting onto it the bow section of the deactivated sister ship honolulu ssn718 see for example associated press damaged submarine to get nose transplant seattle postintelligencer june 26 2006 prior to the decision to repair the san francisco the navy considered the option of removing it from service see for example william h mcmichael sub may not be worth saving analyst says navy times february 28 2005 gene park sub repair bill 11m pacific sunday news guam may 8 2005 24 for additional discussion of these funding approaches see crs report rl32776 navy continued crs14 navy testimony to congress in early 2007 when congress was considering the fy2008 budget suggested that two years of advance procurement funding are required to fund the procurement of an ssn and consequently that additional ssns could not be procured until fy2010 at the earliest25 this testimony understated congresss options regarding the procurement of additional ssns in the near term although ssns are normally procured with two years of advance procurement funding which is used primarily for financing longleadtime nuclear propulsion components congress can procure an ssn without prioryear advance procurement funding or with only one year of advance procurement funding consequently congress currently has the option of procuring an additional ssn in fy2009 andor fy2010 singleyear full funding has been used in the past by congress to procure nuclearpowered ships for which prioryear advance procurement funding had been provided specifically congress used singleyear full funding in fy1980 to procure the nuclearpowered aircraft carrier cvn71 and again in fy1988 to procure the cvns 74 and 75 in the case of the fy1988 procurement under the administrations proposed fy1988 budget cvns 74 and 75 were to be procured in fy1990 and fy1993 respectively and the fy1988 budget was to make the initial advance procurement payment for cvn74 congress in acting on the fy1988 budget decided to accelerate the procurement of both ships to fy1988 and fully funded the two ships that year at combined cost of 6325 billion the ships entered service in 1995 and 1998 respectively26 the existence in both fy1980 and fy1988 of spare set of nimitzclass reactor components was not what made it possible for congress to fund cvns 71 74 and 75 with singleyear full funding it simply permitted the ships to be built more quickly what made it possible for congress to fund the carriers with singleyear full funding was congresss constitutional authority to appropriate funding for that purpose 24 continued ship procurement alternative funding approaches background and options for congress by ronald orourke 25 for example at march 1 2007 hearing before the house armed services committee on the fy2008 department of the navy budget request representative taylor asked which additional ships the navy might want to procure in fy2008 should additional funding be made available for that purpose in response secretary of the navy donald winter stated in part the virginiaclass submarines require us to start with twoyear advanced procurement to be able to provide for the nuclear power plant that supports them so we would need to start two years in advance what that says is if we were able to start in 08 with advanced procurement we could accelerate potentially the two year to 2010 source transcript of hearing navy officials made similar statements before the same subcommittee on march 8 2007 and before the senate armed services committee on march 29 2007 26 in both fy1988 and fy1980 the navy had spare set of nimitz cvn68 class nuclear propulsion components in inventory the existence of spare set of components permitted the carriers to be built more quickly than would have otherwise been the case but it is not what made the singleyear full funding of these carriers possible what made it possible was congress authority to appropriate funds for the purpose crs15 procuring an ssn with one year of advance procurement funding or advance procurement funding would not materially change the way the ssn would be built the process would still encompass about two years of advance work on long leadtime components and an additional six years or so of construction work on the ship itself the outlay rate for the ssn could be slower as outlays for construction of the ship itself would begin one or two years later than normal congress in the past has procured certain ships in the knowledge that those ships would not begin construction for some time and consequently would take longer to enter service than ship of that kind would normally require when congress procured two nuclearpowered aircraft carriers cvns 72 and 73 in fy1983 and another two cvns 74 and 75 in fy1988 it did so in both cases in the knowledge that the second ship in each case would not begin construction until some time after the first procuring ssns in 212 pattern some potential approaches for procuring additional boats in fy2009fy2011 could result in pattern of procuring two boats in given year followed by one boat the following year and two boats the year after that 212 pattern navy testimony to congress in early 2007 and early 2008 suggested that if the procurement rate were increased in given year to two boats it would not be best from an industrialbase point of view to decrease the rate to single boat the following year and then increase it again to two boats the next year because of the workforce fluctuations such profile would produce27 this statement may overstate the productionefficiency disadvantages of 212 pattern if two boats were procured in given year followed by one boat the next year total of three boats in 24 months the schedule for producing the three boats could be phased so that for given stage in the production process the production rate would be one boat every eight months production rate of one boat every eight months might actually help the industrial base make the transition from the current schedule of one boat every twelve months one boat per year to one boat every six months two boats per year viewed this way 212 pattern might actually lead to some benefits in production efficiency on the way to steady rate of two boats per year the navys own 30year fy2009fy2038 ssn procurement plan calls for procuring ssns in 1212 pattern in fy2029fy2038 27 see for example the spoken remarks of secretary of the navy donald winter at hearings before the house armed services committee on march 1 2007 and march 6 2008 and spoken remarks by other navy officials at march 29 2007 hearing before the senate armed services committee and at march 14 2008 hearing before the seapower and expeditionary forces subcommittee of the house armed services committee crs16 issues for congress accelerating procurement of second fy2011 boat one issue for congress is whether to accelerate the full funding of the second virginiaclass boat now planned for fy2011 to either fy2010 so as to facilitate followon option of funding an additional virginiaclass submarine in fy2011 supporters of this option might argue the following the operational risks of allowing the ssn force to drop below 48 are unacceptable the navy has described the 48boat goal as moderaterisk force so dropping substantially below 48 boats would imply highrisk force although the deepest part of the projected ssn shortfall lasts only certain number of years potential adversaries can know in advance when this will occur and make plans to take advantage of it the navys nonprocurement options for mitigating the ssn shortfall carry their own risks the navy might not be able to reduce the shipyard construction period for virginiaclass boats to 60 months due to unexpected problems in the effort to reduce shipyard construction time the navy might not be able to extend the service lives of existing ssns as much as currently projected due to faster thananticipated deterioration in ship material condition or higher thananticipated rates of nuclear fuel core use in coming years the navy might not be able to lengthen ssn deployments without adversely affecting retention rates for submarine personnel accelerating the second fy2011 ssn to fy2010 and procuring an additional ssn in fy2011 would reduce the number of sevenmonth ssn deployments needed to meet the requirement for having 10 ssns deployed on daytoday basis between 2025 and 2032 and permit the ssn force to fulfill more of the peak wartime demand for 35 ssns deployed within certain amount of time opponents of this option might argue the following given constraints on navy funding the navy cannot afford to accelerate the second fy2011 ssn to fy2010 and procure an additional ssn in fy2011 without reducing funding for one or more other navy programs in those years the operational risks that would be created by reducing funding for these other programs is greater than the operational risk that would result from procuring an additional ssn in fy2011 the navy has nonprocurement options for mitigating the projected ssn shortfall these options would allow the navy to meet the current requirement for the number of ssns to be deployed on crs17 daytoday basis and to come close to meeting the projected peak wartime demand for ssns deployed within certain amount of time maintaining design and engineering base navy and industry officials appear to agree that preserving the submarine design and engineering base over the next several years will require funding substantial submarine design and engineering work in the near term the navy plans to address the issue by accelerating into the near term the start of design work on the next generation ssbn given the ages of the navys 14 current ssbns work on replacement ssbn design would normally not need to start for several years the navy however is accelerating the start of this project into the near term with an eye toward carrying out the project as steadystate effort over several years rather than as moreconcentrated effort starting several years from now the navys plan will provide significant amount of submarine design and engineering work for several years and engage wide range of submarine design and engineering skills the navy asked rand to study the question of sustaining the submarine design and engineering base the rand study which was published in 2007 states that based on rands analysis we reach the following recommendations seriously consider starting the design of the next submarine class by 2009 to run 20 years taking into account the substantial advantages and disadvantages involved if the 20yeardesign alternative survives further evaluation the issue of gap in submarine design is resolved and further actions need be taken if that alternative is judged too risky we recommend the following thoroughly and critically evaluate the degree to which options such as the spiral development of the virginia class or design without construction will be able to substitute for newsubmarine design in allowing design professionals to retain their skills if options to sustain design personnel in excess of demand are judged on balance to offer clear advantages over letting the workforce erode then the navy should take the following actions request sufficient funding to sustain excess design workforces at the shipyards large enough to permit substantial savings in time and money later taking into account trends affecting the evolution of critical skills continue efforts to determine which shipyard skills need action to preserve them within the sustained design core conduct comprehensive analysis of vendors to the shipyards to determine which require intervention to preserve critical skills crs18 invest 30 million to 35 million annually in the nswcs carderock division submarine design workforce in excess of reimbursable demand to sustain skills that might otherwise be lost28 48boat attack submarine forcelevel goal some observers have argued that the navy in coming years should maintain force of more than 48 ssns particularly in light of for example chinese naval modernization29 and the possibility of rejuvenated russian submarine force the navy has defended the 48boat forcelevel goal for additional discussion of this issue see appendix b potential options for congress potential options for congress include but are not limited to the following some of which might be combined approving the navys current plans for procuring virginiaclass boats accelerating the full funding of the second virginiaclass boat now planned for fy2011 to fy2010 so as to facilitate followon option of funding an additional virginiaclass submarine in fy2011 funding nearterm submarine design and engineering work that is in addition to the work of this kind that the navy is currently planning and directing the navy to review the 48boat ssn force level objective in light of recent developments including chinese naval modernization and the possibility of rejuvenated russian submarine force with regard to the second option above options for providing additional work for the submarine design and engineering base over the next few years in addition to the navys plan for accelerating the start of design work on the nextgeneration ssbn include the following expanded virginiaclass modification effort the navy is currently funding certain work to modify the virginiaclass design 28 john f schank et sustaining us submarine design capabilities rand santa monica ca 2007 pp xxviixxviii prepublication copy posted on the internet by rand accessed on may 9 2007 at httpwwwrandorgpubsmonographs 2007rand_mg608pdf 29 for further discussion see crs report rl33153 china naval modernization implications for us navy capabilities background and issues for congress by ronald orourke crs19 in part to reach the navys virginiaclass costreduction target the scope of this effort could be expanded to include greater number and variety of modifications an expanded modification effort would add to the amount of submarine design and engineering work currently programmed but by itself might not be sufficient in terms of volume of work or number of skills areas engaged to fully preserve the submarine design and engineering base new advanced seal delivery system asds the asds is minisubmarine that is attached to the back of an ssgn or ssn to support operations by navy special operations forces sof who are called seals an acronym that stands for sea air and land dod has decided after building one copy of the current asds design not to put that design into serial production some observers have proposed developing new asds design with the intention of putting this new design into serial production this option like the previous one would add to the amount of submarine design and engineering work currently programmed but by itself might not be sufficient in terms of volume of work or number of skills areas engaged to fully preserve the submarine design and engineering base dieselelectric submarine for taiwan in april 2001 the bush administration announced proposed armssales package for taiwan that included among other things eight dieselelectric submarines30 since foreign countries that build dieselelectric submarines appear reluctant to make their designs available for program to build such boats for taiwan some observers have proposed that the united states develop its own design for this purpose this option would generate substantial volume of work and engage many skill areas uncertainty over whether and when this project might occur could make it difficult to confidently incorporate it into an integrated schedule of work for preserving the us design and engineering base although the project would engage many skill areas it might not engage all of them skills related to the design of nuclear propulsion plants for example might not be engaged in addition this project might raise concerns regarding the potential for unintended transfer of sensitive us submarine technology an issue that has been cited by the navy in the past for not supporting the idea of designing and building diesel electric submarines in the united states for sale to foreign buyers31 30 for more on the proposed arms sales package including the dieselelectric submarines see crs report rl30957 taiwan major us arms sales since 1990 by shirley kan 31 an additional issue that some observers believe might be behind navy resistance to the idea of designing and building dieselelectric submarines in the united states for sale to foreign buyers but which these observers believe the navy is unwilling to state publicly is purported fear among navy officials that the establishment of us production line for continued crs20 new ssn design developing completely new ssn design as the successor to the virginiaclass design would fully support the design and engineering base for several years the navy in the past has estimated that the cost of this option would be roughly equivalent to the procurement cost of three ssns the house version of the fy2006 defense authorization bill hr 1815 proposed this idea but the idea was not supported by the navy in large part because of its cost and the conference version of the bill did not mandate it legislative activity for fy2009 fy2009 defense authorization bill hr 5658s 3001 house section 122 of hr 5658 as reported by the house armed services committee would amend the authority that congress provided in the fy2008 defense authorization act for the navy to use multiyear procurement myp contracts for procurement of virginiaclass submarines starting in fy200932 to require the secretary of the navy to certify that any such contract will be awarded in accordance with the 1997 teaming agreement between gdeb and ngsb for joint production of virginiaclass submarines in its report hrept 110652 of may 16 2008 on hr 5658 the committee states that the provision would modify the myp authority granted in the fy2008 legislation to include the requirement that any multiyear contract entered into between the navy and the shipbuilders must specify that the previous teaming agreements for submarine construction between the two shipbuilders shall remain in effect page 141 the committees report on hr 5658 recommended 722 million in additional fy2009 advance procurement funding for the virginiaclass program to support the acceleration to fy2010 of the procurement of the second boat currently planned for procurement in fy2011 page 79 line 004 the report states that the committee disagrees with the submitted future years defense plan and budget request for not requesting funding to increase the build rate of virginia class submarines to 2 ships per year starting in 2010 pages 8283 and that the additional advance procurement funding recommended by the committee is necessary for the procurement of 2 ships in fiscal year 2010 page 83 the report also states attack submarine force structure requirements the committee directs the secretary of the defense to assess the total number of attack submarines required to fulfill the missions of the department 31 continued such boats would lead to political pressure for the navy to accept the procurement of such boats for its own use perhaps in lieu of nuclearpowered submarines the navy argues that nonnuclearpowered submarines are not well suited for us submarine operations which typically involve long stealthy transits to the operating area long submerged periods in the operating area and long stealthy transits back to home port 32 section 121 of hr 4986pl 110181 of january 28 2008 crs21 of defense and to support the national defense strategy as part of the quadrennial defense review qdr conducted in fiscal year 2009 pursuant to section 118 of title 10 united states code such an assessment should be based upon an analysis and prioritization of unconstrained attack submarine requirements sorted by mission provided by the combatant commanders the committee further directs that results of such an assessment be included in the report on the quadrennial defense review submitted to the senate committee on armed services and the house committee on armed services in accordance with section 118d of title 10 united states code servicelife extension of ssn688 angeles class hulls the committee understands that the secretary of the navy has conducted an assessment of the feasibility of extending the service life of certain ssn688 angeles class submarines in order to mitigate the projected shortfall in the navys attack submarine force structure the committee is encouraged by this effort but notes that the assessment did not explore options that would increase the number of attack submarines above 48 in the longterm the committee also notes that the assessment did not explore options for limiting deployments or other actions that could limit hull fatigue in the near term in order to conserve service life of more angeles class submarines over the longterm therefore the committee directs the secretary of the navy to submit report which includes an assessment of the feasibility and cost of extending the service life of all current angeles class submarines this report should explore the options in the near term which would fully utilize all available hull life and maximize the total number of attack submarines available after 2016 the committee directs the secretary to submit this report within 120 days after the date of enactment of this act pages 8182 the report recommended 10 million in additional navy research and development funding for work on an underwater launched missile study ulms in support of new seabased strategic deterrent page 182 line 42 the report elsewhere refers to the increase being 5 million rather than 10 million stating the budget request for the navys research and development account contained 1417 million in pe program element 63561n for advanced submarine system development but contained funds for design and development of seabased strategic undersea launched missile the committee is concerned that the department of defense has coherent plan for undersea launched strategic deterrent weapons systems to eventually replace the current undersea strategic force the committee believes that research and development is necessary now to ensure undersea launched weapons capability is available in the future the committee recommends an increase of 50 million in pe 63561n to begin initial studies and concept designs of future undersea launched weapons systems page 203 the report recommended 15 million in additional navy research and development funding for work on largediameter launch tube for virginiaclass submarines page 182 line 42 the report states crs22 the budget request contained 1417 million in pe 63561n for advanced submarine system design but contained funds for continued design and development efforts of large diameter weapons launch tube for virginia class submarines the committee understands that development of large diameter launch tube for virginia class submarines will increase combat capability and reduce overall construction costs the large diameter tube also has the potential to field new technologies such as undersea autonomous vehicles as those technologies mature the committee recommends an increase of 150 million in pe 63561n for design and development of large diameter weapons launch tube for virginia class submarines pages 203204 senate section 131 of s 3001 as reported by the senate armed services committee would amend the authority that congress provided in the fy2008 defense authorization act for the navy to use multiyear procurement myp contracts for procurement of virginiaclass submarines starting in fy200933 to permit the secretary of the navy to enter into one or more contracts for advance procurement and advance construction of those components for virginiaclass submarines for which authority for using myp contracts was granted in the fy2008 legislation if the secretary determines that cost savings or construction efficiencies may be achieved for virginiaclass submarines through the use of such contracts in its report srept 110335 of may 12 2008 on s 3001 the committee states that the navy believes that having such an option available could help achieve greater cost savings and production efficiencies as the program increases throughput to rate of two boats per year in fiscal year 2011 page 74 the committees report on s 3001 recommended 79 million in additional fy2009 advance procurement funding for the virginiaclass program to smooth the ramp up to 2 boats per year page 57 line 004 the report states the budget request included approximately 13 billion for advance procurement for the virginiaclass submarine program including 5968 million for economic order quantity eoq procurement of long lead material in conjunction with the current multiyear procurement program congress approved the navys request to enter into multiyear procurement contract in the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 public law 110181 and added 5880 million to help accelerate increasing the attack submarine program to rate of two boats per year at that time the navy planned to increase production to rate of two boats per year in fiscal year 2012 this year as part of the fiscal year 2009 request the navy plans to accelerate that production increase to fiscal year 2011 the navy has also identified that additional eoq funding in fiscal year 2009 and additional authority to conduct advance construction activities would help achieve greater 33 section 121 of hr 4986pl 110181 of january 28 2008 crs23 cost savings and production efficiencies and reduce the span time for construction as the program increases throughput to rate of two boats per year in fiscal year 2011 therefore the committee recommends an increase for eoq funding of 790 million page 76 the abovequoted language from pages 74 and 76 of the report suggest that the 79 million in additional advance procurement funding is not intended to accelerate to fy2010 the procurement of the second boat currently planned for procurement in fy2011 the report recommended 15 million in additional navy research and development funding to continue ssbnx design and study activities page 178 line 42 the report states the budget request for the navys research and development account included 1417 million in pe program element 63561n for advanced submarine systems development the design and development efforts in these programs are to evaluate broad range of system and technology alternatives to directly support and enhance the mission capability of current submarines and future submarine concepts qthe budget request included funding to begin studies that would lead to developing replacement for the ohio class strategic missile submarine program which was designed in the 1970s the navy has begun studies under program called the undersea launch missile study ulms the efforts within ulms will involve exploring new technologies conceptual design of ship configurations supporting ship systems consideration of strategic payloads and development of other payloads however there appears to be insufficient work to maintain the skill set among submarine designers until the navy would otherwise start designing replacement for the ohio class previous report by the rand corporation evaluating the submarine design industrial base concluded that it would be less expensive to sustain some number of workers in excess of those needed to meet the residual design demands during such gap one means of achieving this goal would be to begin the more extensive design activities earlier than the navy would otherwise start them to support specific date to start building the next class the committee believes that the navy should continue that effort in fiscal year 2009 and recommends an increase of 150 million for that purpose page 193 compromise in lieu of conference report there was compromise

of the house appropriations committee issued press release summarizing the subcommittees markup of the bill that same day34 the press release states that the markup redistributes the shipbuilding account to include 3976 million for long lead items in the virginia class submarine program although the press release does not say so explicitly the wording suggests that this 3976 million was advance procurement funding that would be in addition to the 7198 million in advance procurement funding that the navy requested for the virginiaclass program35 senate the senate appropriations committee did not file report on the fy2009 defense appropriations bill on september 10 2008 the committee issued press release summarizing the markup of the bill that day by its defense subcommittee

procurement funding since 3976 million is less than the 7198 million the navy requested for advance procurement the 3976 million cannot be said to include the 7198 million the reference to redistributing shipbuilding funding to various programs including the virginiaclass program suggests that each of the programs listed received additional funding in light of this an interpretation that the 7198million advance procurement funding request was reduced to 3976 million appears unlikely 36 september 10 2008 press release from senate appropriations committee entitled senate defense

us defense policy established goal of maintaining navy of about 346 ships including 45 to 55 ssns39 the clinton administrations 1997 qdr supported requirement for navy of about 305 ships and established tentative ssn force level goal of 50 boats contingent on reevaluation of peacetime operational requirements40 the clinton administration later amended the ssn figure to 55 boats and therefore total of about 310 ships the reevaluation called for in the 1997 qdr was carried out as part of joint chiefs of staff jcs study on future requirements for ssns that was completed in december 1999 the study had three main conclusions that force structure below 55 ssns in the 2015 time frame and 62 ssns in the 2025 time frame would leave the cincs the regional military commandersinchief

defense dod forcelevel goals the george w bush administrations report on the 2001 qdr revalidated the amended requirement from the 1997 qdr for fleet of about 310 ships including 55 ssns in revalidating this and other us military forcestructure goals the report cautioned that as dods transformation effort matures and as it produces significantly higher output of military value from each element of the force dod will explore additional opportunities to restructure and reorganize the armed forces42 dod and the navy conducted studies on undersea warfare requirements in 20032004 one of the navy studies an internal navy study done in 2004 reportedly recommended reducing the attack submarine force level requirement to as few as 37 boats the study reportedly recommended homeporting

report hartford ct courant may 26 2005 crs29 appendix b views regarding 48boat ssn forcelevel goal this appendix summarizes the navys view and an alternative view regarding the appropriateness of the navys 48boat ssn forcelevel goal navy view46 in support of its position that 48 is the correct number of ssns to meet future needs the navy in 2006 argued the following the figure of 48 ssns was derived from number of forcelevel studies that converged on figure of about 48 boats making this figure an analytical sweet spot force of 48 boats is moderaterisk ie acceptablerisk force as opposed to the lowrisk force called for in the 1999 jcs study force of 48 boats will be sufficient in coming years to maintain about 10 forwarddeployed ssns on daytoday basis the same number of forwarddeployed boats that the navy has previously maintained with force of more than 50 ssns the navy will be able to maintain 10 forwarddeployed ssns in coming years with only 48 boats because the force in coming years will include an increased number of newer ssns that require less maintenance over their lives and consequently are available for operation greater percentage of the time us regional military commanders would prefer daytoday forwarddeployed total of about 18 ssns but total of 10 will be sufficient to meet their most important needs all 10 of the forwarddeployed ssns are needed for daytoday missions such as intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr while about 75 of these submarines are also needed to ensure that an adequate number of ssns are in position for the opening phases of potential conflicts in various locations on the issue of meeting us regional military commanders requirements for daytoday forwarddeployed ssns the navy states each combatant commander cocom requests assets to execute required missions utilizing the global force management process broad categories of mission types are used to make requests including national and fleet isr exercise and training supporting us tactical development exercise and operations supporting us engagement strategy carrier strike group csg expeditionary strike group esg tasking oplan war plans support and 46 this section

include priority breakdown in general isr missions have been assigned as critical or high priority requirements other mission areas have been assigned from high priority to routine based on the relative importance to the theater commander allocation is currently requested to support oplan or other mission areas each cocom has authority to use its allocated ssns as required to meet current national and theater priorities the cjcs chairman joint chiefs of staff allocation order to the submarine force strictly directs an allotted number of ssn days of presence be provided capable of meeting each theaters sic taskings the breakdown of mission priorities into critical high priority priority and routine is predominantly construct to demonstrate how cocom could meet their priorities given specific level of ssn presence it serves as an aid to the cjcs in apportioning limited ssn presence to the various theaters the number of ssns allocated against critical missions enabled cocoms to meet all requirements in 2004 and 2005 and 99 of the requirements in 2006 for high priority missions sufficient ssns were allocated to meet 25 50 and 34 of requirements in 2004 2005 and 2006 respectively overall the number of ssns forward deployed was sufficient to cover 66 61 and 54 of combatant commanders requested ssn mission taskings in 2004 2005 and 2006 respectively47 alternative view some observers believe that more than 48 ssns will be needed to meet future needs one such observer retired vice admiral albert konetzni jr former commander of the us pacific fleet submarine force argued the following in 200648 the navys ssn forcelevel analyses called for force of 48 to 60 ssns in this context force of 48 ssns looks more like sour spot than sweet spot the navys ssn forcelevel analyses reflect reverse engineering in which an ssn forcelevel number is selected at the outset for affordability reasons and assumptions used in the forcelevel study are then adjusted to produce that figure the 1999 jcs study on ssn requirements remains valid today 47 source written response by vice admiral charles l munns commander naval submarine forces to question posed by

that are being met are critical in light of the potential size of chinas submarine force in 2020 force of 48 ssns in that year will be insufficient49 49 for more on chinas submarine force and chinas
