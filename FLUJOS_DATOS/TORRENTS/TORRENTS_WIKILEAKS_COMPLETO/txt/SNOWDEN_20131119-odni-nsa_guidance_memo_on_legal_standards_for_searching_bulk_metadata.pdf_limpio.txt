0808 as well as subsequent orders for the production of telephony records1 as well as to the contact chaining activities in which sid analysts engage pursuant to the pen register and trap and trace order 08110 as well as subsequent pentrap orders23 1 tssinf the business records order is captioned in re application of the federal bureau of investigation for an order requiring the production of tangible things from i i the pentrap order is captioned 3 tssinf ogc memorandum dated october 132006 same subject is canceled this memorandum updates the prior memorandum to reflect changes in the foreign intelligence surveillance court fisc the substantive guidance concerning the application of the reasonable articulable suspicion standard with respect to the authorizations remains unchanged top secretcomintnoforn 1 subject to tiie attorneyclient privilege and the attorney workprodi ift doctrine do not release outside of nsa without ogc approval top secretcomiotnoforn 2 tssinf both of the orders set out standard that allows access to the data when nsa has identified known telephone number or other electronic identifier for which based on the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent persons act there are facts giving rise to reasonable articulable suspicion that the telephone number or electronic identifier4 is associated withl ïmt553ï 5 provided however that telephone number or an account or address 5e used bv us person shall not be regarded as associated with solely on the basis of activities that are protected by the first amendment to the constitution when such determination has been made nsa is authorized by the orders to use such numberselectronic identifiers as seed addresses by querying the accumulated data to determine other telephone numbers or electronic identifiers the seed has contacted summary of the standard 3 tss1nf the reasonable articulable suspicion standard embodied in the courts orders requires that before an analyst may use telephone number or electronic identifier as seed address to query the database of records heshe must be able to articulate some fact or set of facts that causes himher to suspect that the number is formulation means thatanalysts are not free to use telephone number or electronic identifier based merely on hunch or guess but must instead base their decisions on specific facts that would cause reasonable person to form such suspicion 4 tssinf note that the standard does not present particularly high hurdle6 the level of evidence demanded by the standard is considerably less than proof by preponderance of the evidence meaning thauiemiieeohouiore likely than not that number is associated with term electronic identifier is intended to include not only email addresses but also similar routing and addressing information that effects delivery of electronic communications 5 tssinf the phrase associated terrorist organization connotes particular list of lie director of national intelligence dni to have allied themselves witfa the specific list is included in the fisc orders 6 ufouo the reasonable articulable suspicion standard comes from the law enforcement context and therefore the cases addressing it focus on actions of police officers see terry v ohio 392 us 1 1968 the idea underpinning the standard is that the police may stop and briefly detain someone for investigative purposes if the officer involved has reasonable suspicion supported by articulable facts that criminal activity may be afoot even where the officer lacks probable cause to believe that this is so see us v sokolow 490 us 17 1989 the officer must be able to articulate something more than an inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or hunch terry at 27 rather the standard demands some minimal level of objective justification for making the stop in question ins v delgado 466 us 210217 1984 top secretcomintnoforn 2 subject to tiie attorneyclient privilege and the attorney workprodi ift doctrine do not release outside of nsa without ogc approval top secretcomiotnoforn see sokolow at 7 indeed the courts have made clear that the level of suspicion required for terry stop ie the level of suspicion required to constitute reasonable articulable suspicion is obviously less demanding than that for probable cause id citations omitted1 further the sokolow court observed that the concept of reasonable suspicion like probable cause requires an examination of the totality of the circumstances the whole picture id citing us v cortez 449 us 411417 1981 the sokolow court quoting one of its earlier cases noted that the process does not deal with hard certainties but with probabilities long before the law of probabilities was articulated as such practical people formulated certain commonsense conclusions about human behavior jurors as factfinders are permitted to do the same and so are law enforcement officers see cortez at 418 5 tssinf in addition for reasons set out belo associated to mean engaged in common enterprise with 3ne of the groups designated by the dni to have allied itself wit jor with someone acting as an agent thereof finally in case in hsnnalysuntends to base his suspicion of numberelectronic identifier used by party solely oncontact with party b such contact must be direct contact and it must misi 1 b association withj 6 tssinf as we alluded to above the meaning of the word associated is important to the analysis since the determination that must be made is that telephone number or electronic identifier is associated wit pignated by the dni to have allied itself while this standard does not say explicitly that the telepto lfier at issue must be used by member or agent ofh jand while we do not insist on such finding here we note that the dictionary definition of associate suggests knowing relationship and engagement in common enterprise9 therefore in making their assessments analysts should consider whether given the totality of the circumstances there exist articula think that telephone number or electronic identifier bears relationship to lor one of the groups designated by the dni to have allied itself 7 u reasonable articulable suspicion is low standard of proof the common standards of proof and common applications of the standards are set out in jinclosurl i would meet the stam probable cause or higher showing ufuofor example associate is defined as follows to join as partner friend or companion to keep company with and also to combine or join with other parts merriam webster collegiate dictionary tenth edition at 70 top secretcomintnoforn 3 subject to tiie attorneyclient privilege and the attorney workprodi ift doctrine do not release outside of nsa without ogc approval top secretcomiotnoforn nature that suggests used by someone engaged in common enterprise with one of the aforementioned 7 tssinf we recognize too that there may be cases in which an analysts articulable suspicion that number is associated wit will be based on telephone or email contacts alone while basing determination on more information than this is preferable and indeed is required to the degree more information is available since one is required to examine the totality of the circumstances analysts must when premising their determinations solely on contact be mindful of what they actually know about the parties involved for example an analyst who has reasonable articulable suspicion with respect to particular telephone number could not query the database to determine what number is three hops away in the communications chain and then based on such contact alone conclude that the number three hops away now should be used as seed number therefore in cases in which communications contacts are the sole justification for concluding that number is associated with such contact must 1 be direct contact and must he with number or electronic identifier for which we have concluded it is more likely than not used by member of c first amendment considerations 8 tssinf in addition the orders each contain provision stating that telephone number or electronic ssociated with i activities that are protected by the first amendment to the constitution 9 tssinf we read the orders as barring nsa from concluding based on such things as the religion of the us person or his editorials contending that the united states is wrong in its war on terrorism or his membership in groups that oppose policies of the united states or the fact that heshe attends antiwar demonstrations and urges his 10 tssinf in order to establish meaningful association from contact alone between the two numbers and b where b is number that is alreadusgectjjjoryikelue than not true that number b is used by eg member oragentofhhhhh neither vague statements about the role of party b in mhhhnoranmdirect linking of the number in question with party b was in contact with party x who was in contact with party b who is probably member ofh will suffice on their own to satisfy the standard as to party where the reasomblirticulab alone such contact must be direct with member or agent and it must be more likely than not that our designation of such member or agent is in fact accurate this advice should help serve to prevent the potential for endless bootstrapping as we have discussed the danger in carrying out the instimn the courts order is suspicion that ceases to be reasonable because of the tenuousness of thej connection we believe that this analytic framework will go long way to countering any such tendency that might exist see enclosure 2 top secretcomintnoforn 4 subject to tiie attorneyclient privilege and the attorney workprodi ift doctrine do not release outside of nsa without ogc approval top secretcomiotnoforn which nsa has the appropriate level of suspicion our conclusion is supported by first amendment law as we discuss below 10 ufouo the first amendment by its terms makes clear that congress can make law respecting the establishment of religion or abridging freedom of speech or of the press or peaceable assembly or the petitioning of the government for the redress of grievances 11 ufouo in addition the amendment has also been construed by courts to protect the freedom of association freedom not explicitly mentioned in its text the courts have opined that the right of association implied in the constitution mainly protects associations when they are derivative of other first amendment guarantees normally speech assembly and petition for instance in case examining universitys decision to refuse recognition to student organization students for democratic society the supreme court stated while freedom of association is not explicitly set out in the amendment it has long been held to be implicit in the freedoms of speech assembly and petition healy v james 408 us 169181 1972 citations omitted emphasis added similarly in one of many cases in which the issue was whether the government could compel an organization to turn over lists of its members the supreme court observed that it is now beyond dispute that freedom of association for the purpose of advancing ideas and airing grievances is protected by the constitution from invasion by the states bates v city of little rock 361 us 516 522523 i960 emphasis added1 12 ufouo by contrast simple social contacts that do not rise to the level of organizations or associations erected for the purpose of engaging in speech do not enjoy the same degree of protection for example the supreme court addressing the question whether the state could restrict admission to dance halls to persons between 14 and 18 years old rejected challenge based on the right of association and held that the state did indeed have such authority in so doing the court found that there does not exist generalized right of social association that includes chance encounters in dance halls see city of dallas v stanglin 490 us 19 25 198912 11 u the first amendment also protects intimate associations among family members permitting the government to infringe on such interests only to serve compelling interest and to do so in the manner that is least intrusive see eg roberts v united states jaycees 468 us 609619620 1984 12 tssinf we note also that the very object of the overall effort supported by these orders is to determine whether or not particular individuals are members of or are associated with the terrorist organizations named in the orders thus under these orders simply by being member of named group one becomes subject to government scrutiny top secretcomintnoforn 5 subject to tiie attorneyclient privilege and the attorney workprodi ift doctrine do not release outside of nsa without ogc approval top secretcomiotnoforn 13 g the fact that these orders only concern communications routing information or metadata rather than the substance of communications further underscores the limited relevance of the first amendment in the context of association the dc circuit observed in 1978 that datagathering activities using legitimate investigative techniques do not violate the first amendment at least where fourth amendment privacy is infringed see reporters committee for freedom of the press v att 593 f2d 10301064 dc cir 1978 since individuals do not enjoy reasonable expectation of privacy under the fourth amendment in the communications metadata nsa acquires under these orders smith v maryland 442 us 735 1979 the investigative techniques nsa uses pursuant to the orders do not run afoul of the first amendment as the court in the reporters committee case observed the first amendment offers procedural or substantive protection from good faith criminal investigation beyond that afforded by the fourth and fifth amendments reporters committee at 1057 14 tssinf the above makes clear that the courts have fashioned protections for association in order to preserve the other rights guaranteed by the constitution in the first amendment since the right to free association has been found by courts to be protected largely as an extension of the other constitutional protections in order to keep these rights from being frustrated and because the derivative right to associate is subsumed by the more specific rights enumerated in the amendment we conclude that the terms of the courts orders are not intended in the context of these orders to preclude entirely the conclusion of association based on communications contact observed in communications metadata we therefore advise that nsa is obligated by the terms of these orders to refrain from finding an association withb based solely on these activities that are explicitly atlord protection by the language of first amendment but nsa is not precluded from finding jiatioryasekiklire so long as such contact is direct and the evidence shows it more likely than not that the putative member of an aforementioned group is in fact member d summary 15 tssinf analysts making determination as to whether telephone number or electronic identifier is eligible to be seed must consider all the facts that they know or reasonably can know prior to engaging in contact chaining looking at the totality of the circumstances the whole picture they must determine whether reasonable articulable snsnirinn twists that the telenhone number or electronic identifier th is there reason to suspect that the person using the evidence required is considerably less than showing that it is more likely than not that number is associated with one of the aforementioned rather there must be an articulable reason
