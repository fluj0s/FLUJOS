from ben santer santer1llnlgov to pjonesueaacuk subject re fwd joc080098r1 decision on manuscript date thu 10 jul 2008 135640 0700 replyto santer1llnlgov xflowed dear phil the wedding was really very moving and beautiful i had great time im sending along picture of tom and helen which was taken at granite island near victor harbor i dont know whether ive ever seen tom as happy as he is now myles if it is myles was bit pedantic in his second review karl who is verymildmannered guy described the tone of the review as whining it seems like the reviewer was saying im lot smarter than you and i could do all of this stuff much better than youve done i was very unhappy about the wilfully ignoring bit that was completely uncalled for have great time at lake constance phil its beautiful part of the world best regards and best wishes to ruth ben pjonesueaacuk wrote ben will read the comments in detail tomorrow when at cru i presume the wedding went well and good time was had by all im in cru tomorrow but away next week im off to one your old hunting grounds friedrichshafen i am going to summer school on the other side of the lake near konstanz cant recall the village name somthing like treffpunkt only gone week back friday week from quick scan below myles does seem to be pain as we both know he can be cheers phil dear folks i just returned from my trip to australia i had great time there now sadly its back to the reality of douglass et im forwarding the second set of comments from the two reviewers as youll see reviewer 1 was very happy with the revisions weve made to the paper reviewer 2 was somewhat crankier the good news is that the editor glenn mcgregor will not send the paper back to reviewer 2 and is requesting only minor changes in response to the reviewers comments once again reviewer 2 gets hung up on the issue of fitting higherorder autoregressive models to the temperature time series used in our paper as noted in our response to the reviewer this is relatively minor technical point the main point is that we include an estimate of the standard error of the observed trend dcps07 do not which is the main error in their analysis in calculating modeled and observed standard errors we assume an ar1 model of the regression residuals this assumption is not unreasonable for many meteorological time series we and others have made it in number of previous studies reviewer 2 would have liked us to fit higherorder autoregressive models to the t2 t2lt and tst2lt time series this is difficult business particularly given the relatively short length of the time series available here there is easy way to reliably estimate the parameters of higherorder ar models from 20 to 30 years of data the same applies to reliable estimation of the spectral density at frequency zero since we have only 23 independent samples for estimating the spectral density at frequency zero reviewer 2s comments are not particularly relevant to the specific problem we are dealing with here its also worth mentioning that use of higherorder ar models for estimating trend standard errors would likely lead to smaller effective sample sizes and larger standard errors thus making it even more difficult to find significant differences between modelled and observed trends our use of an ar1 model makes it easier for us to obtain dcps07like results and to find significant differences between modelled and observed trends dcps cannot claim therefore that our test somehow stacks the deck in favor of obtaining nonsignificance trend difference which they might claim if we used poorlyconstrained higherorder ar model for estimating standard errors the reviewer does not want to see the method proposed in this paper become established as the default method of estimating standard errors in climatological time series we do not claim universal applicability of our approach there may well be circumstances in which it is more appropriate to use higherorder ar models in estimating standard errors id be happy to make statement to this effect in the revised paper i have to confess that i was little ticked off by reviewer 2s comments the bit about wilfully ignoring time series literature was uncalled for together with my former mpi colleague wolfgang brueggemann ive fooled around with lot of different methods of estimating standard errors in both the time domain and frequency domain one could write whole paper on this subject alone such paper would not help us to expose the statistical deficiencies in dcps07 nor would indepth exploration of this issue lead to the shorter paper requested by the reviewer it should take few days to revise the paper and draft response to reviewer 2s comments ill send you the revised paper and draft response early next week slowly but surely we are getting there with best regards ben benjamin d santer program for climate model diagnosis and intercomparison lawrence livermore national laboratory po box 808 mail
