regardin g pupil assessment program improvement allocation of funds school selection fiscal accountability and parental involve ment but very few constraints on such matters as the speci fic resources for which funds are used the child left behind act of 2001 pl 107110 builds upon title ia provisions adopted in 1994 that required pa rticipating states to adopt curriculum content and pupil performance standards and assessments linked to these at three grade levels in reading and mathematics initiated steps toward identifying low performing schools and leas attempted to increase targ eting of funds on high poverty leas and schools and increased flexibility highlights of the title ia provisions of pl 107110 include the following 1 participating states are required to implement standardsbased assessments for pupils in each of grades 38 in reading and mathematics by the end of the 20052006 school year and to implement assessments at three grade levels in science by the 20072008 school year 2 states receiving title ia funds are required to participate in national assessment of educational progress tests in 4th and 8th grade reading and mathematics every two years 3 adequate yearly progress ayp standards with goal of all pupils reaching proficient or advanced level of achievement on state assessments within 12 years must be deve loped by states and applied to each public school lea and state 4 pupils at schools pa rticipating in title ia that fail to meet ayp for two consecutive years must be ffered public school choice options and if title ia school fails to meet ayp for third year pupils from lowincome families must be offered the opportunity to receive instruction from supplemental services provider of their choice 5 corrective actions must be taken with respect to title ia schools that fail to meet ayp fo r fourth year and those that fail for fifth year must be restructured 6 title ia allocation formulas are modified to increase targeting on highpoverty states and leas under the education finance incentive grant formula move puerto rico gradually toward parity with the states and increase state minimum grants 7 states must ensure that all of their teachers in core subject areas are highly qualified and that all paraprof essionals paid with title ia funds have completed at least two years of higher education or met rigorous standard of

pl 107110 among other provisions this act builds upon title i provisions adopted initially in the improving americas schools act i asa of 1994 which required states1 to adopt curriculum content and pupil performance sta ndards and assessments linked to these at three grade levels in reading and mathematics initiated steps toward identifying lowperforming schools and leas attempted to increase ta

issues likely to be considered by the 110th congress4 major esea title ia amendments adopt ed in the child left behind act of 2001 pl 107110 were focused on pupil assessment adequate yearly progress ayp requirements progra m improvement and correctiv actions for schools and leas allocation formulas staff qualifications flexibility and services to private school pupils staff and parents each of these topics is discussed below issues regarding implementation of these requireme nts and other provisions are likely to be considered by the 109th congress such debates ma particularly occur as the congress considers new high school initia tive released by the administration in conjunction with its fy2006 and fy2007 budgets relevant aspects of this initiative are discussed below at the end of the report section on pupil assessment this report concludes with brie f discussion of debate in some states and leas over continued participation in the title ia program and the potential effects of opting out of participati on in the program pupil assessment5 the iasa of 1994 required states particip ating in title ia to develop or adopt curriculum content standards pupil perform ance standards and assessments linked to these at least in the subjects of mathematics and readinglanguage arts and for at least one grade in each of three grade rang grades 35 69 nd 1012 in general these standards and assessments were to be applicable to title ia participants as well as all other pupils in the state these requirements were adopted in part to raise expectations that title ia participants would be required to meet challenging academic standards and to link the progra m to standardsbased reforms taking place in most states typically such standard sbased reform involves the establishment of explicit and challenging goals for state sc hool systems and alignment of curricula assessment methods pupil performance standards t eacher professional development instructional materials nd other school system policie s in support of the goals the deadline for adopting content nd performance standards was the 1997 1998 program year and for assessments was the 20002001 program year

5 2002 pp 4503845047 state assessments meeting the esea title ia requirements may include either criterion referenced tests crts tests that measure the extent to which pupils have mastered specified content content standard to pred etermined degree achievement standard or normreferenced tests nrts tests in which pupil performance is measured against that of other pupils rather than against some fixed standard of performance although any nrts used must be augmented to incorporate the states content standards and have results expressed in terms of the states achievement st andards for further discussion of this and related issues see crs report rl31407 educational testing implementation of esea title ia requirements under the child left behind act by wayne c riddle 8 the nclba explicitly provides that partic ipation in naep tests is voluntary for all pupils but it contains conflicting provisions regarding voluntary participation by leas and schools the naep authorization statute recently rede signated as section 303 of the education sciences reform act by pl 107279 states that participation is voluntary for leas and schools as well as pupils however esea title ia provides that the plans of leas receiving aid under that program must include an assurance that they will participate in state continuedwere given several years to meet these re quirements because many of them were at an early stage of standardsbased reform in 1994 the us department of education ed has been reviewing evidence that state standards and assessments meet the requirements of the title ia statute eg that assessments are linked to state content and pupil performance standards or that disabled and limited english proficient lep pupils are assessed with appropriate accommodations or adaptations but is not considering the substance of state sta ndards and assessments as of the date of this report 46 states have been approved by ed as meeting all of these 1994 requirements for three of the remaining states timeline waivers have been granted to allow them to complete the process of developing and implementing necessary assessments over the next couple of years compliance agreements have been negotiated between ed and the remaining three states that are farther from meeting these requirements pl 107110 substantially expanded th previous title ia assessment provisions in addition to the requirement for assessments at three grade levels in reading and mathematics all participating states will be required to implement assessments linked to state content and academic achievement standards for all public school pupils in each of grades 38 in reading and mathematics by the 2005 2006 school year states will also have to develop and imple ment assessments at three grade levels in science by the 20072008 school year6 pl 107110 requires assessments to be of adequate tec hnical quality for each purpose required under this act7 all states receiving title ia grants are required to participate in national assessment of educational pr ogress naep tests in 4th and 8th grade reading and mathematics administered every two years with costs paid by the federal government individual

selected to participate federal register dec 2 2002 p 71740those in puerto rico for at least three years must be tested for reading in english and states are required to annually assess the english language proficiency of their lep pupils the revised esea authorizes in title via1 annual grants to the states to help pay the costs of meeting the title ia standard and assessment requirements added by the nclba these grants may be used by states for development of standards and assessments or if thes have been developed for assessment administration and such related activities as developing or improving assessments of the english language profic iency of lep pupils the st ate assessment requirements that were newly adopted under the nclb are contingent upon the appropriation of minimum annual amounts for these state assessment grants for each of fy2002 fy2006 at least the minimum amount was appropriated for these grants for fy2006 the minimum is 400 million and the appropriation is 407563000 the nclba also authorizes competitive grants to states for the development of enhanced assessment instruments aided activities may include efforts to improve the quality validity and reliab ility of assessments beyond th levels required by title ia to track student progress over time or to develop performance or technology based assessments f unds appropriated each year for st ate assessment grants that are in excess of the trigger amounts desc ribed above for assessment development grants are to be used for enhanced assessment grants for fy2002 17 million was made available for this purpose in fe bruary 2003 grants to nine states were announced the amount available for assessment enhancement grants was 4484000 under the fy2003 appropriation but funds were available for such grants under the fy2004 appropriation for fy2005 1168 million was available for assessment development grants and 76 million is available for fy 2006 in addition the department is to contract with an indepe ndent organization for study of the assessments and accountability policie s used by states to meet title ia requirements issues regarding the expanded esea title ia pupil asse ssment requirements include the following what is the cost of developing and implementing the assessments and have federal grants been sufficient to pay for them what might be the impact of the requirement for annual assessment of the english language proficiency of lep pupils what might be the impact on naep as well as the impact of naep on state standards and assessments of requiring state participation in naep while not requiring par ticipation by individual pupils and schoolshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31487crs5 what are the likely major benefits and costs of the expanded esea title ia pupil assessment requireme nts will they significantly increase the focus on assessments in public k12 education if so will this enhance educational achievement and quality or will it undesirably limit instructional curricu or drive out assessments in subjects other than reading mathematics or science the bush administrations high school initiative in conjunction with its fy2006 and fy2007 budgets the bush administration has requested funding for high school initia tive thus far details of the proposal are not available nor have bills based on the proposal been introduced or acted upon based on the available information the hs i will be multifaceted and some aspects of it are directly relevant to the topi c discussed immediatel above assessment requirements for states participating in esea title ia the other major aspect of the hsi would be targeted initiatives to improve lowperforming high schools for fy2007 total of 1475 billion has been requested for this initiative under the hsi states receiving title i grants would be required to administer statedeveloped standardsba sed assessments in reading and mathematics in two additional high school grades presuma bly between grades 9 and 12 since the nclba already requires such assessments in each of grades 38 by the 20092010 school year in addition to the one grade b etween grades 10 and 12 already required as discussed above additiona l grants to states would be available to help pay the costs of developing these assessments the administration has also requested an additional 4 million in funding for naep fo r fy2007 to pay the costs of beginning to develop new series of 12th grade reading and mathematics assessments at the state level at this point there are several unanswere d questions regarding the hsi these include the following might the require d assessments include high school exit or graduation tests given the relatively high degree of curriculum differentiation at the senior high school level g vocational and technical education programs advanced placement courses and so forth might states be allowed to meet these requirements by adopting different types of tests fo r pupils in different types of academic programs might advanced placement or international baccalaureate tests be used to meet the new assessment requirements for pupils participating in those programs report cards states and leas participating in the revised esea title ia must report assessment results and certain other data to parents nd the public through report cards states are to publish report cards for the state overall and leas including charter schools that are treated under stat law as individual leas are to publish report cards for the lea and individual sc hools the report cards must generally include information on pup ils academic performance disaggregated by race ethnicity and gender as well as disability migrant english proficiency and economic disadvantage status the report cards must also include information on pupil progress toward meeting any other edu cational indicators included in the stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31487crs6 9 see state left behind the cha llenges and

the public at large there are specific provisions regarding dissemination of the state report cards preexisting report cards may be modified to meet these requirements one issue regarding these report card requirements is the extent to which they will lead to significant changes from previ ous practices while large majority of states have published report cards on sc hool system performance in recent years many have not provided such reports at ll of the required leve ls schools leas and states overall further most state report cards have not include d all of the types of information required under the nclba9 other issues include whether the information provided will be of substantial help to parents especially in the context of potentially increased options to select the schools that their children attend see below adequate yearly progress requirements under the nclba the title ia requirements for statedeveloped standards of ayp are substantially expande d in scope and specificity10 these standards serve as the basis for identifying schools and leas where performance is inadequate so that these inadequacies may be addressed firs t through provision of increased support and ultimately variety of corrective actions the nclba provisions regarding ayp we re adopted largely in reaction to perceived weaknesses with the ayp requirements of th 1994 iasa the latter were frequently criticized as being vague lacking required focus on specific disadvantaged pupil groups failing to re quire continuous improvement toward an ultimate goal and being app licable only to schools and as participating in title ia not to states overall or to all public schools before the enactment of the nclba there was tremendous variation among the states in the impact of their ayp standards ie the number and percentage of title i schools and leas identified as failing to meet ayp standards in some states very large percentage of title ia schools have been identified as needing imp rovement while sm all number of states had identified very few or even such sc hools for at least some years preceding the enactment of the nclba11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31487crs7 12 in addition program regulations federal register dec 2 2002 do not require graduation rates and other additional academic i ndicators to be disaggregated in determining whether schools or leas meet ayp standards 13 for discussion of the mode ls of ayp see crs report rl33032 adequate yearly progress ayp growth models under the child left behind act by wayne c riddleas under the iasa ayp is defined prima rily on the basis of aggregate scores for various groups of pupils on state assessments of academic achievement however under the nclba state ayp standards must also include at least one additional academic indicator which in the case of high schools must be the graduation rate ayp standards will now have to be applied separately and specifically to economically disadvantaged pupils lep pupils pupils with disabilities and pupils in major racial nd ethnic groups as well as all pupils the only exception is that pupil groups need not be considered in cases where their number is so relatively small that achievement results would not be statistically significant or the identity of individual pupils might be divulged12 state ayp standards must also be applied to all public schools leas and states overall although corrective actions for failing to m eet ayp standards need only be applied to schools and leas partic ipating in title ia the ayp state standards w ill also have to incorporate goal of all pupils reaching proficient or advanced level of achievement within 12 years the primary basic structure for ayp under the nclba is specified in the authorizing statute as group status model13 uniform bar approach is employed states are to set threshold per centage of pupils at pr oficient or advanced levels of performance each year that is app licable to all pupil subgroups of sufficient size to be considered in ayp determina tions the threshold levels of achievement are to be set separately for reading and ma th and may be set separately for each level of k12 education elementar middle and high schools in addition the nclba statute includes an alternative safe harbor provision under which school that does not meet the standard ayp requirements may still be deemed to meet ayp if it experiences 10 reduction in the gap be tween 100 and the percentage in the preceding year for the specific pupil groups th at fail to meet the uniform bar and those pupil groups also make progress on at least one othe r academic indicator included in the states ayp standards this alternative provision adds successive group improvement as secondary ty pe of ayp model under the nclba third basic type of ayp model not explicitly mentioned in the nclba statute is the individualcohort growth model the key characteristic of this model is focus on the rate of change over time in the level of achie vement among cohorts of the same pupils growth models are longitudinal based upon the tracking of the same pupils as they progress through th eir k12 education careers while the progress of pupils is tracked individually re sults are typically aggregated when used for accountability purposes in general grow th models would give credit for meeting steps along the way to proficiency in ways that status model typically does not in november 2005 the secretary of education announced growth model pilot program under which up to 10 states would be allowed to use growth

considered for ayp determinations for the school or lea must participate in the assessments that serve as the primary basi s for ayp determinations15 data on schools identified as failing to meet ayp beginning in the summer of 2003 subs tantial amount of data has become available on the number of schools and leas that failed to meet the ayp standards of the nclba for the 20022003 20032004 nd 20042005 school years basic problem with almost all such reported data thus far is that they have generally been incomplete ie not all states are included and subject to change ie the data for several states have been revised one or more times af ter being initially published due largely to data corrections and appeals16 the currently available data reports are discussed below in two categories repor ts focusing on the number and percentage of schools failing to meet ayp standards for one or more years versus reports on the number and percentage of pub lic identified for school impr ovement

20022003 through 20042005 school years were publishe d in december 2004 and 2005 by education week 17 while national aggregate comparisons are not possible due to the number of states for which data were missing for one or more years th data continue to reflect pattern of wide va riation among states in the percentage of public schools failing to meet ayp standards among states providing results the percentage of public schools failing to meet ayp standa rds based on assessment results in the 20042005 school year ranged from 2 wisc onsin to 66 hawaii for 48 states and the district of columbia

states where comparison was possible the percentage of public schools failing to make ayp increased in only 5 states remained the same in one state and declined in 30 states more recently in february 2006 data on the number of schools failing to meet ayp standards based on assessment re sults for the 20042005 school year were published in education daily 18 based on data collected from all states except arkansas it was reported that 22868 sc hools constituting 256 of all public schools failed to meet ayp standards for 20042005 other reported results were similar to those described in the preceding paragraph schools failing to meet ayp standards for two or more consecutive years the most recent and complete publis hed data on schools identified for improvement appears in the february 2006 education daily article disc ussed above according to this survey 11524 schools or 129 of all public schools were identified as needing improvement ba sed on assessment results for the 20042005 and preceding school years in several st ates this group included at least some non title i schools with respect to the vari ous stages of school improvement total of 3757 schools had failed to meet ayp standa rds for two consecutive years 3696 for three consecutive years 1254 for four cons ecutive years and 1847 for five or more consecutive years ed in its national assessm ent of title i interim report published in march 2006 reported that 13 of ll public schools were identif ied for improvement based on assessment results through the 20042005 school year this included 9028 title ia schools or 18 of all title ia schools schools mo st likely to be identified were those large urban leas schools w ith high pupil poverty rates and middle schools earlier in december 2005 survey of the number of schools identified for improvement ie d failed to meet ayp standard s for two or more consecutive years on the basis of assessment resu lts for 20042005 and preceding school years was published in education week 19 the survey included all states except one nebraska and found that on average 14 of public schools had been identified as needing improvement again the proportion va ried widely among the states ranging from 1 in kansas and utah to 48 in hawaii httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31487crs10 20 see thomas j kane and douglas staiger racial subgroup rules in school accountability systems preliminary draft sept 2002 av ailable at http wwwspps rucla edufacultykanekanestaige rracialsubgroupsrevisionpdffor the present it seems likely that state variations in the percentage of schools identified as failing to meet ayp standards or as needing improvement are based at least in part not only on underlying differe nces in achievement levels but also on differences in the degree of rigor or challenge in state pupil performance standards and on statedetermined standards for the minimum size of pupil demographic groups in order for them to be considered in ayp determinations of schools or leas in general larger minimum sizes for pupil demographic groups reduce the likelihood that many disadvantaged groups such as lep pupils or pupils w ith disabilities will be considered in determining whether school or lea meets ayp also in many cases it appears that schools or leas faile d to meet ayp solely because of low participation rates in assessments ie fewer than 95 of all pupils as well as pupils in each relevant demogr aphic group took the assessments as result of such estimates and reports as well as state reports indicating that approximately 8600 schools ve failed to meet ayp even under the prenclba standards some have expre ssed concern that large per centages of all public schools are being identified as failing and subjected to variety of corrective actions described below with cons equent strain on fi nancial and other resources necessary to provide technical assistance public school choice and supplemental services options and other corrective actions in addition some have ex pressed concern that random variation in test scor from year to year unrelated to actual gains or losses in achievement levels might substantially increase the number of schools identified as failing to meet ayp standards or that schools might be more likely to fail to meet ayp simply because they have diverse enrollments and therefore more groups of pupils to be separately considered in determining whether the school meets ayp standards20 in response to these concerns ed offi cials have emphasized the importance of taking action to identify and move to improve underperfor ming schools matter how numerous they have also emphasized the possibilities for flexibility and variation in taking corrective actions see below with respect to schools that fail to meet ayp depending on the extent to wh ich they fail to meet those standards ed policy developments regard ing participation rates plus treatment of limited english proficie nt pupils and ce rtain

reduce the number of schools and leas identified as failing to make ayp on march 29 2004 ed announced that schools could meet the requirement that 95 or more of pupils all pupils as well as pupils in each desi gnated demographic group participate in assessments in order for the school or lea to make ayp on the basis of average participation rates for the last two or three years rather than having to post 95httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31487crs11 21 see 69 federal register 3546235465 june 24 2004 nd http wwwedgov policygenguidsecletter040220html 22 bill introduced in the 108th congress hr 3049 would have authorized the exclusion of scores of lep pupils who have resi ded in the united states for less than three years and would have allowed formerly lep pupils to be included in that group for ayp calculation purposes indefinitelyor higher participation rate each year in other words if particular demographic group of pupils in public school has 93 st participation rate in the most recent year but had 97 rate the preceding year the 95 participation rate requirement would be met in addition the new gu idance would allow schools to exclude pupils who fail to participate in assessments due to significant medical emergency from the participation rate calculations the new guidance further emphasizes the authority for states to allow pupils who miss primary assessment date to take make up tests and to determine the minimum size for demographic groups of pupils to be considered in making ayp terminations including those related to participation rates according to ed in some states as many as 20 of the schools failing to make ayp did so on the basis of assessmen t participation rates alone it is not known how many of these schools would m eet the new somewhat more relaxed standard in letter dated february 19 and pr oposed regulations published on june 24 2004 ed officials announced two ne w policies with respect to lep pupils 21 first with respect to assessments lep pupils who have attended sc hools in the united states other than puerto rico for less than 10 months must participate in english language proficiency and mathematics test s however the participation of such pupils in reading tests in english as well as the inclusion of any of these pupils test scores in ayp calculations is to be optional ie schools and leas need not consider the scores of first year lep pup ils in determining whether schools or leas meet ayp standards such pupils are still considered in determining whether the 95 test participa tion has been met second in ayp determina tions schools and leas may continue to include pupils in the lep demographic category for up to two years after they have attained proficiency in english however these formerly lep pupils need not be included when determining whether school or lea s count of lep pupils meets the states minimum size threshold for inclusion of the group in ayp calculations and scores of formerly lep pupils may not be include d in state lea or school report cards both these options if exercised should increase average test scores for pupils categorized as being part of the lep gr oup and reduce the extent to which schools or leas fail to meet ayp on the basis of lep pupil groups22 regulations addressing the application of the title ia standards and assessment requirements to certain pupils with disabilities were published in the federal register on december 9 2003 pp 6869868708 the purpose of these regulations is to clarify the application of standa rd assessment and acc ountability provisions to pupils with the most significant cognitive disabilities under the regulations states and leas may adopt lternate assessments based on alternate achievement standards aligned with the states academic content standards and reflectinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31487crs12 23 this limitation does not apply to the administration of alternate assessments based on the same standards applicable to all students for other pupils with noncognitive or less severe cognitive disabilities 24 see httpwwwedgovnewspressreleases20050505102005html 25 this would be calculated based on statewide demographic data with the resulting percentage applied to each affected school and lea in the state in making the ayp determination using the adjusted data further use may be made of confidence intervals or other statistical techniques the actual not just the adjusted percentage of pupils who are proficient must also be reported to parents and the publicprofessional judgment of the highest achievement standards possible for limited percentage of pup ils with disabilities23 the number of pupils whose proficient or higher scores on these alternate assessments may be considered as proficient or above for ayp purposes is limited to max imum of 10 of all tested pupils approximately 9 of all pupils with disabilities at the state and lea level there is limit for individual schools as may request from the us secretary of education an exception allowing them to exceed the 10 cap statewide and seas may grant such exceptions to leas within their state according to ed staff three states in 20032004 montana ohio and virginia and four states in 20042005 the preceding three states plus south dakota received waivers to go marginally above the 10 limit statewide in the absence of waiver the number of pupils scoring at the prof icient level or higher on lternate assessments based on alternate achievement standard s in excess of the 10 limit is to be added to those scoring below proficient in lea or state leve l ayp determinations new ed policy affecting an additiona l group of pupils with disabilities was announced initially in april 2005 with more details pr ovided on may 10 200524 the new policy is divided into shortterm affecting ayp determinations for the 20052006 school year based on the results of assessments administered during the 20042005 school year and longt erm affecting subsequent years phases it is focused on pupils with persistent acade mic disabilities whose ability to perform academically is assumed to be greater than that of the pupils with the most significant cognitive disabilities discusse d in the above paragraph but below that of other pupils with disabilities in eds terminology these pup ils would be assessed using assessments based on modified achievement standards under the shortterm policy in eligible states that ve not yet adopted modified achievement standards sc hools may add to their prof icient pupil group number of pupils with disabilities equal to 20 of all pupils ssessed in effect deeming the scores of all of these pupils to be at the proficient level25 this policy would be applicable only to schools and leas th at would otherwise fail to meet ayp standards due solely to their pupils with disabilities group according to ed staff as of the date of this report 31 states have been authorized to exercise this shortterm flexibility alternatively in eligible stat that have adopted modified achievement standards schools and leas may count proficient scores for pupils with disabilities on these assessments subject to 20 f all assessed pupils cap at the lea and state levelshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31487crs13 26 the 30 limit might be exceeded for leas but only if and to the extent that the sea waives the 10 cap applicable to scores on alternate assessments based on alternate achievement standardsboth the short term and longer term flexibility policies will apply only to states meeting number of eligibility criteria for example in order to be eligible for the shortterm flexibility states must set minimum group size n for pupils with disabilities in ayp determinations equal to that for other pupil gr oups p rovide information on actions taken to raise achievement for students with disabilities or narrow the achievement gap and evidence that such efforts are improving student achievement and submit variety of assurances regarding the adoption and implementation of alternate assessments and modified and alternate achievement standards on december 15 2005 ed published proposed regulations embodying the longerterm policy for this group of pup ils with disabilities these proposed regulations would affect st andards assessments and ayp for group of pupils with disabilities who are unlikely to achieve gradelevel proficiency within the current school year but who are not among those pup ils with the most significant cognitive disabilities whose situation was addressed by an earlier set of regulations discussed above for this second group of pupils with disabilities states would be authorized to develop modified achievement standa rds and alternate assessments linked to these the modified achievement standards must be aligned with gradelevel content standards but may reflect reduced bread th or depth of gr adelevel content in comparison to the achievement standards applicable to the majority of pupils the standards must provide access to gradele vel curricula and not preclude affected pupils from earning regular high school diploma as with the previous regulations regarding pupils with the most significant cognitive disabilities there would be direct limit on the number of pupils who take alternate assessments based on modified achievement standards however in ayp determinations pupil scor of proficient or adva nced on alternate assessments based on modified achievement standards may be counted only as long as they do not exceed number equal to 20 of all pupils sted at the state or lea level ie an estimated 20 of pupils with disabilities such scores in excess of the limit would be considered to be nonpr oficient as with the 10 cap for pupils with the most significant cognitive disabilities this 20 cap does not apply to individual schools in general leas or states could exceed the 20 cap only if they did not reach the 10 limit with respect to pupils with the most si gnificant cognitive disabilities thus in general scores of proficient or above on lternate assessments based on alternate and modified achievement standards ma not exceed total of 30 of all pupils tested at state or lea level26 in particular states would longer be allowed to request waiver of the 10 cap regarding pupils with the most significant cognitive disabilities the december 15 proposed regulations also include provisions that are widely applicable to ayp determinations first states would longer be allowed to use varying minimum group sizes n for differe nt demographic groups of pupils this would prohibit the frequent practice of setting higher n sizes for pupils withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31487crs14 27 in such cases the former pupils with disabilities would not have to be counted in determining whether the minimum group size was met for the disability subgroup 28 see httpwwwedgovpolicyelsecguidsecletter050929htmldisabilities or lep pupils than for other pup il groups second when pupils take state assessments multiple times it would longer be required that only the first test administration be used in ayp determinati ons states and leas could use the highest score for pupils who take tests more than once finally as with lep pupils states and leas could include the test scores of former pupils with disabilities in the disability subgroup for up to two years after such pupils have exited special education27 thus eligible states and leas will be llowed to count as proficient or above in ayp determinations the pr oficient or higher scores of up to 10 of all tested pupils on alternate assessments based on lternate achievement standards and of up to an additional 20 of all tested pupils on assessments based on modified achievement standards for both groups there is limit for individual schools on the percentage of pupils in either of these categories and there is limit on the number or percentage of pupils to whom ither type of alternate assessment may be administered finally following the damage to school systems and dispersion of pupils in the wake of hurricanes katrina and rita in august and september 2005 interest in the possibility of waiving some of the nclbas assessment ayp or other accountability requirements has been expre ssed by officials of states and leas damaged by the storms several of which ve enrolled pupils displaced by them in policy letters to chief state school officer s cssos the secretary of education has emphasized forms of flexibility already available under current law and announced number of policy revisions and potential waivers that might be granted in the future in september 29 2005 letter to all cssos28 the secretary of education noted that they could exercise existing natural disaster provisions of the nclba section 1116b7d and c10f to pos tpone implementing school or lea improvement designations nd corrective actions for schools or leas failing to meet ayp standards that are located in the major disaster areas in louisiana alabama mississippi texas or florida without sp ecific waiver being required in addition waivers of these requirements will be considered for other heavily impacted leas or schools via the enrollment of large num bers of evacuee pupils further all affected leas and schools could establish separate subgroup for displaced students in ayp determinations based on assessments admin istered during the 20052006 school year pupils would appear only in the evacuee subgroup not in other demographic subgroups eg economically disadvantaged or lep waivers could be requested in 2006 to allow schools or as to meet ayp requirements if only the test scores of the evacuee subgroup would prevent them from making ayp in anyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31487crs15 29 for further information on this topic see crs report rl33236 educationrelated hurricane relief legislative action by rebecca skinner et 30 center on education policy from the capital to the classroom year 4 of the child left behind act mar 2006 pp 56 62 31 while there were ayp requirements for lea s under the iasa the application of these requirements by states was apparently quite uneven and the provisions for consequences for leas that failed to meet ayp standards for multiple years were minimal 32 see states plans likely to test esea pliancy

data on leas failing to meet ayp as mentioned above states receiving esea title ia grants are required to establish and implement ayp standards not only for all public schools in the state but also for leas overall and the state as whole while most attention in both the statute and implementation activities thus far has been focused on application of the ayp concept to schools limited amount of information is becoming available about leas that fail to meet ayp require ments and the consequences for them according to the education daily survey referred to above in the discussion of schools failing to meet ayp standards 3281 leas or 237 of all leas failed to meet ayp standards on the basis of assessment results for the 20042005 school year of these 1712 leas 124 of ll leas were iden tified for improvement as result of failing to meet ayp standards for two or more consecutive years more recently the year 4 report of the center on education policy cep on child left behind implementation30 found that an estimated 20 of all leas were identified failed to meet ayp standard s based on assessment results for the 2004 2005 and immediately preceding school years31 according to this report the odds of failing to meet ayp standards were much greater for urban 50 leas than for rural 11 or suburban 26 leas selected ayp implementation issues aside from issues of timing only limited an alyses have thus far been conducted of the extent to which state accountability pl ans are fully consiste nt with the detailed requirements of the statute nd regulations some analys ts have concluded that ed is allowing at least marginally increased flexibility in comparison to the statute and regulations in approving state accountability plans thus far although the approved plans appear to closely mirror the detailed provisions of the authorizing statute and regulations in most respects32 aspects of state ayp plans receiving special attention include 1 the pace at which proficiency levels are expected to improve eg equal increments of improvement over the entir period or much more rapid improvementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31487crs16 33 reportedly ed has approved state ac countability plans under which schools or leas would be identified as failing to meet ayp only if they failed to meet the required level of performance in the same subject for two or more consecutive years but has not approved proposals under which school would be identifie d only if it failed to meet ayp in the same subject and pupil group for two or more consecutive years 34 see for example states revise the meaning of proficient education week oct 9 2002 35 see httpwwwedgovpolicyelsecguidsecletter021022htmlexp0expected in later years than at the beginni ng 2 whether schools or leas must fail to meet ayp with respect to the same pupil groups grade levels andor subject areas to be identified as needing improvement or whether two consecutive years of failure to meet ayp with respect to any of these categories should lead to identification33 3 the length of time over which pupils should be identified as being lep 4 the minimum size of pupil groups in school in order for the group to be considered in ayp determinations or for reporting of scores 5 whether to allow schools credit for raising pupil scores from below basic to basic as well as from basic or below to proficie nt or above in making ayp determinations and 6 whether to allow use of statistical techniques such as confidence intervals ie whether scores are below the required level to statistically significant extent in ayp determinations another evolving issue is whether some states might choose to lower their standards of proficient performance in order to reduce the number of schools identified as failing to meet ayp and make it easier to meet the ultimate nclba goal of all pupils at the proficient level within 12 years reportedly few states have redesignated lower st andards eg basic or partially proficient as constituting proficient level of performance for title ia purposes or established new proficient levels of performance th at are below levels previously understood to constitute that level of performance and other states are considering such actions34 in the affected states this would increase the percentage of pupils deemed to be achieving at proficient leve l and reduce the number of schools failing to meet ayp standards while states are generally free to take such actions without jeopardizing their eligibility for title ia grants since performance standards are ultimately state determined and have always varied widely such actions have elicited public criticism from ed in policy letter dated octobe r 22 2002 the secretary of education stated that unfortunately some states have lowered the bar of expectations to hide the low performance of their schools and fe w others are discussing how they can ratchet down their standards in order to remove schools from their lists of low performers sadly small number of persons have suggested reducing standards for defining proficiency in order to ar tificially present the facts those who play semantic games or try to tinker with state numbers to lock out parents and the public stand in the way of progress and reform they are the enemies of equal justice and equal opportunity they are apologists for failure35httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31487crs17 36 an analogous separate series of provisions applies to schools operated by the bureau of indian affairs bia 37 over 90 of all leas receive title ia

for two or more consecutive years as needing improvement and to take variety of corrective actions with respect to schools or leas that fail to meet ayp standards for four or more consecutive years36 while states are encouraged to establish unita ry accountability systems affecting all public schools the title ia statute requires them only to take corrective actions regarding schools and leas that receive title ia funds not all schools and leas thus the corrective actions described below need be taken with respect to large majority of leas37 and approximately 58 of all public schools school

pupils attending schools that have failed to meet ayp standards for two consecutive years or more must be pr ovided with options to attend other public schools that meet ayp standards39 public school choice must be offered to such pupils by the next school year unless prohi bited by state law leas are generally required only to offer public school choice options within the same lea however if all

consecutive years if on th other hand it fails to meet ayp standards for additional years after being identified for improvement it faces variety of additional sanctions as is described above if

restructuring must consist of one or more of the following alternative governance actions reopening as charter school replacing all or most school staff state takeover of school operations if

more schools reached the final stage of school improvement year five in 2004200545 in general the authors of the ecs study concluded that 1 seas vary widely in their involvement in the restructuring process 2 in most cases the restructuring options app lied to affected schools have been relatively mild to moderate eg changing curriculum implementing school reform strategy or altering the schools management stru cture rather than strong eg reconstituting or closing the school or converting it to charter school and 3 political difficulties have arisen in cases where stronger forms of restructuring have been applied in veral states some restructuring options could not be implemented because they are not authoriz ed under state law eg charter

improvement or corrective actions were to be identified for and subjected to schoollea improvement and corrective actions under the nclba during the 20022003 school year however according to ed the statutory provisions ar ambiguous regarding the particular group of schools or leas that failed to meet ayp requirements for second consecutive year specifically on the basis of assessment results for the 20012002 school year while some continuedlea improvement and corrective actions procedures analogous to those for schools are to apply to leas that receive title ia grants and fail to meet ayp require ments as with schools while states are encouraged to implement unitary accountability systems applicable to all pupils and schools states may base decisions regard ing lea status and corrective actions only on the title ia schools in each lea and in the case of targeted assistance schools only on the individual pupils served by title ia further as noted earlier identification as needing improvement and corrective actions need be taken only with respect to leas that receive title ia grants leas that fail to meet state ayp standards for two consecutive years or more are to be identified as needing improvement technical assistance based on scientifically based resear ch section 1116c9b is to be provided to the lea by the state educational agency sea and parents of pupils

identified46 thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31487crs21 46 continued observers disagree with this interpretati on program regulations 34 cfr 20032e gave seas and leas the option whether or not to identify such schools or leas for improvement effective in 20022003 although they must be so identified if they fail to meet ayp on the basis of assessment results for 20012 002 and 20022003 the regulations

assessment results for 20012002 47 see httpwwwedweekorgmedia27adminpdfactions taken with respect to such schools or leas is to be based on the number of consecutive years during which they have failed to meet ayp standards as outlined above numerous schools and much smaller number of leas have failed to meet state ayp standards based primarily on transitional assessments and prenclba ayp provisions consistently since initial implementation of the 1994 iasa in the 19951996 school year in most cases thes schools faced substantial corrective actions previously in part because th corrective action provisions of the 1994 version of the esea were much less specific than those of the nclba and in particular because the iasa provided that most forms of corrective action were not to be implemented before states adopted final standards and ssessments meeting all of the requirements of the 1994 iasa wh ich state had done before the 20002001 school year the only exceptions to this pattern were provisions in fy2000 and fy2001 appropriations acts that required public school choice options to be provided to pupils attending certain title ia schools that failed to meet ayp standards but those provisions were more narrow in sc ope and application than those of the nclba as was discussed earlier in this report schools and leas have in past years been identified on the basis of wide ly varying transiti onal ayp standards developed by the states raising number of issues any school or lea that has been identified for improvement or corrective action may be removed from this status if it meets state ayp standards for two consecutive years data on the use of the school choice and supplemental services in most states during the 20032004 school year were recently published by education week 47 these data were reported by the states to ed and obtained by education week through freedom of information act reque st data are provided for 45 states plus the district of columbia with respect to public school choice and 46 states plus the district of columbia with respect to suppl emental services th ey indicate low rate of utilization of the supplemental services option by eligible pupils and very low rate of utilization of the school choice option by the much larger group of pupils eligible for that nationwide the data i ndicate that 113 of eligible pupils received supplemental services in 20032004 with indi vidual state rates ranging from zero for seven states although four of these states reported that they had eligible pupils in that year to high of 491 for utah only 10 of eligible pupils were reported as taking advantage of school choice op tions under the nclba with this rate ranging from zero in seven states three of which reported that they had pupils eligible to transfer that year to ma ximum of 944 for alabama it is unclear whether such low participation rates in most states if continuing into the presenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31487crs22 result from delayed implementation of thes provisions by states and leas low levels of parental interest inadequate dissemination of information about the options to parents limited availability of alternative public school s or tutorial services or other factors issues number of issues have been raised with respect to these corrective action provisions of the nclba including the following might relatively large percentages of public schools participating in title ia be identified for corrective actions with the result that the ability of states and leas to provide substantial technical assistance school choice and supplemental services options and other resources necessary for effective co rrective actions for all of these schools would be seriously limited is the goal of having all pupils at the proficient or advanced level of achievement by 20132014 realistic might it result in increasing percentages of schools and leas fa iling to meet ayp in future years or might it have the opposite effect of encouraging states to weaken their performance standards might this goal lead states to lower their standards for what constitutes proficient or advanced levels of achievement or to develop strategies to limit identification of schools or leas for improvement through extensive use of high minimum group sizes narrow confidence intervals and the like or might such highly ambitious goal provide the stimulus for major improvements in the quality and equity of public education services will meaningful range of public school choice options be available to pupils in leas that are sma ll andor sparsely populated or in highly disadvantaged leas where large percentage of public schools may fail to meet state ayp standards due to these and other limiting factors might relatively few eligible families actually exercise the school choi ce and supplemental services options offered under the nclba what sorts of entities organizations firms or institutions will beavailable to provide supplemental rvices to eligible pupils will they be willing to provide these services for the level of funding made available under the nclba pr ovisions how likely is it that supplemental services provided by third parties will be more effective than conventiona l public school instruction will states and leas implement the nclba provisions for corrective actions and restructurin g for schools and leas in timely and effective manner what might be the incentive effect of the very limited sanctions andlack of performance bonuses fo r states overall as opposed to individual schools or leashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31487crs23 48 this discussion of formulas is based on th eir current provisions incorporating where relevant amendments under the nclba which are discussed in greater detail in the succeeding section of this report 49 these data are from the census bureaus small area income and population estimates saipe which provides estimates of poor nd total children aged 517 for leas counties and states these intercensal estimates are updated every year as of this writing the latest saipe data are for income year 2003 these estimates were published in nov 2005 and will presumably be used for fy2006 title ia allocations 50 for all except the efig formula the mini mum is 80 and the maximum is 120 of the national average for the efig formula the minimum and maximum are 85 and 115 continuedallocation formula provisions esea title ia has four parate formulas basic concentration targeted and education finance incentive grants fig for the allocation of funds to states and leas however once these f unds reach leas they are longer treated separately they are combined and us ed for the same program purposes the primary rationale for using four different formulas to allo cate share of the funds for single program is that the formulas ve distinct allocati on patterns providing varying shares of allocated funds to diffe rent types of localitie s in addition some of the formulas contain elements that are deemed to have important incentive effects or to be significant symbolically such as the equity and effort factors in the efig formula in addition to their impact on allocation patterns in the discussion below we begin with general discussion of the characteristics of the title ia allocation formulas in order to provide context for the subsequent review of the title ia formula amendments in the nclba general characteristics of the title ia allocation formulas there are several common elements of the four title ia allocation formulas as amended by the nclba48 each of them has population factor which is the same in each of the four formulas children aged 517 1 in poor families according to the latest available data that are satisfactory to the secretary of education and applyi ng the census bureaus standard poverty income thresholds appr oximately 955 of all formula children for fy200449 2 in certain institutions for neglected or delinquent children and youth or in certain foster homes 44 of all formula children and 3 in families receiving temporary assistance for needy families tanf payments above the poverty income level for family of four only about 01 of all formula children under each of these formulas this population factor is multiplied by an expenditure factor which is based on state average expenditures per pupil aepp subject to minimum and maximum levels50httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31487crs24 50 continued these amounts are further multiplied by fed eral share of 40 to determine maximum authorized grants subject to state minimu m lea holdharmless and other provisions 51 the holdharmless rate under each formula is now 8595 of the previous year grant depending on the leas schoolage child poverty rate children counted for title ia grants as percentage of total schoolage population if the lea poverty rate is 30 or above the holdharmless rate is 95 if the poverty rate is 1530 the holdharmless rate is 90 and if the poverty rate is less than 15 the holdharmless rate is 85 note with partial exception for certain leas under the concentration grant formula holdharmless rates are applicable only to leas meeting th eligibility thresholds for each formula 52 more specifically the minimum is up to 025 for basic and concentration grants at funding levels up to the fy2001 appr opriation for those formulas and up to 035 for basic and concentration grants above the fy2001 level plus all funds allocated under the targeted and efig formulas in addition these state minimums are capped in all cases under the basic targeted and efig formulas state may not as result of the state minimum provision receive more than the average of 1 025 of the total fy2001 amount for state grants plus 035 of the am ount above this and 2 150 of the national average grant per formula child multiplied by the number of formula children in the state under the concentration grant formula state may not as result of the state minimum provision receive more than the average of 1 025 of the total fy2001 amount for state grants plus 035 of the amount above th is and 2 the greater of i 150 of the national average grant per formula child mu ltiplied by the number of formula children in the state or ii 340000 53 throughout this report this term refers to the number of poor and other children counted in the title ia allocation formulas expressed as percentage of the total schoolage population for the leafurther as is discussed below special expenditure factor provisions apply to puerto rico due to the expenditure factor leas in high spending states receive up to 50 more per child counted in the title ia formulas than leas in lowspending states the rationale for this factor is that it reflects differences in the cost of providing public education and provides an incentive to increase spending however it is spending not cost index it reflects ability and willingness to spend on public educa tion as well as cost differences it is crude affecting all leas in state equally and the incentive it provides to increase state and cal spending for public education is relatively small each of the formulas has holdharmless provision minimum annual grant level for leas that is calculated as percentage of the previous years grant under each formula51 the four title ia formulas include state minimum grant level as well in general state is to receive less than approximately 025 of allocated funds up to th fy2001 appropriation level and approximately 035 of f unds above that level52 finally each formula has minimum eligibility threshold for leas minimum number of poor and other formula children andor minimum schoolage child poverty rate53 in order to be eligible for grants even holdharmless amounts in most cases the lea minimum eligibility threshold varies by formula it is 10 formulahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31487crs25 54 in the cv calculations for this formula an extra weight 14 vs 10 is applied to estimated counts of children from poor families limited purpose leas such as those providing only vocational education are excl uded from the calculations as are small leas with enrollment below 200 pupils there are sp ecial provisions for states meeting the expenditure disparity standard established in regulations for the impact aid program esea title v iii as well as the singlelea areas of hawaii puerto rico and dcchildren and schoolage child poverty rate of 2 for basic grants 5 schoolage child poverty rate for the targeted and efig formulas and 6500 formula children or 15 schoolage child poverty rate for concentration grants in addition to these common elements two of the title ia formulas have unique features for the targeted grant formula as well as the intrastate allocation of funds under the efig formula the poor and other children counted in the formula are assi gned weights based on each leas schoolage child poverty rate and number of poor schoolage children as result an lea would receive higher grants per child counted in the formula the higher its poverty rate or number under the targeted grant formula the weighting factors are applied in the same manner nationwide poor and other formula children in leas with the highest poverty rates have weight of up to four and those in leas with the highest numbers of such children have weight of up to three compared to weight of one for formula in the lowest rate and number ranges in contrast under the efig formula the degree of targeting in terms of the ratio of the highest to the lowest weight varies depending on the value of each states equity factor three different weighting scal are used for states with equity factors within specified ranges under both formulas the higher of its two weighted child counts based on numbers and percentages is used in calculating grants for each lea the efig formula has two unique factors an equity factor and an effort factor in addition to the popula tion and expenditure factors the equity factor is based upon measure of the average disparity in expenditures per pupil among the leas of state called the coefficient of variation cv which is expressed as percentage of the state average expenditure per pupil54 in calculating grants the equity factor is subtracted from 130 as result the lower states expenditure disparities among its leas the lower is its cv and the higher is its multiplier the effort factor is based on comparison of state expenditures per pupil for public elementary and secondary education with state personal income per capita this ratio for each state is further compared to the national average ratio resulting in an index number that is greater than 10 for states where the ratio of expenditures per pupil for public elementary and sec ondary education to personalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31487crs26 55 in practice appropriations for fy2003fy2005 fo r basic grants have been slightly below the fy2001 level due to the application of small across the board funding reductions 56 for additional details see crs report rl31256 education finance incentive grants under esea title ia by david p smoleincome per capita is greater than average for the nation as whole and below 10 for states where the ratio is less than average for the nation as whole narrow bounds of 095 and 105 are placed on the resulting multiplier so that its effects on state grants is limited under the basic concentration and ta rgeted grant formulas maximum grants are calculated by multiplying the population f actor by the expenditure factor for all leas meeting the minimum eligibility thresholds the efig formula differs from the others both in terms of its use of unique formula factors and in being twostage formula first state total grants are calculated by multiplying the population factor by the expenditure factor by 13 minus the equity factor and by the effort factor then as is described below these state total grants are allocated to leas on the basis of weighted population factor unde r all four formulas maximum amounts are reduced proportionally to the aggregate leve l of available funds subject to lea hold harmless and state minimum grant provisions title ia allocation formula amendments under the nclba the following section of this report focuses specifically on the aspects of the title ia formulas that were revised by the nclba overall the nclba made number of relatively modest changes to the basic concentration and targeted grant formulas while substantially amending the efig formula in addition appropriations legislation for fy2002 and s ubsequent fiscal years has provided funds for each of the four formulas in previous years only the basic and concentration grant formulas were funded this was c onsistent with the nclba provision that in the allocation of title ia funds an amount equal to th fy2001 appropriation is to be allocated under the basic and concen tration grant formulas and any increases above the fy2001 level are to be allocated under the targeted grant or the efig formula55 efig formula amendments major changes were made to the efig formula by the nclba56 first while it retained its twostage structure one mechanism is used to allocate funds to st ates while second is used to suballocate state total grants to leas the revised efig formula has its own distinct substate allocation formula previously state total efig grants would have simply been allocated to leas in proportion to tota l grants under the other three basic concentration and targeted grant formul as under the nclba efig grants are to be allocated within states under varia tion of the targeted grant formula but with the degree of targeting the ratio of the weight applied to formula children in the highest poverty ranges compared to the weig ht for such children in the lowest poverty ranges varying in three stages the stage or degree of targeting used for substate allocation varies depending on each states equity factor the higher the equity factor and therefore the greater the di sparities in expenditures per pupil among ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31487crs27 57 few minor revisions were made to the pr ovisions for calculating state equity factors for example under the 1994 iasa for states w ith separate elementary or secondary as opposed to unified k12 leas special rule provided for separate calculation of the cv for each sector of leas with these figure s to be combined in proportion to relative enrollment in each sector to establish statewide cv under the nclba data from elementary secondary and unified leas are comb ined at all stages of calculating cvs and the equity factor in addition the 1994 vers ion contained authority for the secretary of education to revise the equity factor to adjust for regional variation in costs or the differing costs of meeting the needs of lep pupils or those with disabilities this authority was deleted from the nclbastates leas the greater will be the degr ee of targeting on highpoverty leas in the intrastate allocati on of efig funds second in the allocation of funds to st ates the population factor is changed from total schoolage children to the same count of poor and other children used to calculate basic concentration and target ed grants this change in the most fundamental formula factor results in pa ttern of allocations under this formula that is substantially more similar to those of the other three formulas than would have been the case in the past w hen the population factor was total schoolage children despite the other distinctive factors in the efig formula third variant of the state expenditure factor used in the other three part formulas is added to the efig formula previously this was the only title ia formula without an expenditure factor fo r the efig formula the floor and ceiling bounds on the expenditure factor are marg inally narrowed they are 85 and 115 of the national average rather than 80 and 120 as under the other three formulas finally the equity and effort factors used in the allocation of efig grants to states remain essentially unchanged from previous law57 as noted above each states equity factor will also determine which of three variations of the targeted grant formula will be used for intrastate allocation of efig funds the lowest degree of targeting which is the same as the nationwide targeting under the targeted grant formula will apply to states with an equity factor below 010 14 states plus the district of columbia and puerto rico for fy2003 middle range of intrastate targeting which is 50 greater than unde r the targeted grant formula in terms of the ratio of child weights for the high estpoverty leas compared to the lowest poverty leas will apply in the majority of states 35 with an equity factor equal to or above 010 and below 020 finally the greatest degree of targeting twice as great as under the targeted gr ant formula will apply in states with an equity factor of 020 or above one state formula revisions for puerto rico the relative share of funds allocated to puerto rico will increase over time as result of two nclba amendments to the title ia formulas first provision that has reduced the expenditure factor for puerto rico below the minimum applicable to the 50 states plus the district of columbia will be gradually eliminated previously for puerto rico only the minimum expenditure factor for each of the four allocation formulas was further multiplied by the ratio of the puerto rico average expenditure per pupil divided by the lowest average for any state for fy2001 the last prenclba year this ratiohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31487crs28 58 it has generally been eds policy to apply holdharmless rates only to leas or other grantees that meet basic program eligibility criteria 59 primary rationale for this special provis ion limited to concentration grants is that several leas were eligible for and received concentration grants in years preceding fy1999 when these were calculated initially on the basis of counties not leas these leas continued to receive grants for fy1999 through fy2001 due to special holdharmless provisions in annual appropriations legisla tion for fy2002 and future grants the nclba holdharmless provision applies to c oncentration grants for these leaswas approximately 750 as result the grant to puerto rico was approximately onethird less than the amount it would have received if it were treated fully in the same manner as the 50 states and the district of columbia the nclba places floor on this ratio wh ich was 775 fo r fy2002 800 for fy2003 825 for fy2004 etc in steps until it reaches 1000 ie the same minimum expenditure factor as for state for fy2007 and bey ond this increase is not supposed to take effect in any year if it would result in any state or the district of columbia receiving total title ia grants below the amount it received for the preceding year second cap on the aggregate weight applied to the population factor for puerto rico only under the targeted gr ant formula is marginally raised from 172 to 182 this provides that the share of targeted grants allocated to puerto rico will be approximately equal to its share of grants under the basic and concentration grant formulas for fy2001 while it provide s an increase for puerto rico compared to the previous targeted grant cap the remaining cap still reduces grants below the level that would obtain if there were cap at all ie if puerto rico were treated in the same manner as the 50 states and the district of columbia since puerto ricos high number and percentage of poor schoo lage children would translate into significantly higher weigh ting factor if not capped largely as result of these provisions the title ia grants to puerto rico have risen substantially in recent year s from 2744 million for fy2001 the last pre nclba year to 3333 million for fy2002 4022 million for fy2003 and 4492 million for fy2004 other nclba formula amendments the nclba applies hold harmless rate of 8595 of previous year gr ants the higher an leas child poverty rate the higher is the holdharmless percentage to each of the four allocation formulas previously this rate applied only to basic and targeted grants there was hold harmless in the authorizing stat ute for concentration or efig grants for concentration grants only th holdharmless provision applies to all leas that received grants in the preceding year not ju st those that currently meet the eligibility criteria for this formula58 except that if an lea fails to meet such criteria for four successive years then the hold harmless would longer apply59 state minimum grants are increased from up to 025 under current law to up to 035 but only with respect to funds above the fy2001 level see footnote 42 pl 107110 also provides for the use of population data on sc hoolage children in poor families that is updated nnually rather than every second year previously as is discussed later in this report the census bureau began to publish annual updateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31487crs29 60 these ranges are structured so that onefif th of the nations formula children are in leas in each quintile on both the number and poverty rate scales the previous ranges were based on 1990 census data while the nclba ranges are based on income year 1997 saipe estimates 61 in order to be eligible for title ia basi c grants leas must have at least 10 children counted in the formulas for grants to leas and schoolage child poverty rate of at least 2 for targeted and education finance ince ntive grants the lea eligibility criteria are 5 schoolage child poverty rate and 10 formula children for concentration grants leas must have 15 schoolage child poverty rate or 6500 formula children 62 according to program data for fy2001 approxi mately twothirds of the leas receiving title ia grants have total number of schoolage children of less than 100 63 except for analyses of fy2001 grants which were based on only the basic and concentration grant formulas under previous law all of the analyses in this report are based on fy2002fy2005 grants using the title ia allocation formulas as modified by the child left behind act pl 107110 64 for the lealevel analyses in this report poverty rates are based on total children counted in the title ia allocation formul as divided by total schoolage populationin november 2003 further the nclba re vised the thresholds for application of varying weights to poor and other formul children in different poverty rate and number ranges under the targeted and efig i ntrastate formulas to reflect the latest available population estimates as of the time the nclba was enacted60 targeting on highpoverty leas under the four title ia formulas for the last several years the primary issue regarding the title ia allocation formulas has been the extent to which funds are targeted on highpoverty leas over 90 of the nations leas receive grants under esea title ia largely because the eligibility thresholds for thr ee of the four allocation formulas are relatively low61 in general all leas receive title ia grants except those that have extraordinarily low schoolage poverty ra tes andor have extremely few pupils62 few leas including certain charter schools that are treated as separate leas under state law are eligible fo r relatively small title ia grants but do not choose to participate in the program at least in part because the administrative responsibilities accompanying participation are perceived to exceed the value of the prospective grants table 1 below presents the distribution of title ia grants63 among leas grouped by poverty rate quintile64 each quintile contains leas with onefifth of the nations schoolage children in poor families based on the census bureau population estimates used in calculating fy2006 grants those for income year 2003 table 1 lists the percentage share of the national total of title ia grants that are allocated to leas in each poverty quintile these data are provided separately for each of the four title ia allocation formul as as well as for total grants for fy2006 as illustrated in table 1 the share of title ia funds allocated to leas in various poverty rate ranges va ries significantly among th four allocation formulashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31487crs30 65 with the exception of puerto rico leas with the largest numbers of schoolage children in poor families tend to have high but not among the highest schoolage child poverty rates 66 leas with the highest schoolage child poverty rates are frequently cated in states with relatively low expenditure factorsfor basic grants the share is similar for each quintile of leas varying only within the narrow range of 191211 for concentration grants the share of funds allocated to leas in each poverty rate range is again similar with the ex ception of the lowestpoverty quintile which receives much lower share 59 of tota l grants vs 215245 for the other four quintiles this reflects the eligibility threshold for concentration grants formula child rate of at least 15 or 6500 or more formula children overall the primary pattern for both basic and concentration gran ts is relatively cons tant shares of funds for all leas meeting minimum eligibility thre sholds in other words grants per poor and other child counted in the title ia allocation formulas are approximately the same for all leas meeting the initial eligibility criteria for basic and concentration grants whether those leas have high av erage or somewhat below average school age child poverty rates the pattern of distribution of grants under the targeted and efig formulas is somewhat different under each of these fo rmulas the share of total grants increases steadily from the lowest to the secondhi ghest poverty rate quintile then declines somewhat between the 4th and 5th quintile while this partly reflects the slightly higher eligibility threshold for these formulas in comparison to basic grants 5 vs 2 formula child rate it primarily resu lts from the structure of these formulas under both the targeted and efig within state formulas the grant per formula child continuously increases as either the schoolage child poverty rate or the total number of children counted in the title i formulas increases the share of funds going to leas in the 4th quintile under each of these form ulas is slightly higher than the share going to leas with the highest poverty rates 5th quintile primarily because of the strong influence of high numbers of formula children on the allocation of funds65 as well as the influence of the expenditure factor66httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31487 crs31 table 1 share of esea title ia funds allocated to leas by lea poverty rate quintile fy2006 poverty rate quintile 12345 all leaspoverty rates of 0

transfer of an additional 4353368 in unobligated fy2003 funds fro m variety of ed programs to title ia these funds were allocated to the three states for which the initial fy2003 allocations under pl 1087 were less than their fy2002 allocation iowa maryland and michigan the amount transferred brings the fy2003 allocation for each of these states up to its fy2002 levelfy2002fy2007 funding for the title ia allocation formulas fy2002 appropriations legisl ation for ed pl 107116 provided total of 1035 billion for title ia this legi slation provided initial funding of 1018 billion for the targeted grant formula and 793 million for the efig formula both of which were first authorized in 1994 but not previously implemented or funded in contrast to appropriati ons acts of several preceding years pl 107116 had extraordinary holdharmless provisions ie none that go beyond the holdharmless provisions of the authorizing statute for fy2003 the bush administration requested total of 1135 billion for title ia grants to leas an increase of 10 billion 97 all of the increased funds would have been allocated as targ eted grants the amounts allocated under the other three formulas would have remain ed the same as for fy2002 final fy2003 appropriations legislation for ed pl 1087 provided total of 11684311000 for title ia the increase over fy2002 was split much more evenly between the targeted 1670239000 and efig 1541759000 formulas than requested by the administration most fy2003 appropria tions under pl 1087 were affected by an acrosstheboard reduction provision the am ounts discussed herein reflect these reductions67 for fy2004 the administration requested total of 1235 billion for title ia an increase of 6657 million 57 over fy2003 as in its request for fy2003 the administration proposed that all funds above the fy2002 level be allocated as targeted grants which would have resu lted in sharp reduction for efig grants from 1541759000 the fy2003 appropriation to 793499000 same as the fy2002 level different versions of standalone fy2004 lhhsed appropriations bills were passed by the house and the senate hr 2660 the total fy2004 amount for esea title ia under each version of hr 2660 would have been the same as under the administration request 1235 billion the primary difference between the bills was in the distribution of funds above the fy2002 level under the targeted versus the efig formula as under the administration request the house bill would have allocated all funds above fy2002 under the targeted grant formula reducing efig grants by almost onehalf in contrast the senate bill would have allocated the fy2003 amount under targeted grants and distributed all increases over fy2003 under the efig formula the house bill would have returned basic grants to the fy2002 level while the senate bill would have funded basic grants at the slightly reduced level of fy2003httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31487crs33 in addition the senate ve rsion of hr 2660 would in effect have prohibited ed from updating the population data to be used in allocating fy2004 grants requiring the department to use the best available data as of july 1 2003 to allocate fy2004 grants beginning with income year 2000 estimates released in november 2003 the census bureau has shifted from its previous schedule of updating the estimated number of schoolage children in poor families in leas every second year to new schedule of annual updates for the lea estimates thus the senate bills provision would have prevented the use of the latest at that time income year 2000 population estimates to allocate fy2004 funds the conference version of fy2004 appropriations legislation for ed hr 2673 the consolidated appropriations act 2004 pl 108199 provided total of 12342309000 for title ia after applica tion of small acrosstheboard reduction marginally less than the house and senate versions of hr 2660 the amount for basic grants was slightly below the fy2003 level while the concentration grants total was the same as for fy2003 under pl 108199 the remaining amounts for title ia were sp lit equally between targeted and efig grants the final legislation did not contain the senate bills provision regarding use of updated population data allowing transition to annua lly updated population estimates to occur beginning with fy2004 grants for fy2005 the administration proposed 1 billion 81 increase over the fy2004 level for esea title ia as in its budget requests for fy2003 and 2004 the administration proposed that all funds above the fy2002 level be allocated as targeted grants which would more than double the funds for this formula from 1969843000 to 4146187000 while funds for the efig formula would be cut by approximately 60 from 1969843000 to 793499000 on july 14 2004 the house committee on appropriations re ported hr 5006 bill to provide fy2005 appropriations for ed and other agenci under this bill as passed by the house on september 9 2004 the aggregate fy2005 appropriation for t itle ia would be the same as requested by the administration 13342309000 but in contrast to the administrations propos equal amounts would be allocated as targeted and efig grants 2469843000 under each formula the senate committee on ppropriations reported its fy2005 appropriations act for ed and other agencies s 2810 on september 15 2004 under s 2810 the total funding for title ia grants to leas would be 13557607000 215298000 above both the administration request and the house amount however approximately onethird of this difference 71557000 consists of funds that would be appropr iated as fy2005 basic grants but would be used during the 20042005 school year the year during which fy2004 appropriations would generally be used these funds would be allocated to the 10 states see following section that currently are receiving less for fy2004 than they received for fy2003 under title ia overall if this were to occur state would receive less for the 20042005 school year than it received for the previous year alt hough numerous leas would still receive reduced grants an additional 100 million of the diffe rence between the senate and houseadministration amounts consiste d of funds provided under the senate committee bill for additional school impr ovement funding ie beyond amountshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31487crs34 reserved by seas from lea grant appropriations for this purpose for fy2005 after deducting these two amounts the di fference in aggregate funding under the senate bill versus the house bill nd administration request for fy2005 was 43741000 03 the larger difference among these proposals is that the senate bill would have allocated more f unds under the efig 2756175000 than the targeted grant 2231954000 formula in contrast to the 5050 split under the house bill or the heavy emphasis on ta rgeted grants under the administration request finally the conference version of hr 4818 consolidated appropriations act 2005 was passed by the hous and senate on november 20 2004 it was signed into law as pl 108447 on december 8 2004 it provides total of 12739571000 for title ia for fy2005 this amount is lower than the amounts that would have been provided under the administration request the housepassed bill or the senate committ eereported bill it represents an increase of 397262000 32 over the fy2004 appropriation the nate bills provisi ons for additional fy2004 holdharmless funds and additional school impr ovement grants were not included in hr 4818 under p l 108447 equal amounts 2219843000 each were provided for targeted and efig gran ts concentration grants are maintained at the fy2004 level 1365031000 and ba sic grants were reduced from 7037592000 in fy 2004 to 6934854000 for fy2005 note that all of these amounts incorporate acrosstheboard spending cuts as applied by ed in table published on december 9 2004 these are s ubject to possible presumably minor future

as is the case with state pupil assessment policies the nclba establishes new requirements regarding teacher qualifications for states and leas participating in title ia that will affect public school systems overall the revised esea also contains expanded qualification requirements for teacher aides or paraprofessionals although these provisions are limited to certain paraprofessionals pa id with title ia funds an additional major provision of the nclba regarding instructional staff is the requirement that leas are to use between 5 and 10 of their title ia grants in fy2002fy2003 and at least 5 of their grants thereafter for professional development activities sepa rately as noted earlier i ndividual schools identified as having failed to meet ayp standards for two or more consecutive years must use at least 10 of their title ia grants for professional development teacher qualifications70 first the nclba requires leas participating in esea title ia to ensure that beginning with the 20022003 school year teachers newly hired with title ia funds are highly qualified sec ond participating states must establish plans providing that all public school teachers statewide in core academic subjects meet the bills definition of highly qualified by the 20052006 school year and that all leas will make annual progress toward meeting this deadline finally according to the authorizing statute leas participating in title ia must have plan to ensure that all of their teachers are highly qualified by the 20052006 deadline71 in an october 21 2005 letter to cssos72 the secretary of education stated that the 20052006 deadlines might be extended by one year to 20062007 for some states states will qualify for the extension if they provide evidence that they are making good faith effort toward meetin g the requirement as evidenced by such factors as whether the states definition of highly qualified teacher is consistent with the statute regulations and policy guidance whether the state is meeting requirements to report on teach er quality to parents and th public the quality of data on teacher quality reported by the state to ed and steps taken by the state to assure that highly qualified teachers are equitably distributed among classrooms in high poverty versus low poverty schools httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31487crs39 73 this and related concepts

found in title ix part general pr ovisions of the esea as amended by the nclba this definition of highly qualified teacher includes some elements that are applicable to all public school teachers and others that apply only to teachers who either are or are not new to the profession the criteria applicable to all public school teachers are that they must hold at least bachelors degree must have obtained full state certification or passed the state teacher licensing examination and must hold license to t each without any certification or licensure requirements having been waived for them an exception is made for teachers in public charter schools who must meet the requirements established in the states charter school law program regulations also provide that individuals participating in alternate certification programs meeting certain requirements would qualify as being highly qualified the additional criteria applicable to teachers who are new to the profession are that they must demonstrate by passing rigorous state test subject area knowledge and teaching skills in basic ementary curricula if teaching at the elementary level or b demonstrate high level of competency by passing rigorous state academic test or completing an academic major or equivalent course work graduate degree or advanced certification in each subject taught if teaching at the middle or high school level finally public school teacher at any ementary or secondary level who is not new to the profession may be deemed to be highly qualified by either meeting the preceding criteria for teacher who is new to the profession or by demonstrating competence in all subjects taught based on high objective uniform state standard of evaluation which among other consid erations is not ba sed primarily on the amount of time spent teaching each subject73 qualification requireme nts for paraprofessionals paraprofessionals also known as teacher aides constitute approximately one half of the staff hired with title ia grants and their salaries constitute an estimated 15 of title ia funds use of title ia funds for paraprofessi onals appears to be especially prevalent in many highpove rty leas and schools professionals whose salaries are paid with title ia f unds provide variety of instructional and noninstructional services in both schoolwi and targeted assistance programs some have criticized the performance of instructional duties by paraprofessionals who often lack educational credentials and may receive little supervision from classroom teachers others have questi oned the appropriateness of using title ia funds to pay paraprofessiona ls who perform duties that are not directly related to instruction the iasa in 1994 required t eacher paraprofessiona ls funded under

determine competence for those not meeting the educational requirements however th paraprofessionals surveyed by aft are concentrated in selected large urban leas and may not be representative of title ia paraprofessionals in general77 in addition education week published state data on paraprofessional qualifications during the 20032004 school year78 these data covering 42 states and the district of columbia were reported to ed and obtained by education week through freedom of information reque st among these 43 jurisdictions the percentage of paraprofessionals in title i programs

than those used in the selection of participating schools and allocation of funds among them which may further expand the pool of eligible schoolsissues one issue regarding these nclba staff qualification requirements is whether highpoverty leas and schools will be ab to meet the teacher qualification requirements schools and leas disadvantaged by hi gh pupilpoverty rates have generally had particular difficulty attracting highly qualified staff79 second major issue is whether the re quirements for professionals are being interpreted and implemented in such manner as to have substantial impact the nclba provisions regarding paraprof essional qualifications are ambiguous their significance will depend very much on the extent and manner in which these provisions are interpreted and implemented by states and as it is thus far unclear what standards of quality or assessments states and leas will deem to be sufficient to meet these new requirements possibl effects include substantial expansion of state or lea procedures to certify the qua lifications of paraprofessionals or significant reduction in the extent to whic h title ia funds are used to hire aides other provisions regarding title ia other aspects of esea title ia that were significantly modified by the nclba are discussed briefly below flexibility one of the most distinctive changes in title ia since 1994 has been the rapid growth of schoolwide programs which cu rrently account for approximately 45 of all title ia schools and 60 of title ia funds spent at the school level the iasa reduced the eligibility threshold for sc hoolwide programs from 75 to 50 low income pupils in general and the nclba has further reduced this threshold to 4080 the statute allows the use of funds under most federal aid programs not just title ia on schoolwide ba sis if basic program objec tives and fiscal accountability requirements are met the rationale for providing schoolwide program authority to relatively high poverty schools is that in such schools all pupils are disadvantaged so mosthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31487crs43 81 at the level of individual schools the mo st commonly used criterion for determining whether pupils are from lowincome families is eligibility for free andor reducedprice school lunches not the more narrow census pover ty income standard the national average percentage of public k12 pupils meeting this criterion is approximately 40 in school just meeting this threshold 100 of the pupils may be served under title ia although the school would receive funds ba sed on only 40 of its enrollment in addition the freereduced price school lunch data may over estimate the percentage of pupils from low income families as there is evidence that more children and youth are counted than may be eligible based on family income see officials seek to refine lunch program tallies education week mar 27 2002 82 for additional information on this and ot her flexibility authorities adopted under the child left behind act see crs report rl31583 k12 education special forms of continuedpupils are in need of special assistance and it seems less equitable to select only the lowestachieving pupils to receive title i services and b the level of title ia grants should be sufficient to meaningfully affect overall school services in high poverty schools since these funds are allo cated on the basis of the number of low income pupils in these schools howeve r the nclba has reduced the eligibility threshold to level that is approximately the national average percentage of pupils from lowincome families and the validity of both aspects of this rationale might be questioned for schools that ju st meet the new threshold81 in addition there is little direct evidence of the achieve ment effects of this expans ion of schoolwide programs in addition title vi part a1 of the revised esea allows most leas to transfer up to 50 of their grants among four pr ograms teachers technology safe and drug free schools and the innovativ programs block grant or into not from title ia leas that have been identified as failing to meet state ayp requirements under title ia will be able to transfer only 30 of their grants under these programs and only to activities intended to address the failure to meet ayp standards according to policy guidance published by ed leas identified

provisions for parental involvement and professional developmen t activities second it requires that services be provided to private school pupils in timely manne r third requirements for consultation between public and private school officials are significantly expanded to include such topics as the data to be used to determine the share of pupils from lowincome families who attend private sc hools and who will provide the services including consideration of the possibility of providing services via thirdparty contractor the revised title ia includes specific provisions regarding authorized methods for leas to determine the share of pupils from lowincome families who attend private schools which is the basis for dete rmining the share of title ia grants that is to be devoted to serving eligible priv ate school pupils leas may 1 use the same measure of low income and source of data as used to count such children attending public schools 2 conduct survey which may be based on representative sample of pupils using the same measure of low income as used to count children attending public schools 3 apply the percentage of children from lowincome families determined for public school pupils to private school pupils residing in the same school attendance area or 4 use different measure of low income than used for counting children ttending public schools adjusting these data by an appropriate proportion so that the measures may be equated83 t h s provisions are similar to those of policy guidance disseminated by ed under the previous authorizing statute finally

earlier in this report the esea title ia requirements apply only to states that receive funds under this pr ogram if state chose to terminate its participation in title ia none of the requirements disc ussed in this report would apply to that state of course such state would lose significant amount of funding since title ia is the largest fede ral k12 education prog ram in addition as described in 2004 letter by the then acting deputy secretary of education eugene w hickok to the utah superintende nt of public instruction such state might also lose some or all of its f unds under several other esea programs under which grants are allocated to states using formulas that are linked to the title ia formulas90 as with states individual leas might choose to terminate their participation in title ia in order to attempt to avoid implementing the requirements discussed in this report however even if it r eceived title ia grants most of the requirements discussed in this report would continue to pply to an lea if its state continues to participate in title ia this includes the assessment ayp and report card requirements which apply to all public schools and leas in states receiving title ia grants an lea that refuses t itle ia funds would be released only from the corrective action requirements discussed in this report in addition as with states such an lea would presumably lose funds under not only title ia but also several other esea programs under which alloca tions are based on those under title ia
