l visas in fy1980 l visa issuances began increasing in the mid1990s and peaked at 122981 in fy2005 some are now charging that firms are using the l visa to transfer rank and file professional employees rather than limiting these transfers to toplevel personnel thus circumventing immigration laws aimed at protecting us employees from the potential adverse employment effects associated with an increase in the number of foreign workers proponents of current law maintain that any restrictions on l visas would prompt many multinational firms to leave the united states as well as undermine reciprocal agreements that currently permit us corporations to transfer their employees abroad title iv of pl 108447 the conso lidated appropriati ons act for fy2005 renders ineligible for l visa

to the united states temporarily or may come to live permanently those admitted on permanent basis are known as immigrants or legal permanent residents lprs while those admitted on temporary basis are known as nonimmigrants1 nonimmigrants include wide range of people such as tourists foreign students diplomats temporary agricultural workers exchange visitors internationally known entertainers foreign media representatives business personnel and crew member s on foreign vessels most of these nonimmigrant visa categories are defined in 101a15 of the immigration and nationality act ina these visa categories are commonly referred to by the letter and numeral that denotes their subsection in 101a15 for example b2 tourists e2 treaty investors f1 foreign students and h1b temporary prof essional workers intracompany transferees who work for an international firm or corporation in executive and managerial positions or have specialized product knowledge are admitted on the l1 visas their immediate family spouse and minor ch ildren are admitted on l2 visas legislative history of l visa congress established the l visa in 1970 largely in response to unintended consequences of the immigration amendm ents of 1965 that made multinational corporations unable to transf er toplevel personnel to offi ces in the united states as easily as they had prior to the impleme ntation of the 1965 immigration amendments because many of the employees that firms sought to bring into the united states were not intending to stay in the united states and were likely to be transferred abroad in few years congress opted to create nonimmigrant ie temporary category for aliens who performed in managerialexecutive capacity or who had specialized knowledge these aliens had to have been em ployed in that capacity by that firm for at least one year prior to seeking the l visa2httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32030crs2 3 214b of ina presumes that in general aliens seeking admission to the united states

congre ss made several changes to the l visa category most notab ly clarifying that specialized knowledge meant specialized knowledge of the firm s product congress placed time limits on the l visas allowing managers and executives holding l visas to stay for up to seven years and those having specialized product knowledge to stay for up to five years congress also amended the ina to permit aliens with l visas to petition to become lprs allowing for what is known as dual intent in immigration policy3 in the 1990 act congress further dded managers and executives to the priority worker also known as first preference categor of employmentbased lpr admissions facilitating the adjustment of l nonimmigrants to lpr status4 the 107th congress enacted change to the ina that reduced the length of time an l1 would have to work for certain multinational firms abroad from one year to six months prior to transferring to us location this legislation also amended the ina to permit the spouses of l1 nonimmig rants ie l2 nonimmigrants to work while they are in the united states5 during the 108th congress title iv of pl 108 447 the consolidated appropriations act for fy2005 included

market some of those advocating reform maintain that l1 visas should be limited to only toplevel executives of multinational firms and that midlevel managers and specialized personnel should be admitted only after determination that comparable us personnel are not adversely aff ected some argue that the l1 visa currently gives multinational firms an unfair advantage over usowned businesses by enabling multinational corporati ons to bring in lowe rcost foreign personnel supporters of current law argue that it is essential for multinational firms to be able to assign top personnel to facilities in the united states on an as needed basis and that it is counterproductiv to have government bureau crats delay these transfers to perform labor market tests they warn these multinational

to do business in the united states some point out that us corporations who do business abro ad might well lose the reciprocal benefit of transferring top us personnel overseas if restrictions are added to the l visa alternative to h1b visa there have been series of media reports that firms are opting to bring in foreign professional workers on l1 visas rather than the h1b visa for professional specialty workers16 critics cite the law on h1b visas in which employers seeking to hire h1b nonimmigrants must attest to the dol that they are paying the foreign workers the same wages as similarly employed us workers and that have not laid off us workers 90 days before or after hiring the h1b17 some are asserting that certain employers are end running the bor attestation requi rements of the h1b visa by exaggerating the specialized produc t knowledge of their professional workers so that they qualify for an l visa and that some firms are bringing in l1 nonimmigrants expressly to outsource th em to other firms advocates of reforming current law warn that the l visa is replacing the h1b visa for information technology positions and that l admissions will soar in numbers because h1b admissions are numerically limited18 supporters of current law assert that intracompany transfers are essential personnel that do not need to be subjected to the labor market tests designed for foreign workers filling rank and file positions they maintain that corporate flexibility and control on issues of staffing toplevel management are essential to success they warn that labor attestation for l visas would make it more costly and timeconsuming to do business in the united states reducing investment in the united states and ultimately resulting in multinational firms moving jobs off shore some observe that l1 employees do not technically constitute new hires who could displace us workers they maintain instead that the l1 employee is being transferred temporarily within the firm to add value or provide expertise based on their international experience with the firm19 inclusion in free trade agreements critics of current law on l visas are concerned that free trade agreements retain the current language on l visas and woul d bar the united states from statutory changes to l visas as well as other temporary business and worker nonimmigranthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32030crs8

require labor certification or other similar procedures as condition of entry and shall not impose any numerical limits on intracompany transfers from singapore20 similar language is also in the uschile free trade agreement21 proponents of these trade agreements point out that they are merely reflecting current law and policy and that such agr eements on the flow of business people and

senate followed passing the implementing language for both ftas on july 31 2003 the north american free trade agreement nafta has immigration provisions concerning intracompany transf erees similar to the chile and singapore ftas nafta requires the three signatory countries canada mexico and the united states to grant temporary entry to business persons employed by foreign enterprise who seek to render services to that enterprise or its affiliate or subsidiary in capacity that is managerial executive or that involves special knowledge these intracompany transferees must have worked continuously for one year out of the past three in foreign country for the same firm that they are seeking to serve in the united states party to nafta may impose numerical limits or labor market tests as condition of entry for intracompany transferees22 negotiators for the uruguay round agr eements of the general agreement on trade and tariffs gatt completed in 1994 and known as the general agreement on trade in services gats included ve ry specific language on intracorporate transfers23 this language is similar but not identical to the definitions of intracompany transferee found in the regulations governing the l visa24 given the issues being raised about the l visa some are concerned that these trade agreements constrain congress as it considers revisions of immigration law and policy on the l visa since the gats and ftas provide specific definitions of intracompany transferees prohibit labor cer tification or similar labor condition tests for intracompany transferees and prohibit numerical limits on intracompanyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32030crs9 25 for further analysis see crs report rl32982 immigration issues in trade agreements by ruth ellen wasem 26 consolidated

adjudicators often find it difficult to be confident that firm truly intends to use an imported worker in such capacity the visa allows for the transfer of workers with specializedknowledge but the term is so br oadly defined that adjudicators believe they have little choice but to approve almost all petitions the transfer of l1 workers requires that the petitioning firm isdoing business abroad but adjudi cators in the united states have little ability to evaluate the substantiality of the foreign operation the visa encompasses petitioners who do not yet have but aremerely in the process of establishing their first us office the visa permits petitioners to transfer themselves to the unitedstates the dhs oig also found that though the l1 visa program is not specifically tailored for the computer or information t echnology it industries the positions l1 applicants are filling are most often rela ted to computers and it from 1999 to 2004 nine of the ten firms that petitioned for the most l1 workers were computer and it related outsourcing service firms th at specialize in labor from india 27 in this 2006 report the dhs oig made three recommendations 1 establish procedure to
