brown made several speeches on african development nd undertook highprofile trip through the subsaharan region to highlight the principal british proposals international finance facility blair and brown initially proposed the cr eation of an inte rnational finance facility iff for africa funded at 50 billi on annually for ten years this proposal was modified by the commission for africa s

by review and move to 50 b illion if there has been sufficient progress in improving the managerial and administrative capabilities of african governments17 the iff would not be new deve lopment bank or aid agency but mechanism for raising new resources for development the iff would sell bonds and disburse the proceeds to existing b ilateral and mu ltilateral aid agencies from 2006 through 2015 donors would commit themse lves to repaying the bonds in the years after 2015 the commissions report desc ribes this big push of predictable aid as moral duty for the g7 developed countries and as step that would serve their economic selfinterest by promoting an economic expansion in africa the report repeatedly stresses that africa must continue economic and governance reforms if the new aid is to be used effectively one source estimated the nearterm cost of us participation in the iff based on the commissions 25 billion initial targ et at 6 billion or per year18 over the long term however blair regards funding for the iff as dependent on progress by the g7 in reaching the goal of giving 7 of gdp in development aid for the united states to reach an interim leve l of 5 from the

concerned that any major imf gold sale could sharply lower the price of gold with potentially destabilizing consequences for the gold re serves held by many countries others argued that any sales could be small and made over long period of time to minimize this risk with respect to debt owed by poor c ountries to the world bank and the african development bank us officials favored simple cancellation not funded by any repayments made by the g7 or any new contributions by the g7 to the mdbs27 after the writeoff in the us view the banks would make grants rather than loans to poor countries so that they do not accumulate new debt28 many were concerned that the us approach would deplete the banks capital and reduce their capacity for alleviating poverty since they would l onger

the g8 promised that the compensation paid to the mdbs would be in addition to the assistance they were already planning to provide africa ho wever some were concerned that this commitment would be difficult to monitor and some also argued that an agreement on the iff at the london meeting would have been of far greater benefit to africa the agreement did not cover nigerias vast debt of 30

action on specific reducti ons some developing countries may not be willing to make the concessions on market access sought by the united states leading to breakdown in the wto negotiati ons moreover reductions in subsidies and other barriers will encounter political opposition in both the united states and europe where many see them as an impor tant guarantor of jobs and protection against price

markets have come in for particular criticism wide range of countries have freed up markets in varying degrees and undertaken governance reforms since the late 1980s under pressu re from the world bank the imf and bilateral donors but corruption remains problem kenya for example had been the source of much optimism for africas future after free and fair elections were held in december 2002 but recently both the us and british ambassadors have criticized the government of president mwai kibaki for failing to tackle corruption the united states has suspended an anticorruption assistance

the southe rn african development community in short number of observers feel that too many african governments are failing to live up to their end of the deal pr oposed by prime minister blair in october 2001 they point out that africa has receive d substantial amounts of assistance over the years with official development assistance reaching nearly 24 billion in 2003 see below from their perspective the principal responsibility for africas development now lies with africas leaders w ho must assure that their countries enter the ranks of the good performers millennium project head jeffrey sachs takes somewhat different view though st rong supporter of s ound economic policies in africa he believes the continent is cau ght in poverty trap so poor that few want to invest even in count ries where real attempts at reform are being made the millennium project report whic h he directed argues that many countries in africa are well governed considering the extent of their poverty and would benefit from big push in foreign assistance to streng then education health care infrastructure and other sectors this rapid scaleup in his view would create viable economies attractive to investors and he lp africa escape the poverty trap proponents of third view acknowledg that committing large new amounts of aid to africa is risky given the continents many difficulties but maintain that the risk is worth taking since in their view the amounts of aid being proposed by blair brown and sachs could readily be afforded by the g7 countries working together in return some argue the g7 might gain new markets assure access to africas oil and other resources over the long term nd create an environment in which violence and terrorism are less likely to emerge africa at previous g8 meetings g8 meetings in the 1990s often dealt w ith many of the same themes expected to be raised at gleneagles the g8 first emphasized in those years that subsaharan africa faces special velopment challenges and summit communiques acknowledged that substantia l development assistance was needed to help sub saharan africa grow41 debt relief for the poorest countries was another major theme the 1994 naples summit encouraged wider cancellation of bilateral debt and the 1996 summit at lyons helped launch the heavily indebted poor countries initiative hipc to reduce poor country debt owed to the world bank and imf at cologne in 1999 the g8 agreed on an expanded hipc program that would offer deeper broader and faster debt relief toward the end of the 1990s g8 meetings also began to reflect the view that the least developed countri needed expanded access to developed country markets beginning with the 1997 denver summit the g8 repeatedly called for expanded efforts to combat hivaids and other infectious diseases afflicting africa as well as other impoverished regi ons also at denver the g8 expressed their support for longterm efforts to promote rapidly

responsibility for promoting their own development this means conducting sound and consistent economic and social policies promoting political and legal environment conducive to the development of the private sector and encouraging domestic and foreign investment42 the genoa and kananaskis canada meetings in 2001 and 2002 saw an intensification of the focus on africa th ree subsaharan presid ents

g8 have not done nearly enough after the 2003 evian meeting for example om ar kabbaj president of the african development bank wrote that there had b een some good initiatives with respect to aid but
