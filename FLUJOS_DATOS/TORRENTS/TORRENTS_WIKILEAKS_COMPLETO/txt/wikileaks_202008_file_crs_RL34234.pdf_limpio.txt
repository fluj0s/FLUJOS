disfavor nuclear power is attracting renewed interest new per mit applications for 30 reactor s have been filed in the united states and another 150 are planned or proposed globally with about dozen more already under construction in the ited states interest appears driven in part by provisions in the 2005 energy po licy act authorizing streamlined licensing that combine construction and operating pe rmits and tax credits for production from advanced nuclear power facilities moreover the us department of energy proposes to spend billions of dollars to velop the next generation of nuclear power technology expanding global access to nuclear power nevertheless has the potential to lead to the spread of sensitive nuclear technol ogy despite 30 years of effort to limit access to uranium enrichment several undeterred states pursued clandestine nuclear programs the aq khan black market ne tworks sales to iran and north korea representing the most egregious examples concern over the spread of enrichment and reprocessing technologies combined with growing consensus that the world must seek alternatives to dwindling and polluting fossil fuels may be giving way to optimism that advanced nuclear technolog ies may offer proliferation resistance proposals offering countries access to nuc lear power and thus the fuel cycle have ranged from formal commitment by these countries to forswear enrichment and reprocessing technology to fact approach in which state does not operate fuel cycle facilities but makes explicit commitment to restrictions at all the most recent pr oposal under the us global nuclear energy partnership gnep represents shift in us policy by not requiring participants to forgo domestic fuel cycle programs whether developing st ates will find existing proposals attractive enough to forgo what they see as thei r inalienable right to develop nuclear technology for peaceful purposes remains to be seen congress will have considerable role in at least four areas of oversight related to fuel cycle proposals the first is provi ding funding and oversight of us domestic programs related to expanding nuclear ener gy in the united states the second area

interest in nuclear power nd expanding its role in meeting world energy demands has also led to increased concerns for limiting the spread of nuclear weaponsrelevant technology after lang uishing for several decades the united states appears poised for new phase of nuclear reactor construction two new uranium enrichment plants are already under construc tion in anticipation of an increased demand for nuclear fuel spent nuclear fuel disposal has remained the most critical aspect of the nuclear fuel cycle for the united states where longstanding nonproliferation policy discouraged commercial nuclear fuel reprocessing2 other countries provide commercia l reprocessing services and with several notable exceptions have kept th eir commercial and weapons fuel cycles separate new proposals to offer commerc ial nuclear power oppor tunities to nonfuel cycle nations would guarantee them s upply of nuclear fuel in exchange for commitments to forgo enrichment and reprocessing the us department of energy consid ers nuclear power as the only proven technology that can provide abundant supplie s of baseload elect ricity reliably and without air pollution or emissions of greenhouse gases3 the national energy policy development group r ecommended in 2001 that president bush support the expansion of nuclear energy in the ited states as major component of our national energy policy about the same time the us partment of energy doe created the generation iv international forum to collaborate with 10 other states in investigating innovative nuclear energy syst em concepts for meeting future energy challenges the bush administration requested millions of dollars from congress in 2003 to support several prog rams related to the devel opment of new nuclear power plants in the united states including the advanced fuel cycle initiative and generation iv in passing the energy policy act of 2005 cong ress created certain incentives and streamlined license application procedures for new

timeline of fuel cycle proposals av ailable at h ttp wwwiaeaorgne wscentermeanwhile concerns over nuclear prolifer ation have steadily risen as ostensibly commercial uranium enrichment and reprocessing technol ogies have been subverted for military purposes in 2003 and 2004 it became evident that pakistani nuclear scientist aq khan sold sensitive tec hnology and equipment related to uranium enrichment process that can be used to make fuel for nuclear power and research reactors or to make fissile material for nuclear weapons to states such as libya iran and north korea although pakistans leaders maintain they did not acquiesce in or abet khans activities pakistan re mains outside the nucl ear nonproliferation treaty npt and the nuclear suppliers group nsg iran has been direct recipient of pakistani enrichment technology4 the international atomic energy agen cy iaeas board of governors found in 2005 that irans breach of its safegu ards obligations c onstituted noncompliance with its safeguards agreement and refe rred the case to the security council in february 2006 despite repeated calls by the security council for iran to halt enrichment and reprocessingrelated ac tivities and im position of sanctions iran continues to develop enrichment capability at natanz5 iran insists on its inalienable right to develop the peaceful uses of nuclear energy pursuant to article iv of the npt interpretations of this right have varied over time6 the iaea director general mohamed elba radei has not disputed this inalienable right and by and large neither have us government officials however the case of iran raises perhaps the most critical question in this decade for strengthening the nuclear nonproliferation regime how can access to sensitive fuel cycle activities which could be used to produce fissile materi for weapons be circumscribed without further alienating nonnuclear weapon states in the npt leaders of the international nuclear nonproliferation reg ime have suggested ways of reining in the diffusion of such inherently dualuse technology primarily through the creation of incentives not to rich uranium or reprocess plutonium the international community is in the pro cess of evaluating those proposals and may decide upon mix of approaches most of the proposals are not new but rather variations of those developed thirty or

reasons foundered for technical and political reasons but many states were nevertheless deterred from enrichment and reprocessing simply by the high t echnical and financial costs of developing sensitive nuclear technologies as well as by slump in the nuclear market several developments may now make efforts to limit access to the nuclear fuel cycle more attractive growing concern about the spr ead of enrichment t echnology specifically via aq khan black market network as we ll as irans efforts growing consensus that the world must seek alternatives to polluting fossil fuels and optimism about new nuclear technologies that may offer more proliferationresistant systems central to the debate is developing proposals attractive enough to compel states to forego what they see as their inalienable right to develop nuclear technology for peaceful purposes at the same time there is debate on how to improve the iaea safeguards system and its means of detecting diversion of nuclear material to weapons program in the face of expanded nucl ear power facilities worldwide this report is intended to provide members and cong ressional staff with the background needed to understand the

natural gas since 199811 indicates that natural gas prices have also risen around the world as result national governments are searching for alternative energy sources often including nuclear power however only 20 of the worlds electricity generation is fueled by natural gas and 7 by oil the majority of the worlds electricity is generated from coal12 so nuclear powers ability to directly substitute for oil and gas is limited at least in the near term for nuclear power to have signi ficant impact on oil demand longterm changes in energyuse patterns would have to take place particularly in the transportation sector one possibility is that nuclear power plants could be used to produce hydrogen which could provide ener gy for fuelcell vehicles the us department of energy is developing processes that could produce industrial scale quantities of hydrogen in hi ghtemperature reactor by 201913 and is concurrently supporting development of fuel cell ve hicles another possibility is the commercialization of allelectric or plugin hybrid vehicles that could be recharged with nucleargenerated electricity but even if such technologies were to be successfully developed it woul d take many years for the new vehicles and in the case of hydrogen fuel delivery infrastructure to have significant energy impact government policies aside higher oil and gas prices are heightening interest in nuclear power by improving current pr ojections of nuclear powers economic viability in the united states natural gas has been the overwhelming fuel of choice for new electrical generation capacity ce the early 1990s but recent high prices have caused planned coalfired capacity in 2009 to reach nearly twice the level of planned gasfired capacity14 increased demand has led to rising us prices for coal which already generates nearly half of us electricity and 40 of world electricity15 because fuel costs constitute relatively small per centage of nuclear power costs higher natural gas and coal prices could make ne w nuclear power plants economically competitive despite sharply rising uranium prices16 growing worldwide concern about gr eenhouse gas emissions particularly carbon dioxide from fossil fuels has renewe d attention to nuclear powers lack of direct co2 emissions although few nationa l governments or international organizations have explicitly adopted policies in support of nuclear power to reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions many ghg policies and proposal s may indirectly encourage nuclear power expansion legisl ative proposals such as tradeable permits and carbon taxes

support for nuclear power as way to reduce ghg emissions has emerged in academic and think tank circles as stated by the massachusetts institute of technology in its major study the future of nuclear power our position is that the prospect of global climate change fro m greenhouse gas emissions and the adverse consequences that flow from these emissions is the principal justification for government support of the nuclear energy option17 but environmental groups generally contend that the nuclear accident waste and weapons proliferation risks posed by nuclear power outweigh any ghg benefits the large construction expenditures required by co mmercial reactors they contend would yield greater ghg reductions if used for ergy efficiency and renewable generation finally they note that nuclear power while not di rectly emitting greenhouse gases produces indirect emissions through the nuclear fuel cycle and during plant construction another key factor behind th renewed interest in nuclear power is the improved performance of existing reactors us commercial reactors generated electricity at an average of 898 of their total cap acity in 2006 after averaging around 75 in the mid1990s and around 65 in the mid1980s worldwide performance has seen similar improvement18 the improved operation of nuc lear power plants has helped drive down the cost of nucleargenerated electricity average us reactor operations and maintenance costs including fuel but excluding capital costs dropped steadily from high of about 35 centskilowatthour kwh in 1987 to below 2 centskwh in 2001 in 2001 dollars19 by 2005 the us average operating cost was 17 centskwh20 nuclear interest has been further increas ed in the united states by incentives in the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 the law provides nuclear energy production tax credit for up to 6000 gawatts of new nuclear capacity compensation for regulatory delays for the first six new reactors and federal loan guarantees for nuclear power and other adva nced energy technologies under certain baseline assumptions the tax credit could determine whether new us nuclear plants would be economically viable21 us electric utilities and other companies during the past two years have announced plans to submit license app lications to the nuclear regulatory commission nrc for more than 30 new commercial reactors table 1

nuclear option as figure 1 shows the vast majority of reactors cu rrently under constructi on are in asia with only handful in the rest of the world despite the recent positive developments for nuclear power much uncertainty still remains about its prospects construc tion costs for new nuclear power plants which were probably the dominant factor in halting the first round of nuclear expansion continue to loom as pot ential insurmountable obstacle to renewed nuclear power growth average us nuc lear plant construction costs more than doubled from 1971 to 1978 according to the office of technology assessment and nearly doubled again by the mid1980s not including interest accrued during construction22 including interest many us nuc lear plants proved to be grossly uneconomic often with capital costs to taling more than 3000 per kilowatt of capacity in 2000 dollars23 and relying on the utility regulatory system to recover their costs major reactor vendors such as general electric and westinghouse contend that new designs and constructi on methods will cut costs considerably nuclear supporters also point to new us nuclear licensing system that is intended to avoid some of the regulatory problems that delayed completion of some reactors in the past us commercial reactor has been completed during the past decade however and the new licensing system has yet to be tested the french reactor vendor areva estimated that the first of its newly designed power plants in france would cost 2600 per kilowatt which would be high in the likely range of economic viability reported construction costs of reactors completed around the world since the 1990s range so widely and vary so much in circumstance that they provide little insight into probable future costs24 many other important factors in the future of nuclear power are similarly uncertain prices of competing fuels par ticularly natural gas have risen recently but have been volatile in the recent past if fossil fuel prices become depressed for sustained period as in the late 1980s through the 1990s support for nuclear power as an alternative energy source could ag ain be undermined major accidents such as three mile island and chernobyl woul d almost certainly diminish public support for nuclear power disposal of highlevel nuclear wa ste which reprocessing or recycling is intended to address

cycle take place after nuclear fuel assemblies have been loaded into reactor in the reactor the uranium 235 235u splits or fissions releasing energy neutrons nd fission products highly radioactive fragments of 235u nuclei the neutr ons may cause other 235u nuclei to fission creating nuclear chain reaction some neutrons are also absorbed by 238u nuclei to create plutonium 239 239pu which itself may then fission after several years in the reactor fuel assemblies will build up too many neutronabsorbing fission products and become too depleted in fissile 235u to efficiently sustain nuclear chain reac tion at that point the assemblies are considered spent nuclear fuel and removed from the reactor spent fuel typically contains about 1 235u 1 plutonium 4 fission products and the remainder 238u the last stage of the fuel cycle after spent fuel is removed from reactor has proved highly contentious one option is to directly dispose of spent fuel in deep geologic repository to isolate it for the hundreds of thousands of years that it may remain hazardous the other option is to reprocess the spent fuel to separate the uranium and plutonium for use in new fuel supporters of repro

uranium resources opponents contend that commerc ial use of separated plut onium key material in nuclear weapons as well as reactor fuel poses nuclear weapons proliferation threat commercialscale spent fuel reprocessi ng is currently conducted in france britain and russia the 239pu they produce is blended with uranium to make mixed oxide mox fuel in which the 239pu largely substitutes for 235u two french reprocessing plants at hague can each reprocess up to 800 metric tons of spent fuel per year while britains thorp facility at sellafield has capacity of 900 metric tons per year russia has 400ton plant at ozersk and japan is building an 800ton plant at rokkasho to succeed 90t on demonstration fac ility at tokai mura britain and france also have older plants to reprocess gascooled reactor fuel and india has 275ton plant52 about 200 metric tons of mox fuel is used annually about 2 of new nuclear fuel53 equivalent to about 2000 metric tons of mined uranium54 however the benefits of reprocessing spent fuel from todays nuclear power plants are modest existing commercial light water reactors use ordinary water to slow down or moderate th neutrons released by the fission process the relatively slow thermal neutrons are highly efficient in causing fission in certain isotopes of heavy elements such as 235u and 239pu55 therefore fewer of those isotopes are needed in nuclear fuel to stain nuclear chain reaction the downside is that thermal neutrons cannot efficiently induce fission in more than few specific isotopes in todays commercial reactor s therefore the buildup of nonfissile plutonium and other isotopes sharply limits the number of reprocessing cycles before the recycled fuel can longer sustain nuclear chain reaction and must be stored or disposed of in contrast fast neutr ons which have not been m oderated are less effective in inducing fission than thermal neutrons but can induce fissi on in all actinides including all plutonium isotopes therefore nuclear fuel for fast reactor must have higher proportion of fissionable isotopes th an thermal reactor to sustain chain reaction but larger number of different isotopes can constitute that fissionable proportion fast reactors ability to fission all ac tinides actinium and heavier elements makes it theoretically possible to repeatedly separate those materials from spent fuel and feed them back into the reactor until th ey are entirely fissioned fast reactors are also ideal for breeding the maximum amount of 239pu from 238u eventuallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34234crs19 56 the core of breeder reactor is configured so that more fissile 239pu is produced from 238u than the amount of fissile material initially loaded into the core that is consumed 235u or 239pu in breeder therefore enough fiss ile material could be recovered through reprocessing to refuel the reactor and to prov ide fuel for additional breeders the core of fast reactor can also be configured to produce less 239pu than fissile material consumed if the primary goal is to eliminate 239pu from spent fuel in that case much less 238u ultimately would be converted to 239pu and therefore less total energy produced from given amount of natural uraniumconverting virtually all of natural uranium to useable nuclear fuel56 current reprocessing programs are generally view ed by their proponents as interim steps toward commercial nuclear fuel cycle based on fast reactors waste disposal nd energy security reprocessing of spent fuel from fast br eeder reactors has long been the ultimate goal of nuclear power supporters as noted above fast reactors operated either as breeders or nonbreeders can iminate plutonium from nuclear waste and greatly extend uranium supplies but opponents cont end that such potential benefits are not worth the costs and nonproliferation risks removing uranium from spent nuclear fuel through reprocessing would eliminate most of the volume of radioactive material requiring disposal in deep geologic repository in addition the remova l of plutonium and c onversion to shorter lived fission products would eliminate mo st of the longterm post1000 years radioactivity in nuclear waste but the waste resulting from reprocessing would have nearly the same shortterm radioactivity nd heat as the original spent fuel because the reprocessing waste consists primarily of fission products which generate most of the radioactivity and heat in spent fu because heat is the main limiting factor on repository capacity conven tional reprocessing would not provide major disposal benefits in the near term doe is addressing that problem with proposal to further separate the primary heatgenerating fission products cesium 137 and strontium 90 from high level waste for separate storage and decay ove r several hundred years that proposal would greatly increase repository capacity although it would requi re an alternative secure storage system for the cesium and strontium that has yet to be designed energy security has been primary driving force behind the development of nuclear energy particularly in countries such as france and japan that have few natural energy resources recent cutoffs in oil and gas have underscored the instability of oil and gas supply which c ould be mitigated by nuclear energy for example in 2006 natural gas price dis pute between russia and ukraine resulted in temporary cutoff of natural gas to western and central europe in 2007 price disputes between russia and azerbaijan and belarus caused temporary cutoff in oil to russia from azerbaijan and in oil from russia to germany poland and slovakia moreover temporary production shutdowns in the gulf of mexico and the transalaskan pipeline instability in nigeria and

weathering potential cutoffs worldwide uranium resources are generally considered to be sufficient for at least several decades uranium supply is highly diversified with uranium mining spread across the globe while uranium conve rsion enrichment and fuel fabrication are more concentrated in handful of countries but because most reactors around the world rely at least partly on foreign s ources of

and russia as well although their research and development programs have faced numer ous obstacles and schedule slowdowns proposals on the fuel cycle57 proposals on limiting access to the full nuclear fuel cycle have ranged from formal commitment to forswear enrichment and reprocessing technology to facto approach in which state does not operate fuel cycle facilities but makes explicit commitment to give them up to rest rictions at all all of these proposals aim to persuade countries not to develop their own fuel production capabilities by providing economically attrac tive alternatives that

in the february 2004 speech the international community had renewed interest in addressing this quandary since 2004 the group of eight g 8 nations have announced yearlong suspension of any such

only one that calls for countries to explicitly renounce pursuit of enrichment or reprocessing technologies in exchange for reliable access to nuclear fuel it wa s meant to disarm advocates of indigenous fuel cycle development of the argument th at only indigenous supply is secure there has been little agreement on president bu shs proposals many nonnuclear weapon states see this as an attempt to limit thei r inalienable right to the use of peaceful nuclear energy under article iv of the np t and are not willing to consider limits on peaceful nuclear technologies until more progress on nuclear disarmament has been made key questions about impleme ntation of this proposal remain unanswered for example who is included in the group of supplier states and how is fullscale functioning plants defined would irans enrichment program qualify today even if it did not back in 2004 and what about nonnpt states with the full fuel cycle as part of their weapons programs also how would related tec hnologies be treated for example would restricti ons also apply to postirra diation experiments on spent nuclear fuel which yield significant data about reactor operations but can also contribute to knowledge about reproce ssing for weapons purposes since 2004 delay in defining these terms appears to have provided an incentive for some states such as canada south africa argentina

mechanism to ensure the supply of low enriched uranium leu for nuclear fuel the proposal would work as follows 1 commercial supply relationship is interrupted for reasons other than nonproliferation 2 the recipien t or supplier state can approach the iaea to request backup supply 3 the iaea would rule out commercial or technical reasons for interruption to avoid mark et disruption and assess whether the recipient meets the following qualifications it must have comprehensive safeguards agreement and additional protocol in force it must adhere to international nuclear safety and physical protection standards and it is not pursuing sensitive fuel cycle activities which are not defined 4 the iaea would facilitate new arrangements with alternative suppliers two mechanisms were proposed to create multiple tiers of assurances including standard backup provision in commercial contracts and establishing reserves of leu not necessarily held by the iaea but possibly with rights regarding the use of the reserves the six c ountry concept specifically mentioned the 17 tons of us heu declared in september 2006 to be ex cess to defense needs which would be converted to leu and held in reserv to support fuel supply assurances74 according to us ambassador gregory schulte any such reserve in the united states would be kept under national control75 stringent us requirements on usorigin material pursuant to the 1954 atomic energy act as amended may limit the attractiveness of that material for some states such re quirements include safegu ards in perpetuity prior consent for

for assuring frontend and back end nuclear fuel supplies88 like the six country concept the wna proposal envi sions system of supply assu rances that starts first with normal market procedur attempting to reestablish nuclear fuel supply after interruptions also similar to the sixpa rty proposal preestablished network of suppliers could be triggered through the ia ea if supply were interrupted for political reasons if that network then failed stoc ks held by national governments could be used the first tier of assurances therefore is through commercial suppliers the second level of supply commitme nt would use standard backup supply clause in enrichment contracts supported by govern ments and the iaea to ensure that single enricher is unfairly burdened w ith the responsibility of providing backup supply the other remaining enrichers w ould then supply the c ontracted enrichment in equal shares under terms agreed between the iaea and the enrichers according to the proposal for fuel fabrication backup supply system would be more complicated according to the wna report because fuel design is specific to each reactor design an effective mechanism would require stockpiling of different fuel typesdesigns the cost of such mechanism could thus be substantial according to the report however wna noted th at unlike uranium enrichment technology uranium fuel fabrication is not of proliferation concern the wna report also noted the need fo r backend nuclear fuel cycle supply assurances to prevent future scenario in which reprocessing technologies spread as nuclear power programs expand the report recommends that clear option to reprocess spent fuel at affordable prices is offered to states that do not have indigenous reprocessing programs such assu rances would be part of longerterm approach other proposals japan presented complementary proposal to the six country concept at the iaea in september 2006 japans concerns with the six country concept centered on the implication that it would deny the righ t for states to use nuclear technology for commercial purposes and because it assured the supply only of leu rather than

2007 that ne w enrichment facility be built and placed under iaea ownership in extraterritorial area89 an independent management board or cons ortium would finance and r the plant on commercial basis but the iaea would decide whet her to supply enriched fuel according to nonproliferation criteria germany argues th at this approach is advantageous since it does not prohibit uranium enrichment but does provide co mmercially viable politically neutral option for fuel supply and could create competition on the world market by creating new fuel service provider with an economically viable option on neutral ground it will be harder for states to justify starting their own enrichment program for commercial reasons the united kingdom has proposed that richment bonds be created that would give advance assurance of export approvals fo r nuclear fuel to recipient states the bonds would be an agreement between supplier state or states the recipient state and the iaea in which the supplier government would guarantee that subject to the iaeas determination that the recipien t was in good nonproliferation standing national enrichment providers will be given the necessary export approvals

fabricated into fuel for an advanced burner reactor fast reactor to be developed by does generation iv nuclear energy systems initiative in the longer term plutonium and other transuranics in spent fuel would be fabricated into new fuel for future fast reactors eventually that fuel would be continually recycled until all the transuranics are consumed leaving the fission products to be disposed of in geologic repository the international component of gnep nvisions consortium of nations with advanced nuclear technology that would provide fuel services and reactors to countries that refrain from fuel cycle activities such as enrichment and reprocessing it is essentially fuel leasing approach wherein the supplier takes responsibility for the final disposition of the spent fuel this could mean taking back the spent fuel but might also mean acco rding to doe that the supplier would retain the responsibility to ensure that the material is secu red safeguarded and disposed of in manner that meet s shared nonprolifer ation policies91 while this describes the responsibility of the supplier the vagueness of the language suggests that any number of solutions including onsite storage could be the outcome gnep envisions system whereby supplier states take back spent fuel but many nations lack the politi cal will to do so skeptics have raised the question of whether the technology used in gnep will be net gain for nonproliferation efforts since the united states does not reprocess or reuse plutonium now in their view the proliferationresistance of technologies under consid eration must be assessed against the status quo in the united states which is disposal of sealed intact fuel rods in geologic repository much of the afcis research is focu sing on separations technology called urex in which uranium and other elements are chemically removed from dissolved spent fuel leaving mixture of plutonium and other highly radioactive elements proponents believe urex is proliferationresistant because further purification would be requi red to make the plutonium useable for weapons and because its high radioactivity would make it difficult to divert or work with in contrast conventional reprocessing usin g the purex process can produce weapons useable plutonium however critics see the potential nonpro liferation benefits of urex over purex as minimal richard garwin sugge sted in testimony to congress in 2006 that urex fuel fails the proliferationresistance test since it contains 90 plutonium it could be far more attractive to divert than current spent

reprocess 11 kg of urex fuel to obtain roughly 10 kg of plutonium in cont rast to reprocessing 1000 kg of highly radioactive spent fuel to get the same amount from light water reactor fuel92 another nonproliferationrelated concern about gnep is how its implementation will affect global stockpiles of separated plutonium frank von hippel points to costly failed plutonium r ecycling programs in the uk russia and japan where separated plut onium stocks have accumula ted to 250 tons enough for 30000 nuclear warheads in von hippels view gnep would exchange the safer onsite spent fuel storage at reactors for cen tral storage of separated transuranics and highlevel waste cost ten times more and increase the global plutonium stockpile93 separate set of questions focuses on how effective gnep will be in achieving its goals as the only proposal currently that offers incentives for the backend of the fuel cycle it may hold more promise of attracting states to participate in the fuel supply assurances part of the framework however backend fu cycle assurances will require significant changes in policies and laws as well as efforts to commercialize technologies further it is far from clear that all suppliers will be able to offer the full range of fuel cycle assurances raising the question of the relative competitiveness of suppliers these critic s do not argue that the overall vision of gnep is misplaced but instead are skeptical that its vision can be achieved particularly in th timeframe proposed gnep itself marks departure from us policy of not encouraging the use of plutonium in civil nuclear fuel cycles supporters suggest that the us policy developed in the late 1970s did not envi sion recycling process that would not separate pure plutonium and therefore question the underlying assumptions of that longstanding policy critic s of gnep have suggested that even though many nations did not agree with the united states in th 1970s on the dangers of having stockpiles of separated plutonium th message that the united states conveyed was that reprocessing was unnecessary to reap the benefits of nuclear power and that gnep conveys the opposite message now mo reover some critics point to the accumulation since the 1970s of separated plut onium as particular threat given the potential for terrorist interest in acquiring nuclear material an october 2007 study published

proposals see lawrence scheinman equal opportunity historical challenges and future pr ospects of the nuclear fuel cycle arms control today may 2007prospects for implementing fuel assurance mechanisms proposals to provide an in ternational and instituti onal framework for peaceful nuclear activities have abounded since the 1940s but fe w have been implemented the ussponsored baruch plan introduced at the united nations in 1946 recommended establishing an international agency with managerial control or ownership of all atomic energy activities the international atomic energy agency established in 1957 emerged as paler vers ion of what was suggested in the baruch plan but still retains authorities in its statute to store fissile material concern about proliferation led to flurry of proposals in the 1970s and 1980s as the united states and others convened groups to study the issues101 one idea studied in the mid1970s was regional nuc lear fuel cycle centers focused on reprocessing technologies several factors contributed to its lack of success despite support by the us congress low uran ium prices making plutonium recovery relatively unattractive slump in the nuc lear industry in the late 1970s and early 1980s and us oppos ition to reprocessing from the late 1970s member states of the iaea also convened the internationa l fuel cycle evaluation project which involved 60 countries and in ternational organizations infce working group reports suggested establishing multitiered assu rance of supply mechanism similar to the one proposed by the six country concept in 2006 states also studied international plutonium storage in the late 1970s and early 1980s but could not agree on how to define excess material or the re quirements for releasing materials as in the past the success of current proposals may depend on whether nuclear energy is truly revived not just in the ited states but globally that revival will likely depend on significant support for nuclear energy in the form of policy price supports and incentives factors that may help improve the position of nuclear energy against alternative sources of electricity include higher prices for other sources natural gas and coal through carbon tax improved reactor designs to reduce capital costs regulatory improve ments and waste disposal solutions the willingness of fuel recipient states to participate in international enrichment centers rather than develop indigenous enrichment capabilities and confidence in fuel supply assurance mechanisms such as an international fuel bank will largely determine the success of the overall policy goal to prevent further spread of enrichment and reprocessing technologies so far proposals addressing this challenge have originated in the supplier states with many recipient states continuing to voice concern that their right to peacef ul nuclear energy technology under the npt is in jeopardy increasingly however par ticipation is being presented as market based decision by country not to at least for the present develop their own fuel enrichment programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34234crs40 102 see crs report rl33558 nuclear energy policy by mark holtanother factor that will shape the ccess of these proposals is the possible addition of other incentives simply maki ng nuclear energy costeffective may not induce countries to forgo i ndigenous enrichment and reprocessing such decisions may require other incentives perhaps even outside the nuclear realm to make them palatable the experience of iran may be instructive here russias offer to provide assured enrichment services on russian soil has gone nowhe re instead other broader trade incentives may be necessary while the case of iran may illustrate the extreme end of the spectrum in terms of country determined to develop capability for weapons program nonnuclear weapon st ates will clearly take notice of how solution develops for iran issues for congress congress would have considerable role in at least four areas of oversight related to fuel cycle proposal s the first is providing funding and oversight of us domestic programs related to expanding nuclear energy in the united states key among these programs are gnep the advanced fuel cycle initiative other nuclear research and development programs nd federal incentives for building new commercial reactors102 the second area is policy direction andor funding for international measures to assure supply what guarantees should the united states insist on in exchange for helping provide fuel assurances hr 885 contains nonprolif eration requirements for states participating in an iaea fuel bank yet the nti fuel bank and other proposals do not although the six country concept contains an option for fuel bank it would not require par ticipants to forswear enri chment and reprocessing third set of policy issues may arise in the context of implementing the international component of gnep as re ferenced above in the original policy documents gnep participant states woul d agree to refrain from fuel cycle initiatives however in its most recent ministerial meeting this language was longer used and participation was opened to all this is most likely meant to increase participation in the initiative by emphasizing that gnep is not asking state to give up rights to peaceful nuclear technology some observers believe th at further restrictions on nonnuclear weapon states party to the npt are untenable in the absence of substantial disarmament commitments by nuclear weapon states
