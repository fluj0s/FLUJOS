action of the house in declaring vacancy as existing or causing one by expulsion4 although considered in the federal convention of 1787 there was never provision adopted in the united states cons

which is characterized as selfdisciplinary action necessary to protect the integrity of the institution and its proceedings7 an expulsion is diffe rent from an exclusion an exclusion is not

way of an impeachment procedure in the legislature as are executive and judicial officers but are subject to the more simplified legislative process of expulsion9 removal through an impeachment requires the action of both houses of congress impeachment in the house and trial and conviction in the senate while an expulsion is accomplished merely by the house or senate acting alone concerning one of its ow n members and without the constitutional requirement of trial nd conviction an expulsion from the senate or the house of representatives is considered the most severe form of cong

of its own members is unres tricted on the face of the c onstitutional language except as to the requirement for twothirds pproval although such authority appears to be extensive as to the grounds nature timing and the procedure for the expulsion of member16 policy considerations as opposed to questions of power or authority may have generally restrained the senate and the house in the exercise of their authority to expel such restraint has been particularly evident when the conduct complained of occurred prior to the time the member was in congress17 or occurred in prior congress when the electorate knew of the c onduct and still elected or re elected the member18 the apparent reticence of the senate or house to expel member for past misconduct af ter the member has been dul elected or reelected by the electorate with knowledge of the memb ers conduct appears to reflect in some part the deference traditionally paid in our heritage to the popular will and election choice of the people19 in 1914 the judiciary com mittee of the house detailed various policy considerations in expulsions for past misconduct in the judgment of your committee the power of the house to expel or punish by censure member for misconduct occurring before his election or in preceding or former congress is sustained by th practice of the house sanctioned by reason and sound policy and in extreme cases is absolutely essen tial to enable the house to exclude from its deliberations and councils notoriously corrupt men who have unexpectedly and suddenly dishonored themselves but in considering this question and in arriving at the conclusions we have reached we would not have ou unmindful of the fact that we have been dealing with the question merely as one of power and it should not be confused with the question of policy also involved as matter of sound policy this extraordinary prerogative of the house in our judgme nt should be exercised only in extreme cases and always with great caution nd after due circumspection and should be invoked with greatest caution where the acts of misconduct complained of had become public previous to and were generally known at the time of the members election to exercise such power in that instance the house might abuse its highhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30016crs5 20 report of the house judiciary committee hrept 570 63rd cong 2d sess

its constitutional authority by seeking to s ubstitute its standards and ideals for the standards and ideals of the constituency of the member who had deliberately chosen him to be their representative the effect of such policy would tend not to preserve but to undermine and destroy representative government20 the authority to expel has thus been used cautiously particularly when the institution of congress might be seen as usurping or supplanting its own institutional judgment for that of the electorate as to the character or fitness for office of someone the people have chosen to represent them in congress21 recall in some states state legislators and other state or local elected officials may be removed from office before the expiration of their established terms not only by action of the legislature itself through an expulsion or for executive officers through an impeachment and conviction by the legi slature but also by the voters through recall election procedure while an expulsion is an internal authority of legislative bodies incident to their gene ral powers over their own proceedings and members recall is special process outside of the legislature itself exercised by the people through special election recall pr ovisions for state or local officers became popular in the progressive m ovement particular ly in the western and plains states in the early part of the 20th century22 constitutional history the united states constitution does not provide for nor authorize the recall of united states officials such as united stat senators representatives to congress or the president or vice president of the united states and thus united states senator or member of the house of representatives has ever been recalled in the history of the united states as early as 1807 senate committee examining the question of the senates duty and broad authority to expel member noted that such duty devolves to the senate not only becau of the express constitutional grant of authority but also as practical matter because the constitution does not allow for recall of elected members of congress by the people or the state the committee noted specifically that the constitution had set out numerous provisions qualifications and requireme nts for members of congre ss to prevent conflicts of interest and to assure certain degree of fealty to constituents but did not give members constituency the author ity to recall such memberhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30016crs6 23 ii hinds precedents supra at 1264 p 818 senator john quincy adams reporting

293 1988the spirit of the constitution is perh aps in respect more remarkable than in the solicitude which it has ma nifested to secure the purity of the legislature by that of the elements of its composition yet in the midst of all this anxious providence of legislative virtue it has not authorized the constituent body to recall in any case its representative23 the recall of united states senators or representatives had been considered during the time of the drafting of the fe deral constitution but recall provisions were rejected and were not included in the final version of the constitution sent to the states for ratification24 the ratifying process in the states evidences debate over this lack of inclusion of recall provision lu ther martin of maryland for example in an address delivered to the maryland legi slature criticized th proposed constitution because the members of congress are to pay themselves out of the treasury of the united states and are not liable to be r ecalled during the period for which they are chosen25 in new york an amendment was defeated in the 1788 ratifying convention which would have allowed the state legislatur to recall their senators and elect others in their stead26 in the ratifying debates in virginia george mason commented the senators are chosen for six years they are not recallable for those six years and are reeligible at the end of the six years they cannot be recalled in all that time for any misconduct27 this history indicates an understanding of the framers and ratifiers of the constitution that right or power to recall senator or representative from the united states congress exis ted under the c onstitution as ratified as noted by an academic authority on the mechanisms of direct democracy the constitutional convention of 1787 considered but eventually rejected resolutions calling for this same type of recall recall of senators by the state legislatures as provided in the articles of confederation in the end the idea of placing recall provision in the c onstitution died for lack of support athttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30016crs7 28 thomas cronin direct democracy the politics of initiative referendum and

1995 cook v gralike 531 us 510 continuedleast from those participating in the ratif ying conventions the framers and the ratifiers were consciously seeking to remedy what they viewed as the defects of the articles of confederation and some of their state constitutions and for many of them this meant retreating from an excess of democracy28 another constitutional scholar explained that the formation of the united states government as distinct sovereign entity was unlike the former confederation and the continental congress created by the articles of confederation where the colonial legislatures selected the congressmen for the statecolony and could instruct and recall them such as sovereign state could do with its ambassador to another country or to multinational entity once the union was formed in 1788 upon the ratification by the 9th state it became clear that members of congress were longer merely ambassadors from states coming together by treaty or confederation and who thus could be recalled by their c onstituent tities but rather were new officers of the newly formed national gove rnment that is officers of the united states29 judicial decisions supreme court jurisprudence although the supreme court has not needed to directly address the subject of recall of members of congress other judicial decisions indicate that the right to remove member of congress before the expiration of his or her constitutionally established term of office is one which resides within each house of congress as expressly delegated in the expulsion clause of the united states constitution and not in the entire congress as whole through the adoption of legislation nor in the st ate legislatures through the enactment of recall provisions in burton v united states 30 the supreme court ruled that provision of federal law whic h on its face purported to make one convicted of bribery ineligible to be united states senator could not act as forfeiture of senators office since the only way to remove member under the constitution was by the senate exercising its aut hority over its own members the seat into which he was originally inducted as senator from kansas could only become vacant by his death or by expiration of his term of office or by some direct action on the part of the sena in the exercise of its constitutional powers31 the concept that the states do not indi vidually possess the authority to change the terms or qualifications for federal officers agreed upon by the states in the united states constitution has been confirmed by the supreme court in modern case law32httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30016crs8 32 continued 2001 33 us term limits inc 514 us at 832835 34 us term limits inc 514 us at 800802 the court stated as we have frequently noted the states

article i 4 cl 1 is not broad authority for an individual state to substantively change the qualifications length or numbe r of terms of federal officials established within the united states constitution33 the court in us terms limits inc noted that the states do retain significant sovereign authority in many areas but that the states transferred and delegated cer tain powers and authority to the national government within the instrument creating that entity the constitution with respect to powers in relation to the federal national govern ment and any powers deriving exclusively from and because of the existence of that national government the states must look to the united states constitution for grants or delegation of authority to them34 tenth amendment as to the 10th amendment and the reserved authority of the states the united states supreme court has clearly explained that determining qualifications and terms for federal offices created within the united states constitution were not part of the original powers of sovereignty that the tenth amendment reserved to the states and thus whatever authority states have over the terms qualifications and elections of federal officers must be delegated authority from the constitution35 such authority could not be reserved power of the states since the states could not reserve power it did not have as part of its original sovereign authority that is power relative to something which did not exist before its creation in the constitution petitioners tenth amendment argument misconceives the nature of the right at issue because that amendment could only reserve that which existed before as justice story recognized the stat can exercise powers whatsoever which exclusively spring out of the exis tence of the national government which the constitution does not delegate to them state can say that is has reserved what it never possessed 1 story 62736 reemphasizing this meaning of the nth

in that national government representatives owe primary allegiance not to the people of state but to the people of the nation as justice story observed each member of congress is an office r of the union deriving his powers and qualifications from the constitution and neither created by dependent upon not controllable by the states 1 story 627 represen tatives and senators are as much officers of the entire union as is the president38 the united states constitution establishes the exclusive qualifications for congressional office sets the specific length of terms for members of the house and for senators and expressly delegates to each house of congress the authority to judge the elections and qualifications of and to discipline and to remove its own members39 these provisions of the united states constitution with respect to federal officials have supremacy over st ate laws and provisions and state laws in conflict with such constitutiona l provisions have been found by the courts in the past to be invalid40 although the language of some state recall laws might be broad enough to include members of congress or might even explicitly include federal officers it does not appear under existing pr ecedents and standards expressed by the supreme court that such statutes could be effective in altering the constitutionally established term of office of member of the united

court has provided guidance to administrative bodies called upon to perform their ministerial duties under circumstances raising doubts as to the constitutional validity of the result accordingly in the event petitions for the reca ll of united states senator are presented to the elections board you should proceed to ca rry put your responsibilities unless and until directed otherwise by court of lawadministrative and judicial decisions on state recall laws i n oregon in 1935 the state attorney general ruled that the states recall provisions could not apply to member of congress w ho is not actually st ate official but who holds his office pursuant to the united states constitution and is federal constitutional officer the opinion found that such recall provisions would interfere with the congresss exclusive constitutional authority over the elections and qualifications of its own members noting that the jurisdiction to determine the right of representative in congress to seat is vested exclusively in the house of representatives and representative in congress is not subject to recall by the legal voters of the state or dist rict from which he was elected42 in interpreting state recall statute the attorney general of wisconsin did note in an opinion on may 3 1979 that an administrative agency the state election board upon presentation of valid petition to recall member of congress under the wisconsin constitution had authority in itself to adjudicate and reject such petition without ruling from court43 when such matters have on rare occasions reached the courts however the courts have thus far found that state recall laws are ineffective to override and substitute for the provisions of the united states constitution concerning the terms of and removal of federal officials such as members of congress fe deral court in 1967 for example dismissed suit which attempted to compel the idaho secretary of state to accept petitions recalling

judicial ruling the court found that senators are not subject to state recall statutes and that such state provision is inconsistent with the provisions of the united states constitution44 similarly state court in michigan dismissed petition effo rt to recall member of congress under that states recall statute although an administrative entity d earlier approved the language of the recall petition and despite the express langua ge of the state law the court granted an injunction against the tinuation of the recall effort finding that pursuant to the text of article i of the united states constitution and by operation of the supremacy clause of the united stat constitution the recall provisions under michigan law are ineffective to recall member of congress45 constitutional amendm ent pro and for recall provision to be enforceable against member of congress it would appear that constitutional amendment woul d need to be adopted by the requisite number of states authorizing such recall procedure in the united states constitution although there has been so call for constitutional amendment authorizing national referenda or initia tives there has not been significant movement for nati onal recall provision supporters of recall provisions see this m echanism as device to assure regular and close oversight of elected public officials and to make elected officials more continuously rather than periodically re sponsible and responsive to the will and desires of the electorate with recall procedures available it is argued there is need for the electorate to tolerate an incompetent corrupt andor unresponsive official until that officials term is over those who oppose recall note that r ecall petitions generally need only relatively small minority of the electorate to force recall election of an official with the threat of recall election ever present it is argued that an official may be deterred from and penalized for taking strong and clear political positions that could offend even small but vociferous and ac tive political group it is contended that such small special interest or single issue groups might effectively stymie an official by constantly occupying the official with the potential need to campaign and run in recall election it is also argued that complex governmental programs and policies may often need to f unction and to be evaluated in the long run over time but with the threat of immediate recall memb ers may be further deterred in supporting longterm plans and programs for the count ry which may not bring immediate short term benefits to constituents
