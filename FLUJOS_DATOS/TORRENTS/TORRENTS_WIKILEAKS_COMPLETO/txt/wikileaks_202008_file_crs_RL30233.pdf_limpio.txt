december 1997 in kyoto japan the united states would be required to reduce emissions f carbon dioxi co and other greenhouse gases by 7 from their 1990 or 19952 levels depending on the gas however the kyoto protocol places bindin g greenhouse gas restrictions on developing countries such as ch ina and india whose co emissions are projected to grow dramatically2 concerns have arisen in the united states that witho ut binding agreement from china india and other developing countries the responsibility for realizin g worldwide greenhouse gas reduction goals would fall entirely on industrialize d countries while developing countries continue to increase their emissions befor completion of the kyoto protocol the us senate passed resolution sres 98 urging that the united states not become party to the treaty if it did not includ specified commitments by developing countries to limit or reduce their greenhous gas emissions the clinton administration has stated it will not send the protocol to the senate for consideration u ntil meaningful participation by developing countries is achieved developing countries are being encouraged to make voluntar commitments to limit greenhouse gas emissions economists anticipate many asian developing countries will continue t experience rapid economic growth i n the years ahead that will increase their demand for electric power with coal likely to be major energy source to support tha t growth forecasts show world coal demand growing nearly 70 between 1995 and 2020 with china and india accounting for 85 of that increase coal is majo r source of co emissions china one of the worlds fastest growing economies is 2 on track to become the world leader in co emissions within 20 years and is already2 the world leader in co emissions from coal however to date china and india have 2 not made any voluntary commitments to limit co emissions2 china is expected to rely on coal to power much of its future developmen t because of its abundant domestic reserves and low cost and because the nation s infrastructu re is better developed at this time for coal than for other energy sources china stresses its right to pursue this course of development fostering econ omic growth while curtailing co emissions from fossil fuels is2 one of the greatest dilemmas facing attempts to encourage thirdworld participation in greenhouse gas

coal use in china and other asian developing countries introduction coal use in asia is on rapid upward trend particularly in china this trend1 has special relevance to issues related to global climate change because the burning of coal currently accounts for some onethird of all carbon dioxide co emissions2 worldwide and co accounts for 85 of all greenhouse gas emissions increasing 2 concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may affect global climat systems2 to address the global climate change issue the third conference of the parties cop3 of the united nations framework convention on climate chang unfccc convened in december 1997 in kyoto japan parties to the resultin g protocol agreed to legally binding reductions in emiss ions of the six major greenhouse gases for the developed count ries listed in annex i of the unfccc and referred to3 as annex i countries each annex i country negotiated specific emissions reduction commitment listed in annex b to be

difficulty in engaging developing countries in limiting greenhouse gas emissions is the dependence of these countries on fos sil fuels especially coal for their economic development chinas energy

white paper on environment issued by the peoples republic of china prc in 1996 china attaches equ importance to energy conservation and the growth of the energy industry china has already enacted many laws n environme ntal protection including the law on the prevention of air pollution under the national environmental protection agency china has established thre major policies for environmental protection 1 putting prevention first an d combining control technology with prevention 2 making t he polluter responsible for treatment of po llution and 3 intensifying environmental management however24 it is unclear as to what extent t hese laws are enforced and whether those policies will have significant effect on chinas projected co emissions from coal2 according to united nations development progra m undp report one view is that china is substantially improving its energy efficiency and has already cut it s energy consumption per unit of output in half with improved technology since 1980 also noted was that chinas emissions growth rate was well bel ow its per capita gross national p roduct gnp growth rate see table 4 statistic considered by some to indicate that china is already participating meaningfully in reducing its greenhouse gas emissions from previous trends in other words china is well below where it25 would have been had energy efficiency measures been put

rise substantially because of the current electric generating capacity designed for coal huge reserve base and c oal production capacity already in place natural gas rises at faster rate than coal but has much lower starting point only in the very long term will natural gas begin to make dent in the energy supply picture and co 2 emissions because of the hundreds of billions of dollars of infrastructure project s needed estimates of worldwide carbon missions show most of the emissions growth is taking place in china and india largely because of the projected growth in coa l consumption without the kyoto protoc ol in place the developing world as whole will emit about the same amo unt of carbon as the developed world by the year 2010 carbon emissions from developing countries should surpass those from th industrialized world by the year 2020 the asian coal outlook raises questions about global climate change policy if the emissi ons issue is not sufficiently addressed in
