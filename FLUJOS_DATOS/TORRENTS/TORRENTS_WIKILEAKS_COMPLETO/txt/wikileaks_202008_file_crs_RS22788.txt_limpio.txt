code rs22788 january 11 2008 regulation of vehicle greenhouse gas emissions state and federal standards brent d yacobucci specialist in energy and environmental policy resources science and industry division summary california is seeking under the clean air act authority to establish greenhouse httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22788 gas ghg emissions standards for passenger vehicles the standards would require 30 reduction in permile ghg from 2002 levels by 2016 to implement the standards the state must secure waiver from the environmental protection agency epa in december 2007 the epa administrator announced that the agency would deny californias waiver request in part because he argues new federal fuel economy standards established in the 2007 energy bill pl 110140 will be more stringent than the california program california is challenging the agencys denial and its rationale this report discusses the federal corporate average fuel economy cafe standards including tighter standards enacted under pl 110140 and compares them with the ghg standards under californias law it also identifies some factors that would have bearing on the relative stringency of cafe and the california program background in 2002 the state of california enacted ab1493 requiring greenhouse gas ghg emissions reductions for new passenger vehicles starting in model year my 2009 in 2004 the california air resources board carb finalized regulations requiring annual reductions in average ghg emissions for new vehicles between my2009 and my2016 ultimately this law requires 30 reduction in average permile emissions from my2002 levels by my2016 as of january 2008 16 other states have adopted or announced their intention to adopt californias standards1 passenger vehicles are key source for ghg emissions from mobile sources in the united states transportation accounts for roughly one third of all us carbon dioxide co2 emissions passenger vehicles alone represent roughly 60 of transportation emissions or roughly 20 of total us co2 emissions because passenger vehicles play 1 pew center on global climate change states poised to adopt california vehicle ghg standards updated december 2007 for more information on state actions on ghgs see crs report rl33812 climate change action by states to address greenhouse gas emissions crs2 such significant role in us ghg emissions there is growing interest in reducing their emissions as part of strategy to address climate change concerns in general there are three ways to reduce vehicle ghg emissions 1 reduce vehicle miles traveled through strategies such as carpooling transit or teleworking 2 reduce vehicle permile fuel consumption through improved fuel economy and permile non carbon emissions eg fluorinated gas emissions from air conditioner systems through improvements in vehicle systems and 3 convert to lowercarbon transportation fuels therefore any program to reduce ghg emissions will likely raise fuel economy likewise any program to increase fuel economy will lower ghg emissions states do not have the authority to set fuel economy standards that authority rests solely with the federal government which sets federal corporate average fuel economy cafe standards under the energy policy and conservation act pl 94163 however critics of the proposed standards argue that if the reductions finalized by carb are placed into effect these standards will largely be met through increases in vehicle fuel economy in other words in this view californias proposal to impose more stringent standards on vehicle emissions is an implicit if not explicit fuel economy standard httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22788 while states do not have authority to regulate fuel economy the clean air act grants california solely the authority to set vehicle pollutant emissions standards subject to the state filing petition with the environmental protection agency epa and being granted waiver by that agency any stateestablished standards must be at least as stringent as the federal standards and must be needed to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions2 while only california can petition for waiver other states may adopt any california standards that are put into place following the granting of the waiver however on december 19 2007 epa administrator stephen johnson sent letter to california governor arnold schwarzenegger informing him that epa would deny californias waiver request3 without this waiver californias program cannot be implemented epas rationale appears to consist of two arguments first california has not shown that its regulations are needed to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions as required by the clean air act second the administration and congress are addressing climate change through national standards these explanations have been deemed unsatisfactory by california officials as result on january 2 2008 california along with 15 other states filed suit against epa in the us court of appeals 9th circuit challenging epas rejection of the petition federal cafe standards the energy policy and conservation act epca established cafe standards for passenger cars for my1978 the cafe standards called 2 for more information on the clean air act waiver process see crs report rl34099 californias waiver request to control greenhouse gases under the clean air act 3 epa administrator stephen l johnson letter to the honorable arnold schwarzenegger governor of the state of california december 19 2007 it should be noted that there are details in the letter of how the number of 338 mpg was calculated crs3 for an eventual doubling in new car fleet fuel economy by 19854 epca also granted the department of transportation dot the authority to establish cafe standards for other classes of vehicles including lightduty trucks5 dot first established cafe standards for light trucks in my1979 for passenger cars the current standard is 275 mpg for light trucks the standard was 222 mpg for my2007 on april 6 2006 dot issued additional rules to further increase light truck fuel economy through my2011 although that rule was recently sent back to dot in november 2007 the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit ruled that the agency had not conducted sufficiently rigorous analysis to measure whether the standards in the final rule would have beneficial effect in improving environmental quality through reduction of ghg emissions on december 19 2007 president bush signed the energy independence and security act of 2007 pl 110140 hr 6 among other provisions title i of the law requires an increase in passenger car and light truck fuel economy standards to combined average of 35 mpg in 2020 up from roughly 25 mpg today the law requires dot to set interim standards between my2011 and my2019 in order to reach the 2020 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22788 goal but does not specify schedule for cafe increases the american council for an energy efficient economy aceee estimates that the cafe provisions in pl 110140 will save roughly 24 million barrels of oil per day in 2020 further aceee estimates that the standards could reduce annual co2 emissions by 47 million metric tons mmt annually by 2020 and 404 mmt annually by 20306 while the new law requires an umbrella average of 35 mpg for cars and light trucks the law requires separate standards for these classes it is expected that the passenger car standard will be significantly higher than the light truck standard as previously noted one of the arguments advanced by epa administrator johnson in denying californias request was that the restructuring of cafe in pl 110140 will result in more stringent program than the proposed california program number of considerations factor into any analysis of the agencys contention some of the major ones are discussed below californias vehicle greenhouse gas rule californias rule is not an explicit fuel economy standard but instead limits total vehicle permile ghg emissions these include co2 emissions from combustion as well as tailpipe methane emissions and hydrofluorocarbon hfc emissions from air conditioning systems however since the majority of vehicle emissions are co2 emissions from fuel combustion it is expected that most of the reductions needed to meet the california standards will come through reductions in permile fuel consumption ie increases in vehicle fuel economy other allowable strategies include credits for the sale of alternative fuel and flexible fuel vehicles if it can be demonstrated that these vehicles will be operated on alternative fuels 4 for more information on the cafe program see crs report rl33413 automobile and light truck fuel economy the cafe standards 5 light trucks include pickups vans and sport utility vehicles suvs 6 american council for an energyefficient economy energy bill savings estimates as passed by the senate december 14 2007 available at httpwwwaceeeorgenergynational energybillsavings1214pdf accessed january 7 2008 crs4 the standards are separated into two classes the first is passenger cars pc and lighter light duty trucks ldt17 the second is heavier light duty trucks ldt28 unlike the new cafe standard there is umbrella standard for the california program therefore if more vehicles in the pcldt1 class are sold in california the fleet average will be higher if fewer of these vehicles are sold the average will be lower9 the state of california estimates that by 2016 their standards will save roughly 17 mmt of co2 annually by 2016 and that the program along with anticipated standards for my2017 through my2020 will save 33 mmt annually by 202010 further the state estimates that the required ghg reductions are equivalent to an average fuel economy of 366 mpg for new vehicles in the state11 however in denying californias waiver request epa estimated that californias standards would result in an 338 mpg average in california and the other states looking to adopt californias standards one of the key requirements under the clean air act to allow california to set its own standards is that the standards be at least as stringent as the federal standards according to california they have met this requirement epa contends they have not based on its estimate of fuel economy under the california program california estimates httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22788 that the cafe program would result in an average fuel economy in the state of 357 mpg by 2020 and would save total of roughly 8 mmt annually within the state by 2016 and roughly 19 mmt by 202012 as compared to 17 mmt and 33 mmt respectively under the california program epa has yet to publish estimates of the anticipated ghg savings from new cafe standards comparison of cafe and californias program the california program and the federal cafe program regulate two different although overlapping factors the cafe program requires that automakers achieve specific fuel economy targets while the california program requires automakers to achieve specific reductions in vehicle ghg emissions see table 1 two key questions must be addressed in comparing the federal cafe program with the california program the first is the mix of vehicles covered by the programs the cafe standards under pl 110140 require an umbrella standard of 35 mpg by 2020 the law also requires separate standards for passenger cars and light trucks but leaves these standards to the discretion of the secretary of transportation it is expected that the passenger car standard will be more stringent than the light truck standard therefore state whose new vehicle fleet mirrors the national average will have average fuel economy roughly equivalent to the cafe standard state that buys more light trucks will likely have lower average fuel economy state that buys more passenger cars will likely have 7 ldt1 lightduty trucks up to 3750 pounds gross vehicle weight gvw 8 ldt2 lightduty trucks above 3750 pounds gvw 9 under the federal program regardless of the fleet mix the combined average must be 35 mpg 10 california air resources board carb comparison of greenhouse gas reductions under cafe standards and arb regulations adopted pursuant to ab1493 january 2 2008 pp 89 11 ibid p 6 12 ibid p 10 crs5 higher average fuel economy california estimates that passenger cars and lighter light trucks represent roughly 70 of new vehicles in the state as opposed to roughly 50 nationwide the california program maintains separate standards for slightly different set of vehicles than the federal program but has umbrella standard table 1 comparison of cafe under pl 110140 and californias vehicle greenhouse gas program program cafe under pl californias vehicle ghg 110140 program regulated measure fuel economy mpg greenhouse gases gmi vehicle classes passenger cars passenger cars and lighter light trucks light trucks ldt1 heavier light trucks ldt2 first year of regulation my2011 my2009 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22788 interim standards required yes yes interim standards specified yes year of full implementation my2020 my2016 second key question in comparing the two programs is their timing assuming californias estimates of the fuel economy resulting from its ghg program are accurate13 then it seems unlikely that federal cafe standards would exceed the fuel economy increases expected from californias program figure 1 as was stated above the federal standards do not start to phase in until my2011 while the california standards begin two years earlier second while the california program explicitly defines interim standards with most of the increase required in first four years my2009my2012 pl 110140 does not specify what the interim federal standards should be only that there must be interim standards assuming carbs analysis is accurate californias program will require in 2016 higher fuel economy than required by the federal program four years later future actions in addition to the above established programs future actions will likely affect the interactions between californias vehicle ghg program and federal programs on september 27 2006 governor schwarzenegger signed ab32 this law commits california to additional ghg reductions beyond those required under ab1493 carb has announced proposed vehicle standards that would apply for my2017 through my2020 if promulgated these standards would be more stringent than those under the current california program14 however like the standards under ab1493 they would also require an epa waiver from the clean air act consequently the result of the 13 as of january 8 2008 epa has yet to publish the technical analysis supporting the agencys decision to deny the californias waiver petition 14 california estimates that the proposed standards would be equivalent to 439 mpg in 2020 carb op cit p 6 crs6 current challenge to the epa denial of californias waiver request will likely affect the outcome of

increase cafe 2 on april 2 2007 in the case massachusetts v epa the us supreme court found that epa has the authority to regulate ghgs from new motor vehicles and the responsibility to do so unless epa finds that ghgs do not endanger public health and welfare16 assuming that epa concludes that new standards are necessary the agency may issue its own vehicle ghg standards in the future however executive order 13432 requires coordination among agencies with respect to vehicle ghg emissions regulation17 therefore it seems likely that any future action by epa will be taken in coordination with dot on new standards 15 for example it is possible that epa could find that the new standards are more stringent than the cafe standards and thus grant california the waiver on the other hand epa could maintain that compelling need for the standards exist at the state level and that fuel economy and vehicle ghg emissions should continue to be regulated at the federal level 16 see crs report
