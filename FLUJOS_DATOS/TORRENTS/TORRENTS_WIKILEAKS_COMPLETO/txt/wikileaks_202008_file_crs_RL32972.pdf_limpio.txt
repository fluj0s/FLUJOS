repetitive loss problem summary historically flooding has been the most common natural disaster in the united states costing more in property damages than any other natural disaster in response to the trend of building homes and busine sses in floodprone areas and the increasing cost of damages caused by floods cong ress created the national flood insurance program nfip in 1968 the object was to reduce future flood losses through flood hazard identification floodplain management ie land use controls and building codes and insurance protection nfip c overage is available to all owners and occupants of insurable property in participating community two flood insurancerelated polic issues stand out in the 109th congress the first issue is the high and continuing cost of paying for repetitively flooded properties and clarifying c ongressional intent with resp ect to restoring flood victims to preflood conditions the problem with repetitive loss proper ties rlps is that the vast majority of these older genera lly lesssafe propertie s were grandfathered into the nfip when the program was create d and these properties have been repaired multiple times with subsidized flood insu rance claim payments owners of rlps pay less than the full actuarial risk rates congress started looking at the rlp problem and other matters several years before th national flood insurance reform act of 1 994 the fl ood mitigation assistance fma program was authorized as section 1266 in 1994 and has rgely been used to mitigate rlps the bunningbereuterblumenauer flood insura nce reform act of

priority involving flood hazard identification the purchase of federallysubsidized flood insurance by homeowners renters and bus iness owners and state and local landuse controls designed to minimize flood loss and guide development away from flood prone areas in 1968 through enactment of the national flood insura nce act4 congress established comprehensive ri sk management prog ram to 1 reduce

flood controls on rivers nd shorelines eg dams and levees and postdisaster assistance for flood victims by the 1950s however it had become clear to congress that these approaches left much to be desired public works we re not always effective in the long run while private construction c ontinued in vulnerable areas legislative relief payments were problematic because they were unpred ictable and necessitate d bargaining after each major natural disast er prefunding via insurance began to look like an attractive alternative to flood control or federal disaster assistance flood insurance coverage was virtually vailable from the private insurance markets however because insurers could not profitably sell cove rage at an affordable price due to the catastrophic nature of flooding and insurers inability to develop actuarial rates that reflected the flood hazard risk7 the earliest effort to form ulate viable federal fl ood insurance program dates back to 1951 when president truman reque sted congressional ppropriations for national system of flood disaster insurance8 congress did not approve that request subsequently however in 1955 and 1956 the senate committee on banking and currency undertook an extensive study of the feasibility of creatin g federal disaster insurance program9 on the basis of that study congress passed the federal flood insurance act of 195610 to establish fiveyear 3 b illion federal flood insurance and reinsurance program to be administered by the housing and home finance agency the federal flood indemnity administrati on was created within the agency to perform the tasks authorized in the 1956 act the 1956 act called for subsidized insurance rates and policies marketed by pr ivate insurance companies this first flood insurance program

submitted presidential special task force report to the speaker of the house of re presentatives that examined ways the federal government could decrease flood losses without spending heavily on flood controls like the hud study published that same month the task force report concluded that national program of flood insurance should be implemente d and an integrated program be established to mitigate losses the report warned however that an insurance program could aggravate rather than reduce development of the nation s floodplains and estimated that subsidies for existing highrisk properties would be required for approximately 25 years see communication from the president of the united states transmittal of report by the task force on federal flood control policy unified

opriate any funds11 consequently the agency ceased to exist congressional concerns focused on the lack of technical study to determine the costs of starting federal program for flood insurance12 series of natural disasters in the early to mid1960s triggered renewed interest in congress to create comprehens ive system of federal disaster insurance that interest began to move forward when congress enacted the southeast hurricane disaster relief act of 196513 primarily because of hurricane betsy and other hurricanes that devastated the south in 1963 and 1964 and heavy flooding on the upper mississi ppi river in 1965 section 5 of that act directed the secretary of housing and urban development hud to undertake ninemonth study of the feasibility of alternative met hods for providing assistance to those suffering property losses in floods and ot her natural disasters 1966 hud feasibility study of flood insurance program entitled insurance and other programs for fi nancial assistance to flood victims was submitted by president lyndon johnson to the sena committee on banking and currency14 the study concluded that flood insurance was both feasible and could promote the public interest although the rates in certain floodprone areas could be extremely high15 after an analysis of alternative wa ys of helping flood victims the hud study recommended providing fede ral subsidy to existing occupants in highrisk flood areas as way to discourage further velopment in hazardprone areas the hud study also suggested that the subsidy not be given to persons who proposed to construct new homes in areas subjected to flood hazard risks in essence once actuarial rates had been determined for given area new flood insurance coverage could be provided unless the community dopted and enforced permanent landuse control ordinances according to the study in addition the study asserted that subsidies to some existing occupants of floodprone areas should be viewed as

designed to reduce the exposure to flood hazard risks16 the recommendations from the hud feasib ility study led congress to pass the national flood insurance act of 196817 which authorized the creation of the national flood insurance program nfip the nfip incorporated most of the recommendations of the 1966 hud feasibility st udy it was expected that managing flood hazard risk through insurance woul d greatly reduce the reliance on federal disaster relief assistance property and business owners would in effect prefund their own floodrelated property losses ex isting buildings in flood risk areas would receive subsidies on premiums because thes structures were built before the flood risk were known and identified on flood insu rance rate maps owners of structures built in floodprone areas on or after the ffective date of the initial flood insurance rate maps firm or after december 31 1974 whichever was late r would have to pay full actuarial rates the program also called for the development of flood hazard maps to identify flood risk areas and the requirement that local communities voluntarily adopt and enforce floodplain management ordinances that met or exceeded minimum nfip standards since its creation in 1968 the laws nd regulations governing the nfips implementation have undergone many changes majo r revisions were enacted in 1973 1977 1994 and

from the adjustment processing and settlement of hurricane isabel claims the cost of paying rlp claims has placed financial strain on the program from community standpoint residents liv are disrupted and may be threatened by repeated flooding on the other hand owners of rlps view nfip payments as benefit they have purchased that enables them to remain in their homes for over decade fema has actively pursued va riety of mitigation st rategies to reduce floodrelated losses the nfip had program known as section 1362 under which funds were made available to buy repetitively flood insu red properties and transfer the land to communities critics however claimed it was cumbersome having the federal government buy the land congress eventually repealed the section 1362 program and replaced it in 1994 with the flood mitigation assistance fma program that was originally aut horized at 20 million per year transferred from the national flood insurance fund n fif the funds are taken from the income associated with the flood policy serv ice fees also over the years fema has encouraged states and communities to use its other mitigation programs for rlps including the postdisaster hazard m

2008 augment the fma program establish fiveyear pilot program through fy2009 for reducing severe rlps and make some programmatic changes to the nfip intended to address administrative problems which came to light following hurricane isabel in september 2003 floods and insurance coverage of the two types of floods riverine or inland stream flooding and coastal flooding riverine floods typically cause th highest economic losses on the other hand coastal floods often cause greater loss of life the great flood of 1993 that occurred along the missouri and upper missi ssippi river basins is considered the most costly and devastating flood to rava ge the united states its size and impact surpassed the 1927 flood disaster noted earlier in most categories number of record river levels the number of persons disp laced amount of crop and property damage and duration tragic combination of unique extreme weather and hydrologic conditions led to the flood of 1993 flooding is not confined to just fe w geographic areas almost every region of the country is subject to flooding some of the principal econo mic consequences of flooding are 1 the cost of emerge ncy services borne by state and local governments 2 reductions in government revenue due to bus iness interruption or business destruction sales taxes foreg one and lower propert tax revenues 3 dollar value of floodrelated deaths bodily injury and mental anguish suffered by victims and 4 postdisaster outlays by the federal government such as loans and direct financial assistance to individuals for emergenc housing food and clothinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32972crs6 21 it is because flooding is so predictable along many bodies of water that made private insurers avoid coverage 22 for more information on flood insurance policy and claim statistics see data provided by fema available at httpwwwfemagovnfippcstatshtm visited on april 20 2005 property damage caused by genera l condition of flooding is explicitly excluded under most homeowner insurance policies sold in the private sector21 property insurance companies insist th at flood insurance is not commercially feasible as general rule property insurance markets will provide coverage capacity when insurers are confident that they can identify the risk and set insurance rates that cover expected losses insurers generally lack the ability to spread flood hazard risk sufficiently to safeguard th eir assets against catastrophic flood losses moreover only people living in flood hazard areas would be expected to purchase flood insurance socalled dverse selection and thes people would have frequent claims making the coverage prohibitivel expensive and hence not marketable private insurance companies have been ble or unwilling to pr efund and diversify flood risks through insurance reinsu rance agreements or securitization national flood insurance program in 1968 congress created the nfip in res ponse to the trend of development and redevelopment in floodprone areas the increasing damages caused by floods and rising cost of taxpayer funded disaster re lief for flood victims today the nfip is among the nations largest domestic liabilities along with the social security system and federal health programs such as dicare and medicaid the nfip involves partnership among fema specialists and c ontractors thousands of insurance agents and claims adjusters private insurance companies floodplain managers and other public officials lenders and real estate agents federal flood insurance is currently offered to homeowner renters and busin ess owners in over 20000 participating communities that adopt and enforce fl oodplain management regulations which conform to nfip standards appendix shows that by the end of the fy2004 almost five

with jurisdiction over land use adopt administer and enfor ce floodplain development regulations the nfip does not operate on the trad itional insurance definition of fiscal solvency rather it operates under statut ory mandate that pr emiums on prefirm structures ie structures built before the issuance of firm or before 1975 whichever is later must be reasonable and if n ecessary be subsidized the subsidy is provided by charging premium rates discounted from full actuarial rates in order to make up the subsidized premium shortfall nfip has established rating methodology consisting of target level of premium income for the program as whole that is at least sufficient to cover expenses and losses relative to what fema calls the average historical loss year the premium level generated to cover the average historical loss year must accommodate the combined effect of the portion of nfip business paying less than full risk premiums and the portion of the business paying full risk premiums in the event that premium and investment income are inadequate in given year the nfip can exercise its statutory authority to borrow up to 15 billion from the us treasury to cover losses borrowed funds must be repaid with interest identification and mapping of special hazard areas the first step in assessing communitys flood hazards is identifying and mapping the special flood hazard areas23 flood maps provide the basis for establishing floodplain management ordina nces ie building standards setting insurance rates and identifying propertie s whose owners are required to purchase flood insurance fema issues firms that delineate areas within the 100year flood boundary called special flood hazard areas sfha nd flood insurance risk rate zones the sfha is based on nfips 1annual chan ce flood standard commonly called the 100 year flood 100year flood is calculation of the maximum stream discharge or coastal storm surge and resu ltant level of flood water that has one chance in 100 of occurring in any given year the occurrence of flood of this magnitude is independent of all other floods indeed 100year flood may occur more than once in given year and even number of times in 10 or 20 year period fema uses statistical methods or hydrol ogic calculations to determine the 100year stream flow or coastal stor m height based upon stream ga uge records of river flows storm tides and rainfall that informati on is related to topog raphic maps and field surveys using hydraulic analysis to then determine the predicted elevation of floodwaters based on the expected flood elevation for 100year flood the nfip then delineates the area of inundation ie sfha relative to eleva tion above sea level these sfhas receive particular in surance risk zone designation httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32972crs8 24 for more information on fema map modernization program see crs report rl31691 femas flood map modernization initiative by wayne morrisseyfirms also serve as guiding documents for communities as they regulate development in floodplains and for lenders that enforce mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements insurance companie s and agents use the firms as the source of risk information for underwriting and ra ting applications for flood insurance under the nfip accuracy of flood maps an important policy issue for state and local officials insurers mortgage lenders nd property owners is that many flood maps have not been updated with detailed topography or mo re accurate methodologies or reflect real estate growth growth tends to increase runoff and alter drainage patterns on floodplains and thus increase flood hazard risk an inaccurate flood map could result in flood damages to uninsured propertie s and larger than expected expenditures of federal disaster assistance not all structures that lie within the same flood zone on firm are subject to the same risk the flood risk depends on factors such as how the home is built elevation and drainage there are also instances where individual properties are inadvertently shown on sfha the nfip has made it possible through flood zone correction process for homeowners to remove their homes from the sfha removing the mandatory flood in surance purchase requirement flood map modernization in may 1997 fema announced flood map modernization initiative to update revise and conve rt over 100000 paper flood maps to new maps in digital electronic format that are more accurate more accessible and easier to keep current24 some floodplain management experts agree that the updated flood hazard maps may have financial implications fo r homeowners and property developers in terms of insu rance and construction costs it is not certain however whether the map modernization process will increase or decrease the number of properties in the flood zones or whether insurance pre miums will rise or fall when the maps are updated in january 1999 fema requested that c ongress authorize the agency to charge transaction fee of 15 for each federally insured mortgage to fund the nfips map modernization program congress did not approve the request instead it authorized 5 million to begin updating flood maps congre ss also instructed fema to evaluate alternative ways to fund the cost of mode rnizing flood maps the options developed by fema included mapuser fee an increase in the fee charged for each flood insurance policy supplemental appropria tions and use of the nfips borrowing authority in fiscal year 2003 congre ss authorized 150 million in general funds for map

based on outdated estimates rather than planning tool more important th ey insist that the mhips implication that fema can map all communities in the nati on with the current funding levels is erroneous instead they argue that policym akers and stakeholders need to consider the total scope of the longterm effort to map the nations floodplains what priorities will be addressed in the initia

emergency program was established in 1969 as the initia l phase of commun itys participation during which insurable structures are elig ible for limited amounts of crosssubsidized insurance before the effective date of the issuance of the communitys firm27 communities in the emergency program phase are not required to meet the nfipsminimum floodplain requirements community is eligible for the regular program when firm has been completed and the community adopts th nfips minimum floodplain management standards in its local ordinances firms become the official zone designation that serves as the guiding document for communities developing landuse plans and for lenders in enforcing mandatory flood insuran ce purchase requirements in the regular program the nfip authorizes the sale of additional flood insurance that is actuarially determined to reflect the probability of fl ood damages insurance on newly constructed buildings or substantially impr oved structures must be based on actuarial rates if construction work be gins after the area is identified as having special flood hazardshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32972crs10 28 individual properties can be precluded fro m purchase of flood insurance under what is called section 1316 it is process by which communities and states can report to fema that an individual property is in violation of statelocal floodplain management requirements and that efforts to get the property owner to bring the property into compliance have failed fema then puts the property on master list if the property owner or future property owner buys policy at some point it gets iden tified and the nfip policy is rescinded the idea is that recalcitrant owner may refuse to comply with floodplain ordinances but eventually the owner will find it hard to sell if flood insurance is not availablepolicy issuance and claims adjusting unlike the practice in private insurance markets the nfip accepts all insurance applicants and is not selective in evalua ting individual applicants for flood insurance coverage there is individual risk anal ysis to determine the likelihood of future loss and individual property loss experi ence is not used as

replacement cost value rcv losses and appeals 6 calculating repair and replacement costs by using unrealistic construction pricing guidelines that do not reflect the actual costs of repair and renovation 7 femas failure to advise policyholde rs about the extended limit for filing an insurance claim and pressuring flood vi ctims to accept the wyo companys claim estimate with an implicit threat of not r eceiving insurance benefits under the policy meanwhile congress has taken some steps to address this issue with the enactment of the bunningbereuterblume nauer flood insurance reform

the single largest family investment the home 4 subsidized premiums could have proved to be less costly to the federal government than disaster assistance and 5 subsidies of prefirm structures could provide an incentive to local communities to participate in the program and discourage unwis future floodplains construction38 by authorizing subsidized rates for prefirm structures without providing annual appropriations to f und the subsidy congress did not set up the nfip on an actuarially sound basis39 in 1981 fema shifted policy by increasing premium rates for prefirm structures and establishing goal of collecting sufficient revenue each year to at least meet the expected losses of an average historical loss year based on experience under the program since 1978 the goal

diately avail themselves of federally subsidized flood insurance by 1973 however only 5500 communities participated in the nfip45 this low participati on rate and the fact that so few flood victims had flood insurance following major flooding in the early 1970s led to the enactment of the flood disaster protection act of 197346 the 1973 act revised the earlier law to make the purchase of flood

question in the occupancy and use of floodplains debate is whether flood probability assessment techniques landuse planning methods and damagereducing land management policie s have had the intended results in other words has the nfip resulted in appropriate land use adjustments to slow or reduce the development of land that is exposed to flood damage and thus minimize damages caused by floods nationwide landuse planning techniques are used to influence and manage the type and densityintensity of uses and development on the land the nfip has implemented number of tools and oversight systems to monitor support and evaluate the quality of floodplain enforcement at the local community level the nfip by statute can only encourage states and local communitie s to adopt and enforce certain minimum floodplain management regulations fema has consistently taken the position that federal landuse regulation should not be forced on local communities because this practice would be unworkable50 repetitive loss problem major public policy issue before the 109th congress is the cost to the nfip of paying for repetitivel flooded properties51 according to fema relatively small number of rlps account for dispropor tionate share of paid flood claims52 insurance market analysts insist that by reducing the number of rlps actual flood insurance claims will be reduced and this will both

owners of rlps pay subsidized rates for flood insurance fema has sought over the years to prioritize rlps and pursue variety of insurance and mitigation strategies to stem the disp roportionate costs to the nfip associated with these properties as indicated above conforming with c ongressional intent flood insurance rates are subsidized56 the record indicates that mbers understand that when the 90th congress enacted the national flood insu rance act it was aware that prefirm properties would experience higher loss rate and that flood insurance on these structures would be prohibitively expensive if the premiums were not subsidized57 it was thought that properly implemented building ordinances the natural turnover of property and rating and coverage changes would eventually produce cost savings to the nfip from reduced flood damage in addition policy makers thought that providing subsidized insurance for existing buildings would lead to

funded by taxpayers factors contributing to repetitive loss properties most insurance market analysts agree that there are four factors contributing to the rlp problem first the nfip has not effectively excluded prefirm structures from receiving premium subsidies as the program was initially envisioned by congress and thus rlps have received disproportionate shar of nfip payments for flood losses recall that the vast major ity of rlps are olde r prefirm properties which were initially constructed before the establishment of firms and nfip building standards since the 1980s fema has pursued policy of encouraging states and local communities to remove da maged properties from the floodplain or elevate them above the 100year flood level some critics of the effec tiveness of this policy note that many buildings have been repaired at original elevations and continue to be classified as prefirm properties eligible for subsidized insura nce these prefirm properties contribute to disproportionate share of flood losses under the nfip second properties that sustained substan tial damage are not subject to nfip hazard mitigation require ments and this has led to disproportionate share of nfip payments for flood losses according to fema disproportionate share of nfip claims are for rlps that suffer less the 50 damages and therefore are not required to be rebuilt to ppropriate floodplain ma nagement standards designed to reduce future losses communities must require that owners bring into compliance any building that is substantially damaged by any cause repetitive flood losses occur in part because this requirement is difficult to administer the cost of paying for rlps is driven up because rlps are damaged repeatedly but typically not beyond 50 of their va lue the threshold that triggers the substantial damage standard requiring that structures be rebuilt to meet the programs elevation standards58 substantial damage means damage whereby the cost of restoration to the predamage conditi on would equal or exceed 50 of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred many rlps never reach the 50 threshold because majority of the target buildings are in shallow flooding areas flooded only to the depth of few feet consequently such flooding does not result in substantial damage thus it is the number and cumulative amount of these losses that is the problem insurance market analysts have suggested that it might make better public policy to eliminate eg buyout elevate relocate these potential future losses now rather than wait for these buildings to be substantially damage d in september 1999 femas inspector general published an audit which noted that many communities participating in

typically encourage owners to use the increased cost of compliance icc coverage in nfip policies to bring their buildings into compliance icc coverage part of the standard flood insurance policy pays towards the costs of br inging insured flood damaged homes and businesses into compliance with their communitys floodplain ordinance fema charges policyholders from 3 to 75 pe r year for icc the coverage limit is 30000 some floodplain management specialists insist that the icc coverage has not been used as much as it should because it requires claims adjusters to know what they are doing because adjusters are among the first professionals the owner sees after flood an adjuster is really in the optimal position to foster mitigation and use of icc floodplain managers argue that fema and wyo insurers might need to do more to ensure that adjusters are properly identif ying likely candidates and directing owners to the permit officials for required permits and evaluation of mitigation options if buildings appear to be close to substantially damaged sometimes it is months before an owner gets around to seeking pe rmits it should be noted that permit officials in small towns are quickly over whelmed when they have many damaged buildings to be inspected third large share of rlps are classified as being outside the designated 100 year floodplain which raises concerns bout the accuracy of flood insurance maps see previous discussion on mapping and the f act that the nfip has not assessed the degree to which residents living in fl oodprone areas purchase policies the

property buyouts in the nations floodplains that analyzed the nfips claims data on repetitively flooded properties and discu ssed voluntary buyout and relocati on programs in the context of restoring the natural flood protection capac ity of floodplains the report outlined compelling argument for nonstructural meas ures and the restora tion of the nations floodplains in response to criticism of the nfip found in the report fema announced series of proposals designed to reduce disaster losses including attempts to reduce the subsidy provided to repetitiv loss properties par ticularly vacation homes rental properties and other nonprima ry residences that experience repetitive losses as well as attempts to terminate flood insurance coverage for the worst offending repetitive loss properties63 in december 1993 congress passed the hazard mitigation and relocation assistance act of 1993 that included pr ovision to increase the formula for post disaster hmgp support for mitigation to 75 from 5064 the law clarified what constituted acceptable c onditions for the purchase of damaged homes and businesses in addition the law clarified that purchased land be dedicated in perpetuity for open space uses the national flood insurance reform act of 199465 made comprehensive changes to the nfip including establishment of the flood mitigation assistance program to provide grants to states and communities based on 7525 cost sharehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32972crs24 66 us department of homeland security performance budget over view fiscal year 2005 congressional budget

incentives under the nfips community rating system crs to communities to address the issue locally67 through the crs the nfip provides discounts on flood insurance premiums in co mmunities that volunt arily initiate activ ities over and above the nfip minimums that reduce flood losse s or that increase the number of flood insurance policies under the crs communities receive fl ood insurance premium discounts based on their implementation of local mitiga tion activities that reduce flood losses communities that exceed the nfip minimum mitigation standards can apply for rating from class 1 45 premium reducti on to class 10 0 premium reduction which is based on the total number of points the community accumulates for implementing various mitigation activities the higher the number of points the greater the premium reduction class 1 refl ects the highest number of possible points and hence the highest premium discounts according to fema there are over 1000 communities receiving flood insurance pr emium discounts these communities represent 66 of the nfips policy base68 the national flood insurance reform act of 199469 codified the crs with the goal to provide incentive for communities to reduce flood losses to facilitate accura insurance rating and to promote awareness of flood insurance femas ongoing efforts also include the implementation of its repetitive loss strategy whose objective is program cost reduction towards that goal fema has pursued the following strategy components httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32972crs25 target subset of properties femas repetitive loss strategy is to identify the highest priority properties t hose with four or more loss claims that would benefit from mitigati on activities as of december 31 2004 fema had identified 11706 properties that were insured and which d four or more losses or had two or three losses that cumulatively exceeded the apparent value of the building as reported in the insurance policy the aim of the nfip is to target these properties for mitigative action that will remove them altogether from the floodplains elevate or floodproof them to reduce th eir exposure to flood risk establish special direct facility sdf fema has set up special direct facility to service these 11706 srlp s and provide information about these properties to state and local floodplain ma nagement officials fema opened the target group special facility program in orde r to allow the nfip to provide consistent control of claims f acilitate data collec tion and more easily track mitigation offers of assistance the monthly transfer of insured srlp s to the facility started on may 1 2000 properties are evaluated for inclusion in the sdf based on causeandeffect relationship between construction character istics and surrounding terrain as well as the flood losses these proper ties have sustained ho meowners who reside in properties that become part of the fac ility typically receive letter from the nfip informing them that their properties have been identified as srlps and that their policies will be renewed with the sdf program established by fema all standard rates and periodic rate changes will still apply to policies transferred to the sdf expand flood mitigation funding femas mitigation funds are available to states and communities to target the riskiest rlps and offer the owners financial assistance to acquire elevat floodproof demolish or relocate buildings out of the floodplain current programs available fo r accomplishing this mitigation include an annual 20 million transfer for the

in 2004 bunningbereuterblumenauer flood insurance reform act of 2004 during debate in the 106th through 108th congresses on reauthorizing the nfip members also focused attention on estab lishing framework for addressing the repetitive loss problem as indicated earlier this debate was triggered largely by the 1998 national wildlife fede ration nwf publication entitled higher ground report on voluntary buyouts in the nation s floodplains which revealed that very small percentage of proper ties that suffered from repeat ed flooding were responsible for some 40 of total nfip loss paymen ts the study found that flood losses had risen dramatically through the last centu ry despite huge expenditures on traditional flood control structural projects the nwf recommends nonstructural approaches to reducing flood damages in the aftermath of the nwf study policymakers began to consider utilizing existing fma programs as the key mechanism to increase funding levels for repetitive loss predisaster mitigation particularly voluntary buyouts demolition elevation and floodproofing most expe rts believed that using the fma program framework for repetitive loss mitigation would encourage communities and states to be directly involved with the planning and implementation of their floodplain management strategies policymakers so considered requiring homeowners who refused reasonable mitigation plan offer to pay rates that reflect the actuarial risk associated with their properties in ddition floodplain managers and disaster policy experts explored ways to get fema to work directly with repetitive loss owners on flood hazard mitigation where communities c ould not afford the minimum 25 cost share or did not have the capability to manage the mitigation project on

may take several years to fully solve the rlp problem on september 18 and 19 2003 hurricane isabel struck several states along the midatlantic coast in the aftermath of hurricane isabel flood victims received claims settlements below the cost of repairing their homes according to fema this was because the nfip was ne ver intended to give victims full compensation for their flooddamaged homes or
