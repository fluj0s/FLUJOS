1991 heralded major reduction in russian influence in centra l and eastern europe during the 1990s russias armed forces and the russian economy went into steep decline in recent years one key sector of the russian economy the russian oil and gas sector has shown signs of revival the russian energy sector occupies central place in russias economy and political syst em in 2000 the energy sector accounted for 16 of russias gdp 29 of the gro ss value of industrial output 4548 of federal budget revenues and 54 of foreign exchange earnings its vast financial resources also translate into great politi cal power although this power is mitigated by infighting among russian elite groups in the past few years flush with cash from rising energy prices russian firms have tried to buy up energy companies in central europe with mixed success officials and experts in central europe have expressed worries about the political motives of these investments they ve expressed concern that such russian investment could have negative impact on the sovereignty of these countries particularly given the nontr ansparent way in which thes companies have operated and their close links with the russian government some claim that russian leaders are pushing to control as much as possible while they still have substantial leverage as opposed to 2004 when nato and especially eu membership will change the political equation they claim if russian firms controlled key resources they could form stronger political client networks w ithin their countries thereby compromising their sovereignty however some analysts point out that in some cases the actions of russian firms appear to be affected by conflicts within the russian elite moreover there are limits to russian firms ability to gain infl uence in the region they often face strong resistance from local governments fearing russian dominance and wanting to protect local companies public opinion in thes countries strongly favors maintaining independence from russia incl uding economic independence one way that the united states can help counter the possible negative consequences of the activities of russian energy firms is to raise the issue with moscow and encourage the european union which is the main player on the issue to do likewise the united states and its allies could also encourage the participation of western companies in the privatizati on of key firms in the region which would foster transparency the united states can help these countries by encouraging diversification of their energy supplies us investment in russian energy firms could also be helpful i nvestment could both give the ited states greater interest in the success of russian energy firms and positively influence the behavior of

in russia is gazprom it has monopoly on gas pipelines in russia and virtual m onopoly on production accounting for 93 of the gas produced in russi it controls over quarter of the worlds reserves of natural gas its impact within russia is even bigger its sales alone account for 8 of russian gross domes tic product it is the single largest contributor to the russian governments budget providing over 20 of tax receipts it also controls banks portfolio of i ndustrial holdings news papers and television and radio stations the russian government holds 38 of gazproms shares private investors hold the rest2 gazprom has been useful to russian lead ers in several ways first it helps to prop up russias domestic economy it provi des 70 of its production at loss at prices 15 of those in europe to russi an companies and consumers who often cannot or will not pay thereby helping to ease social pressures in exchange for subsidizing russian domestic consumers gazprom receives virtual monopoly on exports to richer customers abroad nevertheless many experts say gazprom needs to substantially increase domestic prices for gas if it is ever to become viable business3 gazprom has also played key role in russian politics often as weapon of the kremlin for example in 1996 gazprom invested heavily in the media conglomerate media most among many holdings at the time president yeltsin desperately needed media help in his election campaign and businessmen were glad to oblige however after media most outlets started criticizing president putin in 2000 gazprom began to call in the firms bts and seized control of them including ntv the only nationwide televi sion network critical of putin however despite its support of putin gazproms future is uncertain it has been highly inefficient and opaque orga nization although it provides substantial tax revenue gazprom could pay more according to many observers russian officials also want gazprom to do better job in collecting payments from domestic customers although there may be limits to how successfully this can be done another issue is highly dubious tr ansactions by gazprom executives presumably aimed at selfe nrichment on massive scale gazprom is linked with large number of ostensibly independent intermediary co mpanies the best known case involves company called itera wh ich started out brokering obscure barter trades for gazprom and rose to become the secondbiggest gas company in russia it is suspected that gazprom assets were covertly transferred to itera which may be owned by gazprom insiders perhaps gazproms most serious problem which derives partly from the problems mentione d above is that production is hamperedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32087crs3 4 sagers the russian energy sector pp 231234 5 putin aims to

equipment and lack of capital investment over the past two decades4 putin has therefore been faced with the question of whether and how to reform gazprom some radical reformers in putins government would like to see it broken up western investors are lobbying to ease limits on foreign ownership however reform efforts appear to have slowed perhaps for political reasons at least for now putin is moving to establish greater state control over the company he refused to renew the contract of gazprom ceo re m vyakhirev when his contract ended chipping away at the old guard in ma 2001 putin put one of his supporters alexei miller at the head of gazprom number of prominent st petersburg figures and exintelligence officers allied with putin ve subsequently been appointed to high positions in gazprom miller has had some success bringing some gazprom intermediaries under control the government is also seeking to increase the states share of the company to over 50 putin appears to be reluctant to move forward with radical restructuring of gazprom in part because he may fear that the situation will play into the hands of the already powerful oil oligarchs who could be in position to take over the gas industry5 russias oil majors russia is the worlds second largest oil producer and exporter after saudi arabia and has the seventh largest oil reserves the russian oil industry has

control is enhanced by the fact that it sets the export quotas for the pipelines russian oil producers are restricted to exporting 30 of their output6 while they are private companies the large russian oil firms are closely connected with government officials the oligarchs who own and run them received them due to government support in the 1990s in exchange they provided political support to the leadership as in the case of gazprom putin has tried to rein them in with mixed success companies and factions within the russian government supporting them often compete with each other for

are reportedly suspicious of the wealth and power wielded by many of the russian oil oligarchs in july and august 2003 russian prosecutors launched investigations of persons and firms associated with yukos analysts view the investigations as an expression of putins displeasure with yukos ceo mikhail k hodorkovsky who he reportedly suspects of having political ambitions possibly includi ng desire to succeed putin after his second term expires in 2008 they also char ge that putins former kgb associates who occupy posts in the government and in gazprom and lukoil are opposed to western investment which khodorkovsky favored and want to reverse the yeltsin era privatizations that made the oligarchs powerful7 in contrast to khodorkovsky lukoil chief vagit alekperov enjoys good relations with putin possibly because he does not appear to have political ambitions moreover lukoil aided putin in forcing the closure of tv6 in 2002 an independe nt television networ k staffed by former ntv journalists that was often cr itical of the russian government8 russian oil and gas firms in russian foreign policy russian oil and natural gas firms are important players in russian foreign policy particularly those partly or wholly stateowned such as transneft and gazprom in february 2003 putin justifie d his decision to not break up gazprom in part by noting that the company is powerful economic and political lever in the world9 in addition to ownership stakes the conduct of russian energy firms is linked to russian foreign policy by common mindset inherited from traditional soviet and early postsoviet russian fo reign policy this includes lingering distinction between the near abroad which includes the former soviet republics and the baltic states and the far abro ad which includes western countries the central european countries appear to occupy middle ground in russian thinking less important than western countries and somewhat less subject to manipulation than the form er soviet republics ne vertheless central europe continues to play significant role in russian foreign policy partly due to the needs of the russian energy industry itself russian oil and gas exports to western europe flow through the regions pipelines and ports russia already supplies over 15 of europes total oil and one quarter of its natural gas however it is often difficult to posit clear causeandeffect relationship between russian foreign policy and the activities of russian firms the close informal connections of ru ssias political and economic lites make it difficult to disentangle actions that serve the commercial interests of the firms or the privatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32087crs5 10 bear hug russia cap italizes on eu expansion business week november 25 2002 68interests of the firms managers fro m overall russian foreign policy goals additionally it should be noted that russian elites are fractured and often work at cross purposes including on foreign policy issues the activities and impact of russian oil and gas firms in central and eastern europe observers in central europe and the ited states have noted with concern accelerated investment by russian firms in central europe in the past several years even without russian acquisitions the re gion is highly dependent upon russian oil and natural gas central eu ropean industries are ineffici ent users of energy and have very little in energy resources hungary has little natural gas and romania has dwindling oil supplies secondly seve ral countries are dependent on russia for pipeline transit fees including slovakia and the baltic states there are several reasons for increased ru ssian investment in the region first in recent years central european countri have been privatizing their energy sectors in part to prepare for eu member ship this privatiza tion had been delayed because of the political sensitivity of the i ndustry there has been some effort among local firms to consolidate among themselves but russian and western energy firms have also bought large stakes second af ter the 10 central european countries join the eu in 2004 over half of russias exports will go to the eu therefore russian energy firms see eu enlargement as an oppor tunity and their investments in central europe as an effort to position themselves for that opportunity russian subsidiaries in the new member states will ve better access to the eu market10 moreover central and southeastern eu rope are regions in which russian firms can carve out significant roles in the refining and retail sectors given the lack of western competition and longstanding infrastructure ties and personal relationships another reason for the interest of russian firms in refineries and retail is that they are not globally competitive yet and central eur ope is one place where they can succeed russian firms are able to exploit this opportunity because they are flush with cash due to intermittently high oil pr ices and booming oil production which is recovering from the sharp slump of the 1990s cost competitiveness was enhanced by the ruble devaluation in 1998 as resu lt russian oil firms in recent years have been looking to expand their export markets in acquiring central european energy assets russian firms have trump card they are often the only source of energy s upply in several places russian firms have been able to use this lever to gain control the efforts of the us firm williams international to operate the mazeikiai oil complex in lithuania are instructive in this regard mazeikiai includes large refinery the butinge maritime terminal and pipeline it is the largest enterprise in lithuania and provides vitallyneeded tax revenue httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32087crs6 11 vladimir socor

lithuanian politicians including some with close links to moscow who wanted to see lukoil get the refinery in response lukoil which supplie d the oil to the refinery slowed supplies to trickle as result mazeikiai became increasingly unprofitable this led williams which had financial problems of its own to sell its stake to yukos in august 2002 yukos now has majority stak and operating rights in the enterprise the lithuanian government is currently seeking investment from the european bank for reconstruction and devel opment in mazeikiai to provide at least some balance to yukos and to help secure financing for the modernization of the complex russian firms have acquired other footholds in l ithuanias energy sector gazprom has secured 34 interest in lietuvos dujo s the lithuanian natural gas company lithuania managed to secure the partic ipation of ruhrga sled consortium for another 34 ruhrgas is the operator of the company11 another recent example of russian company using its control over energy supplies to support acquisitions occurred in january 2003 the russiangovernment controlled transneft oil pipeline company cut off all oil shipments to the latvian oil terminal at the port of ventspils for the first quarter of the year after having decreased shipments in late 2002 the move is large blow to latvia ventspils is vital to latvias economy accounting for 10 of gdp transneft is diverting the oil shipments to its own baltic pipeline system and the russian port of primorsk which it controls transneft claims that there is demand for using ventspils claim viewed with great skepticism by outside observers most see the move as power play by transneft to secure controlling share of the firm ventspils nafta which operates the oil terminal12 russian firms have sometimes used underh anded methods to secure control of firms or engaged in other illegal practi ces for example gazprom succeeded in obtaining control of large parts of th hungarian petrochemical industry in 2000 through the use of complicated shell corpor ations to disguise its role which would be prohibited by hungar ian law if done openly13 in 2000 gazprom laid fiberoptic cable along with pipeline it was build ing through poland without the knowledge or approval of the polish government14 other acquisitions have occurred in less questionable ways but still spark concern because of the power they give russian firms in 2001 yukos bought 49 of the slovak pipeline firm transpetrol this will give it control of the southern part of the druzhba pipeline the main pipeline for russian crude oil to western europe this gives yukos control over oil exports to hungary and the former yugoslavia it also forms part of plan to connect th druzhba pipeline with the adria pipeline which supplies

as major oil supplier to the united states15 in some cases observers have questi oned the wisdom of russian purchases lukoil bought petrotel refinery in romani in 1998 but had to shut it down in april 2002 due to its unprofitability lukoil says it hopes to open modernized plant there in 2004 lukoil was reportedly displeased with its treatment at the hands of the romanian government claiming that bucharest had reneged on aspects of the original deal the romanian government re stored many of the terms of the original deal in august 2002 lukoil owns the bu lgarian refiner neft okhim which controls 85 of bulgarias domestic market howe ver lukoil has also suffered substantial losses in bulgaria it has continued to expand in purchasing and building gas stations in romania and bulgaria despite losses16 implications of russian investment local officials and experts in central eu rope have expressed worries about the alleged political motives of these investments and their domestic impact for example latvian officials have expressed concern that transnefts move shows that russia is willing to suffer substantial econo mic losses to seize greater economic and therefore political power in latvia russian power in latvia has waned since the withdrawal of soviet troops in the early 1990s latvian officials claim that russian leaders are pushing to control as much as possible while they still have substantial leverage as opposed to 2004 when nato and especially eu membership will change the political equation the possible sa of ventspils nafta to transneft could also have domestic political implications ventspils resources have been used by latvian businessmen to fund several latvian po litical parties including latvias way and the union of greens and farmers if russian firm controlled these resources it could fund parties more c ongenial to moscows views this fear that russian firms will form stronger political client ne tworks within countries is also common in lithuania and other countries in the region17 russian government officials have generally not openl linked commercial transactions with russian political go als in the region however russias ambassador to latvia has hinted that tvian concessions on the status of ethnic russians in latvia could influence the russian government to permit crude oil to flow to ventspils again18 it is

the russian minority and for its desire to join nato the ventspils issue can also be seen as part of the conflict between the oil oligarchs and putin the cutoff move was criticized by the five major russian oil firms lukoil yukos rosneft and rgutneftgaz and tnk which want to continue to use and even expand their use of ventspils however transneft backed by russian government officials has said that it will not restore shipments to ventspils unless it can buy stake in the port the profitability of the big oil firms is dependent on their export capability and statecontrolled access to pipelines is means for putin to bring them to heel if he wishes to do so in fact the russian government has tried to disc ourage the building of private pipelines controlled by the oil companies the government has given its approval to the drafting of feasibility study on the building of key new pipelines to murmansk for export to europe and the united states and east asia however transneft may want to own the pipeline if it is built19 in many countries in the region gazprom has tried to secure political influence through local intermediary companies bartimpex polish company that received the franchise to import russian gas into poland has 17 former government ministers and senior officials on its payroll nd its owner reportedl has close ties with russian oligarchs bartimpex lobbied against polish government plans to import gas from norway to diversify polands sources of supply20 in bulgaria in the early and mid1990s gazprom used close connections with ruling socialist party elite and its control or influence over intermediary companies such as topenergy overgas and multigroup to try to secure control over bulgarias natural gas pipelines these pipelines supply energy not only to bulgaria but to other balkan countries although subsequent prowestern officials have not been as sympathetic to gazprom as their socialist predecessors the russian firm is still trying to secure control of stateowned bulgargas company21 there are limits to russian firms ability to gain influence in the region they often face strong resistance from local governments fearing russian dominance and wanting to protect local companies public opinion in these countries strongly favors maintaining independence from russia in cluding economic independence for example efforts by russian companies to buy large refinery in gdansk poland were stymied due to local political fears22 the security provided by eu and nato membership may help central european countries ward off excessive

fearing that russian influence could continue to undermine their sovereignty for many years to come23 this situation can be contrasted to that of countries like belarus ukraine and moldova which do not have western geopolitical anchorage their political systems are often less democratic and transparent than those in central europe making it easier for russian firms and the government to make deals without sparking public opposition public opinion in these states is often split on the importance of independence versus close relationship with russia belarus and ukraine have been isolated by the antide mocratic and in the case of belarus anti western actions of their leaders moldova has been made vulnerable by its status as the poorest country in europe it is also weakened by the existence of the dniestr republic separatist entity within mo ldova which many moldovans view as russiansupported and the continued depl oyment of russian troop contingent there the vulnerability of these countries s made them more prone to political pressures from russia which gazprom and other russian companies have converted more easily to commercial advantage than in central europe for example gazprom has taken over the gas pipeline network in moldova in exchange for debt forgiveness for unpaid gas bills similarly gazprom threatened to cut off gas deliveries to belarus in october 2002 belarus bowed to the pressure and in november 2002 agreed to reorganize its gas pipeline netw ork as joint venture with russia in ukraine gazprom may have scored its biggest coup in october 2002 ukrainian president leonid kuchma and putin signed deal creating russianukrainian consortium to control the ukrainian pipeline system the largest in the world the consortium is 5050 split which could give russia veto on key pipeline management issues observers believe that kuchma made the move to bolster support from moscow for his inte rnationallyiso lated regime24 us policy russian investment in the oil and natura l gas industries in central and eastern europe may not be negative for the united st ates and the countries themselves if the conduct of russian firms in the region is tr ansparent and is not aimed at reducing the sovereignty of these countries however misbehavior by russian companies could retard us goals of fully integrating th countries of the region into euroatlantic institutions one way that the united stat can help counter potentially troublesome activities of russian energy firms is to attempt to persuade russian leaders that russias longterm political and economic in terests are best served by carrying out policy of transparency and partnership in the region in meeting with president bush in february 2003 president bush rais ed the issue of ventspils

serve as wa to lessen the dependence of ukraine and central european states on russia by provi ding an alternative route for caspian oil however proposal to run pipeline though poland to the baltic

june 2003 the european union announced it will provide 36 million for another feasibility study on an extension to gdansk it is estimated that the project would take 3 to 5 years and cost 589 million so far however the project has been hampered by the reluctance so far of caspian producers to use the pipeline russian firms have expressed interest but want the flow of the pipeline to be reversed to allow russian crude to flow through ukrain to the black sea for export ukraine has so far rejected this proposal27 in tactic similar to the one it pursued in latvia transneft cut off oil supplies to odesa in august 2003 claiming that it lacked the oil to supply the port however observers believe the move was in fact undertaken to pressure kiev to reverse the flow of the pipeline28 us investment

watching the treatment of foreign companies in the caspian pipeline consortium and of russian firms efforts to build an oil pipeline to murmansk one possible ray of light for western inve stment in russias oil and gas industry is the february 2003 announcement of d eal between tnk and british petroleum the deal would merge three russian oil companies sidanko and two firms owned by tnk bp would acquire onehalf of the new company which would become russias third largest oil company after lukoil and yukos bp would invest up to 675 billion in the new company observers have noted that bp
