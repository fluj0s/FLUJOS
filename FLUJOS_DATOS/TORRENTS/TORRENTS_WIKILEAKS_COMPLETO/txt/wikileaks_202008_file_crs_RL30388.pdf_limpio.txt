of religious organizations that can participate in publicly funded social service programs the establishment of religion clause of the first amendment s long been construed to allow religious organizations to participate in such progra ms but in the past it has generally been interpreted to require public ly funded religious social services providers to be incorporated separately from their sponsoring religious institutions to forego religious activities and prosel ytizing in the publicly funde d programs and to remove religious symbols from the premises wher the services are provided charitable choice attempts to allow religious organizations to retain their religious character and to employ their religious faith in carrying out publicly funded programs four charitable choice provisions have been enacted into law although two overlap and in the 106th congress either the house or the senate or committee approved an additional seven all of these provisions state their purpose to be to allow religious organizations to participat as contractors or grantees in publicly funded social service programs on the same basis as any other nongovernmental provider without impairing their religious character to protect their religious character the provisions direct that religious grantee or contractor shall retain control over the definition development practice and expre ssion of its religious beliefs bar government from discriminating against an applicant on the basis that the organization has religious character prohibit government from requiring such an organization to alter its form of govern ance or to remove religious art and other symbols as condition of eligibility specify that religious contractors and grantees can discriminate on religious grounds in th eir employment practices and with two exceptions allow such contractors and gran tees to use their own funds to promote sectarian worship instruction and pros elytization in the funded programs but in part as the result of amendments adopted on the senate floor during the welfare reform debate the charitable choi ce provisions also all require that the programs be implemented in manner consistent with the establishment clause bar the use of public funds received directly by religious organizations but not indirectly if the underlying program so allows for sectarian worship instruction or proselytization and permit government to require religious grantees to be separately incorporated from their sponsoring religious institution as consequence of these various provi sions

and developments through the 106th congress introduction charitable choice is the name given burge oning legislative effort to expand the universe of religious organizations that can participate in publicly funded social services programs under the establis hment of religion clause of the first amendment1 religious organizations have long been held to be eligible to participate as grantees or contractors in such programs but the establishment clause has in the past generally been interpreted to bar g overnment from providing direct assistance to organizations that are pervasively s ectarian as consequence government funding agencies have often required re ligious social services providers as conditions of receiving public funds to be incorporated separately from their sponsoring religious institutions to refrain from religious activities and proselytizing in the publicly funded programs and to re move religious symbols from the premises in which the services are provided the establishment clause in short has been construed to require relig ious organizations to secularize their services and premises as conditions of obtaining public funding as concept charitable choice challenges these restrictions and seeks to allow religious organizations to retain their religious character and to employ their faith in carrying out programs that are directly subsidized by government charitable choice provision wa s first enacted into law in 1996 as part of the personal responsibility and work oppor tunity reconciliation act of 1996 the welfare reform measure2 in 1998 congress enacted into law modified charitable choice provision as part of the reauthoriz ation of the community services block grant program3 in 2000 it added two overlapping charitable choice provisions to the drug abuse treatment and prevention titles of the public health service act by means of the childrens health act4 and the community renewal tax relief act ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30388crs2 5 pl 106554 december 21 2000 the measur was enacted as part of the omnibus consolidated appropriations act 2001 6 see infra at 202320005 number of other charitable choice provisions also received favorable consideration in either the house or the senate in the 106th congress although they were not enacted into law as follows both the house and the senate adopted charitable choice provisions in their versions of the juvenile justice bill hr 1501 and s 254 the house passed an additional four measures that included charitable choice provisions the fathers count act hr 3073 which was subsequently passed agai n as part of the child support distribution act of 2000 hr 4678 the american homeownership and economic pportunity act of 2000 hr 1776 and the literacy involves families together act hr 3222 the house committee on education and the workforce reported oneadditional measure that included charitable choice section the education opportunities to protect and invest in our nations students education opti ons act hr 4141 the provisions of two of these measur the american homeownership and economic opportunity act and the literacy involves families together act were ultimately enacted into law as parts of other bills but in both instances the charitable choice provisions were eliminated 6 these charitable choice provi sions differ in some details but they all share number of common provisions the charitable choice measures all explicitly or by reference state their purpose to be 1 to allow religious organizations to participate as contractors or grantees in publicly funded social service programs on the same basis as any other nongovernmental provider without impa iring the religious character of such organizations to that end the provisions all 2 direct that religious grantee or contractor shall retain control over the definition development practice nd expression of its religious beliefs 3 bar government from discriminating against an applicant on the basis that the organization has religious character 4 prohibit government from requiring such an organization to alter its form of internal governance or to remove religious art and other symbols as condition of eligibility and 5 specify that receipt of public funds does not alter the exemption religious organizations have under title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 allowing them to discriminate on religious grounds in their employment practiceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30388crs3 but partly as the result of amendments adopted on the senate floor during the welfare reform debate in 199596 the charitable choice provisions also all 6 require that the programs be im plemented in manner consistent with the establishment clause and in two ca ses with the free exercise clause as well 7 bar the use of public funds received directly by religious organizations but not indirectly in the form of v ouchers if the underlying program provides for vouchers for sectarian worship instruction or proselytization and 8 implicitly permit government to require religious grantees to be separately incorporated from thei r sponsoring religious institution in addition most but not all of the ch aritable choice provisions that have been enacted or approved so far 9 implicitly allow such contractors and grantees to use their own resources to promote sectarian worship instruction and proselytization in the funded programs 10 bar religious organizations th at receive funds under the pertinent programs from discriminating against bene ficiaries on the basis of religion religious belief or refusal to activel participate in religious practice 11 require that beneficiaries who obj ect to the religious character of an organization providing services be afford ed an alternate and accessible provider and 12 provide for government audits of the religious organizations use of the federal funds provided smaller number of the charitable choice measures 13 provide that the charitable c hoice provisions do not preempt state constitutions or statutes that prohibit or restrict the expenditure of state funds in or by religious organizations 14 specify that receipt of financial assistance constitutes receipt of federal financial assistance for purposes of appl ying federal civil rights statutes and 15 bar religious organizations from using their own funds to engage participants in religious worship instru ction or proselytization in the funded program finally two additional elements proposed in some of the charitable choice initiatives which with one exception have gene rally been rejected would have 16 barred public agencies from requiring religious organization to form separate nonprofit entity to receive and administer funds under the bill and 17 allowed participating religious organizations to require employees to adhere to their religious tenets and to abide by any rules regarding the use of drugs or alcohol as consequence of these various provi sions questions have been raised about the internal consistency of the charitable choice measures whether some of the provisions undermine and contradict the inte nt of charitable choice to allow religious organizations to employ their faith in carrying out publicly funded social services programs and whether administering agencies can in

administrative feasibility and constitutionality are interrelated and both have been further complicated by recent supreme court decisions that appear to loosen the restrictions the court has prev iously imposed on direct aid to sectarian institutions pursuant to the establishment clause7 indicative of the questions surrounding the constitutionality of charitable choice it should be noted that at least one suit has now been filed challenging the constitutionality of charitable choice program in texas8 and another relevant suit has been filed in kentucky the latter suit does not involve charitable choice program as such but challenges the constitutionality of one of its central provisions namely religious discrimination in the employment practices of religious organization that receives public funds to provide child welfare services9 the following sections 1 summarize the legislative histories of the four charitable choice measures that have been enacted into law as well as the seven that were passed by either the house or the senate or committee in the 106th congress and 2 set forth the framework of the constitutional issues to simplify comparison of the various charitable choice measures in these laws and bills an appendix lays out their provisions in table form charitable choice measu res enacted into law 1 welfare reform pl 104193 in 1996 congress enacted the first charitable choice provision as part of the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act whic h reformed the welfare system10 that provision included all of the elements in 113 above but not those in 1417 charitable choice had first surfaced during the senates consideration of welfare reform in 1995 it was not in the welfare reform bill hr 4 initially passed by the house that year11 nor was it in the version subs equently reporte d by the senate finance committee12 but charitable choice provisi on had been part of welfarehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30388crs5 13 see s 842

substitute proffered by the majority leader sen dole rkn for the bill that had been reported by the senate finance committee14 the provision was included reportedly at the initiative and urging of sen ashcroft after further modification fe w days later by sen dole15 the charitable choice section in the leadership substitute specified that the states could make grants to or contracts with religious organizations to administer elements of the temporary assistance for needy families program tanf the measure contained the first five provisions noted above protecting the religious ch aracter and independence of religious grantees and contractors truncated version of the limitation noted in 7 above barring the use of dir ect assistance but not assist ance in the form of vouchers and not the organizations own funds for s ectarian worship or instruction and the protections for beneficiaries in 10 nd 11 above in addition the leadership substitute included the provisions in 16 and 17 above barring funding agencies from requiring religious organization to form separate nonprofit entity to receive and administer funds under the bill and allowi ng participating re ligious organizations to require employees to adhere to their religious tenets and to abide by any rules regarding the use of drugs or alcohol during floor debate in september 1995 on the leadership substitute sen cohen rme proposed two amendments to the charitabl choice section the first proposed to add language requiring the prog rams to be impleme nted consistent with the establishment clause of the united states constitution and to delete the language precluding funding agencies from requiring the recipient organizations to be incorporated separately from their sponsoring religious organizations16 h i s second amendment proposed the deletion of the language barring funding agencies from requiring the recipient organization to re move religious art icons scripture and other symbols17 sen kennedy dma in turn offered an amendment to delete the charitable choice provisions in their entirety18 but only sen cohens first amendment was acted upon by the senate sen cohen contended that the bill in its present form does too little to restrain religious organizations from using federa l funds to promote religious message19 he also contended that prohibiting the states from asking religious organization to set up separate nonprofit corporation to receive the money and administer the programs would actually inhibit the partic ipation of religious organizations the supreme court he said

massive reconciliation bill that contained the provisions of welfare refo rm providing budgetary savings but that bill did not include variety of other provisions that were included in hr 4 including the charitable choice sectiongovernment grants to religious organizations that are permeated with sectarianism and states will if they do not have th separate nonprofit cor poration option avoid dealing with some religious organizations because they are not going to want to walk into lawsuit that will challenge th program as being violative of the first amendment20 sen ashcroft rmo opposed the second part of the amendment on the grounds it provided certain protecti on against lawsuits and placed barrier to the participation of religious organi zations that was imposed on other kind of organization what we really ask for he stated is that there be level playing field here for religious nd nonreligious organizations21 after division of sen cohens amendment the part requiring prog rams to be implemented consistent with the establishment clause was adopted by voi ce vote and the other part giving funding agencies the discretion to require the recipient organizati on to be separately incorporated from its sponsoring religious organization was adopted by vote of 59 4122 several days late r the senate approved hr 4 as amended23 the house as noted above had previous ly adopted welfare reform measure that did not include char itable choice provision in th subsequent housesenate conference both parts of sen cohens amendment we re retained but the conference agreement deleted the provision in the senate substitute which permitted recipient organizations to require their em ployees to adhere to the organizations religious tenets and their rules regarding the use of alcohol or drugs 17 above while retaining the other provision noted in 5 above allowing such organizations to discriminate on religious grounds in their employment practices24 the conference agreement also slightly amended the provision barring direct assistance received by such organizations but not assistance received indirectly in the form of vouchers or their own funds from being used for relig ious worship or instruction adding prohibition on proselytizing as well finally the agreement added the non preemption provision summarized in 13 above thus the conference agreement resulted in charitable choice section in hr 4 that included all of the provisi ons in 113 but not those in 1417 above both the house and the senate approved the conference agreement and sent the bill to the

in the conference agreement during the first session in their revised welfare reform measures without s ubstantive change26 the only action on charitable choice occurred on motion in the senate to waiv point of order under the budget act that would have excluded this section from the bill after brief debate the motion to waive the point of order and thus to retain charitable choice in the bill was adopted 673227 on august 22 1996 president clinton without any comment on the charitable choice provision signed the welfare reform bill into law28 in december 1996 the department of health and human services sent p ackage of proposed technical corrections to the statute to congress which included several changes to the charitable choice section the primary r ecommendation was to change references to religious organizations in the charitable choice section to religious organizations that are not pervasively s ectarian but congress re portedly due to the opposition of sen ashcroft did not include that propos in the technical and other amendments to the program it adopted in 199729 as noted above t hose amendments included the addition of welfaretowork grant initiative to the tanf

of children and adolescents section 305 of the b ill provided that the states could administer their substance abuse programs under either title by means of grants contracts and cooperative agreements

charitable choice statutes are fully applicable to the discretionary grant and the block grant programs authorized by titles v and xix of the public health services act but they are not wholly

s 976 had not cont ained charitable choice section instead the section was part of an amendment in the nature of substitute offered by sen frist r tn during the markup of the bill by the senate committee on health education labor and pensions on july 28 1999 the charitable choice provision included in the substitute differed from the one ultimately approved by the senate in one respect in addition to allowing religious organizations to retain their title vii privilege to discriminate on religious grounds in their employment practices notwithstanding the receipt of public funds the frist substitute also provided that such organizations could require employees to adhere to their tenets and teachings as well as to ru forbidding the use of drugs or alcohol 17 above during the markup sen reed d ri and sen kennedy dma proposed an amendment to delete both of these employment discri mination provisions but that amendment was rejected on rollcall vote of 810 the committee then approved the frist substitute by vote of 171 the committee report on s 976 cited the apparent success of several faithbased substance abuse programs and stated that because of the effectiveness of these organizations the committee believes that greater participation of faithbased programs in treating substance abuse problems is critical the report sa id that religious organizations have often been unwilling to accept government funds to pr ovide social services for fear of having to compromise th eir religious character and that government ought to exercise neutrality when inviting the participation of nongovernmental organizations to be services providers by cons idering all organizations even religious ones on an equal basis the charitable choice provision the report stated clarifies the constitutional framework for enabling coopera tion between the government and religious organizations assures religious organizations that they will not have to compromise their religious character upon receiving government funds maintains their autonomy over employment decisions by permitting them to make employment decisions based upon religious reasons and protects the free exercise rights of beneficiaries while religious organizations are expected to use government funds for the secular purpose of the legislation the report stated nothing prohibits religious organizations from using monies received from other sources for inherently religious activities as long as participation is voluntary see srept 106196 oct 19 1999 at 3233 seven democrats who voted to report the bill filed additional views in the committee report criticizing the charitable choice section the provision they stated is constitutionally suspect and lacks clear and strict safeguards to ensure that the dividing line between church and state is not er ased moreover they asserted there is as yet documented evidence of the efficacy of faithbased substance abuse programs and recent research they said has emphasized that addiction is chronic illness rather than moral failing in addition they stated it provides new avenue for employment discrimination and they decried the committees rejection of the reedkennedy amendment to strike the employ ment discrimination provisions religious discrimination may be acceptable when the organization is using its own money but when it is using federal funds with explicit prohibitions against proselytization this kind of discrimination is objectionable the dissenting senators said that we believe re ligious organizations are helpful allies in the battle against substance abuse but that ch organizations should be enlisted without undermining constitutional principles and civil ri ghts laws the charitable choice section

worship i believe that is clearly unconstitutional and for good reason federal subsidies of our church and houses of worship is something we have not done for 200 years in our country the second point it mentions language under the guise of not wanting to have discrimination against religious organizations that might be cute marketing but it is faulty logic the reason our founding fathers set up distance between government and religion and church and state was to protect religion not to discriminate against it the third point is it talks about stopping di scrimination charitable choice language in this bill actually subsidizes religious discrimination very clearly it says you can take federal tax dollars and put out government paidfor sign that says catholics jews protestants need apply here for this federally subsidized job that is wrong th fourth point is that charitable choice language in the name of helping religion is actually going to bring government auditing on our churches i am not sure our religious entities are helped in america by having uncle sam come in and audit this language is unnecessary it is harmful it is unconstitutional and it should not be in this bill52 president clinton signed the bill into law on october 17 2000 but he reiterated with some modification the c onstitutional concern about charitable choice that he had expressed in signing the

religious or ganizations are already providing services under the even start program but stated that the committee thought it was important to amend current finitions to clarify that such providers may not be barred from providing services in the future because of their religious nature under the amendment the committee stated the government may not discriminate against religious organizations that seek to participate in the local partnership and may not require those re ligious organizations to secularize or eliminate their religious character in order to participate the report noted the other charitable choice provisions that had prev iously been approved by the house as indicating congressional support for the c oncept and quoted both president clinton and vicepresident gore as

decisions on charitable choice had as yet been reported91 rep scott filed additional views to detail his gra ve concerns about the constitutional and policy implica tions of the charitable choice provision the committees rejection of his amendment to bar religious organizations participating in the even start program from discr iminating on religious grounds in their employment practices meant he said that religious bigotry may take place with federal funds the title vii exem ption he asserted was intended to apply to the use of private funds for the religious organization and it was never expected to be applied to the use of federal funds the exemption also raised questions he stated with respect to its interplay with the precepts of religions that may mandate or ordain observance of be liefs based on race gender sexual orient ation marital status or behavior and it wa s to ensure that federal nondi scrimination statutes would continue to apply in such situations he explained that he proposed an amendment to make clear that any receipt of even st art funds would constitute receipt of federal financial assistance the committees accep tance of his second amendment barring proselytizing in even start programs even with religious organizations own funds he said increases the possibility that the program can be implemented consistent with the constitution finally he cont ended the purpose of charitable choice to allow government funding of pervasively s ectarian organizations conflicts with the requirements of the constitution similar contentions were voiced in the brief floor debate on the measure rep scott expressed hi s reluctant oppos ition to the bill because it allows the government to give taxpayer money to religious institutions and then allows those

choice provisions on number of prior occasions and that the concept had been supported by both president clinton and vicepresident gore rep scott filed dissentin g views reiterating many of his objections and expressing grave concern about the constitutional and po licy implications of charitable choice99 the provision he stated would allow religious bigotry to take place with federal funds because it specifies that religious organizations can retain their exemption from title viis prohibition of religious discrimination in employment even when they receive public funds thus he asserted religious organization using federal f unds under charitable choice coul d fire or refuse to hire perfectly qualified employee because of that persons religion moreover he argued the purpose of charitable choice is to provide government funding to pervasively sectarian organizations notwithstanding the likelihood that public funding of such entities is unconstitutiona l quoting rev wanda henry of the american baptist churches usa rep scott suggested that charitable choice may also do harm to the recipient organizations as their missions become intertwined with the quest for public money he quoted re v henry as saying not only that religious organizations will become subject to government audit and regulation but also that the prophetic voice of the chur ch will be silenced or threatened with silence due to their inability to criticize the main source of their funding for meeting social needs public funding may also heighten religious animosities rep sco tt stated as

hr 2511 s 1382 finally four bills would ve made charitable choice applicable to most federally funded social service programs s 997 s 1113 s 2779 and hr 1607 constitutional framework one of the issues that has been raised about the charitable choice measures is whether it is possible to implement ll of their provisions or whether some necessarily have to be ignored ie whether the various provisions of charitable choice are internally contradictory but that issue of the administrative feasibility of implementing charitable choice is in fact question of its constitutionality on the one hand all of the charitabl choice provisions enacted or approved to date require that they be implemented consistent with the establishment clause of the united states constitution and that fe deral funds received in the fo rm of grants or contracts not be used for purposes of religious wors hip instruction or proselytization but on the other hand they also all allow the relig ious organizations that receive grants or administer contracts under the pertinent progra ms to hire only adherents of their own faith to display religious symbols and scri pture on the premises where services are provided to practice and express their religious beliefs i ndependent of any government restrictions and with two exceptions to invite the participants in their publicly funded programs to take part in religious activ ities funded with the organizations own funds the provisions also allow federal funds received indirectly in the form of vouchers if th underlying program allows for vouchers to be used for sectarian worship instru ction and proselytization recipient organizations also need not although they may be incorporated separately from sponsoring religious entity administrativel the question is whether the programs can be implemented in full compliance with all of these provisions but more fundamentally the question is whether it is consistent with the establishment clause for the government to fund religious organizations with these characteristics100httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30388crs27 100 continued it should be noted does not depend on the presence of this phrase in the statutes enacted or the bills approved 101 403 us 602 61213 1971 102 id at 61213 quoting walz v tax commissi on of new york 397 us 664 668 1970this question in turn has at least two dimensions the charitable choice measures govern public aid that is given directly to religious organizations by means of grants or contracts and at least in the case of the welfare refo rm statute public aid given indirectly in the form of vouchers that can be redeemed with religious as well as nonreligious organizations the constituti onal strictures that apply to these two forms of aid however differ and as cons equence the form in which the public aid is provided to religious organizations has implications for the compatibility of the consistent with the establishment clau phrase with the other provisions of charitable choice it should also be noted that recent supr eme court decisions appear to be moving away from the direct aid principle that has characterized much of its jurisprudence four justices have expre ssed the view that the establishment clause should be interpreted and app lied in accordance with prin ciple of formal neutrality ie that direct public aid programs benefitting religious institutions pass constitutional muster so long as the aid is distributed evenhandedly to religious and nonreligious institutions alike according to s ecular criteria regardless of whether the aid is subsequently diverted to religious use by the recipient organizations this is not the majority view on the court as yet and the other justices still require that direct public aid be limited to secular use by the recipient institutions but majority of the justices have abandoned the presump tion that some religious institutions are so pervasively sectarian th at direct public aid is inevitably unconstitutional because of the impossibility of limiting it to secular use in such institutions thus the courts recent decisions appear to be openi ng the door to greater degree of direct public aid than formerly although those decisi ons have left the full scope of what the establishment clause requires indeterminate the following subsections detail the constitutional framework that appears to govern these two types of aid 1 direct aid as noted recent decisions by the supreme court appear to have loosened somewhat the constitutiona l strictures placed on direct public aid programs benefitting religious institutions albeit to an indeterminate degree under the tripartite test first articulated fully in lemon v kurtzman 101 the court has long held that to pass muster under the estab lishment clause public aid program must have secular legislative purpose pr incipal or primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion and not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion102 these requirements continue to apply but the primary effect and excessive entanglement prongs of this tripartite test have now been modifiedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30388crs28 103 grand rapids school

v kurtzman supra bowen v kendrick supra 107 the court has looked at such factors as th proximity of the organization in question to sponsoring church the presence of religious symbols and paintings on the premises formal church or denominational control over the organization whether religious criterion is applied in the hiring of employees or in the selection of trustees or in the case of school to the admission of students statements in the organizations charter or other publications that its purpose is the propagation and promoti on of religious faith whether the organization engages in religious services or other religious activities its devotion in the case of schools to academic freedom etc see eg bradfield v roberts 175 us 291 1899 lemon v kurtzman supra tilton v richardson 403

has also made clear that it is not enough to show that the recipient of continuedthe secular purpose prong of the lemon test has rarely posed an obstacle to public aid programs directly benefitting sect arian entities but the courts use of the primary effect and entang lement prongs have posed substantial barrier in applying the primary effect prong the court has made clear that the establishment clause absolutely prohibit s governmentfinanced or government sponsored indoctrination into the belie fs of particular religious faith103 government inculcation of religious be liefs the court has stated has the impermissible effect of advancing religion104 to guard against that effect public assistance which flows directly to religious institutions in the form of grants or contracts has been required to be limited to aid that is secular neutral and nonideological105 that is under the primary effect prong of the lemon test government has been able to provide direct support to secular programs and services sponsored or provided by religious tities but it has been barred from directly subsidizing such organizations religious activities or proselytizing direct assistance the court has held must be limited to secular use106 thus under this interpretation of the establishment clause religious organizations have not automatically been disqualified from participating as grantees or contractors in publicly f unded programs but in order to meet the secular use requirement such organizati ons have had either to di vest themselves of their religious character and to become predominantly secular in nature or at the least to be able to separate their secular functions and activities from their religious functions and activities to the extent they have done so it has been deemed constitutionally permissible for government to provide di rect funding to their secular functions but under this interpretation of the estab lishment clause it has also been deemed constitutionally impermissible for religious organizations that are pervasively sectarian to participate in direct public aid programs the court has not laid down hard and fast definition of what make s an organization pervasively sectarian107 buthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30388crs29 107 continued grant is affiliated with religious institution or that it is religiously inspired bowen v kendrick supra at 621 indeed none of these factors by itself has been held sufficient to make an institution pervasively sectarian and th erefore ineligible for direct aid such finding has always rested on combination of factors for lower federal court discussions of the criteria bearing on whether an ins titution is pervasively sectarian or not see minnesota federation of teachers v nelson 740 fsupp

religious purpose and character and as entities whose secular functions and religious functions are inextricably intertwined in such religiondominated institutions it is simply impossible the court has stated to limit public aid to secular use as consequence it has until recently held that direct public subsidies inevitably have primary effect of advancing religion108 thus in the courts past decisions the secular use limitation on direct public aid under the establishment clause has been deemed to have two dimensions direct public aid cannot be used for religious pur poses nor can it flow to institutions that are pervasively sectarian as the court summarized in hunt v mcnair109 aid normally may be thought to have primary effect of advancing religion when it flows to an institution in which re ligion is so pervasive that substantial portion of its functions are subsumed in the religious mission or when it funds specifically religious activity in an otherwise substantially secular setting the entanglement prong of the lemon test has also until recently had fatal consequences for direct aid to pervasively sectarian institutions110 in institutions that are not pervasively sectarian the court has been willing to presume that secular use limitation on direct aid can be honored wit hout intrusive government monitoring111 but in institutions that are pervasivel sectarian the court has until recently perceived substantial risk that direct aid which is not limited by its nature to secular use may be used for religious purposes becau of that risk it has stated that comprehensive discriminating and continuing state surveillance will inevitably be required to ensure that the restrictions to secular use are obeyed and the first amendment otherwise respected but t hese prophylactic c ontacts it has held will involve excessive and enduring entanglement be tween state and church112 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30388crs30 113 id 114 521 us 203 1997 115 473 us 373 1985

aid to sectarian elementary and secondary schools because the court has pr esumed that such sc hools are pervasively sectarian the court has presumed to the contrary with respect to sectarian colleges hospitals and other social welfare orga nizations although it has held open the possibility that some of these agencies might be pervasively sectarian113 in its most recent decisions however th court appears to have abandoned the presumption that some religious institutions such as sectarian elementary and secondary schools are so pervasively sectarian that they are constitutionally ineligible to participate in direct public aid programs three years ago in agostini v felton114 the court for the first time overturned prior establishment clause decision and held it to be constitutional for public school teachers to provide remedial and enrichment services on the premises of pr ivate sectarian schools to children attending those schools who were eligible for such rvices under title i of the elementary and secondary education act in city of grand rapids v ball115 and aguilar v felton116 in the mid1980s the court had held such onpremises instruction to violate the establishment clause in several different ways first it said the pervasive sectarianism that characteriz ed the schools created substa ntial risk that the teachers even though they were employed by th public school system would subtly or overtly conform their instruction to th environment in which they teach 117 second it held the onpremises instruc tion by public employees created an appearance of symbolic union between church and state third it stated the aid provided substantial support to the educational function of the sectarian schools and thus to its religious mission finally in aguilar it held that the onsite monitoring necessary to ensure that the services th teachers provided remained wholly secular in nature would create an excessive tanglement between church and state in agostini the court overturned all of thes conclusions it abandoned the presumption that public school employ ee will inevitably be pressured by the pervasively sectarian surroundings of the private schools to inculcate religion it rejected the symbolic union c ontention as neither sensible nor sound it said the services did not supplant the schools regu lar curricula but were supplemental and in any event they were provided to th students and not directly to the schools finally it held that because the teachers were longer presumed to be likely to inculcate religion excessively entanglin g monitoring of their services was necessary the court concludedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30388crs31 118 agostini v felton supra at 230 119 120 sct 2530 2000 120 overturned in part were meek v pittenger 421 us 349 1975 and wolman v walter 433 us 229 1977accordingly contrary to our conclusion in aguilar placing fulltime employees on parochial school campuses does not as matter of law have the impermissible effect of advancing religion through indoctrination118 most recently the court in mitchell v helms119 upheld as constitutional an esea program which subsidizes the acquis ition and use of educa tional materials and equipment by public and private schools in the process the court overturned parts of two prior decisions which had held similar aid programs to be unconstitutional and which had been premised on the view that direct aid to pervasively sectarian institutions is constitutionally suspect120 more particularly the court found the provision of such items as computer rdware and software library books movie projectors television sets tape recorder s vcrs laboratory equipment maps and cassette recordings to private sectaria n elementary and secondary schools not to violate the establishment clause the justices could agree on majority opinion in helms but instead joined in three different opinions ju stice thomas joined by chief justice rehnquist and justices scalia and kennedy contended that the establishment clause ought to be interpreted to allow direct public aid to s ectarian schools so long as it is provided in accord with the principle of neutrality th clause prohibits re ligious indoctrination by government he stated but if aid is provided on neutral basis to public and nonpublic schools alike he argu ed there is violation of the establishment clause if the religious irreligious and areligious are all alike eligible for governmental aid one would conclude that any indoctr ination that any particular recipient conducts has been done at the behest of the government if the government is offering assistance to recipients who pr ovide so to speak broad range of indoctrination the government itself is not thought responsible for any particular indoctrination to put the point differently if the government seeking to further some legitimate secular purpose offers aid on the same terms without regard to religion to all who adequately further th at purpose then it is fair to say that any aid going to religious recipient only s the effect of furthering that secular purpose 120 sct at 2530 opini on of thomas j for that reason justice thomas argued whet her religious institution is pervasively sectarian or not is constitutionally irrelevant and that factor ought to be disavowed even if public aid is or can be used fo r religious purpose by recipient school he said it is constitutionally immate rial so long as the public aid itself is secular in nature and is distributed on the ba sis of religiously neutral criteria justice souter joined by justices stev ens and ginsburg contended on the other hand that the establishment clause bars aid supporting sectarian schools religioushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30388crs32 121 helms v mitchell supra at 2572 souter j dissenting 122 id at 2556 oconnor j concurring in the judgmentexercise or the discharge of its religious mission121 there is single rule guiding the implementation of this substantive pr inciple of aid he said instead he argued the court has looked at variety of factors whether the entities benefitted are pervasively religious whether the aid is provided directly by government or reaches the religious institutions only th rough genuinely independent choices of individuals whether the aid is itself secular in nature or divertible to religious use whether it is in the form of money or serv ices and materials whether it supplants or supplements traditional items of relig ious school expense and whether it is substantial neutrality is an important criterion but not sufficient one he argued in part because it has had at least three different meanings in the courts jurisprudence it has been used to m ean the median position between aiding and handicapping religion required by the establishment and free exercise clauses considered together benef it to religious institutions th at is secular and nonreligious in nature and most recently evenhandedne ss in the distribution of public aid to make the latter meaning the sole constitu tional criterion as justice thomas would he contended be sharp break with th framers understanding of establishment and this courts consistent interpretive course dir ect aid he concluded cannot consistent with the establishment clause be used for religious indoctrination and he found that in this case it had been so used justice oconnor joined by justice brey er authored the determinative opinion in the case and the one that as cons equence provides the most authoritative guidance on the current meaning of the establishment clause122 she agreed that neutrality is an important criterion but disagreed with what she termed the unprecedented view of justice thomas th at it is constitutionally sufficient one she disagreed as well with his view that actual diversion of government aid to religious indoctrination is c onsistent with the establishm ent clause our schoolaid cases often pose difficult questions at the intersection of the neutrality and noaid principles and therefore defy simple categor ization under either ru she stated and individual cases require the courts to draw lines sometimes quite fine based on the particular facts of each case under the primary effect test she argued direct government aid programs ca nnot define their recipients on the basis of religious criteria or result in religious indoctrination moreover she contended the aid itself must be secular in nature nd it must be restricted to s ecular use by the recipients justice oconnor rejected the ra tionale of the earlier cases of meek and wolman that any aid to the educational function of sectarian elementary and secondary schools inevitably advances religion because of the schools pervasive sectarianism presumptions of religious indoctrina tion she said are normally inappropriate when evaluating neutral school aid programs under the blishment clause for program providing secular aid on neut ral basis she cont ended the question is whether the aid has in fact b een diverted to religious use and that is an issue she said requiring proof of violation in th is case she found such proof to be lacking justice oconnor also reject ed the courts prior rule that intrusive government monitoring is necessary when public aid flows directly to pervasively religioushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30388crs33 entity in the past that necessity had itsel f been sufficient to render an aid program unconstitutional because it inevitably resu lted in excessive tanglement between government and the religious institutions that were monitored in this case both the statute and implementing state and local re gulations required some oversight of the religious institutions use of the governmentprovided instructional materials and equipment and justice oconnor found these requirements to be sufficient to deter and detect religious use of the public ai d and insufficient to render the program unconstitutional these decisions and opinions seem to ma ke clear that for majority of the justices those joining in the souter nd oconnor opinions direct public aid must still be limited to secular use by recipient religious institutions in order to pass muster under the establishment clause it also s eems clear that for different majority of justices those joining in the thomas and oconnor opinions the question of whether recipient institution is pervasively sectarian is longer constitutionally determinative factor thus there seems longer to be presumption that in some kinds of institutions such as sectarian ementary and secondary schools public aid will inevitably be used for purposes of re ligious indoctrination to show that particular aid program violates the blishment clause the court now appears to require proof that the aid has been used for religious purposes similarly the court also longer appears to require an intrusive monitoring of the institutions use of the public aid to be sure the limitation to secular use is honored alt hough some degree of review still seems to be required certain aspects of the charitable choice provisions that have been enacted or received some legislative action clearly satisfy these requirements the provisions do not give religious institutions any special entitlement to public aid ie eligibility is not determined on the basis of religious criteria charitable choice simply requires that religious entities be considered as eligible on the same basis as nonreligious institutions in addition the charitable choi ce provisions bar the use of public aid for sectarian worship instruction or proselytization ie they require that the aid be used only for secular purposes but it still appears to be the intent of charitable choice that the religious entities receiving direct public aid be able to employ their faiths in carrying out the subsidized programs and to the extent they do so constitutional question seems to exist even under the courts revised inte rpretation of the establishment clause moreover it deserves mention that justice oconnors opinion which proved decisive in mitchell simply left open the possibility that other factors might be constitutionally necessary in upholding the esea program at issue in the case she cited not only the factors that the aid was di stributed on the basis of neutral secular criteria that it was secular in nature and that there was little evidence of diversion to religious use all of which appear to be constitutional requirements for majority of the justices she noted as well that th statute required the aid to supplement and not supplant the schools own funds that title to the instructional materials and equipment had to remain in the local edu cational agency that funds ever reached the coffers of religious schools and that th ere were adequate safeguards to prevent the aid from being diverted to religious use and then she simply

concurringregardless of whether these factors are constitutional requirements they are surely sufficient to find that the program at issue here does not have the impermissible effect of advancing religion 120 sct at 2572 oconnor j concurring in the judgment this jurisprudential situation appears to leave charitable choice programs vulnerable to the possibility of litigation 2 indirect aid as noted the charitable choice measures that have been enacted or approved also apply in some in stances to aid under the pertinent programs that is received by particip ating religious organizations in the form of vouchers or certificates for such indirect aid it appears more certain that the various provisions of charitable choice can be implemented coherently and consistently with the establishment clause and recent decisions by the court do not appear to have materially altered the constitutional framework public aid that is received only indirectly by sectarian institutions has been given greater constitutional leeway by the court than direct aid such programs still must be religiously neutral in their design and have been held unconstitutional by the court where their structure has virtually guaranteed that the assistance flows largely to entities that it has presumed to be religionpervasive such as sectarian elementary and secondary schools123 however where the design of the programs has not dictated where the assistance is channeled but has given genuine choice to the immediate beneficiary the ta xpayer or voucher recipient the court has held the programs to be constitutional even t hough institutions it has presumed to be pervasively sectarian have benefitted124 justice powell in concurring opinion in witters summarized the critical factors as follows mueller makes the answer clear state programs that are wholly neutral in offering educational assistance to cl ass defined without reference to religion do not violate the second part of the lemon v kurtzman test because any aid to religion results from the private choices of individual beneficiaries thus in mueller we sustained tax deduction for certain educational expenses even though the great majority of beneficiar ies were parents of children attending sectarian schools we noted the states traditional broad taxing authority but the decision rested principally on two ot her factors first the deduction was equally available to parents of public school children and parents of children attending private schools second any benefit to religion resulted from the numerous private choices of indivi dual parents of schoolage children125 thus with respect to aid in the ch aritable choice programs that might be received by religious institutions in the fo rm of vouchers or certificates the courtshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30388crs35 126 justices thomas oconnor and souter all discussed the issu of indirect aid at length in mitchell justice thomas argued that th ere really is difference between direct and indirect aid programs benefitting sectarian sc hools he contended that even per capita direct aid program does not necessarily implicat the government in religious indoctrination by the recipient institutions not only because it was distributed on an evenhanded basis but also because all of the students in the privat sectarian schools were there because of the independent decisions of their parents those decisions he stated meant that the aid was provided pursuant to private choices justic oconnor and souter rejected this blending of the courts direct and indi rect aid cases per capita aid program justice souter asserted is far cry from awarding scholar ships to individuals one of whom make an independent private choice to use it at relig ious school justice oconnor contended the distinction remained important inter alia for purposes of endorsement when government provides aid to school on per capita basis and the sc hool uses it for religious indoctrination she said the reasonable observer would naturally perceive the aid program as government support for the advancement of religion moreover they both contended under justice thomas view there would be nothing to preclude the government from making direct money payments to churches under the pluralitys regime justice souter stated little would be left of the right of conscience against compelled support for religiondecisions suggest that it generally makes difference whether the institutions are deemed to be pervasively sectarian or not so long as the initial beneficiaries tanf clients for instance have genuine c hoice about where to redeem the vouchers or certificates ie they have range of religious and secular institutions from which to choose even pervasively sectarian instituti ons appear to be able to participate consistent with the establishment clause if on the other hand charitable choice is implemented in such manner that religious entity is the only viable choice for voucher recipient the program risks be ing found to violate the establishment clause the courts apparent abandonment in mitchell v helms supra of the presumption that some institutions are so pervasively sectarian that it is impossible to limit direct public aid to sectarian use does not seem to materially affect this framework for indirect aid126 as noted for indirect ai d the critical questions have been whether the aid is dist ributed on the basis of religiously neutral criteria and whether there is genuinely indepe ndent intervening choice between the governments initial distribution of the ai d and its ultimate receipt by religious entity conclusion as noted at the beginning charitable choi ce is an ongoing effort to widen the universe of religious organizations that can participate in publicly funded social welfare programs more specifically its intent appears to be to allow religious organizations to continue to practice and express their faiths in carrying out such programs rather than having to seculari ze their operations whether its provisions actually allow that to happen is matter of debate but to the extent that charitable choice does do so charitable choice appears to push the envelope of existing judicial interpretations of the establishment of religion clause of the first amendment concerning direct public funding of religi ous organizations even as revised by thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30388crs36 supreme courts recent decisions on the subject as consequence charitable choice may at least in some forms of its implementation invite litigation that tests the continuing viability of those interpretations as noted before two such cases appear to have b een filed to datehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30388crs37 appendix comparison of
