situations epa and other regulatory agencies have emergency powers under several statutes epa has used this authority in the wake of hurricane katrina to waive some regulatory requirements or to exercise its available enforcement discretion ie to decline to enforce against certain categories of violations under environmental statutes in addition to th statutes the robert t stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act provides waiver authority it allows the waiver of administrative c onditions that would otherwise prevent the giving of assistance by federal agencies if the

substances pollution contingency plan more commonly called the national contingency plan or ncp is the federal governments blueprint for responding to both oil spills and hazardous substance releases it is intended to provide national response capability and promote over all coordination among the hierarchy of responders and contingency plans under the plan epa is the lead federal response agency for spills occurring in inland waters or on land and the us coast guard is the lead response agency for spills in coastal waters and deepwater ports congress has broadened the scope of the ncp over the years since it was first developed in 1968 in response to an oil spill adding requirements for responses to hazardous substance spills as well as oil discharges and to releases at hazardous waste sites that require emergency removal actions for additional information see http wwwepagov oilspillncpoverhtmeditorialeditorial_0718xml of particular interest fo r this report are the waiver authorities under the clean water act superfund and the clean air act clean water act national contingency plan exception perhaps the most immediate need for regulatory flexibility in the immediate new orleans area related to evacuating trappe d floodwaters from new orlean s officials recognized that immediate removal was necessary to protect city residents and emergency responders from public health risks through exposure to waters that had mixed with human and animal sewage oil and gas from ruptured tanks and pipes and myriad chemicals that leaked from damaged proper ties and vehicles the most expedient option for unwatering the city was to pump and discharge the water into adjacent lake pontchartrain the discharge of pollutants to waters of the united states is typically regulated by permits under the clean water act c wa 42 usc 1251 et seq that are issued by states or in so cases epa under the acts national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes program both the statute and epa regulations however establish exceptions to the requi rement for discharge permit and epa determined that one exception under secti on 311 of the cwa was applicable to watering new orleans the existing llowable exception in this case found at 40 cfr 1223d involves flexibility already c ontemplated by epas rules not an express waiver of normal requirements section 311c of the clean water act authorizes the president to ensure immediate and effective removal of discharges from onshore facilities of oil and hazardous substances that pose substantial th reats to public health or welfare epa determined that this provision of the law applies to the floodwaters of new orleans because industrial facilities sewer systems and property from which oil and hazardous substances had been discharged constituted an onshore facility section 311c requires that removal of oil and hazardous substances be in accordance with an overall framework called the national c ontingency plan codified at 40 cfr

tanks other containers or vessels for stabilization purposes4 similarly the mississippi department of environmental quality issued an emergency order that addressed wastewater treatment systems it waived the initial notification requirement for an upset condition waived effluent monitoring requirements for 30 days allowed the discharge of water from tanks that were emptied of their previous contents and allowed owners and operators of wastewater plants to make repairs without prior notice5 clean water act section 404 permits section 404 of the clean water act establishes program to

authority the superfund law officially the comprehensive environmen tal response compensation and liability act or cercla provides the president and epa br oad authority and flexibility to respond to releases of hazardous substances section 104a1 of the act 42 usc 9604a provides that whenever there is release or threat ened release of hazardous substance or po llutant or contaminant that may present an imminent and substantial danger the president is authorized to act consistent with the national contingency plan to remove or arrange for the removal of and provide for remedial action relating to such hazardous substance pollutant or contaminant at any time including its removal from any contaminated na tural resource or take any other response measure consistent with the national contingency plan which the president deems necessary to protect the public health or welfare or the environment this authority can be invoked by onscen coordinators who have broad authority to conduct emergency response actions unde r the national contingency plan ncp further the ncp specifies in 40 cfr 300400e 1 that federal state or local permits are required for onsite respons actions conducted pursuant to cercla this exception does not apply to offsite activities however permits if required shall be obtained for all res ponse activities conducted offsite8 similar provisions regarding actions taken in response to the emergency are contained in relevant state laws for example the state of louisiana department of environmental quality emergency declaration9 provided that owners and operators of solid waste management facilities that had permits from the department before the hurricane are authorized to make all necessa ry repairs to restore essential services and the

of at permitted haza rdous waste disposal facility11 the burning of asbestoscontaini ng materials was also prohibited clean air act various provisions of the clean air act caa 42 usc 7401 et seq were also waived by epa in its response to hurricane katrina these waivers addressed concerns regarding the impact of the hurricane and subsequent flooding on energy supplies within the four states that suffered major damage as well as impacts in other states because of the importance of the gulf area as both producer of oil and gas and refiner of petroleum products ep temporarily waived regulations regarding gasoline and diesel fuel in all 50 states all of the fuel waivers were granted under the authority of section 211c4c of the clean air act as amended by p l 10958 the energy policy act of 2005 as amended this section allows epa to temporarily waive control or prohibition respecting the use of fuel or fuel additive if 1 the administrator determines that extreme and unusual fuel or fuel additive supply circumstances exist in state or region of the nation which prevent the distri bution of an adequate supply of the fuel or fuel additive to consumers 2 these circumstances are the result of natural disaster an act of god pipeline or refine ry equipment failure or another event that could not reasonably have been foreseen or prevented and not the lack of prudent planning and 3 it is in the public interest to grant the waiver four types of waiver were issued first the agency waived the volatility requirements that apply to gasoline sold during the summer driving season12 lower volatility gasoline is less prone to evaporation thereby wering emissions of the volatile organic compounds that contribute to the formation of groundlevel ozone the volatility requirements vary depending on region of the country making the supply of gasoline available in northern states unusable in the south during summer months the summer volatility requirements expire on september 15 of the year in most states in order to prevent suppl disruptions that might otherwise have occurred epa waived these requirements be ginning august 30 in alabama florida louisiana and mississippi and on august 31 extended the waiver to all 50 stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33107crs7 13 see katrina relief leads to some bendi ng of rules washington post september 20 2005 p d1 14 personal communication gary jonesi u s epa office of civil enforcement continuedand the district of columbia this waiver expired in most states in midseptember but on september 13 the agency extended the waiver until late ptember or october in california texas and phoenix arizona all of which require low volatility gasoline after september 15 all these waivers have now expired second to prevent supply disruptions th agency waived the requirement that diesel fuel sold for use in onroad vehi cles contain more than 500 parts per million of sulfur this waiver permitted higher sulfur diesel fuel which is allowed in construction equipment farm machinery nd other offroad vehicles to be used in highway vehicles such as trucks and bus sulfur content is normally limited because sulfur dioxide is pollutant that affects human health and the environment and because sulfur in exhaust gases in terferes with the effective operation of pollution control devices the agency deci ded however that the potential harm from shortages of compliant fuel outweighed the health and environmental impacts of noncompliance and waived the sulfur limit fi rst in the four states directly affected by katrina and then on august 31 in ll 50 states and dc through september 15 2005 the waiver was subsequently ex tended through october 5 in 25 mostly eastern and southern states and the di strict of columbia and extended again through october 25 in 13 southern and s outhwestern states the last of these waivers affecting florida mississippi kentucky iowa and nebraska expired in midnovember separately epa delayed the effective date of the texas low emission diesel program which was to have been implemented october 1 third beginning september 2 the agency waived the requirement that richmond virginia use cleaner burning reformulated gasoline rfg also because of fears of inadequate supply this waiver was later extended through october 20 similar waivers were granted to the st louis missouri houston galveston and dallasfort worth areas fourth on september 1 epa waived until september 15 certain low sulfur gasoline requirements that apply to the atlanta area atlanta has special gasoline sulfur requirements as part of its state implementation plan for compliance with the ozone air quality standard this waiver was subsequently extended through october 25 following hurricane rita the agency so raised the per gallon cap on sulfur in conventional gasoline produced at specific refineries for limited period of time and allowed the fuel to be sold in 25 states epa also used enforcement discretion to allow on temporary basis actions that would otherwise violate the clean air ac t or other statutes and regulations examples cited in the press included rules regarding vapor recovery at gasoline pumps and certification nd registration procedures for tank truck carriers13 epa provided crs information regarding 12 cases in which enforcement discretion or action assurances were granted several of these instances affected multiple facilities14 in addition the agency provided in formation concerning cases in whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33107crs8 14 continued september 21 2005epa or the department of justice exte nded consent decree compliance deadlines due to force majeure the clean air act also provides authority in section 110f for the president to declare national or regional energy em ergency during which the governor of an affected state could suspend for up to four months provisions of the state implementation plan for achieving air quality standards excess emission penalties and compliance schedules the president did not take such action in response to hurricane katrina issues raised by pr oposed new authority in recent years congress has been asked to grant additional authority to waive or to exempt activities from environmental regulations in number of situations eg to facilitate military training and readiness and to speed the construction of highway and transit projects to cite two of the most important and c ontroversial examples as far back as the carter administr ation there was discussion of whether environmental regulations s hould be waived to facilitate the siting or expansion of energy facilities thus the call for additional waiver authority in response to hurricane katrina may be viewed as part of broader effort to relax environmental requirements in the face of important policy objectives whether such authority is needed and if so how it should be structured are the key questions in the short term in the immediate aftermath of hurricane katrina it would not appear that environmental regulations posed an obstacle to local state federal or private response efforts as result the question of whether additional waiver authority is needed would appear to be be st addressed in the c ontext of longer term recovery efforts legislation as noted earlier in this report several bills have been introduced to provide longer term authority to waiv environmental regulations s 1711 for example would allow the epa to waiv or modify the application of any requirement that is contained in any law or regulation unde r the administrative jurisdiction of epa or that applies to an project or activity carried out by epa if it is in the public interest and is necessary to respond in timely and effective manner to situation or damage relating to hurricane katrina the bill would grant epa this authority for period of up to 18 months after the date of enactment s 1765 s 1766 and hr 3958 develope d by members of the louisiana congressional delegation to provide disaster relief nd recovery incentives for louisiana would allow the president in section 502 to issue emergency permits for any project carried out in re sponse to the disaster during twoyear period beginning on the date of enactment the presiden t would be given 30 days to approve or disapprove an application for such an emergency permit and the application would be considered approved if the president fa iled to act within the 30 days projects given emergency permits would be considered to be in compliance with anyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33107crs9 15 in addition to rep shadegg rep barton and sen inhofe have introduced legislation to expedite the construction of new refining capacity hr 3893 and s 1772 respectively these bills are not directly related to reco very from hurricane katrina and so are not discussed in this report hr 3893 whic h passed the house october 7 2005 would modify the permitting process for refineries but th changes would be permanent rather than waivers and are not directly related to recovery from hurricane katrina 16 information on refinery status was obtaine d from the us department of energys final gulf coast hurricanes situation report 46 dated january 26 2 006 available at httpwwwelectricitydoegovdocumentsgulfcoast_report_012706pdf applicable federal law inc luding regulations the provision makes distinction between environmental and other laws thus the section would waive minimum wage worker safety civil rights and many other protections in addition to environmental requirements fifth example hr 3836 would exped ite the construction of new refining capacity by requiring that permit appli cations under eight environmental laws be approved within 90 days of submittal unle ss the president determines that the benefits of increased refinery capacity ar outweighed by the costs of approving the permit this authority would apply to any refinery repair or reconstruction at an existing refinery in the area affected by hurricane katrina if undertaken as result of hurricane katrina15 as of january 26 2006 one refinery damaged by hurricane katrina with capacity of 120000 barrels per day remained closed and another larger refinery had resumed partial operation tw refineries aff ected by hurricane rita were also either shut down or operating below capac ity with 437000 barrels per day of capacity shut down16 issues these bills raise number of general questions some of which are addressed by one or more of the specific bills but that might help guide discussion on the broader question of whether additiona l waivers are desirabl and if so under what circumstances this is not meant to be an exhaustive list it focuses primarily on pollution regulations and waivers rather than scheduling siting and natural resource issues nevertheless some of the questions are sufficiently broad that they might be raised regarding such issues 1 what authority would waiver legislati on provide that the president and the epa administrator dont already have both through existing emergency and waiver authority in environmental statutes and forcement discretion in the short term the answer would appear to be very little as discussed above the clean water acts permit requirements did not prevent the di scharge of contaminated floodwater into lake pontchartrain regula tory requirements do not app ear to have inhibited the cleanup and disposal of debris the clean air act has not prevented the waiver of regulations affecting fuel distribution or th open burning of debris recognizing this the waiver authority provided in the bills discussed above appear s to be focused on medium term in which decisions regarding reconstruction will be made of the five bills one hr 3836 covers an indeterminate period during which reconstruction is undertaken as result of hurricane katrina while the other four provide authority for 18 months s 1711 or two years s 1765s 1766 hr 3958 the bills do not address the longer term in which the facilities granted waivers orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33107crs10 17 other legislation not directly tied to hurricane relief such as the b ill to expedite refinery construction approved by the house on oc tober 7 2005hr 3893 would apply anywhere in the united states 18 the department of the interior administers regulations affecting oil and gas drilling interiors fish and wildlife service togeth er with the commerce departments national marine fisheries service nmfs implements the endangered species act nmfs also administers fisheries regulations the counc il on environmental quality administers the national environmental policy act and its environmental impact assessment requirements 19 the two additional laws are the national historic preservation act and the national environmental policy actemergency permits would operate do they envision waivers or exemptions that would expire at the end of the 18month or twoyear reconstruc tion period or do they intend to provide permanent waivers for facilities constructed during that window if the latter how would permanent exemptions for some facilities be reconciled with tighter standards imposed on other facilities built before or after the postkatrina period 2 if additional waiver author ity were granted would it pply only to the four states directly affected by hurricane katrina to other states in which major disaster has been declared or to any of the 50 states if the waiver authority applied to any of the 50 states some might see opportunities for abuse unless the potential waiver authority were closely circum scribed on the other hand if expedited authority were provided only in the four states immediately affected by katrina some might see this as providing incentives to locate new refine ry capacity or other development in areas likely to experience future hurricane and flood damage the five bills described above generally apply in the area affected by hurricane katrina and to repairs of damage or reconstr uction made necessary by the hurricane17 3 what agencies and related statutes would be singled out for additional waiver authority if such authority were to be granted for example if environmental regulations are viewed as impeding recovery efforts is it only the environmental programs administered by epa or would the department of the interior commerce department and counc il on environmental quality be included18 s 1711 takes the former approach hr 3836 ddresses two additional laws outside the jurisdiction of epa19 while s 1765s 1766hr 3958 apply to all applicable federal laws and regulations 4 what about state and local requirements state and local requirements concerning air quality water quality and other environmental requirements may be as significant in regulating recovery efforts as the federal laws that could be waived and in most cases federal environmental laws are delegated to and administered by the states under parallel state statutes and regulations would cong resss waiving of federal laws preempt states determina tion to enforce its own requirements 5 if additional waiver authority were to be granted to the president or to the epa administrator what limits should there be on the laws and regulations that could be waived or modified fo r example s 1711 and s 1765s 1766hr 3958 would appear to allow waivers that would per mit ocean dumping of residue and debris orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33107crs11 filling of wetlands with opportunity for public review while some might see such actions as expedient others might poi nt to potential consequences for the health of the fishing industry and for the ability of the ecosystem to buffer future storms 6 in addition to possibly limiting or specify ing which laws are being waived should waiver authority be made less than total for example the federal agencies and departments being allowed to waive regu lations could be directed to assure compliance with the requirements that otherwise would apply to the extent practicable or they could be directed to consult with the agencies administering the laws that are being waived before taking actions thereby possibly avoiding needless harm the five bills are silent on this issue 7 the bills generally are silent as to what role if any courts are to play in reviewing agency grants of the waivers discussed here conclusion existing authorities in environmental laws have allowed number of waivers to provide flexibility in dealing with the impacts of hurricane katrina congress now faces questions for the longer term as it considers legislation that would provide for waivers of environmenta l regulations for reconstruc tion as congress considers such legislation what is lacking are specific examples of the types of activity that would constitute esse ntial components of reconstruction but that might not be permitted or could be delayed under current law and regulations
