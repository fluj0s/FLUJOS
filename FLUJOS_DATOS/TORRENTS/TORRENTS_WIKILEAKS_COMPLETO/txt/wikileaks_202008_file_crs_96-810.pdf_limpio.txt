congressional role patricia wertman economics division updated october 4 1996 abstract in light of current proposal to sell portion of international monetary fund imf gold holdings for the beneﬁt of poor countries this report examines gold sales by the imf during 19761980 imf gold sales require congressional reauthorization because the gold is owned by the imf however there is budgetary impact for the united stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs968101as april 30 1996 the imf held 103439916 ounces of gold imf financial statements april 1996 p 11 congressional research service the library of congresscrs report for congressreceived through the crs web96810 october 4 1996 international monetary fund imf gold auctions current proposal history and congressional role patricia wertman specialist in international trade and finance economics division summary the international monetary fund imf is proposing to sell 5 million ounces of gold equal to little less than 5 of its total gold holdings and at current market prices worth about 19 billion profits from the gold sale would be used to provide debt relief to poor countries although the imf now has sufficient votes to adopt the proposal the opposition of germany switzerland and italy has resulted in an indefinite delay gold sales held by the imf between 1976 and 1980 provided substantial profits 57 billion which were used to establish the imfs trust fund which was also used to assist poor countries gold sales then as now required an 85 voting majority of imf members because legal title to the gold resides with the imf imf gold sales do not have any budgetary implication for the united states and appropriation is therefore required under the bretton woods agreement act however the current proposal to sell 5 million ounces of imf gold presumably would require congressional authorization background the imf is proposing to sell at public auction 5 million ounces of its gold holdings to provide debt relief to poor countries this would amount to slightly under 5 of the imfs total gold holdings1 the gold was initially paid by member countries into the imf as onequarter of their capital subscriptions on its balance sheet the imf values nearly all of its gold at the former official price of sdr 35 per ounce currently about 5048httpwikileaksorgwikicrs96810crs2 2as of september 27 1996 the sdr was valued at

established at the imfs annual meeting on october 3 1974 membership of the interim committee corresponds to the membership of the executive board of the imf each member that appoints an executive director and each of the groups of members that elects an executive director appoints one member of the interim committee and more than seven associates the purpose of the interim committee is to 1 supervise the management and adaptation of the international monetary system 2 consider proposals by the executive board to amend the articles of agreement and 3 deal with sudden disturbances that pose threat to the international monetary system 5the gold agreements are contained in article v sec 11 and 12 article viii section 7 schedule b 2 3 and 7 schedule c 1 and schedule k 1 and 2with the market price of gold at 37970 per ounce sales to the world gold market would yield substantial profits2 the proposal is part of joint imfworld bank proposal intended to provide debt relief to subsaharan africa and other poor countries specificall the funds would be used to provide loans or grants to pay back loans provide d by the imf itself in this manner debt relief would be provided but the principle of nonforgiveness of imf loans would purportedly be maintained under article v sec 12 of the imfs articles of agreement approval of gold sales by the imf requires an 85 voting majority although the imf now has enough votes to force approval the proposal is delayed indefinitely3 germany switzerland and italy are reportedly opposed to the plan this report deals only with the public auctions of imf gold that occurred only during the period 19761980 it does not examine past imf gold sales to its members for the purpose of currency replenishment under the scarce currency provisions of art vii sec 2 ii of the original articles of agreement imf gold auctions brief history in the wake of the international monetary turmoil of the late 1960s and early 1970s the interim committee of the imf4 agreed in august 1975 on revised role in the international monetary system for gold the imf gold agreements were underpinned by separate g10 agreement on february 1 1976 not to peg the price of gold or increase their holdings of gold the gold agreements were incorporated in the second amendment of the imfs articles of agreement which became effective on april 1 19785 they were among the revised articles most controversial features in general it was agreed that gold should be removed from its central role in the international monetary system the official price of gold was abolished gold ceased to be the international monetary systems numeraire that is par values for exchange rateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96810crs3 6the understandings are stated in paragraph 6 3 of the press communiqué issued by the interim committee on august 31 1975 and paragraph 4 of the communiqué of june 12 1975 7details of the imfs gold auctions are shown in table 1 on page 6were longer set in terms of gold imf accounts were longer denominated in gold imf members were longer required to use gold in their transactions with the fund in short gold was demonetized the united states was the primary advocate of the demonetization of gold the gold agreements embodied in the second amendment were therefore largely identical with us policy at the time in the runup to the second amendment of the imfs articles of agreement the interim committee of the imf reached understandings that 50 million ounces or onethird of imfs gold would be sold beginning sometime prior to the effective date of the second amendment6 specifically the imf was given authority to undertake the public auction of 25 million ounces of gold for the benefit of developing countries that were imf members on august 31 1975 plus papua new guinea which was in the process of becoming an imf member this amounted to onesixth of the imfs gold holdings at the time further 25 million ounces were restituted or distributed to all countries that were imf members as of august 31 1975 at the official price of sdr 35 per ounce in the event that the imf did not complete disposition of the total 50 million ounces prior to the effective date of the second amendment as indeed it did not schedule b 7 of the revised articles of agreement provided for completion of the process the profits from the gold auctions were placed in trust fund to be used for balance of payments loans to developing countries on concessionary terms in addition share of the profits proportional to the size of countrys quota on august 31 was also transferred directly to each developing country after the effective date of the second amendment on april 1 1978 developing countries were permitted to take their share of the profits from gold sales in gold instead of currencies by submitting noncompetitive bid in the gold auctions the imf held total of 45 auctions over 4 years7 the exact terms of sale including pricing method place of delivery minimum acceptable amount to be bid and period allowable for payment changed over the course of the 4year auction program the imfs first gold auction was held on june 2 1976 the last on may 7 1980 initially 780000 ounces of gold were offered for sale at 69 week intervals beginning in march 1977 sales were set for the first wednesday of each month and the volume on offer was reduced to 525000 ounces 163 tons in june 1978 the amount for sale at each auction was reduced to 470000 ounces 146 tons in june 1979 to 440000 ounces 138 tons bidders were major private gold market dealers and the imfs auctions became regular feature of the gold market the amount of gold bid at each auction exceeded the amount offeredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96810crs4 8imf annual report 1978 p 70prices were established by two methods 1 the common or dutch price method in which all bidders pay the same common price that is the highest price at which the seller can sell all gold on offer and 2 the bid price method in which the bidder pays the price that he actually bid for the gold after march 1978 imf gold auctions used the bid price method exclusively prices tracked market prices sometimes somewhat above sometimes somewhat below the average fixing price of gold in london on the day of the auction8 in the environment of worldwide inflation that characterized the late 1970s gold prices were rising thus the highest average price obtained in any imf auction was 71212 per ounce occurring in february 1980 the official price of sdr 35 was equivalent to 4607 on the date of the auction the lowest average price 10940 per ounce occurred in september 1976 when the official price was equivalent to 4042 any return from the market sale of the imfs gold in excess of the official price for its gold holdings of sdr 35 per ounce comprised profit over the 4year period the imf sold total of 235175 thousand ounces 7316 tons of gold on competitive bids and 14803 thousand ounces 460 tons on noncompetitive bids total proceeds amounted to 57 billion of which 11 billion represented the capital value equivalent of sdr 35 per ounce and 46 billion represented profits contributed to the trust fund of the later amount 13 billion was awarded directly to 104 developing countries that were members of the imf on august 31 1975 the trust fund in brief the profits from the imfs gold auctions of the late 1970s were deposited in separate trust fund which was used for the benefit of the imfs poorer members in addition voluntary contributions and loans from other members plus income from investments and repayments of past loans made up the balance of trust fund resources seven members of opec the organization of petroleum exporting countries iraq kuwait libya qatar saudi arabia the united arab emirates and venezuela made irrevocable transfers of their share of the profits from the gold sales to the trust fund yugoslavia transferred onethird of its share of gold sale profits romania made loan to the trust fund equal to 10 of its share of gold sale profits the total value of these transfers amounted to 125 million the trust fund was established on may 5 1976 loans from the trust fund were disbursed in two periods the first period extended from july 1 1976 to june 30 1978 the second from july 1 1978 to february 28 1981 during the first period sdr 841 million over 1 billion in loans were extended to 43 countries during the second sdr 2150 million to 53 countries the final loan disbursement occurred on march 31 1981 eligibility was based on per capita income during the first period the 61 countries that were eligible for trust fund loans had to have per capita income of sdr 300 or less in 1973 about 350 during the second period total of 61 countries were also eligible but it was not the same 61 countries per capita income of 520 or less in 1975 was thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96810crs5 9pl 95147 91 stat 1227 signed october 28 1977 22 us code 286 c 1090

imfs board of governors congressional authorization presumably would be required under the bretton woods agreement act as amended it states unless congress by law authorizes such action neither the president nor any person or agency shall on behalf of the united states approve either the disposition of more than 25 million ounces of fund gold for the benefit of the trust fund established by the fund on may 6 1976 or the establishment of any additional trust fund whereby resources of the international monetary fund would be used for the special benefit of single member or of particular segment of the membership of the fund9 the gold auctions that occurred in the late 1970s were authorized as part of us acceptance of the second amendment to the imfs articles agreement this acceptance was contained in pl 9456410 signed by president gerald ford on october 19 1976 the imf gold auctions that were authorized in 1976 however had budgetary implications for the united states the gold was and is legally an asset of the imf11 thus similar action today would also not have any budgetary implicationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96810crs6 table 1 imf gold auctions summary statistics june 2 1976
