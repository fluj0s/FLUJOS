iraq may 13 2004 amy belasco specialist in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division congressional research service the library of congress adequacy of the armys fy2004 funding for iraq summary with the upsurge in violence in iraq in recent months members of congress and others have voiced concerns about whether the 373 billion received by the army in the fiscal year 2004 emergency supplemental pl108106 will be sufficient to fund operations for the remainder of the fiscal year or whether second supplemental is needed before the end of the fiscal year in recent testimony before the house armed services committee chairman of the joint chiefs of staff richard myers suggested that the army is facing shortfall of 4 billion for fy2004 and stated that the department of defense dod was assessing whether additional resources could be found from within either dods regular or current supplemental appropriations or whether more funds would be needed using monthly obligations data on the cost of army operations in iraq this report estimates the size of the potential army funding shortfall and assesses whether sufficient funding is likely to be available to fund the armys military personnel and operation and maintenance om requirements for its wartime missions in iraq in fy2004 as of the end of february 2004 combined funding obligations for iraq afghanistan and enhanced security for defense installations operation noble eagle for all services totaled 270 billion or about 32 billion less than forecast for the army in particular however obligations totaled 179 billion or about 16 billion higher than anticipated primarily because of operations in iraq based on crs estimates for iraq the army might face shortfall in fy2004 of from 53 billion to 71 billion for that mission depending on assumptions about likely monthly obligations for the remainder of the year at the same time however the army might be able to finance such shortfall using about 70 billion in funds that are available because certain other costs are proving to be lower than anticipated for example dod recently lowered rates charged to the services for transportation of personnel and equipment because those rates exceeded costs and obligations to cover enhanced security at defense installations are running about 2 billion less than forecast some peacetime training exercises which were slated for troops that are currently deployed have also been cancelled this report includes monthly data on the cost of operations in iraq afghanistan and enhanced security for defense installations for fy2003 and fy2004 to assess estimates of costs for the rest of fy2004 or for the fy2005 supplemental it could be useful for congress to have data beyond

the joint chiefs of staff general richard myers suggested that the army might be facing shortfall in fy2004 funding for its iraqi operations of about 4 billion according to general myers the department of defense dod is currently reviewing whether funds will be available to finance such an army shortfall using either regular dod appropriations or other dod funds crs2 within the fy2004 supplemental before the end of the fiscal year1 in recent hearings members of congress have questioned whether the army will be able to fund its operational needs in iraq without reducing funding for readinessrelated activities such as peacetime exercises2 earlier this year members also questioned the administration about its initial decision to wait until january 2005 to request supplemental for the next fiscal year fy2005 because this decision would require the military services to tap peacetime funding for occupationrelated needs3 on may 12 2004 the white house sent congress request for 25 billion contingent emergency reserve fund to support operations in iraq and afghanistan for the first part of fy20044 this report addresses only the adequacy of the armys fy2004 funding to cover its

maintenance om funding to fund both its wartime operations and support and peacetime funding for training and running military installations in fy2004 of that total about 374 billion finances army costs in iraq afghanistan and enhanced security for defense installations and the remaining 533 billion is covering costs for the armys peacetime activeduty personnel and om support in fy2004 the armys supplemental om funding is about equal to its war and occupationrelated funding5 funds from either warrelated or peacetime operations as well as funds currently budgeted for other services could be tapped to meet shortfall of the 652 billion appropriated to dod in the fy2004 emergency supplemental the army received about 373 billion or about 60 of the funding6 with the largest number of forces deployed in iraq and afghanistan the army is the service that is most vulnerable to unanticipated changes in cost the recent announcement by dod that additional forces will be remaining in iraq because of ongoing conflict has heightened concerns about the adequacy of funding in fy20047 because of the armys key role and vulnerability this report focuses on the cost picture facing the army in the second half of fy2004 and in particular on military personnel and operation and maintenance costs because these accounts pay for the daytoday operating costs in iraq and cannot easily be deferred decisions about investment costs on the other hand typically take longer time and can if necessary be made at later time estimating the potential shortfall and available resources to reflect uncertainties in estimating total costs in fy2004 this report presents range of estimates of the potential shortfall and outlines the assumptions underlying each estimate the estimates use dods reports of contractual obligations to date and other data8 the report also includes rough estimate from dod of the additional expenses that may be associated with the current higher operating tempo 5 in fy2004 the armys regular om funding is 250 billion and its warrelated funding is 246 billion 6 crs report rl32090 fy2004 supplemental appropriations for iraq afghanistan and the global war on

because of the monthtomonth variation in obligations data monthly obligations sometimes referred to by dod as the monthly burn rate have varied considerably for each of the three missions for example from low of 32 billion in february 2003 to high of 65 billion in january 2004 for iraq from low of 180 million in february 2004 to high of 850 million in december 2003 for afghanistan and from low of 200 million in november 2002 to high of 11 billion in september 2003 for enhanced security see table a1 in the appendix see also table a2 for army examples10 the volatility of monthly obligations may reflect the stage of the operation eg the buildup for iraq in the spring of 2003 variations in operating tempo or the signing of large contracts in particular month eg the army signed large support contract in january 2004 obligations measure the cost of contracts signed and military and civilian checks issued in given month not the actual expenses in given month11 armys warrelated costs total

total due to rounding crs7 estimating the armys potential shortfall in fy2004 in recent testimony general richard myers chairman of the joint chiefs of staff told the house armed services committee that the shortfall for fy2004 could be about 4 billion14 the basis for this estimate is unclear but it may be based on the difference between the average monthly burn rate for fy2004 obligations to date of 53 billion and the projected monthly burn rate for the year of 51 billion plus 700 million to keep 20000 additional troops for three months15 dod is currently conducting midyear review to better determine the size of the likely shortfall and resources available to offset that shortfall the discussion below presents several estimates of the size of the armys potential shortfall in fy200416 the estimates rely on three alternative assumptions about average monthly costs or burn rates for military personnel and operations and maintenance spending longerterm average reflecting costs between february 2003 and february 2004 that covers from the beginning of the iraq buildup through the most recent dfas data available shorter average reflecting costs to date in fy2004 and tailored estimate based on steady state costs prior to the latest upsurge in violence with an adjustment to reflect dod plans to keep 20000 troops incountry and higher operating tempo costs in each case these estimates are compared to dods forecast of anticipated obligations based on the fy2004 emergency supplemental military personnel cost shortfall may be manageable for military personnel the key factors in determining costs are force levels and the extent of reliance on reserve forces table 4 compares dods forecast with three estimates of potential costs for military personnel in iraq for fy2004 using longerterm average an average based on fy2004 and tailored estimate adjusted for recent developments based on these three estimates the army could face shortfall in military personnel funding ranging from 120 million to 600 million in fy2004 the army has total of 411 billion in military personnel funding from the fy2004 regular and fy2004 supplemental appropriations total force levels for operation iraqi freedom including both support forces and forces incountry were slated to drop from highpoint of 252000 in april 2003 to 220000 in september 2003 to 157000 by september 2004 force levels in 14 house armed services committee transcript of hearing iraqs transition to sovereignty april 21 2004 available from reuters news service 15 crs calculations based on dfas monthly obligations reports 16 these estimates exclude 12 billion in army investment funds relatively small part of the total of 36 billion for the army for operations in iraq because decisions about use of procurement funds can be delayed because those funds are available for three years crs8 country were projected to drop from about 165000 in april 2003 to 147000 in september 2003 to 99000 in september 200417 during the spring of 2004 troop levels were to be higher temporarily during the rotation of troops when those initially deployed to iraq swapped out with newlyarriving troops the army provides

draw down in the fall after major combat operations were completed followed by higher costs during the winter and spring of fy2004 for the planned rotation of forces when both incoming and outgoing forces were to be retained temporarily b average during fy2004 includes part of the buildup for the rotation of forces planned for the spring of 2004 c adjusted baseline projects the remainder of fy2004 using the cost in october 2003 with an adjustment of 350 million to cover the cost of keeping an additional 20000 military personnel incountry for six months costs for army military personnel were forecast to grow from 628 million in october 2003 to high of 930 million in march 2004 at the height of the swapout and then fall by the end of the year to 750 million per month the armys costs do not drop in proportion with force levels perhaps because of dods plans to increase 17 figures from osdc briefing to house budget committee february 2004 total forces include transients forces supporting the mission in the region and backfill for deployed forces crs9 its reliance on reserves who cost about six times as much in incremental pay costs18 dod is also using supplemental funding to finance the cost of paying about 30000 activeduty forces above its planned strength levels because the estimate of 600 million shortfall relies on an average that reflects the higher force levels in fy2003 when the army was conducting major combat operations that estimate may be less credible using an estimate based on fy2004 obligations to date has the advantage of more closely capturing current force levels but the disadvantage of including spikes in costs during the winter of 2003 when incoming troops were being trained and the spring of 2004 when outgoing forces handed over duties to their replacements the tailored estimate has the advantage of capturing the armys costs before the current buildup for the rotation of forces and also reflecting dods latest plans to keep 20000 additional forces incountry for three to six month period to be conservative this estimate assumes the additional 20000 troops will be kept for six months on the other hand using an average for october 2003 may not capture the higher costs associated with dods plans to increase its reliance on reserve forces whose incremental costs are considerably higher19 given the relatively small size of the estimated shortfalls and the uncertainty in these estimates it appears likely that the army will have sufficient resources for its military personnel in iraq if however there is shortfall the army may be able to use resources originally slated for personnel rotations which may be delayed for those troops deployed in iraq or curtail current plans to increase reliance on more costly reserve forces om costs for iraq likely to exceed forecast resources for the armys operation and maintenance om activities depend on wide variety of factors including force levels transportation costs operating tempo and overseas support costs the cost of operating and maintaining equipment varies with the size of the forces deployed and the intensity of usage which in turn depend on the types of operations conducted the cost of supporting troops overseas is also considerably different than peacetime rates because of longer supply lines higher costs for contracts high security costs and the need to build and maintain facilities overseas 18 during osdcomptroller briefing to the house budget committee congressional budget office on contingency operations estimating funding execution february 2004 dod officials stated that the incremental costs for activated reservists was about 6000 per month compared to 1000 per month for activeduty forces 19 for example increasing the reserves share of total force levels by 2 would increase costs by about 36 because of the higher incremental cost of activating reservists crs10 for the three estimates shown in table 5 below all of these factors come into play the estimates in table 5 suggest that the army could require additional resources to cover om costs in 2004 in iraq ranging from 54 billion to 71 billion the extent of the potential shortfall varies with the estimating assumption table 5 army fy2004 operation and maintenance costs for iraq estimates vs forecast in billions of dollars estimated estimate monthly

substantial onetime costs associated with the initial deployment of forces and equipment eg 8 billion in transportation costs major combat operations in the spring of fy2003 and spikes in october 2003 and january 2004 which reflect large logcap contracts to build facilities and support troops b average during fy2004 includes some costs which appear to be onetime or may cover future costs such as stocking up supplies for higher optempo in october 2003 and large logcap contracts signed in october 2003 and january 2004 to build facilities and support troops over the coming months c adjusted baseline projects the remainder of fy2004 uses monthly estimate of 16 billion reflecting reported obligations in february 2004 and adjustments of dods estimate of 11 billion to cover the cost of keeping an additional 20000 military personnel incountry for six months and 20 billion to replenish spare parts and repair equipment after period of more intense operations relying on longerterm average has the advantage of smoothing out temporary dips and spikes in obligations data on the other hand using that 13 month average to project future costs includes substantial onetime costs that would not be relevant to costs in the remainder of fy2004 for example 8 billion to transport military equipment supplies and personnel to the iraqi theater and high operating tempo costs because of major combat operations conducted during the spring of 2003 these higher costs are offset to some extent by including february crs11 2003 the initial month of buildup and other months when om obligations were low using shorter average that reflects experience in fy2004 has the advantage of excluding those initial costs on the other hand included in the 11 billion in om costs in the first part of fy2004 are spikes of 1 billion for optempo costs and 16 billion for large support contract in october 2003 and 12 billion in january for another large support contract those support contracts may include onetime costs to build facilities for troops as well as several months of future support costs including those expenses could skew the monthly average for the period and therefore overstate costs for the remainder of the year to develop an estimate that captures both the most recent costs and higher costs for the rest of the year due to the current upsurge in violence in iraq crs created third estimate that estimate assumes monthly om costs of about 16 billion based on february obligations and additions of 11 billion to support the additional 20000 troops for the remainder of the year and 20 billion to replenish parts and maintain equipment in theater after the current surge in operations20 under those assumptions the army could face shortfall of about 54 billion similar to the estimate based on longerterm average potential ways to cover higher army om costs for iraq to cover potential shortfall of from 53 billion to 71 billion for its higherthananticipated costs in iraq the army could tap several sources from lowerthananticipated costs and transfers including lower costs for enhanced security at army bases lower transportation costs lower supply costs deferred peacetime training activities transfers of funds from the iraqi freedom fund and transfer of investment funds table 6 includes estimates for these potential savings totaling 67 billion to 70 billion the army could use some of the savings below such as lower transportation costs without transferring funds between appropriation accounts in other cases such as savings from lower security costs at air force installations dod would need to request transfer of funds from the congress with about 2 billion 20 in testimony before the house armed services committee on april 212004 general myers chair of the joint chiefs of staff estimated that it would cost dod about 700 million to keep an additional 20000 troops in iraq for three months that total included both military personnel and om costs to be conservative crs doubled that figure assuming that those troops would be kept for six rather than three months the 20 billion estimate for higher optempo draws on dfas data showing that in october 2003 the army obligated 12 billion for higher optempo costs just before period of heightened operations as well as other information that amount was about six times as much as during the next four months crs12 remaining in its general transfer authority for fy2004 supplemental funds dod can move monies between accounts with congressional approval21 lower costs for security at defense installations although the army is likely to face higher om costs in iraq dod may have included higherthan necessary funds to cover the cost of providing enhanced security for defense installations22 if monthly costs in the rest of the year reflect experience through february 2004 enhanced security may cost about 21 billion less than forecast obligations to that date are about 550 million less than forecast for the army and about 740 million less than forecast for the air force23 table 6 potential ways to finance the armys higher om costs for iraq in fy2004 in billions of dollars source of

deferral of peacetime training slated for troops that 07 are deployed transfers from the iraqi freedom fund 17 to 20 transfer of investment funds unknown total 67 to 70 sources crs estimates based on obligations reports from the defense finance accounting service notifications to congress of transfers and other sources these savings may reflect in part decision by dod use civilian contractors rather than activated reservists to provide security at defense installations authority to use civilians was initially provided in the fy2003 dod authorization act24 civilian contract security personnel may cost substantially less than the 72000 year average cost of activating reservist cited by dod 21 congress provided dod with 3 billion in general transfer authority in the fy2004 emergency supplemental see section 1101 in pl108106 22 dod refers to this mission as operation noble eagle 23 to transfer funds from the air force to the army dod would need to submit prior approval reprogramming to congress for some time the army has been providing security services for many air force bases including providing 8000 reservists some of those services may now be provided by civilians 24 see section 332 in pl 107314 crs13 lower transportation and other support costs dod has experienced unanticipated decreases in some support costs because of the higher operating tempo due to the war and occupation of iraq and afghanistan for example the additional demand for transportation services and spare parts generated by iraq and afghanistan has reduced the average cost of providing spare parts and transportation services in part because overhead costs are spread over higher workload25 dod recently transferred about 1 billion to army om accounts to reflect the fact that the prices charged to army and other commands for transportation costs were higher than necessary to cover costs the transportation command lowered its rates for the current year for the same reason26 together these decisions reduce costs for both peacetime and warrelated operations below the funding that was included in the fy2004 regular and supplemental appropriations acts for similar reasons other supplies and services may also be overpriced fuel costs may also be less than anticipated because kuwait has provided u s forces with free fuel27 deferral of peacetime training exercises because of the large number of army troops deployed considerably larger than anticipated when the fy2004 budget was constructed some planned exercises may not be conducted this year savings from those exercises could be applied to finance the armys operations in iraq28 although the army will need to conduct training exercises when those troops return om funds for this years exercises may be greater than needed transfers from the iraqi freedom fund in fy2003 congress provided 158 billion in the iraqi freedom fund flexible transfer account dod is 25 although dod estimates of supplemental costs are intended to reflect incremental costs they do not appear to have captured the effect of spreading fixed costs for transportation and other supply services over the much larger base of wartime and peacetime usage when prices for supplying parts or providing services exceed costs cash accumulates in the working capital funds which provide those services beyond the amount needed to carry out business that excess cash can either be transferred to the customers the services whose om accounts finance these costs or dod can lower the rates charged to the services 26 the recent lowering of rates is in addition to congressional actions in the fy2004 dod appropriations act as matter of policy the organizations that stock supplies or provided services known as working capital funds set prices to cover but not exceed the cost of providing goods and services to the various commands when the prices charged exceed the cost prices are cut in the following year or customer accounts receive refunds see for example section 8104 in hrept 107283 see also srept 10887 for reductions of 200 million in the air force working capital fund to reflect excess requirements and reduction of 107 million in army working capital fund reductions p 41 and p 31 the defense authorizers also reduced working capital funds for the same reason excess cash balances see for example hrept 108354 p 648 to reduce cash balances in the working capital funds congress directed dod to transfer cash in the working capital funds to the om customer accounts 27 dod generally relies on the most recent cost factors used by the services to estimate the incremental cost of military operations those factors would not reflect the effects of the higher workload information from services 28 the army could apply savings in operating costs to warrelated operating costs without submitting transfer request crs14 permitted to transfer those funds to individual appropriation accounts five days after notifying congress to date dod had transferred about 12 billion of those resources to army om to fund body armor for troops in iraq repair of oil facilities and administrative support costs of the coalition provisional authority29 dods forecast of obligations included only funds from the fy2004 emergency supplemental transfers of fy2003 monies thus provide additional resources to finance expenses experienced in fy2004 and so could reduce the size of the estimated shortfall outlined above dod also may be holding additional funds in the iraqi freedom fund iff to be transferred to the services at later date for example there appears to be about 300 million still available from the fy2003 iraqi freedom fund that could be provided to the army about 600 million may also remain available from fy2004 iff monies that could be transferred to cover higher than anticipated army costs transferring procurement funds from emergency supplementals to recapitalize or replace stocks damaged or destroyed in wartime the fy20004 emergency supplemental included 59 billion in procurement and research development test evaluation funds some of which could be transferred to cover higherthananticipated operating costs if necessary30 dod has required additional justification from the services for use of these procurement monies because of concern that the funds be used only for the equipment most likely to be needed adequacy of information to assess warrelated costs the variation in the estimates above and in the underlying obligations data suggests that congress may need more detailed information on costs in iraq and afghanistan particularly in order to assess the fy2005 supplemental although dod has provided monthly obligations data by mission those data are inherently variable it might be more useful to track outlays which might better reflect costs incurred it might also be useful for dod to provide congress with monthly manpower levels by mission since september 2001 planning assumptions and the cost factors associated with maintaining forces incountry or in the surrounding areas dod did not provide this information in its justification materials submitted with the fy2002 fy2003 or fy2004 supplemental requests with that information congress could 29 an additional transfer of 450 million for coalition provisional authority expenses appears to be pending 30 see table 3 in crs report rl32090 fy2004 supplemental appropriations for iraq afghanistan and the global war on terrorism military operation reconstruction assistance by stephen daggett larry nowels curt tarnoff and rhoda margesson dod would have to get approval from congress to transfer funds between appropriations account some of this funding may already have been allocated to the services crs15 better assess dods request taking into account anticipated troop levels during fy2005 in addition presentation that segregates onetime from recurring costs could be particularly helpful in assessing future requests for supplemental funds in the years to come since much of the fixed cost of deploying equipment and setting up facilities for troops in iraq has been incurred table a1
