assessment lecture given on 12 may 1961 thank you looks like an acc this is may the 12th 1961 somebody hand an emeter would you thats all right now i dont want you to get the idea that this course consists basically of formal lectures of course in most accs i back up the instructors and i give them all the information i can but i actually seldom go over individual cases in this particular course im going over individual cases with finetoothed ron i see your auditors reports every day and try to keep it on the wheels but what can happen here is that you go around in fog of some kind or another and you got some kind of burning question or big withhold or dissatisfaction or something like that and i dont hear about it all right if that takes place why the obvious thing to do is to write despatch or grab ahold of when you see i try to get down here every afternoon despatch will get to very easily it has hardly any distance to go at all because youre in the middle of hcos worldwide communications and we really keep them whirring around here we dont know how well they do in london but here we do fine all right matter of fact theyre doing all right in london now now ive got to talk to you about assessment and thats what this is all about assessment boy i tell you there seems to be an awful lot to know about assessment that i considered was leadpipe cinch dont get the idea that what youre doing is experimental it is not experimental but ill tell you that trying to find out what you do wrong with it and how to communicate how to do it right is complex drill all of itself and if theres anything thats being worked with it is that but that is always worked with that always has to be worked with how do you communicate this information so that people can do it without additives or alteris ill give you some simple rundown i say well you look at the pc fixedly and sneeze and that fixes it all up you see thats all dandy and then what do i hear well do you sneeze in eflat minor laughter what is the violence and duration of the sneeze laughter is this done in an auditing session do you use model session form to put this sneeze in or is it special form now this of course isnt bounded by the auditors code is it laughter and particularly this changes of course everything we have been doing before those things are pretty inevitable now i dont mean to be sarcastic im just showing you what happens im not being sarcastic because this is too true it is too painfully true and it works like this you in trying to equate relatively simple fundamental in scientology at this time are of course picking up fundamental which sits right in the middle of anybodys case and you tend to blow off little bit of confusion you know in trying to grab hold of it and it isnt as if i were teaching you how to run diesel engine what little oddball ideas you had about diesel engines would blow off in hurry i could teach you how to run diesel engine very complicated to even you girls you see just bang itd be hardly anything to it id show you well theres this and theres that and theres the other thing id have to read book and find out how myself first but that would be very easy but that isnt what were teaching and the data that were teaching goes straight into the middle of reactive computation sop goals right here at this minute is doing this exact thing and nothing else it is exactly reversing how the mind got aberrated and it reverses that exact process now im not trying to hand out any stink cabbages to myself about this having been hot piece of mental prestidigitation to get this job done the best evidence of that is the fact that it had not been done before all im trying to do here is show you that the most hidden factors of the mind were of course the things that aberrated the mind because nobody has ever freed mind before so therefore they must have been the most concealed or they would have gotten asised just as simple as that see almost anybody could have come along and asised them if they hadnt been very hidden so although sop goals at first glance looks very simple it is actually undoing all of the factors which made mind plow in made persons ability run downhill and it consists of all the solutions that person adopted to fix up oddball circumstances that havent anything to do with anything anymore ever and probably had nothing to do with it then here is this little fellow hes playing out here on the hill and hes just having marvelous time and he goes around and listens to panpipes and dances with the goats and hes free as the breeze and everything is wonderful and the next thing that we hear of him hes general of armies laughter and hes miserable and hes upset and hes eventually assassinated what happened who wouldnt want to have the kind of mind that could be happy doing something simple who wouldnt want to have this kind of mind well i dont know anybody who wouldnt want to have it in the long run because basically what youre afraid of is getting bored well how come you get bored it must be what youre doing is somehow or another insufficient or inadequate to the demands of the environment well this little boy dancing on the hill amongst the goats boy he must have been invalidated within an inch of his life it must have been proven to him conclusively that the game of playing with goats was game to be played and hes lost very simple game in the favor of very complicated game which he never did enjoy what happened to him well something had to happen to him first he himself had to get somebody involved in that kind of situation on the backtrack he himself had to take little boy playing and dancing with the goats and push him into position where he assumed enormous responsibility for him to have the achilles heel eventually of falling for the same trap well youd certainly never look for that because were totally educated to believe that everybody became victim now ill show you how far weve gone dick was commenting the other day on the old tapes of the philadelphia lectures and he says youre talking about theres comments in there about being trapped in the mest universe and so forth well we all kind of thought that at that time and it was sort of obvious and so forth well you couldnt have been trapped in the physical universe unless you trapped somebody in it well who would have looked for this oddball factor the psychologist knew the stimulusresponse he knew that if you kicked bill bill was kicked that was stimuli of some kind or another but if the kick was stimuli then bill was restimulated into doing something but he didnt say what he totally didnt look at the other end of the line at all what was the consequences of kicking bill it isnt stimulusresponse factor at all its an overtmotivator sequence to get kicked in the butt it is necessary to kick somebody in the butt you get the idea i mean its this idiot simplicity you had to open yourself up on this postulate being kicked in the butt is bad and people dont want to be kicked i am people therefore i dont want to be kicked in the butt therefore i must resist being kicked in the butt therefore i am certainly going to be kicked in the butt and theres your overtmotivator sequence at work in the most inelegant stupid form who would have looked for these factors well over course of about eleven years weve got them rounded up the proof of the pudding now is the fact that we can go ahead and do things with cases that have never been done before with an accuracy or if it is done with an accuracy we can do it with an accuracy if it is done with an accuracy in other words we can advance case accurately almost as if we set it up and say itll be here itll be there itll be there and thisll happen and thisll happen and thisll happen as total predict as long as everything done with the case is done with complete accuracy now we know all the things that have to be done with case now there are only two reasons why people dont clear ill expand that because you are studying these other things theres three reasons why people dont clear inadequate knowledge of technical application that would be your first largest heading person doesnt know the trs doesnt know how to read an emeter doesnt know model session and doesnt stay inside the auditors code you see now actually im not giving you there are whole large number of these things to know there are literally thousands thats not so see i stated them all when i just made that statement technical application just includes those things next is the accuracy of assessment the assessment must be done with total accuracy there is not such thing as slightly correct assessment in spite of the dianetic axiom that absolutes are unobtainable there is such thing as perfect assessment it is an absolute perfect assessment now it is very strange and very peculiar that there could be such thing as perfect assessment because there isnt any such thing as perfect mind heres an artificial perfection which you are trying to attain on case and it is highly artificial extremely so and it has to be done exactly right and were learning more and more how to do it exactly right by finding out the things youre doing wrong thats good way to learn though isnt it dont make blunders though to teach other people we dont need those we got enough blunders at the present time i have insufficiency of havingness of blunders all right what do people have to know well evidently you have to invent certain things and just to conclude this three the third one is an incomplete prehav scale you dont have the full prehav scale at this moment and there could be the possibility that cases could hang up for missing link in the prehav scale but that is not very serious because if you have perfect assessment and the case hung up in clearing when you did get the big full dress prehav scale all that would be necessary to do is level those levels on the prehav scale that have not been flattened because they werent there and the case will blow through to clear i mean its as easy as that all youve done is put little bit of wait on the line well man has been waiting on this planet alone for several thousand years so i think we can stand few days i got two stenographers typing themselves ragged right now trying to get that scale for you just as though man hasnt been waiting for it for that long well how do you do right assessment if that is the most single important thing to do how do you do it well apparently theres at the present time as many ways to do an assessment almost as there are people apparently there are lots of ways to do assessments well the more i look at it the more it narrows down to the solemn fact that theres only one way to do an assessment to achieve perfect assessment i havent really found any question about it it isnt well you could do this or you could do that that isnt the case every time you look over two things you could do with an assessment one inevitably emerges as infinitely superior to the other it sorts itself out we might not know at this instant everything there is to know that we have to tell you so that you will never make mistake on an assessment see you might still be able to invent one laughter see there might be something there that never quite gets through im not being sarcastic theres distinct possibility this is the case therefore we have to take every precaution that this doesnt happen now the first thing then you must know is that in sop goals there is such thing as nearly correct assessment there is only one correct assessment it is an absolute now we said absolutes were unobtainable but remember were only attaining an absolute upon an aberration and thats very easy to do there is one assessment for one case and that is it now whats odd is in the first few days of running of case id say in the first few hours of run anything up to thirty forty hours of run do you know that you can reassess at any time and get the same assessment you know that you can always reassess the auditing of an incorrect assessment does not wipe out the correct assessment thats another leadpipe fact you can just wrap around that and hug it to your bosom because its very fortunate fact for you it is extremely fortunate it means that you can make mistake with case and audit it for some little time 25 30 40 50 60 180 hours and still do right assessment on the case afterwards isnt that fascinating of course youre going to have trouble with the case the whole distance hes going to be arc breaky and blowoutthewindow and hes going to be this and hes going to be that and he may be upset or not progressing the whole prehav scale may be getting kind of live and hotted up and we cant quite figure out why the whole scale is getting hotter and hotter its just incorrect assessment so there might be difficulties in trying to hold somebody still and audit them on an improper assessment that only technical skill could overcome and it isnt true that an absolutely perfect assessment always audits with perfect ease see that has its bumps too because you may make technical blunder or something of this sort as you run that youll have to patch up like mad and the case is pretty trembly now lets take good look at this if you can always do right assessment even if wrong one has been done then the answer to vast difficulties which youre having with case or auditing case for 30 40 50 hours without marked and distinct improvement has as its answer those are the difficulties auditing case and the case is just having one awful horrible time and you just practically cant hold the case in session and the case is all arc broke and all of this stuff is going on answer reassess perfectly all right wrong assessment it was one of these almostright assessments if youd just asked one more question or just two more goals it would have been right but you missed that criticism here of having missed it only if you get out of here and start missing assessments and i start hearing about it back over the lines again ill write the postmaster and have him turn in your thetan laughter but if you did an almostcorrect assessment and the case apparently ran but just seemed to go on running that would be the symptom the case just seems to go on running forever and seems about to put in the next 280 hours going the same way marked change is occurring for every given 125 to 15 20 hours of auditing see marked change on sop goals answer reassess difficulties with sop goals would come about through your inability to apply things right technically lets say your trs are all out and you sit there and you look at your emeter and its all sort of crosseyed and this thing keeps falling madly the emeter keeps falling and it keeps falling and you say peanuts you see its you say peanuts and there it goes you say peanuts there it goes and you say well peanuts are sure null laughter you can make technical blunder of this character you see and get all wound up in ball if your confront is bad your pc may arc break consistently and continually through just horribly bad technology i mean terribly poor administration of the trs model session and emetering youre missing the living daylights out of the rudiments you know the man drops off the pin on pt problem and you say well thats flat do you have pt problem bang well thats flat im glad we havent got to handle pt problem today and then your pc starts blowing out of session and getting snarly and so forth oh you can make those blunders but the symptom of an imperfect assessment is you with nearly perfect handling of model session trs and emeter have one hell of time keeping him insession and hes always arc broke with you thats the result of an imperfect assessment its not correct assessment thats all the thing to do is reassess now lets answer this question do we care how much time you spend doing an assessment we do not care there are ways to do assessments more rapidly but there is such thing as doing an assessment more accurately you can be very slippy doing an assessment you can be quite rapid you can be quite positive and very easy and very sure of yourself and come out with the exact answer at the other end or you can go at it slowly and ploddingly and chopping it all up and chewing everything up and spitting it all out and grinding and so forth if your model sessions any good you can keep the pc insession matter how grim he thinks this is but i dont care if you took 25 to 50 hours doing an assessment i would much rather you did perfect assessment than fast imperfect one for instance i wouldnt care in an hgc if they took whole intensive of 25 hours just to do one assessment i wouldnt care or if this situation took place i would consider this perfectly all right fellow does an assessment it takes him 8 or 9 hours or 10 or 12 hours or something like this and he did an assessment on this pc he runs the pc for 5 or 6 hours and theres change and theres gain on the pc i wouldnt take it amiss at all if he just scrapped that original assessment and neither should even paying pc scrapped that original assessment and did another assessment from scratch doing assessment saves time because the accuracy of the assessment if perfect prevents an infinity of auditing hours without clearing so you have well look youd have thousand hours of an assessment would at least be finite number of hours of processing and if an assessment took thousand hours to do perfect assessment thats utterly ridiculous but if it did it would still be better than doing sloppy fast one thousandhour assessment would probably clear the fellow in hundred or two you see so youd have the totality of time in auditing finite period of twelve hundred hours but an imperfect assessment would give you an infinity of auditing hours and that would be that and this is the arithmetic that has to do with an assessment he just never would get clear so theres finite auditing period to an imperfect assessment it will go on forever and that is that and itll be very rough auditing too and itll just go on forever now there is the advantage then of perfect assessment how long should an assessment take well when youre learning how its going to take lot longer than when you dont have so many doubts and questions in your mind naturally i wouldnt even criticize you for moment if it took you 15 hours to assess somebody i wouldnt criticize you it wouldnt even occur to to criticize you but if you took 25 hours to assess somebody and then got the improper assessment and it was way off the gun and off the beam and then you say well i want to get on with auditing him so i would not be critical i would again write the postmaster and i would say please deliver one laughter theres your situation do you see the order of magnitude and how this thing sets up do you see how this is hm well please if you dont learn anything else learn that because its your foremost datum the foremost datum which you have and which i know now is absolutely true this is one of those weird big truths its only true as far as auditing is concerned its only true as far as clearing is concerned but within that framework it is one gargantuan truth perfect assessment is the only assessment that you can afford to do on the pc regardless of time effort difficulty money or anything else its the one that you can afford to do it is the only one he can afford if you were charging five hundred pounds for an intensive and it took you 3 intensives to assess the pc and it cost him fifteen hundred pounds to get perfect assessment do you realize that would be cheap hm but that regardless of what you got for an intensive if he charged you hundred pounds for 25 hours and did the assessment in 3 hours and did wrong one hes thief that is complete waste of money an imperfect assessment would be complete waste of money thats all there is to it any auditing done now on sop goals not preparing case not getting fellow over his motherinlaw trouble or any of the oldtype of auditing that we have done were now talking about clearing people directly and overtly any effort put onto clearing somebody from the level of first assessment sop goals on that does not result in perfect assessment is wasted and will continue to be wasted from there on out the answer is assess perfectly assess 100 percent now is there way to assess is there an actual routine which is so precise that somebody could sit and look at you for 10 minutes and tell whether or not you were doing correct assessment or not yes such system exists its not down on paper theres high probability that it can be stated on paper that it actually could be followed stated on paper but that gives you high probability that itll probably never be followed laughter because were dealing with the basic stuff of which the reactive mind is composed and that on this subject more than any other subject you are going to find more confusion more silly questions well dont get mad at them you realize that youre trying to lay into somebody datum which restimulates the whole confounded reactive bank boom just like that i mean you know its youre right there in the middle of it now he went down the track this way i will tell you now how to do one the pc went down the track so he was out there one day walking down road and he saw little boy playing with the goats and the little boy appeared to be very happy and he was very grumpy that day or just for the hell of it he zapped the little boy and he went on for few centuries and one day he was out there playing on the hill with the goats and the kings men came along and wiped out all the goats and beat him and threw him amongst the dead and he came to himself and decided that the thing to do was to rule kings men or maybe he decided the thing to do was to be very rich merchant so that you could buy all the goats and the soldiers could just slaughter the goats ad nauseam and you still wouldnt run out of goats but youve altered his beingness because he has had to solve problem and the basic solution to the problem was new beingness which gave him new game and game consisted of beingness doingness and havingness those are the components of the game but he is now not being himself he is being solution to the problem of living and then one day he became merchant let us say pirates jumped upon all his cargoes as they were on the high seas and wiped him out and pauperized him utterly and completely so that he went around whining starving children were sold into slavery or anything else happened to him and he decides then that he knows how to be merchant the way you should be merchant is to be naval captain now what an oddball situation this is you have fellow who wanted to be merchant who actually is being naval captain well actually most military lines or naval lines get into it in more or less this groove and youll find them then getting very close to commercial lines but then they began to despise and have enormous contempt for commercial lines and they wont have anything at all to do with commercial lines dont you see so what do we see we see fellow who is now in tertiary condition with regard to his game which was playing with goats on hill there he is stomping up and down his quarterdeck saying flog em laughter and then one day he is overcome by storms battles winds everything else after long periods of time with this beingness and this game and he decides the thing to be is weatherman so that you can foretell storms now what game is he in now youre in the fourth position now it just literally took thousands of years dont think this happens fast it took thousands of years for him to make these shifts what beingness is real to this pc what does he now consider game what does he think he has to do to have good safe secure game well as the result of all these beingnesses its the game somebody will permit him to play therefore when you clear him without clearing up his beingness havingnessdoingness games condition bedohave games condition these things are synonyms all right you clear him up but you dont clear up any of these problems of the games condition hes going to maybe go clear and then hes going to realize he has game because he knows what he has to do in order to have game hes got to be able to foretell weather laughter and although youve got him very clear on the subject of foretelling weather he actually kind of moved out of foretelling weather and he knows you have to be pretty aberrated and worried to really be interested in foretelling weather and he knows its dangerous not to be able to foretell weather and not to foretell it so he starts putting the thumbscrews on himself which is to say naval captain gets overwhelmed by storms see so he brings up this engram and forces himself again to tell weather and even though you got him up to clear read he will now be bored or upset but hes really not bored hes worried hes got to get back there and foretell weather and the thing to do to foretell weather is put the thumbscrews on himself of realizing what would happen to naval captain see its very simple and he goes unclear he just dives overboard just like that boom and again he comes in hes reading stickily on the meter well what has he done to state it very simply because it can be stated mechanically too he knew that the only game that you could play would be that game of foretelling weather and he knows you have to be aberrated to do it so its less dangerous he thinks the jerk to be aberrated than to fail to play the game of foretelling weather thats what it amounts to its less dangerous to be aberrated to have friends to get every kind of of domestic or business scene messed up anything that you could think of see that is less dangerous than not to be in the game of foretelling weather thats the way his thinkingness goes so he goes clear so therefore you could use just plain processes on and on and on and on and youd eventually get this fellow up so hes reading on free needle and then he stays clear for little while and then he walks out and then hes all of sudden clank reading something else and you say this is the most mysterious thing i ever saw in my life and we explained it one time by saying you could postulate himself now he could postulate and he can postulate himself unclear and that was perfectly true and is exactly how he does it but why why did he do it well thats the games condition unless you have cleared up his games conditions clear across the boards he will continue to restore himself into an aberrated condition now heres the funny thing he really cant foretell weather laughter thats always the hooker on this because hes too aberrated to foretell weather see hes got to play the game and so you have nearly every human being on earth today is in this condition of hes got to be something but he cant be it theres something wrong with being what hes being and so he cant be it and so he really dare not be it and yet he must be it and this emerges whenever youre auditing somebody on sop goals very shortly along the line someplace he will tell you oooohhh he will say if i go on with just few more commands of this the situation which i found myself in in life so far will become intolerable because now this goal i have is about to be cleared away and i wont be able to do this anymore and he comes to these fabulous conclusions which all the whole quote science of psychology came to in the states psychoanalysis came to the conclusion psychiatry in general came to the conclusion long ago that artists only art because theyre crazy that people only do the things they do because theyre crazy well that is not at all true that is not at all true people who are in very good state of beingness given the educational data are not going to not do it anymore they will actually be able to do it and have some fun and do it well ill give you an idea i had used to have grave qualms about docking ships i can handle practically anything in the way of ships but i started getting them around docks or around shallow ground its quite visible what this is ship isnt supposed to touch anything it is not supposed to run aground you know its not supposed to ram things its not supposed to go into cliffs you see so most of the time youre skippering ship youre preventing it from running into things in other words youre preventing ship from communicating thats about all it amounts to you see and i thought well this is very necessary thing obviously and i was thinking about ships and monkeying around with yachts and so forth and i was thinking about ships i got little few cognitions on this thing it became very obvious to and i started to laugh at myself you see because well you have to be very worried about ships in order to run ships and id actually stopped running ships because i was worried about them because i liked ships because i wanted to run ships you get the idea laughter and this little thought came to as i was sort of thinking this through and getting it straightened out this little thought occurred to well now if i became totally unworried about ships i would become totally incapable about them puh what balderdash the very fact youre worried about them will eventually cause you to ram docks with them so therefore youve got to withhold yourself from ships because you know youre going to damage them so therefore youve got to run ships because you cant run ships see so heres whole zone of nowimsupposedtos which wouldnt work out at all got the idea well i got this cleaned up and all of sudden i realized that oh i dont know i can dock ships and handle ships and do things with ships and run ships and navigate ships and all of sudden it looked very weird to why have i been worrying about ships and im getting one laughter of course its an old hooker but its all right see that doesnt matter either so the bottom falls out of it so you take to the lifeboats laughter now heres the essence of all these beingnesses and nowimsupposed tos which is doingness in order to have something they get into cant have musthave jammedup situation and fellow has to abandon them because theyve been invalidated too many times and hes gotten invalidated in too many ways and theres this whole parade of these things heres game the fellow is fairly happy with the game and something invalidated it so he now goes into this new valence and plays this new game in order to keep the old game which now he cant have and now hes got this new game and hes got all the beingness doingness and havingness of this new game but something invalidates that so he takes over on the winning valence of new game and he goes into this new game and the beingness doingness and havingness of this new game and then so forth and hes becoming unhappy in life by this time you see but that invalidates the old game now something comes along and invalidates this new game and now hes for some reason or other he isnt himself anymore you see hes just departed from it his communication with the world has become very poor now in assessment youre backtracking that exact put on the new valence with the new doingness and havingness you see put on the new valence with the doingness and havingness only people express these things as goals thats what they express them and youve got to have game that is real to the pc and what falls or reacts on the meter is what is real to the pc so that is the first game you audit and theres only one of them that is attainable or reachable now thats the oddity if theres anything peculiar about this thats the oddity how come theres only one because obviously there are thousands of these things lying behind him well theres only one at time one at time and as these valences go up the pc goes down and here he is in the nowhere of the minus tone scale and the valence may be clear up to serenity and therefore he operates in totally psychotic way while being totally serene we know this case the theetieweetie case totally serene totally batty whats this all about well the valence is all the way up at tone 40 and the pc is all the way down below minus 8 now as you audit the valence that youre auditing out comes down and the pc starts taking over the control of that environment and that game and hell find out that he can play it with this reservation that he doesnt have to if he doesnt want to but before that he had to play this game he had choice so youre restoring the power of choice of the pc over games and as the pc gets out of these fixed games he can now look around the environment and find out that he can not only play that game but that he can play other games now hes got more games and if hes got more games hell stay clear and if hes got less games that he really can play he will go aberrated on you again so the total stability of clearing works out to be how much horizon you lift for the pc in these given zones of beingness doingness and havingness and if you lift them all so that hes longer aberrated along these lines you have stable mest clear and hell stay that way the very act of finishing off clearing stabilizes the clear because its just more sop goals more sop goals and more sop goals and more sop goals and more sop goals you see more goals more beingness doingnesses and havingnesses that are plowed in and they start running out faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and the plight of this poor girl in the 3rd south african who made the first clear down there was terrible toward the end the auditor was in this terrible state and she became very very worried and finally went and saw the instructors for two days she had found goal she had done complete assessment on the case and had found goal and it was the right goal and shed found the right terminal and shed got it all set and shed ask the pc and it had disappeared off the meter laughter what was happening they were blowing by inspection and theyd gotten to state of blowing by inspection and that was all there was to it what do you suppose starts happening to life about that time what do you suppose starts happening when somebody comes in your wife comes in or your husband comes in or somebody says to you and the house has just burned down and its all bad and the governments been overturned and theyre shooting all your business partners and so forth if that much bad luck would happen to you which is doubtful it wouldnt become an engram you would probably do something effective about it and none of it would become an engram and that would be an interesting thing to have happen wouldnt it supposing you got up even little higher than stable mest clear and an automobile ran into you if it did itd almost have to be by your intention but if it did run into you what do you suppose would happen you know its obvious that the only thing that keeps an injury there is the engram you make of it weve got lot of interesting things here to find out when you throw body off of the wall or drop it off of cliff what does it do bounce and then what do you do pick it up and dust it off or will dust stick to it laughter can it retain an injury ah but all injuries are retained by mental image pictures this has been demonstrated time and time again in the last eleven years interesting but do you have to have game to be injured well if you dont have to have game to be an injured invalid the high probability is you can pick up your body throw it against the wall it bounces off it just would have gone splat in pale pink mist you see previously pick it up dust it off and walk on down the street is this the kind of thing that happens well these things we dont know but were right there finding them out i was rather interested to get letter from clear the other day i didnt receive it but it was written to somebody in the organization and instead of saying how wonderful it all was beyond the thing that shes getting along fine which was social statement the whole thing was devoted to getting the show on the road in that particular area and the various problems they were dealing with and how they were settling them and how we could help out settling these various problems and straightening up the particular area darnedest letter you ever wanted to read see its just all well were being effective we want to be effective now here we go and were doing this and that and you can do soandso and soand so and there wasnt single mention of her case beyond this social line how are you i am fine see that was interesting too wasnt it how would it feel to go around getting things done and never be worried about your case how would that feel would that feel odd never worried about your own reaction never worried about your consequences never be even vaguely upset by your whether you were going to get tired or confused or not well this is obviously from person who if youd said are you tired she would have probably laughed at you who tired not tired well youve been working for fortyeight hours i thought you might be tired oh have i oh yes yeah well theres lot of things to do now ill tell you so clear apparently doesnt go up and sit on cloud nine having to play the game is what prevents one from playing the game and evidently one can play the game as long as one doesnt have to play the game so thats the status which is reached which is very interesting thing the perfect assessment is the first step in for case if youve done perfect assessment the case all of sudden feels much better if youve done an imperfect assessment the case feels not so good theres that indicator too it starts in with perfect assessment thats the first foot on the pathway and the first thing you run into as possibility that the fellow is not going to make the grade is an imperfect assessment and then that will haunt it all the way through after that youre in trouble from there on out so its good thing to know how to do an assessment be able to read an emeter do an assessment carry it on i dont care how long it takes you to learn one that is immaterial i couldnt care less but what do you know i can show you how to do rather rapid assessment youve been doing assessments which bid fair to be going on for fifteen or twenty hours well you can do them faster than that and still have them that accurate but if i show you how to do such an assessment i dont want you to get the idea that i am trying to speed you up in doing assessments because i dont care how long it takes you to do an assessment but i can show you how to make it little easier on the pc and how to make it little faster for you and so forth and there are exact ways to go about this in order to do this now ill give you an example of that in reading repeater technique which you use on goals and terminals assessing but not on prehav scale assessing you dont use repeater technique to find out the level of prehav scale i think id better put that on practically every tape we release and all the information bulletins maybe i should carry it as footnote on all bulletins because it seems so natural after youve done repeater technique you see on goals to do repeater technique on terminals then well prehav scale obviously you should do repeater technique on the prehav scale everybody knows that thats just one of these additives now obviously as you go down the prehav scale youd hit all of these levels if you repeated each level over and over and over and over and over youd really grind the fellow in because youre auditing him on hot buttons but thats not true of the goals and its not true of the terminals so whats the best way to do terminals i mean goals assessment well its to get all of the goals thats the first one and then when youre sure youve got all of the goals and youve been through the list one time get all of the goals and after youve been through the list second time well you get all of the goals what do you mean all of the goals well you always ask him if there arent some more goals every time you go through list of anything in the way of goals or terminals you always add at the end of the list as the last kickup of the heels what additional goals do you have and you run it against the meter and if the question produces the slightest change of characteristic on your meter you say what goal is that until you get it and you flatten the meter every time you read goals list and you flatten the meter for new terminals every time you read terminals list you always add the new goals because hes always got new goals until you get the right one and after that your meter is null on new goals and itll stay pretty null on it but after youve run him for while on youve got the goals youve got the terminal youve got everything and you then now get the prehav and you audit him for while when you come back to do new terminal youd better do new terminal assessment and get the new terminals because they are now tremendous numbers of terminals which add themselves to this goal youre trying to flatten and when youre finally finished up with terminals for that goal that goal is going to be flat now for your new goal add goals find all of the goals in other words it is quantitative find all of the goals every opportunity you get find more goals on terminals every opportunity you get find more terminals quantity quantity quantity i dont care if you have list of 1295 goals and 15000 terminals i just couldnt care less you wont achieve that youll probably cool off at the absolute top of about 350 thats probably the extreme the most ive seen right now is about 280 or something like that but i did hear of case just this morning that had some vast number of goals and it was all assessed out and finally was assessed out wrong and the question do you have some more goals produced the goal of the pc coo so quantity hasnt single thing to do with it that is to say how many you get its quantitative it you just go on you get more you see it doesnt matter how many it doesnt matter how long it takes and it doesnt matter how many you get just make sure that you get it all and just make sure that when you do it you do it so that you come out with perfect result and what is perfect result one goal falls and one terminal falls and you cant even get another goal and you cant get another terminal and that is it actually the assessment has to be as perfect as it mechanically works out to be its quite mysterious that it works out so wonderfully and so mechanically to be just that itll turn out to be one goal that wont go flat unless you audit it and of course if youve got this one goal and then you go over the list again and it disappears you didnt have all the goals thats all that means and if you had your list of terminals and you finally had one terminal and there it was and thats that one terminal and youve really got it all done and you say well just as an afterthought well how do you feel about janitors and it goes null what did that mean it means you didnt have all the terminals thats all youve got to now make new additional terminals list and find the terminal you have all you all youve got are null well then you havent got the right one thats all now in addition to that you have to find the terminal at both ends of the goal now what do i mean by that the terminal at both ends of the goal the fellow has goal to shoot sparrows and this turns out to be the idiotic goal that he comes up with we dont care how sensible it is or how insensible thats what he comes up with his ambition and the thing to do is to shoot sparrows that is it well it defies your reality that anybody wants to dedicate his entire existence to shooting sparrows but as matter of fact you probably are not aware of the fact that for centuries for actually thousands of years every time he marries beautiful wife or something of that sort sparrows turn up in some peculiar way and ruin his marriage and we never can figure out how this is see laughter well thats his aberration dont you try to make it reasonable thats why hes crazy got the idea laughter all right so thats the way it is so you got this goal to shoot sparrows now when i say you get both ends of the goal i mean you have to get terminals list for the beginning and terminals list for the end because theres two understood terminals here i want to shoot sparrows well the first question is who are you who would want to shoot sparrows you understand you get the terminals list for the i who would want to shoot sparrows now its better if you can get that than to get the sparrows because this thing is the cause over the sparrows dont you see but you might not get that it might not be at the i end of this goal it might be at the receiving end of the goal the effect line here to shoot sparrows is of course sparrows all right whats sparrow give another word for sparrows well he says theyre birds theyre tweetieweeties theyre our feathered friends you got the idea and you take that whole list of synonyms for the end now but who would shoot sparrows gamekeepers would shoot sparrows and then theres cats you get this picture of pussinboots you know with shotgun laughter and you say cats would shoot sparrows yes cats would shoot sparrows yes yes definitely all right well after all this is this is his terminals list not yours laughter so you put down cats well now thats the way it goes you get both ends of the terminal see both ends of the goal is converted into terminal in other words theres really two terminal lists but they all add up to just one terminal list so you can ask two questions about terminal who does this and what is it done to causedistanceeffect and you get the terminals at cause and all the terminals at effect and youll find out theyre both present in any goal fellow says i want to have oysters that is the goal that finally came up i want to have oysters you have to get all the synonyms in the hinglish language and if he was born hungarian in the hungarian language too for hoysters and you have to find out who would have to have oysters oh he says oystermen fishmongers uh princes uhm fishermen uh people who tend oyster beds uhm little old ladies with green bonnets who sit on pedestals and uh laughter now look it doesnt have to make sense if it made sense he wouldnt be aberrated on the subject thats something for you to remember in all goals listing all right now lets take another look at how to do fast goals list the reading of the list is very important if in doubt leave it in that is primary rule of goals assessment if in doubt leave it in the only mistake you can make is eradicating goal that is still alive now to save you time to save you time if it rock slams on your first three repetitions of the goal or the terminal or if it rock slams on two of those repetitions or if it rock slams on one of those first three repetitions leave it in if it rock slams leave it in because rock slams turn on and turn off and turn on and turn off and theres sense in you wasting time trying to get it on again if it slammed on it it slammed on it and that is all there are to it so it slammed on rock slam well rock slams are very often sporadic leave it in simple huh now if you get anything like three falls the same or increasing while reading the thing the first three times the goal or the terminal if you get three falls or if it looks like its going to go on falling or if it looks like it is going to increase its fall leave it in and go on to the next read do not try to flatten it got it but if in the first three reads of the goal or on terminals list this does not apply to the prehav scale i want to get that note in there often assessing on the prehav scale is done at one announcement of the level only you dont announce level twice you just announce it once and take what it said now if you read three times and it was off it was on and it was slighter youll develop an instinct for this it looks like its going to fade doesnt it repeat it more than three times to get it to null but if by the time youve repeated it five or six times and its now starting to develop good healthy fall get off of it dont punch them to death when they keep falling only knock out those which appear to be in declining fragile state that clear all right so the maximum test that you make is three reads of the goals and the terminal with prehav three reads is your maximum three reads of the goals list three reads on the terminals list and you make your determination out of those three reads if it looks like its going to fade rub it out keep on repeating it and get rid of it and if it looks like its going to stay there get off of it and you make your adjudication on your first three reads got it on the prehav scale for heavens sakes just say it once and mark what it fell in terms of divisions dont repeat prehav level because youre auditing the fellow if you do youre not assessing youre auditing this is an old old law by the way you think weve changed man have we swung back to the beginning do you know one of the first auditing processes that ever existed was repeater technique you know that and on the prehav scale do you know that this way back when that you could always say phrase once or twice to find out if it was hot without getting the pc plowed in but if you said it four five six eight ten times hed had it youd thrown him right into the middle of the bank your pc will actually continue to asis his goals list more rapidly if you follow the system which i have just given you what are you really doing youre going over the list more times and going over the questions less times its better to go over the list more times and the questions less times why by the time you get to the end of the list you will have scummed off one entire chain that chain will be gone now when you go back over the list again youre not reading these goals now against the force of that chain that chain is gone so these things that are going to flatten will now flatten with greater rapidity and you keep doing it it doesnt matter how many times you go over the list you follow this same rule make your adjudication in the first three reads are you going to rub it out or are you going to leave it there theres great liability to making mistake its just youre going to fog up the pc and hes going to be little less comfortable and youre going to slow down your doing your assessment we dont care if you slow down doing the assessment and we dont care if the pc gets restimulated while doing the assessment were just asking you to be sure but im just giving you system which will work faster and its real slippy theres hardly anything to this system you say i want to shoot sparrows there is wording that goes with this and im going to give you complete wording of this and ill turn it out in bulletin theres particular reason to give you the wording now what you have to do is tell the pc that youre going to read new goal this is in essence what this is whatever the wording turns out to be and that you want to know how he feels about it to in order to put his attention on this goal and youll shift his attention faster by having little set patter there now ill give you that patter in goals assessment model session so theres model session for assessments which is slightly different not enough to bother with because its the same difference in model sessions as youd get in running processes you can change processes in model sessions so you can change processes in doing assessments you just put it in that slot thats the way you do the assessment thats actually how this works now heres heres the essence of this thing you put his attention on it and you say im going to go over this goal with you which is i want to shoot sparrows see eyes right on that meter see because thats one repetition of it i want to shoot sparrows and then you say how do you feel about that and you dont take that read that read is null there is read because you havent repeated the goal youve asked him how he felt but his attention is on this more strongly so youll get variation in these first three reads so you actually only have two more reads left youll say i want to shoot sparrows thank you i want to shoot sparrows thank you well the first time you said it it fell about three divisions on the needle and the second time you said it it fell about four divisions on the needle and the third time you said it it fell three divisions on the needle well thats just it you put slant over there in the margin you just leave it there and you say now i want to go over this goal with you which is and you read the next one i want to shoot my motherinlaw thats one read how do you feel about that i want to shoot my motherinlaw i want to shoot my motherinlaw see you can acknowledge it and you better had its i want to shoot my mother inlaw thank you i want to shoot my motherinlaw thank you and notice those three reads and what happened this time well when you said i want to shoot my motherinlaw there was nice hard fall and then the second time you said it there was little theta bop and the third time you said it there was tinier theta bop so you say i want to shoot my motherin law thank you i want to shoot my motherinlaw thank you i want to shoot my motherinlaw thank you its null by this time cross it out that goal you dont go over on the whole list again its gone got the idea its not just that it changed characteristic it actually looked like it was going to flatten it looked like it was going to change it looked like it was going to shift off it looked like it didnt amount to anything now you get into this characteristic you say im going to go over with this goal with you i want to shoot sparrows how do you feel about that and he says its really eagles and what do you do scratch out sparrows and put in eagles thats wrong hes given you brandnew goal so you write that down underneath the goal he just gave you so you say all right okay were going to cover this sparrows goal first here i want to shoot sparrows thank you i want to shoot sparrows thank you this looks like its getting tough you know it looks like its strong its heavy thing so you say well were going to leave that and now i want to shoot eagles and it falls and you say i want to shoot eagles and it falls and i want to shoot eagles and it falls so you say and i want to shoot eagles thank you and i want to shoot eagles thank you and i want to shoot eagles thank you all right well take that one off its scrubbed this is quite ordinary that youll get sudden alteris in the middle of goals run okay now reading the list over more times and spending little less time grinding on it will actually speed up your assessment thats in the interests of speeding up an assessment but these interests are not very great now what happens if you get down to the end on the sixteenth read of the list and there were only see when you go over it the next time you only read those goals that have slant in front of them which said they still read you use the same principles in going over this he had 120 they have now boiled down to 40 on maybe three reads hes got 40 left go over these 40 and they all go null null null null oh theres one okay that one stayed null null stayed stayed stayed stayed oh they say thats fine thats dandy and you get down to the end of this thing you ask him do you have any more goals see that you havent mentioned before now he says and the needle is quite flat on this so you go over the remaining goals and there are now 12 and you go over these things and you say well same formula and scrubbed and that one scrubbed and that one scrubbed and that one scrubbed that one stayed okay laughter all right and when you get over that list you ask him if there are any more goals and he says and the needle is nice and null and so you go back over it again and you now find out there are three and you go over it and its scrub scrub scrub laughter now this is the kind of problem youll get into thatll happen less ordinarily than you will have one left but when you get into that the proper thing to do is say what other goals are you withholding that you havent told about oh that i havent told you about oh thats different for some reason or other this is all different now well what you actually did was pull the goals chains off the line and youve simply been taking the overburden off of his goals and not until it was all gone did you find you had some new goals sitting there staring you in the face so you can add this rule to assessment that when youve got the goal and you know exactly what it is and youve got it in total box and that is it you could set it up in bright lights neon signs put huge seamens floodlights on it youre absolutely certain now youve got it absolutely set you have done everything you have been told to do that youve learned to do and that youve dreamed up laughter and you know thats it ask for some more goals ask for some more terminals and put them down and assess them first goals list then terminals assess them against the one you had because ill tell you this little rule any goal which is to put up mockup because of the prehav scale is liable to be false one and is dangerous one to audit and it is perishable because the result of failure is to create mockup ones own self that is the result of failure so that you get into an arts goal this is particularly true and just as broad category this most succinctly and desperately for some reason or other applies to arts goals youll learn lot of this bricabrac about how to judge these things but this is very important one because you should always be suspicious of an arts goal the guy isnt even putting up mass mockup dont you see hes putting up figurefigure sort of thinkthink hes going to write music i wouldnt ever leave anybody with goal of writing music hes going to sing i wouldnt leave guy with goal of singing i would just start beating that goals list to pieces this is what experience has taught why because theres always the thing you can do when all else fails and thats usually the arts now isnt that hell of thing thats an awful commentary on the arts but i dont intend it to be commentary on the arts the renaissance in italy takes place after its beaten by france nobody can now make machinery or masses or really put up this or get society on the road but they could paint pictures got the idea so theyre going to start to overwhelm with aesthetic masses actual masses didnt work so theyre going to go into aesthetic masses and those are closer to the thought band i dont say that preclear will never in the history of sop goals turn out to have an arts goal because thats not justified i just say its something to regard with grave suspicion not in life but on an assessment if you go just little further youll find youve improved the case enough with an assessment that he gets into better goal channel thats what it amounts to got the idea so that all arts goals as one single whole category should if encountered demand additional assessment just beat it to pieces without invalidating the pc ask him for some more goals theres all kinds of ways to ask for goals i wont go into those today but what did you want to do before youd started to sing oh well thats not possible claaaan and youll find out they usually have an answer to it what did they want to do before they went into the arts what did they really want to do now this also applies to these figurefigure professions like law philosophy these other professions things that are in thought band exclusively and only such as arts and that sort of thing ah its very featherweight goal man its pretty featherweight it denotes hell of failure just ahead of it but that isnt any reason why it wont turn out to be that on some pcs it wont isnt any reason why it couldnt be the perfect assessment in the long run but it is something that very easily blows while assessing and you can find something more solid to run and your assessment has actually accomplished some auditing so its something to just be suspicious of not something to eradicate all right now lets go into this just one more tiny step and we will find out that perfect goals assessment gets the right goal and the right terminal so that the case can be run thats what it does and theres only one set that unlocks the case and if you run the wrong one you will find out about it so the thing to do is if the case is not running right to do another assessment there is harm in doing this because if the right assessment was done the first time oddly enough matter how violently you assess on the second time if you do it in model session picking up the arc breaks present time problems and the other things which youre supposed to do youre going to get the same goal on the second assessment and if it was the wrong one it probably is gone by this time what mistakes then can you make in modern processing you can make the mistakes of attempting auditing without your trs emeter and model session in perfect condition that leads and breeds many other mistakes your next mistake is you can fail to achieve perfect assessment it doesnt mean that you have to do it perfectly with your little pinky in the air and just exactly this and that it doesnt matter how adroitly you do this the perfection totally consists of achieving the result of the right goal and the right terminal for that pc now if youve got that youve got it made thats what i mean by perfect assessment not doing perfect job of assessing because you could probably achieve the right assessment by doing an imperfect job of assessing as long as you were bulldoggish enough to carry it through to its conclusion and to be absolutely sure if you have any doubt in your own mind about the rightness of the assessment for any reason under the sun except of course that you yourself would hate to be that terminal laughter weve already found that person finally got it and when youre absolutely sure that this is the only thing thats going to shake out of that case and thats the last thing thats going to shake out of that case and thats the only thing thats going to shake out of that case and the only thing that can disturb this now is auditing on the prehav scale when youre absolutely sure then start auditing until that time continue to assess matter how boring or how upset the pc gets or anything else continue to assess keep the arc breaks picked up keep the present time problems picked up get the withholds off the case get it whizzing and keep on assessing till you are sure you and the meter know the pc does not now the pc may speak during an assessment laughter but thats practically the limit of how it enters into an auditors judgment now ive had lot of experience with this and amongst the experience is pcs becoming wildly enthusiastic about some goal and wildly enthusiastic about some terminal oh balloon jumper boy thats the thing you know theyre right in the middle of the wheeee you see person who jumps from balloon and comes down in parachutes ohho boy thats it i know thats it all my life it explains everything its just it the next read it drops out you say how do you feel about balloon jumpers what balloon jumpers laughter its discouraging from that point of view now i want you to do assessing i dont care whom you grab by the ear and start to assess i dont care who gets assessed i dont care how badly they get assessed or how well they get assessed in terms of technology the waving of the pinky how you hold the emeter laughter the expression in your left eye laughter to say nothing of the expression in you right eye laughter we dont care anything about those things what we care about is that perfect assessment at the other end and carry it on down if you do one of these youll find out youll give case an enormous advance if its perfect assessment the case gets an enormous advance they say coo you see its some terrific cognition you know this is what i am doing well well what do you know sometimes its the first what do you know you had off the case maybe hes been audited five hundred hours before and he never said what do you know he just said yes laughter and he gets up to state where he really has he really has some idea of where hes going and what hes doing you dont have to tell him thats his goal the emeter and he will find that out now he isnt going to find it out until after youve found it out because youre plowing right into the middle of this fellows beingness crash so i want you to do at the drop of hat an assessment i dont care if you start assessments on people and never finish them on that particular person well get him someday you havent loused him up you havent loused him up we can now do complete assessment you can take an assessment that another auditor has done just scrap it and do another assessment of your own if his assessments right youll get the same answer if your assessments right it doesnt matter how many times you assess now the only time an assessment goes wrong was when it was absolutely right and it was audited for few hours and that was the end of that terminal and now you cant assess for the same terminal you may get some other terminal for the same goal but it already is showing up on the case the case is advancing if this occurs the case feels much better the case looks much different sop goals running is very rapid and you can tell the difference in the people and you can tell the advances okay all right now if over this weekend you have person sitting innocently laughter and theres an emeter anywhere to be found you might ask him this searching question rather speculatively what do you suppose your main goal in life might be laughter oh you dont know well lets find out shall we thats enough excuse for doing goals assessment and youll find out that where people before maybe didnt volunteer at once to be guinea pigs or something for auditing you might have had some resistance you almost never have resistance on that question about goals okay audience yes hmm i think khruschev himself could be put into session with this one laughter okay audience yeah thank you
