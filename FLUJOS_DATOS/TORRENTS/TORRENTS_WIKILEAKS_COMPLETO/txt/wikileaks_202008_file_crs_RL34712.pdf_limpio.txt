outstanding this measure is generally cons idered to be the most relevant in macro economic terms because it is the amount of bt sold in credit markets debt held by the public will be the debt measure used to describe the ebbs and flows of debt in this report in most years debt held by the public has increased on nominal basis nominal measures of debt however do not control for inflation therefore debt held by the public will be measured as percentage of gross domestic product gdp in this report because it adjusts for inflation and relates the size of the debt to the size of the economy as long as an economy grows faster than the debt it may become better equipped to handle increasing amounts of debt because interest payments on the debt are less burdensome to the economy as whole in nearly every year since the establis hment of the country the government has accumulated debt5 world war ii wwii however represented new era in debt levels and the role of the united states in the global economy because of this an examination of debt levels since 1940 is used in this report to show ebbs and flows of debt levels and how they have changed over the last seven decades selected historical examples will illustrate the sources of federal debt movements over this period figure 1 depicts gdp growth and the change s in gross debt and debt held by the public as percentage of gdp between 1940

be defined in number of ways these factors will be used in this report to identify changes in debt levels in order to make an appropriate comparison over time outlays receipts and debt will be

as percentage of total fe deral spending has declined projections of large future increases in mandatory spending are exp ected to place further strain on the budget8 in the absence of other economic or polic changes increases in spending levels result in larger deficits or smaller surpluses deficits will increase debt held by the public and will generally lead to increases in gross debt as percentage of gdp on the other hand decreases in spending with ll else equal will lead to larger surpluses or smaller deficits generally resulting in decreases in both gross debt and debt held by the public as percentage of gdp receipts economic performance heavily influences receipt levels during periods of sustained growth revenue coll ections through income corporate and capital gains taxes will generally be stronger and result in larger collections by the department of the treasury in the absence of changes in law conversely economic weakness generally decreases receipts individuals may see decline in their incomes and corporations might experience decline in profits in the aggregate this can cause decrease in receipts collect ed changes in receipt levels also have an impact on the debt with other changes to policy or the economy increases in receipts will result in larger surpluses or smaller deficits which can decrease debt held by the public as percentage of gdp and will generally lead to decreases in gross debt as percentage of gdp in the absence of other policy changes the opposite will occur with declines in receipt levels gdp overall economic health is often measured by the growth rate of real gdp economic indicators such as debt are often evaluated using gdp as base because it facilitates comp arisons over time economic growth may allow an economy to absorb higher levels of debt even though interest payments increase as debt levels rise they can be offset by higher potential tax base thereby reducing the burden on the economy9 gdp growth will generally result in decrease in the ratios of both the gross debt and debt held by the public as percentage of gdp in the absence of changes in spending and receipts during the period analyzed in this report fy1940 to fy2007 gdp growth did not necessarily result in the expected movements in debt as percentage of gdp showing that othe r factors influenced changes in debt levels macroeconomic interaction movements in spending receipts or gdp described above can occur simultaneously or as result of each other economic fluctuations tend to automa tically cause shortrun chan ges in the annual

implications of the longterm federal budget outlook by marc labontegovernment programs10 for example in strong economy new jobs are often created in response if the unemployed become employed and earn higher incomes additional tax revenue will be generated in contrast in weak economy people may lose their jobs which could lower tax re venue and increase government expenditures on programs such as unemployment insu rance and food stamps ie automatic stabilizers if the growth in debt levels exceeds gr owth in the economy over the long term an inherently unstable situation will result11 debt levels influenced by these changes are also affected by policy decisions made by the president and congress some policy analysts assert that the fiscal situation in the united states is unsustainable and represents threat to economic stability necessitating significant changes in fiscal policy12 as is shown in figure 2 outlays greatly exceeded receipts during wwii as the war ended and spending fell receipts nd outlays remained relatively equal as percentage of gdp for the next several decades though small deficits existed in most years growth in gdp exceeded the growth in borrowing causing

debt levels most recently debate over the emergency ec onomic stabilization act of 2008 pl 110 343 included concerns about increasing debt levels in most cases these events led to or are expected to lead to upward movements in debt due to immediate or outyear spending requirements in addition the economy through its ffects on revenues and outlays has also played significant role in debt movements over time however the effects of strong or weak gdp growth have not always re sulted in predictable debt movements in some instances strong gdp growth was outweighed by increases in spending or decreases in tax revenues causing debt as percentage of gdp to increase instead of decrease at other times strong economic performance led to declines in debt as percentage of gdp data on revenue

increases despite this receipts fell from 180 of gdp in 1990 to 176 in 1993 largely as result of the economic slowdown beginning in 1992 gdp growth ranged from 3 to 5 annually through the end of the decade due to the strong gr owth and in combination with various tax increases in the omnibus budget and reconciliation act of 1993 pl 10366 receipts increased from 176 of gdp in 1993 to 200 in 1999 low rates of unemployment also helped boost the level of receipts as more people had jobs and income which generated tax revenue reliance on income security programs fell as result from 27 of gdp in 1993 to 22 in 1999 the budget surpluses that occurred during this decade surprised many budget analysts as late as september 1997 cbo projected budget deficits into fy1998 and beyond the presidents budget proposa l for fy1998 also predicted deficit however strong economic conditions led to surprising and unexpected rise in revenues combined with decrease in spending relative to gdp due to legislatively enforced spending cuts and strong ec onomic growth the annual budget deficits expected from fy1998 through fy2001 became surpluses the budget surpluses not only helped shrink the size of the national debt as revenues exceeded outlays but also reduced interest payments as result of decreased levels of borrowing in 1999 interest spending fell to 25 of gdp the lowest rate in fifteen years economic downturn and entitlements the years of budget surpluses and d eclining debt which continued until 2001 have since been replaced by budget defic its and increasing debt tax cuts and increases in entitlement spending have been two of the largest contributors resulting in this turnaround in 2000 debt held by the public as percentage of gdp was 330 though it fell in 2001 it has been

growth the new spending pr ovided through this legislation could increase debt as percentage of gdp at least in the s hortrun at the present time the effect on the federal debt is hard to determine as the treasury expects to recoup some of these outlays by selling the assets at future date in addition to this spending the larg est mandatory spending programs have grown significantly during the last decade in 2000 spending on medicare medicaid and social security equaled 74 of gdp in 2007 this number rose to 84 of gdp representing one percentage point increase in just seven years31 the longterm consequences on future debt as result of these mandatory programs may also be great cause for concern as the baby boomers approach retirement age how intragovernmental debt affects gross debt changes in the gross debt do not always track closely with budget surpluses or deficits because gross debt includes debt held by the public and intragovernmental debt intragovernmental debt is the amount owed by the federal government to other federal agencies to be paid by the depa rtment of the treasury intragovernmental debt required by law to be held in the form of treasury securities largely consists of money contained in trust funds such as social security the amount contained in these trust funds is largely determined by payroll taxes collected less benefits paid why is it important to examine this measure of debt in 1982 intragovernmental debt as percentage of gdp reached its lowest level it has steadily risen since that time from 66 to 286 of gdp in 2007 this money has been used to finance other government spending while supplying treasury ious to the trust funds from which the borrowing has occurred in 1983 major reformshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34712crs15 32 us social security

the greenspan commission to stave off impending trust fund insolvency these reforms led to increases in payroll tax collections among other changes32 as result of these changes in law the level of surplus in the social secur ity trust fund rose and the treasury has been borrowing from it thereby increasing intragovernmental debt increases in gross debt as percentage of gdp as result of intragovernmental debt are significant concern over the l ong run in their 2008 report the social security trustees projected that in 2017 the trust fund will begin to owe more benefits than what it collects in payroll taxes33 as the trust fund begins to redeem its treasury securities in order to pay bene fits to retirees additional strains on the budget and debt levels will be created as large amounts of money from general revenues are needed to fund these social security benefits in addition the funds from the surplus currently being used by th government to fund other programs will longer be available putting strain on the funding for these programs further the liabilities to future generations of elderly from scheduled social security benefits do not show up in the bt funding the promises of the entitlement programs are difficult to fully measure cbo calculates fiscal gap measure which quantifies the reductions in spending nd revenues necessary to generate fiscal stability over given period they pr oject that permanent and immediate combination of spending cuts and revenue increases amounting to 52 of gdp will be necessary in order to maintain the present level of debt as percentage of gdp 50 years from now34 this amount is significant because outlays and revenues have each historically amounted to about 20 of gdp enacting this change amounts to onequarter cut in spending or onequa rter increase in revenue collection or some combination of the two at time when the country is facing retiring baby boom generation standard economic analysis pr edicts that this could reduce domestic investment worker productivity and real wages further ffecting the economy in the short run35 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34712crs16 considerations for congress debt is affected by annual policy deci sions on the levels of spending and revenue spending and reve nues are also influenced by economic growth and gdp as it has over the past decades the unite d states will continue to face fiscal challenges though the accumulation of debt has always been concern some future challenges are already visible as more people retire and become eligible for mandatory program bene fits and if per capita healthcare costs continue to increase these programs will consume greater portions of the budget unless policy changes are implemented potential changes could include benefit cuts tax increases or programmatic changes effective fiscal discipline is necessary to balance the budget and rein in the debt this would require less spending increas in revenue collections faster than average economic growth or combination of these things many economists agree that having some federal debt is g ood thing because it builds credit which allows for more favorable borrowing terms it encourages investment within the country because federal debt is seen as relatively wrisk and safe however debt is not free and the interest payments that accomp any it can put further strains on budgets taking action to reduce the projected grow th in the debt potentially might lead to insolvency at some time in the future implying that the government would have to default on its
