protection issues in the 109th congress introduction the first session of the 109th congress saw enactment of several laws that include key environmental provisions and congress considered and took some action on variety of environm ental measures many of the issues dealt with by this congress reflect continuing considerati on of issues that were before prior congresses these include issues that we re considered but not enacted as well as annually occurring legislati on on matters such as environmental protection agency epa appropriations and envi ronmental provisions in fenserelated legislation environmental issues considered by congress tend to fall into several major categories 1 funding issu whether funding levels are adequate andor focused on appropriate prio rities in light of the current fe deral budget defic it reductions in the budget request for epa and other pr ograms present difficult choices and questions about the adequacy of funding leve ls were debated in such areas as water quality infrastructure and s uperfund cleanup 2 expanding renewing or refocusing existing environmental policies or programs consideration of proposals that would alter air quality requirements in the current congress for example 3 environmental issues that are important elements of other major areas of concern for example the issue of streamlining environmental reviews in energy and transportation reauthorization legislation and other environmental provi sions in energy measures or environmental issues in defense author ization or appropriati ons and 4 security concerns such as terrorism and infrastructure protection in areas such as water infrastructure and chemical facilities the hurricanes that damaged large areas of the us gulf coast in late august and september of 2005 were major focu s of congressional ttention in the 109th congress including number of environm ental concerns among the many issues of interest were environmen tal considerations related to the hurricane cleanup effort involving large amount of contaminated substances nd debris consideration of modification of environmental laws or rules to expedite disaster response and

appropriations for fy2007 and completing action on supplemen tal appropriations for fy2006 the president signed the emergency supplemental appropria tions act for fy2006 pl 109234 hr 4939 on june 15 2006 increasing epa s fy2006 appropriation by 13 million to total of 772 billion of the 13 million s upplemental 6 million was for increased environmental monitoring asse ssment and analytical support to protect public health during the ongoing recovery and reconstruction effo rts related to the consequences of hurricane katrina and other hurricanes of the 2005 season the remaining 7 million was for assessing unde rground storage tanks that may have leaked in areas affected by these hurricanes the 109th congress adjourned without fi nalizing fy2007 appropriations for epa and many other federal agencies but it enacted continuing resolution pl 109383 hjres 102 to provide funding fo r these agencies through february 15 2007 the funding formula contained in p l 109383 sets conti nuing

the bill srept 109 275 on june 29 2006 although the full house and the senate appropriations committee amounts for epa diffe red both amounts were more than the presidents request of 732 billion but less than the fy2006 appropriation of 772 billion which includes enacted suppl emental funding di scussed above in the absence of final appropriations enacted for fy2007 th continuing resolution funds programs administered by epa and many other federal agencies at the lowest of the fy2006 enacted appropriation the hous epassed bill or the senate passed bill because the senate did not pass the inte rior bill that funds epa the agencys programs are funded at either the fy2006 enacted leve l or the housepasse d amount whichever is lowest as in recent years debate in the second session regarding fy2007 appropriations for epa included major focus on the adequacy of the presidents request for federal assistance to states for the clean water and drinking water state revolving funds srfs from which states issue loans to communities for constructing and upgrading their wastewater and drinking water infrastructures to meet federal requirements also similar to recent years other prominent issues included the adequacy of the presidents request for the cleanup of hazardous waste sites under the superfund pr ogram and the cleanup of commercial and industrial sites referred to as brownfields there also was broad c ongressional interest in the adequacy of funding for scientific re search air quality programs and epas homeland security activities the extent to which funding for individual grant recipients should be congressionally designated often referred to as earmarks was an issue as well the funding and opera tion of epas libraries received attentionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33481crs4 toward the end of the 109th congress although the funding for this activity is relatively small compared with many other agency activities such as those noted above for more information on epa fundi ng issues for fy2007 see crs report rl33399 interior environment and related agencies fy2007 appropriations coordinated by carol hardy vincen t and susan

issues for congress by david bearden and robert esworthy energy and environment the energy bill by brent d yacobucci specialis t in environmental policy 79662 after lengthy debate over u s energy policy the 109th congress enacted omnibus energy legislation in july 2005 the debate over nationa l energy policy had been ongoing since the 107th congress both the 107th and 108th congresses were unable to complete action on an omnibus energy bill due to the broad scope of the bills and stalemates over several contentious issues many of these contentious issues were addressed in various versions of energy legislation in the 109th congress although some of them were dropped from the final version of the bill the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 hr 6 wa s signed by president bush on august 8 2005 the final version of the bill contains many provisions involving environmental protection and regulation including the trea tment of renewable fuels stricter regulation of underground fuel st orage tanks and environmental exemptions for oil and gas exploration and production key component of pl 10958 is requirement that gasoline sold in the united states must contain 75 billion ga llons annually of ethanol and other renewable fuels by 2012 the measure also eliminates clean air act requirements for the use of oxygenates in reformulated ga soline the oxygenate standard led to the increased use of mtbe in gasoline mtbe is fuel additive used to increase combustion efficiency that was found to contaminate drinking water supplies primarily due to leaking underground fuel storage tanks the voluntary transition away from mtbe by gasoline suppliers in spring 2006 contributed to the historically high gasoline prices and caused concerns about the supply of ethanol for blending into gasoline for more information see crs report rl32865 renewable fuels and mtbe comparison of provisions in the energy policy act of 2005 pl 109 58 and hr 6 by brent d yacobucci mary tiemann james mccarthy and aaron m flynn and crs report rl31361 boutique fuels and reformulated gasoline harmonization of fuel standards by brent d yacobucci pl 10958 provides some exempti ons from clean water act and safe drinking water act provisions for oil nd gas exploration nd production related to stormwater runoff and hydraulic fracturing these provisions were seen by some as necessary to promote increased domestic energy supplies whereas critics complain that they will allow energy pr oducers to sidestep nvironmental protection requirements and may result in depleted or pollute d groundwater and surface waterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33481crs5 pl 10958 also contains provisions on technology to addre ss climate change title xvi establishes progra ms to promote the adoption of technologies and their transfer to developing countries to reduce greenhouse gas intensity emissions per unit of economic output these provisions were similar to those adopted on the senate floor in samdt 817 the senate also debate d two other climate change amendments that were not included in the final version of the bill samdt 866 expressed the sense of the senate that congress should establish mandatory market based limits on greenhouse gas emissions this amendment was pa ssed by the senate in voice vote but dropped in conferen ce samdt 826 would have required mandatory greenhouse gas emission reductions this amendment was rejected 3860 the house version of hr 6 did not ddress climate change or greenhouse gas emissions for further di scussion see crs report rl32873 key environmental issues in the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 hr 6 coordinated by brent d yacobucci the major hurricanes along the gulf coas t in 2005 led to fuel supply disruptions and contributed to significantly higher gasoline and diesel prices in many areas of the country as result there was increased in terest in expanding us refining capacity although total refining capacity has in creased in recent years the number of refineries has steadily declined and new us refineries have been built in decades many factors have discouraged investment in new refineries and environmental regulations have been cited as one of those factors hr 3893 which passed the house on october 7 2005 would have limited the number of fuel blends across the country and would have strea mlined federal permittin g of refineries among other provisions controversial amendment to the clean air acts new source review provisions was removed before house passa ge however the senate took action on this bill for more information on new source review see crs report rs21608 clean air and new source review defining routine maintenance by larry parker clean air issues by james mccarthy specialis t in environmental policy 77225 the courts and the executive branch faced major decisions on clean air issues in 2005 and 2006 which were the subject of concern to some in congress one focus was the epa administrators ptember 21 2006 decision regarding air quality standards for fine particles according to epa and the consensus of the scientific community current concentrations of fine par ticles cause tens of thousands of premature deaths annually the admin istrators september 21 decision will strengthen the standards according to th agency it will reduce premature mortality by 1200 to 13000 persons annually ho wever many are unhappy that the new standard will not be more stringent for the first time ever it falls outside of range recommended by the clean air scientific advisory committee casac an independent body established by the clean air act to provide expert scientific advice on september 29 the casac chair formally objected to the administrators action in letter to him for mo re information see crs report rl33254 air quality epas 2006 changes to the particulate matter pm standard by robert esworthy and james mccarthyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33481crs6 on march 17 2006 the us court of appeals for the dc circuit struck down an epa rule that would have modified the new source review nsr provisions of the clean air act exempting most equipment replacement projects at power plants and other industrial sites fro m requirements to install pollution control equipment in 30 decision the court held that ep as attempt to change the nsr regulations was contrary to the plain language of the act congress acted on several clean air act caa issues in legislation that it passed and sent to the president in late july 2005 the most significant of these issues dealing with ethanol and reformulat ed gasoline rfg were addressed in the energy policy act of 2005 hr 6 pl 10958 the act eliminates requirement that rfg used in the nations most pollu ted areas contain at least 2 oxygen in its place the act requires that the tota l gasoline supply contain increasing amounts of renewable fuels requireme nt of great interest to the nations agricultural sector the renewable fuel is most likely to be ethanol which is generally made from corn congress also amended the clean air act in hr 3 pl 10959 the transportation bill that the president si gned on august 10 2005 further discussed below hr 3 addresses requirement that state and local transportation planners demonstrate conformity between thei r transportation plans and the timely achievement of air quality standards under the act the frequency of conformity determinations and the time frame during which conformity must be demonstrated will both be reduced failure to demonstrate conformity can lead to temporary suspension of federal highway funds other clean air act amendments stalled in the 109th congress bill that would have established capandtrade pr ogram for emissions of sulfur dioxide so2 nitrogen oxides nox and mercury from coalfired electric power plants was among the first items on the agenda of the 109th congress s 131 the clear skies act was scheduled for markup by the senate environment and public works committee on march 9 2005 but the committee fa iled to approve the bill on 99 tie vote in large part because of complain ts that the bill would weaken existing clean air act requirements another issue in th debate was whether to cap emissions of carbon dioxide co2 in addition to the other three pollutants with clear skies stalled on march 10 2005 epa finalized the clean air interstate rule cair which will cap emissions of so2 and nox from power plants in 28 eastern states and the district of columbia and establish capandtrade system through regulation deadline for mercury regulations helped drive the clear skies debate epa faced judicial deadline of march 15 2005 to promulgate standards for power plant mercury emissions the agency met this deadline but the specific regulations have been widely criticized and are now being challenged in court by at least 15 states the regulations could have been overtur ned if congress disa pproved them under the congressional review act resolution to do so sjres20 was defeated by vote of 5147 on september 13 2005 whether to modify other requirements of the clean air act new source review deadlines for nonattainment areas and provisions dealing with interstate air pollution have also been contentious issues for additional information see crs report rl33552 clean air act issues in the 109th congress by james mccarthyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33481crs7 clean water act by claudia copeland specialist in res ources and environmental policy 77227 the clean water act cwa is the principal law that regulates pollution in the nations lakes rivers and coas tal waters it also authoriz funds to aid construction of municipal wastewater tr eatment plants although mu ch progress has been made in achieving the ambitious goals that congress established in this law 30plus years ago to restore and maintain the chemical physical and biological integrity of the nations waters problems persist the types of remaining water quality problems are diverse ranging from pollution runoff from farm s and ranches city streets and other diffuse or nonpoint sources to metals nd organic and inorganic toxic substances discharged from factories and sewage treatment plants comprehensive legislation has been enacted since 1987 but bills dealing with specific water quality issues have been enacted and oversight hearings on the act and recent administration water quality initiatives have been hel d throughout this period congress has considered possible actions to implement existing provisions of the cwa whether additional steps are necessary to achieve the overall goals of the act and the appropriate federal role in guiding and payi ng for clean water infrastructure and other activities for further in formation see crs report rl33465 clean water act review of issues in the 109th congress and crs report rl30030 clean water act summary of the law both by claudia copeland during the 109th congress congress enacted two bills dealing with specific cwa programs in december 2005 cong ress passed hr 3963 authorizing 40 million per year for six years to extend th long island sound program under section 119 of the act pl 109137 in nove mber 2006 congress passed hr 6121 bill to reauthorize the lake pontchartrain basi n program in section 121 of the act pl 109392 other bills received consideration but were not enacted in december 2005 the house approved hr 1721 hrept 109292 to extend the coastal water quality program in section 406 of the act and to authorize 30 million over six years for coastal water quality monitoring in ptember 2006 the house transportation and infrastructure committee approved hr 4126 bill to improve and reauthorize the cwa chesapeake bay program in section 117 of the act also in september the senate environment and public works committee repor ted s 1848 bill intended to promote remediation of inactive an d abandoned hardrock mines by easing requirements of the clean water act and certain other environmental laws as an incentive to persons carrying out such projects the committee also approved bill to enhance the security of wastewater treatment works facilities by encouraging operators to assess security vulnerabilities and assisting security improvement projects s 2781 legislation to authorize funding for cl ean water infrastruct ure projects received attention in the 109th congress as it has for severa l years but legislation was enacted at issue is how the federal government will help states and cities meet needs to rebuild repair and upgrade wastewater treatment plants especially in view of costs that are projected to be as hi gh as 390 billion over the next two decades in july 2005 the senate environment and public works committee approved s 1400 authorizing federal funds fo r water quality and drinking water state revolving fundhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33481crs8 programs the senate did not take up this bill in may 2005 the house transportation and infrastructure committee approved bills to reauthorize funding for two other related cwa programs h r 624 to reauthorize section 221 of the act and provide 15 billion over six years for sewer overflow projects and hr 1359 to extend section 220 of the act author izing pilot program for alternative water source projects the house did not take up either of these bills the hurricanes that damaged large areas of the us gulf coast in 2005 were major focus of congressional ttention one area of intere st has been restoring public services that were disabled by the storms including water infrastructure facilities that experienced flooding and wind damage even more than year after the storms states and epa continue to assess needs to repair or rebuild these facilities on september 27 2005 the senate passed bill intended to st reamline delivery of funds through existing epa programs to repair stormdamaged sewage treatment and drinking water plants s 1709 furt her action occurred on this bill for information see crs report rs22285 hurricanedamaged drinking water and wastewater facilities impacts needs and response by claudia copeland water infrastructure funding also has been an issue in the context of the federal budget and appropriations the pr esidents fy2007 budge t requested 6876 million for clean water srf grants which is 22 less than was appr opriated in fy2006 and 37 below the fy2005 funding level on may 18 2 006 the h ouse passed hr 5386 hrept 109465 which provide d the requested level of 6876 million for clean water srf grants the senate appropriations committee approved the same funding level for clean water srf gran ts when it reported hr 5386 on june 29 srept 109275 both bills include f unds for congressionally earmarked project grants 200 million in the house bill and 210 million in the senate bill which the administration did not request advocates of the srf program especially state and local government officials contended that the cuts will impair their ability to carry out needed municipal wastewater tr eatment plant improvement projects administration officials responded that cu ts for the srf in fy2007 were necessary because congress boosted funds above the requested leve l in fy 2005 nd 2006 final action on this fy2007 appropriation bill did not occur before the 109th congress adjourned sine

public water systems epa has put in place regulations covering 91 cont aminants and more rules ar pending public water systems are required to test and if neede d treat their water to comply with the standards and treatment requirements contained in these regulations sdwa issues that received attention in the 109th congress included the ability of water systems to finance projects needed to comply with drinking water standards such as the arsenic and disinfection by product standards nd drinking water problems caused by unregulated contaminants such as methyl tertiary butyl etherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33481crs9 mtbe and perchlorate the key ingredient in solid rocket fuel see the mtbe discussion in the section below on leakin g underground storage tanks an issue in the first session was whether to exempt from regulation the injection into underground drinking water sources fluids that are used for hydraulic fracturing related to oil and gas production the energy po licy act of 2005 pl 10958 section 322 amended sdwa to exempt all fr acturing fluids excep t diesel fuel from regulation see crs report rl32873 key environmental issues in the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 hr 6 coordinated by brent d yacobucci perchlorate contamination also received congressional attenti on housepassed hr 186 and hr 18 would have aut horized remediation of perchlorate contaminated water in cer tain california communities hr 4798s 2298 would have authorized grants for remediating california water supplies contaminated by perchlorate and for developi ng perchlorate cleanup tec hnologies these companion bills also expressed the sense of congre ss that epa should set drinking water standard for perchlorate hr 213 would have required epa to set standard for perchlorate in 2007 epa has not determined whether re gulation is needed citing uncertainties regarding perchlorates health risk and occurrence and concern over the cost of treatment in early 2005 the na tional research council nrc issued comprehensive review of the health effects of perchlorate inges tion and made several recommendations to epa regarding its draft perchlorate risk assessment epa has adopted the nrcs recomme nded reference dose for perchlorate which would inform the standardsetting process and translates to drinking water equivalent level of 245 parts per billion however new studies raise questions about what level of perchlorate exposure might be safe wh ich could further complicate epa standard setting efforts see crs report rs21961 perchlorate contamination of drinking water regulatory issues and legislative actions by mary tiemann an ongoing issue concerns the ability of public water systems especially small systems to construct treatment facilities and improve infrastructure to comply with sdwa standards and ensure the safety of water supplies in 1996 congress created drinking water state revolving loan fund dwsrf program to help systems finance projects needed to meet standards and addr ess health risks for fy2006 in pl 109 54 congress provided 8375 million for the dwsrf program hr 5386 as passed by the house and reported in the senate included 8415 million for fy2007 as requested despite this program most surveys indi cate that an infrast ructure funding gap will continue to grow as the number of federal drinking water standards grows and the nations water infrastructure ages ep as 2003 needs survey indicates that water systems require capital investment of 277 billion over 20 years to address this issue the 109th congress considered several bills but none was enacted the senate committee on environment and public works reported s 1400 water infrastructure financing bill which would have increased funding authority for the

mary tiemann leaking underground storage tanks by mary tiemann specialist in environmental policy 75937 leaks from underground storage tanks u sts especially tanks containing petroleum have been major source of contamination for groundwater and drinking water supplies in 1984 congress establis hed leak prevention detection and cleanup program under subtitle i of the solid waste disposal act swda to address this problem with few exceptions usts that store petroleum or hazardous chemicals must comply with the leak pr evention detection nd cleanup requirements of subtitle i 42 usc 6901 et seq in 1986 congress created the leaking u nderground storage ta nk lust trust fund to help epa and states cover the co sts of responding to leaking petroleum usts in cases where tank owners fail to clean up releases states use most of their share of the annual lust trust fund ppropriation to oversee corrective actions performed by responsible parties roughly onethird of the lust money that states receive typically is used for cleanin g up abandoned tank s ites and undertaking emergency responses epa uses its portion of the appropriation primarily to oversee cooperative agreements with states imple

and the senate appropria tions committee recommended 728 million as requested although much progress has been made in the lust cleanup program roughly 114000 leaking tank sites still require remediation and states have faced several challenges key issue is that cleanup co sts have increased because of the presence of methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe which has been detected at thousands of lust sites this gasoline additive has been used to cut air pollution from auto emissions2 however mtbe is very water sol uble and once released tends to travel farther than conventional gaso line making it more likely to reach water supplies and more costly to remediate another issue is that most states have not had adequate resources to fully enforce ust leak pr evention regulations states

which added new leak prevention and enforcement provisions and imposed multiple new requirements on states epa and tank owners to better prevent and detect leaks the ustca requires epa or states that

develop training requirements for ust operators and individuals responsible for tank maintenance and spill response 3 prep are compliance reports on government owned tanks in the state and 4 ensure that groundwater protection measures are met by ust manufacturers and installers the energy policy act extended the gas tax that supports the lust trust fund through march 2011 and removed the clean air act oxygenated fuel requirement th at promoted greater use of mtbe congress also took steps to make more lust trust fund resources available to support implementation of the ust leak prevention and lust cleanup programs the ustca authorized the appropriation of 200 million from the trust fund annually for six years for epa and states to address leaks involving mtbe or renewable fuels and another 200 million nnually for six years for epa and states to administer the general lust cleanup program3 the ustca further authorized trust fund appropriations of 155 million annually for various ust and lust program purposes including inspections ope rator training delivery prohibition and other leak prevention and compliance activities although the ustca authorized lust trust fund appropriations for epa and states to administer and enforce new and existing leak prevention requirements of subtitle i the tax extension language in pl 10958 prohibited th use of the trust fund for

fy2 007 appropriations coordinated by carl behrens the adequacy of funding to clean up c ontamination on military lands is long standing issue although dod is required to clean up all contaminated lands within its jurisdiction closed bases have been of particular concern because cleanup generally must occur before the land can be transferred for civilian use most of the land on bases closed in past rounds fro m 1988 through 1995 has been cleaned up andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33481crs18 transferred for redevelopment however some of the land has yet to be cleaned up and has been awaiting transfer for many years over decade in some instances the closure of additional bases appr oved in the 2005 round will increase the inventory of military properties slated for civilian reuse there has been rising concern among affected communities about the extent to which contamination on these properties could delay or affect the potential for economic redevelopment to replace lost jobs see crs report rs 22065 military base closures role and costs of environmental cleanup by david m bearden another issue has been whether dod requests broader environmental exemptions than provided in current law are necessary to preserve military training capabilities the 107th and 108th congresses enacted exemptions from certain wildlife protection requirements that dod requested dod also has requested exemptions from certain air quality and hazardous wa ste cleanup requirements each year since fy2003 and requested them again in its fy2007 defense authorization proposal there was considerable public concern that these exemptions could result in harmful exposure to air pollutants and zardous substances and the109th congress did not include these exemptions in either defense authorization or appropriations legislation see crs report rs22149 exemptions from environmental law for the department of defense an overview of congressional action by david m bearden the adequacy and pace of

groundwater at many nuclear weapons sites however sites with the greatest cleanup challenges are not scheduled for completion until more than d ecade from now with the last sites not expected to be complete until 2035 among the most complex and costliest needs are the removal and disposal of hi ghlevel radioactive wastes stored in underground tanks at three sites including hanford in washington

significantly increase passengervehicle fuel ec onomy and reduce vehicle missions however mass production of such vehicles is currently co stprohibitive and many technical and cost barriers are
