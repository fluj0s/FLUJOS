internal controls were identified the weaknesses concerned were not sufficiently critical to compromise the overall system of internal control programme management the only project managed by the liaison office 04 abswils400 increased throughout 2004 from an initial budget of us 110200 to fin appropriation of us 197750 as result of its involvement in the zalmaï exhibition project the project

which were provided by other operations within the bureau for europe documentation was available authorising the transfer of these funds the zalmaï exhibition project which has been suc cess was initiated by the liaison office and coordinated by the head of office although the exhibit is now targeting other regions its responsibility still lies with the liaison office given the limited resources of the liaison office and considering that the project reaches fur ther than just switzerland it seems appropriate to transfer the responsibility for the project to the division of external relations the liaison office was working with only one partne r the organisation suisse daide aux réfugiés osar as its activities with this partne r had been discontinued in 2005 oios focused on the liaison offices financial and perfo rmance monitoring of the partner considering the protection nature of the operation and the limited financial input of unhcr in the partners global budget the

accordance with the international standards for the professional practice of internal auditing 2 the liaison office for switzerland and liec htenstein is based at unhcr headquarters following the increasingly restrictiv position of switzerland in recent years the liaison office is placing emphasis on public aw areness activities and dialogue with the authorities until the new asylum law is approved by parliament on more institutional aspect the liaison office is involved in the asylu m airport procedure and protection officer is posted at the airport to monitor refusal s of asylum and

agreement ii audit scope and methodology 5 the audit focused on 2004 programme activit ies under project 04abswils400 with expenditure of us 216200 our review concent rated on the activities directly implemented by unhcr with expenditure of us 16240 0 and on the monitoring by the liaison office of the activities of its implementin g partner organisation suisse daide aux réfugiés osar representing us 53800 the partn ership with osar has been discontinued in 2005 6 the audit reviewed the administration of th liaison office with budget totalling us 15500 for the year 2004 six staff members wer working for the operation in 2004 comprising five staff on regular posts and jpo 7 the audit activities included review and assessment of internal control systems interviews with staff analysis of applicable data and review of the available documents and other relevant records iii audit findings and recommendations 2 zalmaï exhibition project 8 the liaison office manages single project 04abswils400 for the promotion of refugees rights public awareness and fundraisi ng 9 in 2004 the budget of the project increase d by 56 per cent from us 110200 to final appropriation of us 197750 this progressiv increase derives from the liaison offices involvement in the zalmaï exhibition proje ct which grew from initially funding the project of photographer of swiss refugees of afgh an origin to cover the return of refugees to afghanistan and the coordinating of travellin g world exhibit earmarked funds were received and allocated to the project as additional contributions for unbudgeted activities as described in iomfom0162004 of 9 february 2004 the successive increases of the appropriation did not fully cover the final yearen d project expenditure of us 216200 which was us 18500 or 9 per cent in excess of the final appropriation the liaison office could not provide oios with formal authorization from the director of the bureau for europe to transfer funds to the project oios menti oned to the head of liaison office that formal authorization for the transfer of funds shou ld have been secured prior to the further commitment of funds the head of office further explained that the over expenditure derived from the uniqueness of the zalmaï project and from the liaison office incurring some expenditure on behalf of the division of external r elations 10 in its review of the documentation availab oios noted that for catering and printing services valued at us 13000 related to the stagin g of the geneva exhibition three quotations had not been received and compared to sure best value for money there was only memorandum which authorized the procurement ex post facto oios reminded the liaison office of the need to comply with unhcrs p rocurement rules and procedures the head of office explained that the market on such rvices was very limited one and that in the case of catering services the company had asso ciated its offer with donationinkind 11 very soon after the initiation of the zalm aï exhibition it developed into one of worldwide travelling exhibition and collection bo ok of photographs the exhibition was partly funded from private contributions consideri ng the size of the project and its far reaching audience it is not clear to oios why the liaison office is still responsible for coordinating it given the limited staffing levels of the liaison office it seems appropriate to transfer the responsibility for the exhibition to t he division of external relations recommendation head2right the unhcr bureau for europe should consider transfe rring the responsibility for the coordination of the zalm aï project to the division of external relations as there is longer clear rationale for the involvement of the liaison office for switzerland and liechtenstein rec 01 b other programme issues 12 until 2004 the liaison office delegated s ome responsibilities of the programme to its implementing partner osar under subproject 04ab swils400a in 2004 osar 3 received us 53800 to provide legal advice and dis seminate legal and jurisprudence analysis as well as to coordinate ngos and other actors in t he field of asylum seekers considering the very low ratio of unhcr funds to the overall budget of osar these could be seen as contribution to osars overall activities rather th an directly funding specific project 13 as the partnership with osar was discontin ued in 2005 oios focused on the liaison offices monitoring of the partner 14 oios assessed that project financial monit oring was competently performed however standard reports were not submitted in acc ordance with the timeline and the amounts and sequence of instalments did not equate to the provisions in the subproject agreement oios suggested that future subproject greements be as realistic as possible 15 the latest set of indicators and targets f or the performance measurement of programme activities in switzerland and liechtenste in are detailed in the 2005 country operation plan cop in general these could be im proved introducing quantitative and measurable targets for example in the 2005 cop under theme 1 goal 2 performance indicators organized presence of legal counsellors inside all reception centres could be restated as ensure presence in x centres out of th total xx centres timely production of unhcr comments would have to define what is meant by timely eg within 1 month after release of legislation and monitor variances on t he zalmaï exhibition theme 2 goal 1 starting from the number of viewers in 2004 and the planned exhibit reasonable target audience could be set on the advice of oios the liaison office has alrea dy amended its 2006 cop to include the quantitative examples as pr ovided above recommendation head2right the unhcr liaison office for switzerland and liechtenstein should further review its objectives and targets to introduce quantitative measurable targets rec 02 c administration 16 considering the liaison offices location at headquarters there were only limited activities in administration and finance the liais on office refers to the supply management service for procurement the personnel administrati on section for local staffing issues and the finance section is approving expenditure therefore in its review of the liaison office administration oios mainly focused on its responsi bility for financial control and monitoring 17 oios noted that supporting documents and v ouchers for all transactions were not all kept in one file the desk had to provide copies of some of the projects main documents as they were not available in the liaison office for monitoring purposes as well as for the efficiency of controls standard essential files ch as project file and an accounting file with vouchers and supporting documentation in sequ ential order and by month should be kept within the liaison office recommendation 4 head2right the unhcr liaison office for switzerland and liechtenstein should ensure all supporting document ation and relevant information on its activities be kept organized and filed in the liaison office rec 03 18 considering the size of the operation and the staffing level the secretary is responsible for the activities relating to the admi nistrative and programme budgets although assistance from the programme assistant of the desk covering switzerland is provided on specific issues or upon request it app ears that the incumbent did not undergo specific financial and programme management trainin g as her present responsibilities would require the liaison office has already included in its cop for 2006 request to change the secretary position to one of adminfinance clerk w hich is more representative of present responsibilities and skills needed in the liaison ffice 19 in trying to reconcile the detailed abod t ransaction data to summary reports oios identified several transactions in the commitment c ontrol ledger that were not appropriately charged to the 699 programme code one transaction was directly recorded under programme 800 which should just comprise of staff costs and two other transactions were recorded under the annual budget ab as result the msrp hcr 113 report did not pick up the transactions and disclosed an erroneous amount 20 moreover oios found that while all 699 ex penditure initially posted to the commitment control ledger should be broken down and reallocated to programmes 700 800 and 900 in the general ledger some us 1000 was s till not reallocated for the 2004 abod account it was not evident why this amount has rem ained as we understand that obligations longer required were cleared prior to the closur of the 2004 accounts oios has requested the unhcr finance section to review these balances to ensure they are appropriately allocated andor cleared it should be noted that ios audit of msrp post implementation has already identified the clearing of commitments as an area warranting further attention by the unhcr finance section we will bring this issu to the attention of the msrp project team iv acknowledgement 21 i wish to express my appreciation for the assistance and cooperation extended to the auditor by the staff of unhcr egbert c kaltenbach chief unhcr audit service office of internal oversight services
