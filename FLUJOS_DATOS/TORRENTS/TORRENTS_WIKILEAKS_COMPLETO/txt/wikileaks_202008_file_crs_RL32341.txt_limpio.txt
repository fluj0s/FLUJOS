responsibility of states and local communities as such funding for firefighters is provided mostly by state and local governments during the 1990s shortfalls in state and local budgets coupled with increased responsibilities of local fire departments led many in the fire community to call for additional financial support from the federal government while federally funded training programs existed and continue to exist through the national fire academy and while federal money was available to first responders for counterterrorism training and equipment through the department of justice1 there did not exist dedicated program exclusively for firefighters which provided federal money directly to local fire departments to help address wide variety of equipment training and other firefighterrelated needs assistance to firefighters grant program during the 106th congress many in the fire community asserted that local fire departments require and deserve greater support from the federal government the assistance to firefighters grant program afg also known as fire grants or the fire act grant program was established by title xvii of the fy2001 national defense authorization

outreach6 the consolidated appropriations act of 2008 pl 110161 in the accompanying joint explanatory statement directed the government accountability office gao to review the application and award process for fire and safer grants additionally fema was directed to peer review grant applications that best address the programs priorities and criteria as established by fema and the fire service those criteria necessary for peerreview must be included in the grant application package applicants whose grant applications are not reviewed must receive an official notification detailing why the application did not meet the criteria for review applications must be rankordered and funded following the rank order distribution of fire grants the fire act statute prescribes 14 different purposes for which fire grant money may be used see 15 usc 2229b3 these are hiring firefighters training firefighters creating rapid intervention teams certifying fire inspectors establishing wellness and fitness programs funding emergency medical services acquiring firefighting vehicles acquiring firefighting equipment acquiring personal protective equipment modifying fire stations enforcing fire codes funding fire prevention programs educating the public about arson prevention and detection and providing incentives for the recruitment and retention of volunteer firefighters the dhs has the discretion to decide which of those purposes will be funded for given grant year since the program commenced in fy2001 the majority of fire grant funding has been used by fire departments to purchase firefighting equipment personal protective equipment and firefighting vehicles the program does not award funding for major building construction eligible applicants are limited primarily to fire departments defined as an agency or organization that has formally recognized arrangement with state local or tribal authority to provide fire suppression fire prevention and rescue services to population within fixed geographical area emergency medical services ems activities are eligible for fire grants including limited number more than 2 of funds allocated to ems organizations not

frequentlyaskedquestions the latest awards announcements and other information see the assistance to firefighters grant program web page at httpwwwfiregrantsupportcom the fire act statute provides overall guidelines on how fire grant money will be distributed and administered the law directs that volunteer departments receive proportion of the total grant funding that is not less than the proportion of the us population that those departments protect currently 55 the assistance to firefighters grant program reauthorization act of 2004 title xxxvi of pl108 375 raised award caps and lowered nonfederal matching requirements based on recipient community population extended eligibility to nonaffiliated emergency medical services ie ambulance services not affiliated with fire departments and expanded the scope of grants to include firefighter safety rd there is set geographical formula for the distribution of fire grants fire departments throughout the nation apply and award decisions are made by peer panel based on the merits of the application and the needs of the community however the law does require that fire grants should be distributed to diverse mix of fire departments with respect to type of department paid volunteer or combination geographic location and type of community served eg urban suburban or rural7 the fire acts implementing regulation provides that in few cases to fulfill our obligations under the law to make grants to variety of departments we may also make funding decisions using rank order as the preliminary basis and then analyze the type of fire department paid volunteer or combination fire departments the size and character of the community it serves urban suburban or rural andor the geographic location of the fire department in these instances where we are making decisions based on geographic location we will use states as the basic geographic unit8 according to the fy2008 program guidance for the assistance to firefighters program career paid departments will compete against other career departments for up to 45 of the available funding while volunteer and combination departments will compete for at least 55 of the available funding9 however given that less than 10 of fire grant applications are historically received from career departments funding levels are likely not to reach the 45 ceiling for career departments10 additionally each fire department that applies is classified as either urban suburban or rural in fy2005 6 of the total number of fire grant awards went to urban areas 17 to suburban areas and 77 to rural areas of the total amount of federal 7 15 usc 2229b9 8 44 cfr part 1526c 9 for the fy2008 round of awards less than 33 of afg funds must be awarded to combination departments and less than 22 of afg funds must be awarded to all volunteer departments see department of homeland security fiscal year 2007 assistance to firefighters grants program and application guidance february

and 69 to rural areas11 finally in an effort to maximize the diversity of awardees the geographic location of an applicant using states as the basic geographic unit is used as deciding factor in cases where applicants have similar qualifications table 5 shows statebystate breakdown of fire grant funding for fy2001 through fy2007 while table 6 shows statebystate breakdown of safer grant funding for fy2005 through fy2007 table 7 provides an indepth look at the fy2007 fire grants showing for each state the number of fire departments in each state12 the number of fire grant applications the total amount requested the total amount awarded and the amount of funds awarded as percentage of funds requested as table 7 shows the entire pool of fire department applicants received to date about 16 of the funds they requested in fy2007 this is down from 21 in fy2006 22 in fy2005 28 in fy2004 and 34 in fy2003 this reflects the fact that the number of applications and federal funds requested have trended upward over these years while appropriations for the fire grant program have declined over the same period issues in the 110th congress primary issue in the 110th congress is how appropriations for fire grants should compare with the authorized annual levels of 1 billion the administrations budget proposals have typically recommended significant cuts for fire grants as well as zero funding for safer grants opponents of the cuts have argued that the reduced levels are inadequate to meet the needs of fire departments while the administration has argued that reduced levels are sufficient to enhance critical capabilities in the event of terrorist attack or major disaster aside from budget issues an ongoing issue has been the focus of the fire grant program administration budget proposals have sought to shift the priority of the fire grant program to terrorism preparedness firefighting groups have questioned this proposed shift arguing that the original purpose of the fire act enhancing basic firefighting needs should not be compromised or diluted similarly in recent years the house and senate appropriations committees have directed the afg program to maintain broad allhazards focus s 608 the riskbased homeland security grants act of 2007 would direct dhs to conduct study analyzing the distribution of fire grant awards and the level of unmet firefighting equipment needs in each state 11 department of homeland security national preparedness directorate capabilities division assistance to firefighters grant program fy2005 report p 14 12 the fire grant program sets limit of up to three applications per fire department per year vehicle application an application for operations and safety and regional application thus the number of fire departments in state plays major factor in the number of fire grant applications submitted and the amount of total funding awarded within given state for example because pennsylvania has by far the largest number of fire departments it is not surprising that it leads the nation in the number of fire grants applications and the amount of funding awarded crs10 related issue is the role of the us fire administration in the administration of the fire grant program at its inception the program was administered by the usfafema and focused on enhancing the basic needs of fire departments across the nation in the fy2004 budget request as part of its effort to consolidate terrorism preparedness grants under single entity the administration proposed to relocate the fire grant program within the office for domestic preparedness odp whose mission was to provide state and local governments with assistance to improve their readiness for terrorism incidents the fy2004 dhs appropriations act pl 108 90 acceded to the administrations request and relocated the fire grants to odp the conferees directed that dhs shall continue current administrative practices in manner identical to the current fiscal year including peer review process of applications granting funds directly to local fire departments and the inclusion of the united states fire administration during grant administration on january 26 2004 thendhs secretary ridge informed congress of his intention to consolidate odp including the assistance to firefighters program into the office of state and local government coordination preparedness oslgcp the fy2005 homeland security appropriations act pl 108334 placed the fire grant program within oslgcp however the assistance to firefighters grant program reauthorization act of 2004 pl 108375 designated administration of the fire grant program to usfa according to the fy2006 budget request the fire grant program would be administered by the oslgcp in cooperation with the usfa on july 13 2005 dhs secretary michael chertoff announced restructuring of dhs effective october 1 2005 under the restructuring plan the fire grants as well as the safer grants were to be administered by the office of grants and training in the new dhs directorate for preparedness however legislation considered in the 109th congress sought to restructure fema within dhs with the result that fire and safer grant programs would be transferred back to fema ultimately title vi of the conference agreement on the dhs appropriations bill pl 109295 hrept 109699 the post katrina emergency management reform act of 2006 transferred most of the existing preparedness directorate including fire and safer grants and the usfa back to an enhanced fema crs11 table 5 statebystate distribution of
