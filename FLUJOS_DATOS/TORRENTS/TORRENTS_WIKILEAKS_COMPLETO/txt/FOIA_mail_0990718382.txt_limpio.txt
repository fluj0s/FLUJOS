xflowed john for future reference i think its also important to clarify for you what the dahljensen clow et borehole results actually show see dahljensen et past temperatures directly from the greenland ice sheet science 282 october 1998 in fact the results show that the amplitude of variability over the past 1000 years differs by factor of 2 between the grip and dye 3 borehole estimates the latter only 865 km to the south this is an example of extreme regionalscale variability which should give pause to those who want to draw largescale inferences however even more importantly they show in the case of dye 3 the mid 20th century warm period in the record actually exceeds the medieval warm peak see fig 4 lower panel blue curve so here we have two temperature histories less than 1000 km apart in greenland which give different stories regarding the level of medieval warmth with at least one of the histories conforming precisely to the hemispheric trends presented in ipcc chapter 2 note that in the chapter we actually discuss the evidence of conflicting temperature trends in greenland though not specifically referring to dahljensen et so do i understand correctly that you are referring to the results of dahljensen et as conflicting with what we say in the chapter at the face of it this argument has merit whatsoever i think we should all use better explanation from you since you seem to be arguing publically that the dahljensen et record undermines what weve said in the chapter thanks in advance mike ps ive ccd in eric steig collaborator of clows and greenland antarctic ice core expert to make sure my facts above have been presented accurately perhaps eric woudl be kind enough to forward my email to gary clow and gary can let us know directly if he disagrees with any of my remarks above at 0330 pm 52301 0400 michael mann wrote john i appreciate your reply however i dont agree at all w your assessment it was determined early on that the ice core borehole results would be discussed in the context of the millennialscale variability section as they arguably dont have the resolution to address the timescales relevant to the past 1000 years so this was in jeans domain not mine and if the crossreferences between the sections arent clear enough in that regard that is indeed our fault however there is considerable discussion of the fact that the arcticnorth atlantic regions are inappropriate for inferences into hemisphericscale temperature patterns and this remains fundamentally from any reasonable treatment of the underlying climate dynamics that influence that region the various hemispheric temperature reconstructions discussed in our chapter the emphasis was on the commonality between them including mann et jones et briffa et crowley and lowery and others make considerable use of just about all of the available reliable lowres and highres paleo data available and come to clear concensus regarding the relative warmth of the medieval period at the hemisphericglobal scale crowleys modeling results come to the same conclusion and it entirely independent of any empirical paleoclimate reconstructions you misrepresent the mann et reconstructionit is not based on tree rings but uses all highresolution proxy information commonly available we have shown in fact that our reconstruction is robust to the inclusiondisclusion of tree ring information the crowley and lowery reconstruction which is discussed in our chapter makes use of almost tree ring data and employs lowerresolution proxy indicators including the very records keigwin lambs central england temperature record gisp2 o18 that are often used to argue for warmer mwp and yet comes to the same conclusion and tom shows that when averaged across the hemisphere warmerthanpresentday mwp just doesnt hold up our treatment of this subject in the chapter was far more careful far more inclusive and detailed and far more nuanced than you give us credit for your comments below remain disturbingly selective and myopic and we have dealt w similar comments many times over if abc is looking to do hatchet job on ipcc so be it this doesnt surprise mestossel has an abysmal record in his treatment of environmental issues from what i had heard but ill be very disturbed if you turn out to have played into this in way that is unfair to your coauthors on chapter 2 and your colleagues in general this wouldnt have surprised coming from certain individuals but i honestly expected more from you mike date wed 23 may 2001 135049 0500 from john christy christynsstcuahedu xmailer mozilla 404 macintosh i ppc to michael mann mannmultiproxyevscvirginiaedu subject re ipcc hi mike heres what happened abc news 2020 with stossel wanted to be part of segment that will air at the end of june on the climate change issue specifically the piece will be dealing with the alarmist rhetoric that tends to be found in the media i am more than happy to talk about that because ive been very disappointed with what has gone on even with respect to some of the ipcc elders and their pronouncements for forthcoming disasters in one of the preinterviews they asked about the hockey stick i told them of my doubts about the intercentury precision of the record especially the early part and that other records suggested the period 1000 years ago was warmer i remember saying that you must give the author credit for including the large error bars for that time series in the figure i also specifically said that the most precise record of century scale precision greenland borehole temps was very important to note but that the figure was not in the ipcc i then looked quickly at the ipcc reference list and saw the citation of dahljensen and assumed that it was at least commented on in the 1000 year time series material and told abc as much abc called back few days later and said they couldnt find reference to the greenland stuff in the ipcc discussion of the past 1000 years so i read the final version and abc was right i said this was an omission that should not have happened and that i take part of the blame because i had mentioned it at each of our lead author meetings last thursday night i was one of the guys flown to ny city for the taping of the show there was only one question on this particular issue it was even after stossel had left the room and i gave much the same answer as i indicated above as best as i can remember that the hockey stick i dont think i used the term hockey stick and im almost positive i did not mention your name at any point is one realization of temperatures but that other data are not included and that i had thought the other data were clearly mentioned in the ipcc but werent i mentioned the large error bars as credit to you and that i was partly to blame for this omission if they use my remark they could slice and dice it to make it as provocative as possible four of us were taped for almost 2 hours and from this they will select about 8 minutes so i doubt my remarks will make the show when stossel came back in after all was said and done he said to that i might be good scientist but i didnt have the emotion and passion necessary to excite the audience in one way that is compliment i suppose i think pat m will have good chunk of air time i dont remember whether he added any comments on the 1000year time series but he may have whatever is shown just keep it in context there is way clear scientific point with all the caveats and uncertainties can come across in such venues however i do agree with stossels premise though i dont know what the piece will actually look like so i may be disappointed that the dose of climate change disasters that have been dumped on the average citizen is designed to be overly alarmist and could lead us to make some bad policy decisions ive got good story about the writers of the time cover piece couple of months ago that proves they were not out to discuss the issue but to ignore science and influence government it is not bad science to look at arguably the most precise measure of point temperature actually two boreholes when that point shows 600 year period of greater warmth than today on that time scale the equivalent spatial scale is much larger than any of the regional oscillations we now identify but there are several other admittedly less robust measures that suggest greater warmth 1000 years ago that are outside the n atlantic area i just dont think tree rings if averaged over century can tell us which century was warmest weve never had two complete independent centuries of global instrumental data separated by more than one century to even test this idea by the way i came to my own conclusions long before broekers piece appeared this is an area of further work that i promoted to the nrc about 2 months ago more funding for paleo work to assess intercentury precision of all proxy records regarding the ipcc the ipcc tar is good but it is not perfect nor sacred and is open to criticism as any document should be in some cases it is already outdated some of the story lines used to generate high temperature changes are simply ridiculous the ipcc is us we are under gag rule to keep our thoughts to ourselves i thought our chapter turned out pretty good overall and i attribute that to the open working relationship we all had some other chapter groups did not experience this and to the tireless efforts of our convening lead authors good to hear from you john c john r christy
