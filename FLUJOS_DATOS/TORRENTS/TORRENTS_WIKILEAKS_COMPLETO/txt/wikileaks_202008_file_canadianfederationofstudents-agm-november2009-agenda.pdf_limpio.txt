general meeting in early october the postgraduate studlmts society of mcgill university pgss submitted motions for consideration at the upcoming general meeting the students society also circulated the proposed motions to member locals several nonmember students unions university administrators and variety of groups with which the federation works such as labour unions social justice organisations education section groups at the time i expressed serious concern that number of the statements were false and malicious and about the potential impact these statements could have the national executive shares these concerns and ultimately has responsibility to ensure that material that is false and libelous is not circulated in the form of motion or otherwise republishing the offending clauses would be irresponsible stewardship of the organization and disservice to the membership in addition the national executive has contractual obligations to employees that would have been violated by the inclusion of one of the motftons served by the postgraduate students society of mcg university pgss therefore that motion has been omitted as well to that end upon consultation with the federations legal counsel the national executive has removed number of clauses that are false andor libelous however all other motions regardless of merit are included for the consideration

federations bylaws and policy manual or undertake campaigns be submitted fewer than six weeks prior to the general meeting at which they are to be considered motions submitted by member locals the following motions were served by member locals with notice and shall be considered at the meeting 2009111n01 motion local 108 whereas tuition fees are major baltier for any individual desiring higher education forcing students to pick between debt or education at all and whereas forcing college denseignement general et professionnel cegep students into debt before they even reach university can only do harm to quebec society and whereas the accessibility ofpostsecondary education in quebec is something to protect and work toward improving and whereas tuition fees at the cegep level would constitute break with quebecs proud tradition of offering the most accessible postsecondary education in the country and whereas the cegep system has served as the only model of near universally accessible system of postsecondary education in canada therefore be it resolved that any attempt at imposing tuition fees for college denseignement general et professionnel cegep itudents be opposed 200911n02 motion to adopt policy local 11 be it resolved that the following issues policy on poverty be adopted preamble the federation recognises that conditions of poverty affect access to and quality of post secondary education high tuition fees and inadequate student financial ajd prevent those living in poverty from entering postsecondary education program or completing their studies parental educational attainment is also strong factor of dependents ability to attend and pay for postsecondary education further contributing to inaccessibility lack of access reinforces cycle of poverty poverty is an affront to human dignity and disproportionately affects communities that are already marginalized including aboriginal peoples women racialised people people with disabilities seniors queer people transgendered people and immigrant and nonstatus people and sale support parents the federation recognises that many individuals who live below the poverty line are working one or more jobs and are considered to be the working poor this includes large proportion of students who work either part or fulltime often for minimum wage to pay for their education 32320276 canadian

2009 chronic underfunding ofsocial services such as postsecondary education healthcare public housing social assistance and childcare coupled with widespread lack of food security and the absence of living wage have contributed to the spread of poverty this is especially true during times of economic hardshil the longterm cost of poverty such as the strain on the healthcare system and elevated crime and incarceration rates far outweighs the cost of investing in social services that hflp to prevent and alleviate poverty the federation recognises that current levels of various forms of assistance are inadequate and believes that it should not be necessary to combine forms of assistance in order to live above the poverty line the federation recognises that there is negative view of individuals receiving government assistance in most forms and that this has jed to the implementation of regressive measures such as discriminatory fraud reporling mechanisms in addition those receiving social assistance and government loans to fund postsecondary education will often have that amount clawed back from their social assistance clawbacks further reinforce cycle of poverty and prevent skirrs development furthermore the federation belielves that access to housing and food security and an income that is adequate are basig human rights the federation threfore calls for minimum income level for individuals regardless of employment status that is above the generally accepted measuremenfof poverty ie the lowincome cut off ico published by statistics canada policy the federation supports the development and implementation of poverty reduction strategies at both the federal and provincial level that involve consultations with communities where poverty is prevalent includes firm targets and iimelines and include significant financial commitments to social services such as education health care housing social assistance and childcare and federal support for provincial territorial municipal and aboriginal governments in their efforts to address poverty in their communities afld the root causes of that poverty and additional targeted ltjeasures to alleviate poverty amongst marginalised communities that experience dispropoftjonate rates of poverty and the establishment of standard minimum living wage which allows workers and their families to have decent quality of life and to participate fully in society on the most equal basis possible and social assistance rates that allow for an individual or family to live in dignity and above the poverty line and the recognition of and promotion of the fact that poverty is result of economic policy and not individual or personal responsibility the federation opposes harmful stereotypes about people living in poverty or receiving social assistance as lazy irresponsible or inferior and government cuts to social assistance measures that serve to convert public debt into private debt and poverty thus widening the gap between rich and poor and clawbacks of social assistance empfoyment insurance child benefits and student assistance based on other earnings and government legislatiofl that reduces or eliminates access to bankruptcy processes and government regulations that prevent individuals enrolled in university or college program from receiving socia assistance and the removal of basic funding for people with disabilities 200911 n03 motion local 19 whereas data coliection on graduate student completion rates and postgraduation employment is critical to understanding how many masters and doctorate students abandon their studies their reasons for doing so and the impact of hiring freezes upon postgraduation employment and 6132320276 canadian federation of 5 040713 pm 09112009 947 page 4 opening plenary agenda 28th annual national general meeting of the canadian federation of studentsservices wednesday november 25 to saturday november 282009 200911 n04 whereas lack of standardised and available data in this area makes it nearly impossible for this information to be gathered by researchers and whereas this data would allow for research to be conducted on how many students finish their masters or doctoral studies and how many go on to jobs within the postsecondary sector and whereas this information is particularly critical in time where faculty hiring freezes and institutional cut backs are tnreatening the ability of current students and newry graduated masters or doctorate holders to gain permanent or tenured employment within the post secondary education sector therefore be it resolved that polling firm be icontracted to study the completion rates of post graduate students including how many continue to work cit canadian colleges and universities after graduation and be it further resolved that data also be collected on the length of time it takes for recent graduates to secure fulltime faculty positions and be it further resolved that data also be collected on the employment type job security and relevance to their field of study of postgraduate masters and doctoral students as well as whether they are working in their desired profession and be it further resolved that coalition partner support be solicited to help facilitate the study including investigating the possibjjj1 of sharing the cost of the study_ motion to adopt policy local 19 be it resolved that the issues polley on research councils be amended to read research councils preamble independent research free of influence from powerful interests is critical to both scholarly inquiry and research integrity political or corporate interference can undermine the peer review process and threaten the principle of academic freedoma key foundation of public postsecondary education the natural sciences and engineering research council nserc social sciences and humanities research council sshrc and the canadian institutes for health research cihr also known as the tricouncils provide the majority of public funds for research in canada the canada council for the arts provides funding to artists and arts organisations these councils are mandated 10 promote the highest standards of research excellence public funding for research scholarly and artistic activities is integral to strong canadian intellectual and cultural fabric increasingly governments are placing direct and indirect pressure on granting councils to fund research and art that is politically agreeable to the government governments have also increasingly shifted funding support to favour industrypartnered research and research that is commercialisable over other types of research this commercial bias can lake the form of creating incentives for doing industry oriented research making the councils justify themselves in terms of the economic growth they generate and direct contact with granting council officials about funding decisions they have made federal government policies that offer incentives to commercialise research increase the pressure to produce private forprofit research in public postsecondary education institutions this shift has influenced the mandates of the granting councils to increasingly support for profit research the commercialisation of research poses threats to the ability of researchers to participate in curiositydriven or basic research that does not have an immediate commercial interest but which can nonetheless make important contributions to society and the economy funding agenda thatfavours commercialisable research also poses threats to research integrity and to basic and exploratory research in addition although the majority of students and faculty study and teach in the social sciences and humanities funding to sshrc is significantly lower than the funding provided to the other two tricouncils this suggests funding bias that disadvantages the social sciences and humanities 6132320276 canadian

and sustained publil funding for artists supported by the canada council for the arts equitable distribution of granting council funds among disciplines and institutions adequate allocation of granting council funds for basic research granting council research funding provided to support public as opposed to private interests granting councils that uphold the highest standard of research by explicitly supporting the roleofwhistle blowers through ti1eenactment ofwhistle blower protection policies and independence of the research granting councils from political and government influence the federation opposes political and govemment influelnce over research and research funding threats to the geerreviewed accountable and transparent system for allocating grants reductions in public funding for research supported by the granting councils inadequate and unpredictable public funding for artists supported by the canada council for the arts inequitable distribution of granting council funds among disciplines and institutions inadequate allocation of granting council funds for basic research and granting council research funding provided to prioritize private forprofit interests rather than public interests motion local 78 whereas open access promotes making scholarly material available online for anyone to read or use free of charge and whereas the majority of published research is funded by the public through government granting agencies so it is unreasonable for the public to pay again through user fees to gain access to this research and whereas the university of toronto library is now charging visiting scholars and students 200 per year for borrowing and in some cases browsing privileges at its robarts library thereby placing greater strain on online material and whereas the usbased scholarly publishing and academic resources coalition sparc issued right to research statement wwwrlghttoresearchorg calling on canadian and american universities researchers governments and research funders to actively support open access with the goal of starting north american campaign on this issue and whereas the content of the statement mirrors the federations position on scholarly publishing notably calling on canadian and american research funders and governments to ensure open access to all publicly funded research and whereas the national graduate caulus signed the statement on july 7 2009 therefore be is resolved that the right to research satement be endorsed and be it further resolved that mmber locals be encouraged to endorse the right to research statement and be it further resolved that updated c81mpaign materials be distributed to member locals motion local 78 whereas the federation was created to be national association of individual students and whereas the individual student members are represented in the federation at national meetings by their respective local student unions known within the federation as the voting members and canadian federation of s 040757 pm 09112009 11 47 page 6 opening plenary agenda 28th annual national general meeting of the canadian federation of studentsservices wednesday november 25 to saturday november 28 2009 whereas the voting members have resolved to vest in the individual members all authority to decide questions of membership including the initiation of any referendum on the question of continued membership and whereas the bylaws currently provide for referendum on the question of continued membership to be initiated by petition signed by 10 percent of the individual members and whereas this approach aimed at greater grassroots democracy within our federation seems to be open to abuse and whereas based on the information reported in the student press concerning the campuses in question as few as 12000 signatures could result in jo referendums and whereas evidence indicates lhat this is coordinated plan to destabilize our federation by small group of individuals including some nonmembers and whereas evidence indicates that as part of this coordinated effort to destabilize our federation the organizers of the peulions intend to submit them all on the same day in an effort to force the various referendums to be held within the same small window of time and whereas the bylaws contemplate the federation and its members having the opportunity to present case for continued membership in any referendum campaign and whereas forcing all referenda to be held within the same small window of time is fundamentally antidemocratic because the federation and its members wourd have reasonabre opportunity to present case for continued membership in the federation and whereas the enormous task of trying to present the case for continued membership in so many referendums within the same small window in time would inevitably detract from the federations normal duty of providing representation and services whereas the interests of students in canada are best served by having strong and stable national association therefore be it resolved that the reference to ten percent 10 in bylaw 1 article 6a be amended to read twenty percent 20 be it further resolved that bylaw 1 article 6b be amended to read b schedule i within 90 days of receipt of the petition described in bylaw i section 6a the national executive will review the petition to determine ifit is in order and if it is in consultation with the member local will schedule areferendum that is not less than 60 days and not more than 90 days following

work of the canadian fhderation of students has expanded to include lhe issues and needs of international students on both college and university campuses and whereas the founding premise of the canadian federation of students is for public accessible and the right to poslsecondal education of all students whereas international students play an important role in the work of the federation and should have equal voice andrepresentalion therefore be it resolved that the article 2 of the statement of purpose be amended to read 2 to represent promote and defend the common interests of students studying at canadian postsecondary institutions motion to adopt policy local 241 be it resolved the following issues policy on credit transfer be adopted credit transfer preamble for variety of reasons many students who start postsecondary diploma or degree at one institution may choose to finish it at another institution changing market demands and new programmes offered by colleges and universities have also lead to an increase in the number of students who choseto supplement diploma or degree with second designation while some provinces responded to marked increase in the level of interinstitutional cooperation by establishing provincial regujations to ensure that programmes remain congruent most others have not and the federal government has made effort to coordinate the standardisation of credit transfer between provinces in the absence of provincewide or federal initiative to facilitate the articulation transfer and admissions arrangements among degree and diploma granting institutions hundreds of agreements had emerged between colleges and universities while this rapid emergence of interinstitutional cooperation has improved educational opportunities it has also lead to increased confusion inconsistency and duplication as result students are often ielft to try and navigate system where programmes may be offered at separate institutions uidd by separate policies or when transferring from one institution to another forced to negotiate on their own which credits will be recognised due to the ad hoc nature of these agrelmenls many students find themselves paying for and earning the same credits more than onceadding to additional costs for the student and the government to help ensure that students am able to move as easily as possible from institution to institution mandatory system of credit transfer needs to be created polley the federation supports maintaining clear transparent and predictable pathways to learning enhancing student mobility through the creation of mandatory credit transfer system provincial frameworks for credit transfer that fit into broader pancanadian system the promotion of accurate and fair priorlearning

colleges to participate in 200911 n09 motion to amend policy local 241 whereas the federation currently has policy on commercialisation on campuses but the extent and intervention of commercialization within postsecondary institutions has dramatically grown throughout the years and there hasbeen loss of public space and surplus of commercial involvement and encroachment in the classroom therefore be it resolved that the issues policy commercialisation be amended to include the following 3 when it enshrines benefactors on to buildings objects public space departments faculties or schools and 4 the inclusion of corporate ads in course textbooks or mandatory equipment for classes 2009111 n1 0 motion local 241 whereas many canadians have lost their jobs and need to access employment insurance ei as result of the recession and whereas the replacement income provided through ef ranks among the lowest of the deco countries and whereas current ei recipients will run out of benefits before february 2010 when estimates forecast that canadas unemployment rate will have risen to 105 percent and whereas the current ei system is outdated and overly restrictive and excludes many people including many who are lowincome and whereas 70 percent of unemployed young workers aged 20 to 24 do not receive ei benefits and the current youth unemployment rate has risen above 18 percent and whereas review of the ei system is scheduled for summer 2009 therefore be it resolved that the campaign of the canadian labour congress to support new employment insurance system in canada which would make it easier for more joblessunemployed workers to qualify for benefits and collect second tier benefits for longer duration be supported and be it further resolved that the government of canada be called upon to make the following changes to the ei system remove any asset or needs test requirement change regulations to ensure that benefits are not clawed back apply the system equarly to all workers lower the number of qualifying hljurs to 360 per year and increase maximum weekly benefits to cover the gap in earnings increase the number of weeks olf benefits coverage up to minimum of two

n11 200911 n12 motion local 24 whereas the federal government hal publicly affirmed that canadas economy has been in an economic downturn culminated by an international recession and whereas high tuition fees and massive student debt target students from low and middle income families who are already feeling the crunch from the economic downturn and tend to be from racialised and marginalised communities and whereas only 17 per cent of youth from high income families over 80000 have never attended college or university while the same is true for 47 per cent of youth from low income families under 30 oooand whereas domestic and international students are facing skyrocketing debt upwards of an average up to 28 000 that when they graduate with four year undergraduate degree which doesnt include debt from credit cards hne of credit or loans from family members and whereas these massive debt loads prevent students from doing things like buying car taking out mortgage traveling starting up small businesses flexing purchasing power and investing in our economy and whereas as the manufacturing sector has cut devastating amount of jobs and there is dire need to switch to knowledge based economy and retrain the unemployed workforce to either enter into ollege and university for the first time or to upgrade their education and whereas intemational students who often stay to live and work in canada are estimated to contribute hundreds of millions of dollars to the economy through work and taxes but still face double or triple the amount of tuition fees when compared to domestic students whereas the federal government has failed to restore federal transfer to fund post secondary institutions and has not yet established designated transfer of funds for post secondary education but instead continues to make funding cuts to social services such as health care child care and postsecondary education and college and university administrators are likely to use the economic climate as an excuse tofurther increase tuition fees therefore be it resolved that fact sheet be produced about tuition fees student debt and the economy that outlines how spending on postsecondary education can help stimulate the economy and further that it highlight the economic benefits associated with highly educated workforce and refutes the idea that government and administrators should increase tuftion fees in time of economic downturn and be it further resolved that member locals be encouraged to hold public forums or town hairs about tuition fees student debt and the economy to educate our membership and debunk economic myths for the purpose of highlighting the need to increase government funding into postsecondary education and to drop tuition fees for all students motion loca124 whereas the bowed water industry is growing at rate of 18 annually and becoming main beverage product sold on unlverslty and college campuses and whereas bottled water is armost always filtered tap water and thrown away plastic bottles contribute to environmental degradation and whereas several ontario cities and mgions including the waterloo region guelph london

provincial and federal ejection campaigns that rate each political party and in doing so has consistently ranked the ndp as the best political party and whereas this perception of unofficial partisan affiliation may help explain why the cfs has been unable to produce results in its campaigns to lower tuition fees throughout all the many years of its operation for example with tuition fees rising consistently since the cfs has inltiated its drop tuition fees campaign and whereas making public an official plicy of the cfs as being completely nonpartisan will help restore some of the neutrality of the cfs and will therein restore its credibility as lobby group ratherthan as crutch for the ndp and whereas doing so will also make the cfs more representative of the ideological diversity of its
