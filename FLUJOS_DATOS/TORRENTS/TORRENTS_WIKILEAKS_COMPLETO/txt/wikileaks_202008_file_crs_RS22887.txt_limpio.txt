background doping in sport involves the use of substances or methods that artificially enhance athletic performance1 although doping is not new phenomenon policymakers remain concerned about the health effects and ethical implications associated with the continued use of performanceenhancing substances in competitive sports antidoping rules have been in place for various sports and in various countries since at least the 1920s but many claim that the enforcement of antidoping rules is fundamentally limited by lack of uniform standards across sports and across countries2 the international convention against doping in sport adopted in 2005 by unesco is the most recent response to 1 examples of doping substances include certain types of steroids hormones and stimulants examples of doping methods include blood doping gene doping and tampering with tests 2 see casa national commission on sports and substance abuse winning at any cost doping in olympic sports 2000 at

umbrella organization for all participants in the olympic movement and whose authority includes sport doping regulation leads the international campaign against sport doping5 in 1999 the ioc created the world antidoping agency wada as the first independent entity to monitor and enforce international antidoping activities for non professional sports one of wadas first achievements was to develop an international framework for harmonizing antidoping policies rules and regulations among international amateur sport organizations and public authorities called the world anti doping code the code as nongovernmental foundation however wada cannot legally bind governments to its policies including the code in 2003 191 countries including the united states signed the copenhagen declaration on antidoping in sport6 the copenhagen declaration is political statement of intent to identify the code as the foundation in the world wide fight against httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22887 doping in sport ensure that national antidoping policies conform with the code and acknowledge the role of wada in coordinating and standardizing international anti doping efforts according to the code unescos 2005 international convention against doping in sport further institutionalizes antidoping norms among state parties treaty commitments states parties to the convention are required to harmonize national laws regulations policies and administrative practices with the principles of the code7 this includes restricting availability of prohibited substances8 applying wadas standards for granting therapeutic use exemptions funding domestic anti doping test programs supporting the sanctioning of doping violators promoting anti doping research and education and facilitating international

over us constitutional law and selfgovernment crs3 convention states parties are the sole voting members of the conventions conference of parties wada is an advisory organization to the conference of parties us ratification does not require changes to domestic laws nor additional funding contribution levels to wada and domestic antidoping programs10 further the convention does not apply to us professional sport associations and institutions us policy the administration states that ratification of this treaty is priority11 on february 6 2008 the president transmitted the treaty to the senate for its advice and consent to ratification12 upon the presidents transmittal of the convention to the senate for consideration the white house press secretary released statement justifying the need for ratification stating that it would solidify our nations place as leader in the worldwide effort to rid athletics of cheating through chemistry13 many including members of congress argue that international commitments to antidoping can help set positive example for elite and aspiring athletes and help discourage their use of performanceenhancing substances14 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22887 major impetus for us action on ratifying this treaty stems from concern that lack of ratification would result in ban from hosting and participating in some international competitions including future olympic games the ioc requires that governments become party to the international convention against doping in sport by january 1 2009 and failure to do so would result in those countries being barred from participation in future games and could also affect citys bid for hosting the 2016 olympics chicago is the us olympic committees candidate for the 2016 games the ioc plans to announce its selection for the 2016 olympics in october 2009 ratification status on august 4 2008 president bush signed the instrument of ratification for the treaty prior to this date the senate foreign relations

participation in several multilateral antidoping venues as signatory to the 2003 copenhagen declaration on antidoping in sport the us government formally recognized the role and importance of wada in harmonizing international antidoping standards the us government is also member of wadas foundation board and executive committee and congress regularly appropriates funding to support wada in fy2008

the international convention against doping in sport does not apply to us professional sports some athletes of us professional teams however may already follow the code whose guidelines the convention embraces when they participate in international tournaments under the jurisdiction of organizations that already implement the code this has already been the case for example when national basketball association or national hockey league players participate in the olympic games or world championships article 20 of the convention however requires that states parties encourage professional sports associations and institutions to develop antidoping principles consistent with the code effectiveness of antidoping tests many observers argue that the value of international antidoping efforts including the international convention against doping in sport are limited by lack of effective antidoping tests that can positively identify prohibited substances historically the search for better methods to detect doping substances has lagged behind the discovery and use of new undetectable substances22 for example though the use of anabolic steroids was already reportedly widespread by the early 1970s reliable test method for detecting them was not found until 1974 and they were only added to the iocs list of prohibited substances in 197623 more recently antidoping efforts suffered setbacks related to the use of designer or synthetic steroids 21 title ii of division d financial services and general government appropriations act 2008 division d in the consolidated appropriations

concern currently surrounds the possibility of gene doping whereby genetic therapies may be used to enhance athletic performance24 athletes rights protection the international convention against doping in sport requires states parties to adhere to the principles of the code some observers however question whether the code sufficiently protects athletes who may be accidentally implicated in doping violation25 these critics argue that the code imposes excessively stringent punishments including potentially careerending suspensions that offer little distinction between intentional doping and the detection of trace levels of prohibited substances originating from the consumption of contaminated or mislabeled nutritional supplements26 some of these concerns may be addressed in revised version of the code which will go into effect january 1 2009 further some question the legitimacy of wada as an authority in international antidoping policy accusing wada of not being sufficiently transparent in its decision making and resistant to outside scrutiny27 some critics have also questioned wada procedures for handling drug testing samples and avoiding contamination as well as for dealing with false positives and other potential testing mistakes httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22887 cost of enforcing antidoping regulations the international convention against doping in sport commits states parties to funding wada and domestic anti doping tests although ratification of the convention does not impose new costs upon the us government it would commit the united states to continuing such funding in the future some critics argue that the cost of antidoping activities especially legal costs of adjudicating doping cases outweighs the benefits of deterring the use of performance enhancing substances in sport28 usadas legal expenses for example represented more than 15 18 million of its total expenses in 2006 already in 2008 usada has sought more than 1 million in external financial support from wada for its legal case against us cyclist floyd landis who was stripped of the 2006 tour france title for doping violation29 24 see sam mellinger gene doping is next frontier
