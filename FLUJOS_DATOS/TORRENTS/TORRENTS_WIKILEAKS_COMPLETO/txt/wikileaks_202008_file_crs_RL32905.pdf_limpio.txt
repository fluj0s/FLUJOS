competing with the private sector in developing tax return prep aration software by requiring the agency to continue an agreement reached with the free file alliance in 2002 the significant differences between the house and senatep assed versions of hr 3058 meant that conference committee needed to be formed in order to resolve them such committee was formed in late october on november 18 it released conference report hrept 109 307 detailing the terms of the agreement it had reached later the same day the house approved the conference agreement on hr 3058 by vote of 392 to 31 and

and 202 million for administering the health insurance tax credit the act specifies that the irs may not reorganize or reduce its workforce without the consent of the house and senate appropriations committees it also directs the irs not to compete in the market for tax return preparation software and bars the agency from reducing taxpayer service until tigta completes report on the effects of proposed service reductions on taxpayer compliance in ddition under the act the irs is required to develop in consultation with the irs ov ersight board and the national taxpayer advocate fiveyear

nonemergency fy2006 federal discretionary funding that bill also included supplemental appropriation of 119 billion to hud to respond to the consequences of hurricanes katrina rita and wilmarequested it proposed to c ontinue to fund cdbg within hud and would have maintained or increase funding for several programs slated for cuts in the presidents budget the senate passed its ve rsion of hr 3058 the fy2006 hud funding bill on october 20 2005 the bill proposed over 34 billion for hud an increase over the fy2005 budget the presidents request and the houseapproved level like the house bill the sena bill would have continued to f und cdbg within the hud budget and restored funding for numbe r of programs proposed for reductions the final conference agreement on hr 3058 passed congress on november 18 2005 and was signed into law on n ovember 30 2005 pl 109115 for most accounts the conference agreement split the difference between the house and senatepassed funding levels it continues to f und cdbg within hud but reduces its overall funding level it also contains provision re stricting the use of federal economic development funds in projects involving the use of eminent domain18 community and economic devel opment programs consolidation proposal the bush administration budget recommendations for fy2006 included proposal that would have consolidated the activities of at least 18 existing community and economic deve lopment programs into twopart grant proposal called the strengthening americas communities initiative saci as outlined by the administration the proposal would have realigned several but not all federal economic and community development prog rams the most prominent of these programs is the community developm ent block grant program other hud programs that would have been liminated under the administration proposal included empowerment zones brownfield economic development initiatives cdbg section 108 loan guarantees and rural housing and ec onomic development grants if approved by congress the department of comme rce would have been responsible for administering the new pr ogram that would have replaced the 18 existing programs that are currently administered by five federal agencies the administration proposal would have reduced aggregate funding from 56 billion in fy2005 for the programs proposed for consolidation to 37 billion in fy2006 for the new program the administr ation offered general outline of the new programs but it did not submit deta iled realignment propos for congressional consideration it stated that the proposed new program would emphasize flexibility would be results oriented and would be targeted to communities based on need the administration sought this realignment in part because many of the 18 programs recommended for elimination have been judged by the administration to be ineffective unable to demonstr ate results or duplicative of the efforts of other federal programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32905crs24 the agency that would have been mo st affected by the proposal is hud programs administered by hud account for nearly 81 of the 56 billion in fy2005 funding the agencys community development block grant formula grants represent 74 of the total the consolidation proposal was opposed by groups representing state and local officials including the us conference of mayors the national governors associa tion national league of c ities and national association of counties the house and senatep assed budget resolutions for fy2006 both included language that supported the c ontinuation of the cdbg program the house version of hconres 95 included language increasing funding for the community and regional development budg et function by 11 billion to 48 billion the senate version of the budget reso lution would have restored 2 billion that would have been cut under the saci proposal and stipulated that the funds were to be used to support cdbg and the other 17 programs targeted for elimination by the administration the conference agreement on the fy2006 budget resolution hrept 10962 assumed 15 billion more than the president requested for community and economic development purposes and the accompanying joint statement of managers indicated that the increase is intended to maintain economic and community development programs such as cdbg at fy2005 levels on june 21 the house committee on appr opriations complete d consideration of hr 3058 the fy2006 appropriations b ill for hud and several other agencies the measure rejected the administrati ons proposed strengthening americas communities initiative and recommended 415 billion for the cdbg program and economic development initiative edi grants this included 386 billion for cdbg formula grants awarded to entitlement communities and states which was 250 less than appropriated in fy2005 the committee also included 290 million for edi grants for congressional earmarked projects the committee bill did not provide funding for number of cdbg tasides and relate d programs including youthbuild empowerment zones brownfie lds and section 108 loan guarantees in addition the committee b ill recommended transferring funding for several cdbg related setasides to othe r accounts within hud the bill included new selfhelp and assisted homeownership account that would have provided 23 million for the selfhelp homeownership program shop 28 million for the national community development initiative 3 million for the housing assistance council and 1 million each for the special olympics and the native american indian housing council indian cdbg would ve been funded as setaside of 45 million within the native american hous ing block grants account the committee also recommended transferring to hud s office of policy development and research 29 million in funding for university programs previously included as cdbg setasides under section 107 including assistance to historic black colleges and universities institutions serving hispanic populations and community development work study program the house approved the committees recommendations and also approved two amendments increasing fy2006 funding for the community development fund account cdf the house approved by voice vote an amendment offered by representative gary miller adding 24 million to the cdf for huds brownfield program it also approved by voice vote an amendment introduced by representative knollenberg that provided an additiona l 675 llion to the cdf floor debate indicated that up to 50 million of the increas was to be used to fund the youthbuildhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32905crs25 program assuming it was not funded within the department of labors budget the remaining 175 million was designated for cdbg formulabased grants this increase would have resulted in cdbg fo rmulabased funding at more than 230 million below the fy2005 level during floor consideration of the bill the chairman of the hud appropriations subcommittee re presentative knollenberg stated that it was his intention to find way to restore the cdbg formulabased program to its fy2005 funding level the senate version of the bill w ould have appropria ted 43 billion for community development fund cdf activitie s which would be decrease of 528 million from fy2005 the bill included 377 billion for cdbg formula grants which was 100 million decrease from the house and 350 million decrease from fy2005 it also included 5562 million for cd bgrelated set asides and earmarks unlike the house bill which would have provided funding reduced funding or would have transferred th activity to another account within hud the senate bill recommended retaining funding for most of the cdbgrelated setasides within the cdf account for instance the senate bill included 69 million for the native american cdbg while the house versi on would have appr opriated 45 million for the program within the native american housing block grant the senate bill would have appropriate d 324 million in funding for college and university programs and retained the programs under the cdf account while the house bill would have transferred thes activities to the research and development account it would have appropriate d 40 million for the neighborhood initiative program program that was not included in the presid ents request or the house version of the bill and it would have ppropriated 30 million for capacity building grants under the national community development initiative program which is 2 million less than the amount recommended by the house within new self help and assisted homeownership account during the senate appropriations committee consideration of hr 3058 senator bond introduced and then withdrew proposed amendment that would have prohibited the use of federal funds in ec onomic development projects involving the use of eminent domain the amendment woul d have allowed the use of federal funds if the project involved airports seaports mass transit or was intended to revitalize blighted area the conference version of hr 3058 which was approved by the house on november 18 and the senate on nove mber 21 2005 appropriates 4220 billion for community development fund activities including 3748 billi on for the cdbg formula grant program this is slig htly less than the 3770 billion recommended by the senate and the 386 billion recommende d by the house the act includes 471 million for select number of cdf set asides and earmarks with the majority of such funds 310 million allocated among 1126 edi earmarked projects of the remaining funds 50 million is earmarked for 50 neighborhood initiative projects identified in the conference report 16 million for the working capital fund and 50 million is to be awarded to cal youthbuild organizations the 310 million in edi earmarks represent 7 increase in funding for such projects over the amount appropriated in fy2005 290 million while the 3748httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32905crs26 billion in cdbg formula grants is 9 less than appropriated for such grants in fy2005 the administration some memb ers of congress and organizations representing states and local governments have voiced concern about the use growth rate and noncompetitive nature of earmarks they argu that the steady increase in earmark projects siphons funds from the need based formula portion of the program the conference version of the act consistent with the recommendations included in the house shifts funding fo r number of programs previously funded under this account to other hud accounts funding for the shop program 20 million national community developmen t initiative 30 million the housing assistance council 3

funding of the section 108 loan guarantee program by ppropriating 6 million in loan subsidies in support of loan commitment ceiling of 275 million the administration included the section 108 program in the list of programs whose ac tivities were to be consolidated under its strengthening amer icas communities initiative the house version of hr 3058 did not include fundi ng for the program the conference version of the act includes 3 million in loan subsidies in support of loan commitment ceiling of 137 million section 726 of the gene ral provisions of t itle vii of the tthud appropriations act for fy2006 includes the nguage prohibiting federal state and local governments from using funds appropr iated under the act for projects involving the use of eminent domain unless such pr ojects or activities involve public purpose the provision excludes economic developmen t that primarily benefits private entities as an eligible public purpose except in cases involving the removal of

presidents fy2006 request for the section 8 tenantbased rental assistance program also called the section 8 vouc her program represented 7 increase in funding over fy2005 these additional funds were to be used to renew existing subsidies rather than create new subsidies the presiden ts budget proposed to continue and expand the practice of funding public housing aut horities phas on the basis of fixed costs rather than on actual costs as was the pr actice prior to fy2004 and on the basis ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32905crs27 fixed utilization rates rather than on all available vouchers as was the practice prior to fy2005 this budgetbased funding structure has been controversial among some phas who argue it does not provide them with sufficient funding to meet their local needs beyond funding levels the budget request so stated that the president intended to introduce new proposal to reform th tenantbased voucher program one purpose for this reform proposal was to cont ain if not reduce costs according to the presidents budget summary section 8 s program costs are cannibalizing every hud program at the same time waiting lis ts of families seeking housing continue to grow the fy2006 hud congressional budget justifications stated that the new proposal would provide additional flexibility to phas which would enable them to run their programs more effectively and efficiently the administrations reform proposal was introduced in the senate s 771 on april 13 and in the house hr 1999 on april 28 2005 although furthe r action has been taken reform proposals were also sub mitted as part of the fy 2004 and fy2005 budgets congressional action was ta ken on either proposal the house appropriations committee recommended 155 billion for tenant based rental assistance which is 765 million more than was provided in fy2005 but 314 million less than the president requested under the house bill funding would have been allocated to agencies based on the amount they received in the previous year plus inflation the 155 billion included setaside of funds that the secretary could have used to adjust the budgets of agencies that were negatively impacted by the fy2005 formula due to anomalous circum stances such as an increase in voucher holders moving to more expensive ar eas on june 30 2005 during house floor consideration of the bill an amendment offered by representative nadler added an additional 100 million to the tenantbased rental assistance acc ount increasing the appropriation to 156 billion the amendmen t offset the increase by decreasing funding for the working capital fund by 120 million the senatepassed bill would also ve funded the voucher program at 156 billion in fy 2006 it pr oposed to allocate renewal funds based on agencies most recent 12 months of cost and utilization data an allocation method advocated by phas and lowincome housing groups it also proposed to set aside funds to be provided to agencies that were negatively impacted by the fy2005 distribution formula the conference version of hr 3058 f unded renewals at the presidents requested level it adopted the presiden ts requested and hous approved allocation method and set aside 45 million for the secret ary to use to adjust agency budgets for additional informa tion see crs report rl31930 section 8 housing choice voucher program funding and related

before the house appropriations subcommittee on transporta tion the treasury hud the judiciary and the district of columbia the secret ary of hud referred to the need to make unpopular cuts in programs such as sec tion 811 in order to maintain adequate funding for section 8 and programs for the homeless the housepassed version of the fy2006 hud funding bill maintained section 811 funding at the fy2005 level of 238 milli on while the senate version increased funding to 240 million both bills permitted funds to be used for capital subsidies the enacted appropriation for fy2006 provides 239 million for section 811 an increase of approximately 1 million over fy2005 and twice as much as the presidents request like the house and senate versions the conference version includes funds for capital grants hope vi for third year the presidents budget requested new funding for the hope vi revitalization of distre ssed public housing program hope vi provides grants to local public housing

when over 570 million was provided to the program in addition to requesting new funding for the program in fy2006 the presidents budget requested that congress rescind the funds it provided to the

consideration of the bill an amendment was adopted that provided 60 million for hope vi offset by reduction of 60 million for the general services administrations federa l buildings fund the senate

tions cacr that are administered by the treasury departments ofac restri ctions on travel have been key and often contentious component of us efforts to isolate the cuban government th regulations have not banned travel itself but have placed restric tions on any financial transactions related to travel to cuba in 2004 the bush administration significantly tightened restrictions on travel and there was considerable reaction to the administrations tightening of restrictions for family visits and educational travel under us sanctions commercial agri cultural exports to cuba have been allowed since 2001 under the terms of th trade sanctions reform and export enhancement act of 2000 or tsra but with numerous restrictions and licensing requirements exporters are denied access to us private commercial financing or credit and all transactions must be conducted in cash in advance or with financing from third countries earlier this year the administration tightened us economic sanctions against cuba by further restricting how us agri cultural exporters may be paid for their sales on february 22 2005 ofac ame nded the cacr to clarify that the term payment of cash in advance for us agricultural sales to cuba means that the payment is to be received prior to the ship ment of the goods this differs from the practice of being paid before the actual livery of the goods practice that had been utilized by most us agricultural exporters to cuba since such sales were legalized in late 2001 us agricultural exporters and some members of congress strongly objected that the action constituted new sanction that violated the intent of tsra and could jeopardize millions of dollars in us agricultural sales to cuba ofac director robert werner maintains that the clarification conforms to the common understanding of the term in international trade42 on july 29 2005 ofac clarified that for payment of cash in advance for the commercial sale of us agricultural exports to cuba vessels can leave us ports as soon as foreign bank confirms receipt of payment from cuba ofacs action would reportedly ensure that the goods would not be vulnerable to seizure fo r unrelated claims while still at the us port supporters of overturning ofacs february 22 2005 amendment such as the american farm bureau federation were pl eased by the clarif ication but indicated that they would still work to overturn the february rule43 since late 2001 cuba has purchased over 1 billion in agricultural products from the united states overall us ex ports to cuba amounted to about 7 million in 2001 146 million in 2002 259 million in 2003 400 million in 2004 and 245 million in the first eight months of 2005 the majority in agricultural products us exports to cuba for january to august 2005
