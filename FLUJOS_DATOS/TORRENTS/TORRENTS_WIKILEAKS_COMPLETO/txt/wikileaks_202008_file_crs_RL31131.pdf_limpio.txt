next farm bill summary conservation is expected to be major component of the next generation of farm policy which the 107th congress is formulating according to leaders of the agriculture committees in both chambers and many others involved in agricultural policy the house agriculture committee reported its version of new omnibus farm bill hr 2646 on august 2 2001 and it includes numerous conservation proposals the senate agriculture committee is working to develop bill in which conservation will play prominent role according to chairman harkin major questions being debated about conservation revolve around 1 at what level should overall funding be set 2 how should funding be distributed among existing and proposed new programs and activities 3 should existing programs be amended and if so how 4 what if any new programs are needed 5 how should funding be divided between programs for land retirement and for working lands and 6 should congress provide new or additional direction to the implementing agencies answers to these questions have been offered in extensive testimony at hearings and are reflected in the policy options that congress is considering this report compares by program conservation proposals in four bills with current law the presentation for each existing program includes brief program description an overview of accomplishments summary of some of the issues that have been identified and table or narrative comparing current law with proposals in each bill while these bills do not represent all of the bills with conservation provision s that have been introduced they reflect most of the range of policy approaches currently being considered the four bills are hr 2646 the farm bill reported by the house agriculture committee house report

httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl311311 descriptions of each program mentioned in this introductory section that is being actively implemented appear later in the reportselected conservation proposals for the next farm bill introduction leaders on both agriculture committees have stated that conservation will be an important part of the next farm bill house agriculture committee leaders have been pressing to move the farm bill through the legislative process rapidly because of concerns that lower projections of the budget surplus might affect future allocations to agriculture the house agriculture committee reported its version of the farm bill hr 2646 h rept 107191 pt 1 and pt 2 on august 2 2001 the committee drew on conservation testimony offered by many witnesses at numerous hearings the process for gathering input has been much the same in the senate but the committee has not yet completed farm bill proposal progress in the senate may have been slowed by changes in party control although conservation was focus of hearings both before and after the democratic party takeover agricultural conservation has played an increasingly important role in farm policy during the past two decades this importance can be measured in many ways the growing proliferation of conservation programs and overall federal funding for conservation the willingness to use mandatory funding which bypasses the annual appropriations process for most conservation spending and the expansion of the conservation mission from programs that largely focus on managing natural resources to enhance farm production to programs that deal with offfarm impacts of farming practices and environmental topics that are new to agricultural policy this changing role can be seen by comparing conservation elements of the most recent three farm bills enacted in 1985 1990 and 1996 prior to the 1985 farm bill almost all conserv ation programs supported either the goal of reducing soil erosion or the goal of providing water at rate and pattern that would enhance crop production these programs were designed to improve conditions on the farm and most did not address effects of agricultural practices on resources or the environment beyond the farm fence line the 1985 farm bill pl 99198 expanded conservation efforts by enacting the conservation reserve program crp and the three compliance programs conservation compliance sodbuster and swampbuster1 except for swampbuster these programs were all concerned with reducing soil erosion although the crp included language that gave the department of agriculture usda the option of enrolling lands that provided offfarm environmental benefits an option that initially it choose to neglect the 1990 farm bill pl 101624 added little to erosion control efforts by 1990 however the department had expanded the crp to include other conservation objectives in addition to reducing soil erosion and was starting to use an environmental benefits index ebi to compare bids by assigning values to each of these objectives the 1990 farm billhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31131crs2 endorsed the ebi and made other changes to the crp it also created new programs including the wetlands reserve program wrp the water quality incentives program cost sharing program the environmental easement program and new pesticides record keeping program it also called on usda to create new office on environmental quality and amended the 1981 farmland protection program as well as water quality research and education programs the overall conservation theme in this law was water but it also greatly expanded the conservation mission and authorized the use of easements the 1996 farm bill pl 104127 again expanded the conservation mission adding numerous programs these included the environmental quality incentives program eqip the farmland protection program fpp and the wildlife habitat incentives program whip in addition the compliance programs were made more producerfriendly and perhaps of greatest interest to the agriculture community the crp was reauthorized other provisions dealt with assigning responsibilities for air quality concerns in usda to the natural resources conservation service nrcs and providing new option combining conservation and commodity payments the overall conservation theme was wildlife and habitat protection but the most significant change may have been to make majority of the conservation funding mandatory using the commodity credit corporation ccc which excludes it from the annual appropriations process previously funding for all conservation programs had been discretionary and required an annual appropriation thus far the current farm bill debate has differed from the past three in at least two major ways first the debate over this bill has been more about how much money will be allocated to agriculture and how much of that allocation will be assigned to conservation in earlier farm bills funding was an important constraint because of federal budget deficits but it is now larger driving force both because the fy2002 budget agreement allocated the surplus projected at that time and gave significant portion to agriculture over the next decade and because that surplus is now forecast to decline for the next few years second while the earlier farm bill debates centered on what new programs and policies are needed for conservation this debate thus far has given more attention to how to make existing programs more effective either by providing more funding or by amending them the house agriculture committee emphasized this difference from earlier farm bill conservation titles in summary of its actions on conservation overview of the conservation effort usda provides conservation assistance through many agencies but primarily through the natural resources conservation service nrcs and the farm service agency fsa the programs are almost all voluntary and participation is attracted by providing incentives in the forms of financial assistance and technical assistance and supported by education and basic and applied research in recent years funding for all of these programs has averaged more than 3 billion per year the overall conservation effort encompasses about 30 programs and activitie s according to usdas budget summary but the total number depends on how one counts them and which ones are included if one views this overall effort as piece of fabric with each of the woven threads representing program or activity then the fabric includes other threads as well they consist of httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31131crs3 very small programs as measured by funding the nrcs snow survey and plant material centers are examples scientific or technical support programs the soil survey and the natural resources inventory are examples programs that are not being implemented the conservation farm option the natural resources conservation foundation and the flood risk reduction program all enacted in the 1996 farm bill are examples programs that are implemented only under unpredictab circumstances the emerge ncy conservation program and the emergency watershed program are examples activities that support many other programs conservation technical assistance and the state technical committees are examples and programs that are agency or department initiatives rather than legislated mandates the national conservation buffer initiative and the unified national strategy for animal feeding operations are examples this report discusses only those programs that are being addressed in one or more of the four farm bill proposals being compared if none of these bills would amend program it is not included if only one bill would amend program it is presented in narrative and if more than one bill would amend it the proposals are presented in table however some of these other threads are very important to the overall conservation effort crosscutting issues certain topics are being raised in discussions of agricultural conservation activities that transcend individual conservation programs some of these topics have been raised recently while others have been discussed for many years some of these topics are being raised by those who believe that lack of attention to them is increasingly constraining the conservation effort the topics are discussed below rather than being repeated for each program they include compatibility with international trade obligations funding for conservation demand for conservation programs and services complexit ies in program administration effects of the expanding conservation mission agency staffing and green payments as an alternative approach international trade obligations the multilateral uruguay round agreement on agriculture uraa poses constraint on us farm assistance by limiting to more than 191 billion per year the cost of domestic farm supports most likely to distort production and trade other countries have their own different limits the uraa spells out rules for determining whether policy is marketdistorting and thus must be counted toward the 191 billion limit or whether it can be considered exempt from the annual spending calculation the united states and other countries use these guidelines to make the cost calculations which in turn are reported on an annual basis to the world trade organization wto conservation and environmental programs are viewed as less likely to distort production and trade than some other types of governme nt support for production agriculture thus they may not have to be counted toward the 191 billion limit some environmental organizat ions have seized upon this argument to build support for moving money fromhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31131crs4 2 uraa annex 2 domestic support the basis for exemption from the reduction commitments for more information see crs report rl30612 farm support programs and world trade commitments 3 the budget data is taken from tables prepared by usdas office of budget and program analysis which places all conservation programs and activities in five categories 1 technical assistance education and administration 2 costsharing 3 public works programs 4 rental and easement payments and 5 data and researchcommodity price support into conservation and environmental activities however the uraa does contain stipulations that must be met in order for conservation or environmental program to be exempt one stipulation is that payments under environmental programs must be based on eligibility determined as part of clearlydefined government or conservation program and dependent on the fulfillment of specific conditions under the government program including conditions related to production methods or inputs also the amount of the payment shall be limited to the extra costs or loss of income involved in complying with the government program most of the conservation programs including the eqip wrp fpp and conservation technical assistance programs have been reported as exempt by the administration under this stipulation the second stipulation is that structural adjustment assistance provided through resource retirement programs could be exempted so long as payment eligibility is determined by reference to clearly defined criteriadesigned to remove land or other resources including livestock from marketable agricultural production b payments on retired land are for minimum of 3 years livestock must be permanently disposed of c payments cannot require or specify any alternative use for such land or other resources which involves the production of marketable agricultural products and d payments cannot be related to either the type or quantity of production or to prices applying to production undertaken using the land or other resources remaining in production2 the crp has been reported as exempt by the administration under this stipulation funding for conservation total federal funding for conservation has almost tripled over the past 15 years according to data compiled by usda funding for all conservation activities in five spending categories totaled just over 1 billion in fy1985 and had grown to as much as 36 billion in fy19983 almost all that growth has been in rental and easement programs one of five categories which had its funding increased from 8 million to more than 18 billion over this time period actual funding for three of the other four categories technical assistance cost sharing and data and research grew by 50 to almost 100 over this time period while funding for public works programs has risen and fallen from year to year but shown little discernable growth these funding trends have caused recurring shortfall in the resources needed to operate the suite of conservation programs according to nrcs representatives for example funding for technical assistance needed to support the rental and easement programs has required supplemental appropriations in recent years and lack of funding in 1998 caused nrcs to temporarily suspend support for crp signupshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31131crs5 demand for conservation programs and services demand for most conservation programs has greatly exceeded available funds in recent years in response to an inquiry from senator harkin at conservation hearing earlier this year nrcs supplied data from recent years for several conservation programs that showed the extent of this disparity for example these data show that the eqip program spent 597 million to implement almost 277000 applications between fy1997 and fy2000 leaving unserved almost 197000 applications that would have cost 1378 billion the data do not indicate how many of the unserved applications might have been rejected changes in emphasis or activities most likely would not fully address this problem if nrcs were asked to commit more resources to one program it would likely mean less could be accomplished in other programs nrcs has developed workload analysis system in recent years to track how staff distribute their time among the activities of the agency this system has been used to forecast how long it might take to meet anticipated demands in the future given current work demands such as providing the technical assistance that producers are likely to need to meet new water quality requirements on farms with larger animal populations complexities in program administration some landowners have complained that complicated enrollment procedures and inconsistent or difficult administrative procedures have dampened their interest in participating in conservation programs there are differing opinions as to whether these complications are excessive whether the problems are overstated and whether the current procedures actually drive away potential participants however there has been comprehensive examination of these complaints and thus it is impossible to determine whether they add up to significant problems or represent isolated incidents in programs that have thousands of participants suggested solutions usually center on combining or coordinating program delivery and usda has made some administrative adjustments expanding conservation mission the conservation mission has grown great deal since 1985 and it now consists of many more subjects which are addressed through new mostly small programs it has expanded from focus on managing lands that are producing food and fiber to include land retirement and from focus on onfarm challenges to include environmental concerns that arise beyond the fence line because of farming activities expansion of the mission since 1985 has required usda agencies especially nrcs to add significant capability in wetland science water quality biology archeology and animal agriculture among other topics it has also meant that many additional producers participate in these programs especially the compliance programs enacted in 1985 placing further demands on usda agencies the laws creating these programs require little coordination most of the programs are implemented at the scale of individual property owners and the sheer number of programs may contribute to the frustrations noted above staff at the field level are now dealing with far more landowners this it is contended has lessened their ability to work oneonone with each interested person which had been hallmark of the conservation effort httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31131crs6 4 for an overview of the concept of green payments and how it fits within the array of current conservation programs see recent economic reserve service report agri environmental policy at the crossroads guideposts on changing landscape agricultural economic report 794 january 2001agency staffing while the mission of conservation has expanded rapidly the human resources at usda especially the nrcs have not expanded rather at nrcs the total agency capacity has shrunk from more than 13600 staff years in fy1985 to less than 11500 in fy2000 moreover many of the specialists who have been hired to provide the new expertises that the expanded mission requires have not followed the traditional career path in nrcs which starts in district office working directly with individual landowners employees who lack that experience are less knowledgeable about how conservation is provided to landowners another important effect of limited staffing in nrcs and other agencies administering conservation programs is that they have been able to devote few resources to evaluating program accomplishments in recent years thus limiting the amount of information about the accomplishments and limitations of these programs these constraints have been partially offset by two other trends first states and localities are committing additional resources for conservation funding from these sources for conservation districts has grown from about 275 million in fy1986 to more than 1 billion in fy2000 according to nrcs second the expanded use of computers has been credited with contributing to increased efficiencies for many activities during the past few years green payments the concept of green payments paying producers to perform environmental services or provide environmental benefits from their production activities is receiving wide spread attention as major new direction for conservation in this farm bill4 some existing programs such as the environmental quality incentive program eqip and conservation reserve program crp meet this general definition but supporters of the green payment concept describe at least two major differences from any current programs one difference is that with the exception eqip all existing green payment programs pay producers to perform these services by retiring land from productio n proponents of green payments are seeking program that pays producers to provide services on land that remains in production second with the exception of crp all these programs have limited funding proponents of green payments are seeking program with much larger total funding that can be used by many producers one bill that would meet these two qualifications is s 932hr 1949 the conservation security act csa which was developed and sponsored by chairman harkin it is discussed here since the bill would not amend any existing conservation programs senator harkin has stated that he hopes to make this proposal key element in the senate version of farm bill conservation title the csa was developed over more than 2 years and working with an extremely wide range of interests it would establish 3 tiers of conservation practices and provide mandatory payments through the ccc for each tier all farmers would be eligible to participate if they submit plan that is approved and enter into contract for all land that is part of the agricultural operation ineligible lands would include full fields enrolled in the crp land enrolled in the wrp and land brought into production after thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31131crs7 5 the crp is placed in subchapter b of chapter 1 environmental conservation acreage reserve program and is in 12311236 of the 1985 farm bill 16 usc 38313836 6 enrolled lands are concentrated in the high plains states with the most enrolled land at the start of fy2001 included texas 41 million acres an area little smaller than new jersey montana 35 million acres and north dakota 33 million acres kansas and colorado both have more than 2 million acres enrolleddate of enactment contracts would be renewable and could be adjusted for inflation the program would provide payments technical assistance education and outreach to participants it would also include evaluation and monitoring components the legislation does not set any limit on the total to be spent either annually or over the life of the program this legislation would be placed in current farm legislation in way that would allow program efforts to be concentrated in priority areas set by the secretary the tiers and payment levels are described below tier 1 practices would include numerous listed management activities such as nutrient or water quality management that would be specified in 5 year contract and apply to either part of or the entire agricultural operation participants would receive an advance payment of the greater of 1000 or 20 of the contract value and annual payments of up to 20000 for the life of the contract tier 2 practices would include all tier 1 practices plus one or more of the following resource conserving crop rotations controlled rotational grazing land conversion partial field conservation practices prairie habitat or wetland protection and restoration and agroforestry practices practices would be specified in contract of 5 to 10 years that would address priority resource concerns on the total agricultural operation participants would receive an advance payment of the greater of 2000 or 20 of the contract value and annual payments of up to 35000 for the life of the contract tier 3 practices would include all tiers 1 and 2 practices and any others needed to address all the resource concerns on the entire agricultural operation that are needed to address the long term sustainability of the resource base practices would be specified in contract of 5 to 10 years that address priority resource concerns on the total agricultural operation participants would receive an advance payment of the greater of 3000 or 20 of the contract value and annual payments of up to 50000 for the life of the contract conservation programs conservation reserve program crp program description the crp was enacted in the 1985 farm bill and most recently amended in the 1996 farm bill5 it is administered by the fsa and funded as mandatory program through the commodity credit corporation ccc the current program goal is to retire up to 364 million acres of environmentally sensitive and highly erodible crop land and some marginal pasture lands under multi year contracts at the start of fy2001 fsa reported that 314 million acres were enrolled6 almost all of the contracts are for 10 years enrollment is limited to 25 of the crop land in county ceiling that has been reached by about 135 counties concentrated in states with the most overall enrollmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31131crs8 7 there was open enrollment in fy2001 and the department allowed expiring crp contracts to be extended for one year fsa may have adopted this approach both because very few contracts end in fy2001 and because the department plans to enroll much of the acreage that remains under that ceiling using other mechanisms crp is the most expensive conservation program having totaled about half of all spending on conservation in recent years in addition to the conservation benefits other benefits that have been attributed to it include helping to stabilize land prices enhancing farmer income and reducing excess production crp enrolls lands through several mechanisms large majority of the total entered the program through open enrollment which has usually been offered once year during specified time periods using nationwide competitive bidding process7 for open enrollment the fsa compares all the bids using an environmental benefits index ebi which awards points under seven factors for each bid the ebi awards points for wildlife up to 100 points water quality up to 100 erosion control up to 100 enduring benefits beyond the life of the contract up to 50 air quality up to 35 points located in priority areas up to 25 and cost points determined at each signup fsa has adjusted the index from signup to signup enrolled land is usually an entire field or larger much of the land that is enrolled is under second contract since most of the initial contracts were signed in the late 1980s and ended in the late 1990s landowners who wish to reenroll their land get priority over other bidders although they do get some points in the ebi if they need financial assistance to establish the required conservation plantings if they were in the program these plantings should already be in place farmers can enter the program through three alternatives to open enrollment first fsa took administrative action in 1997 to allow enrollment at any time called continuous enrollment for smaller parcels of lands within fields that provide especially high environmental benefits such as riparian buffers narrow strips of vegetated land adjacent to water bodies grassed waterways or shelter belts incentive payments were added in april 2000 to attract participation second fsa implemented the conservation reserve enhancement program crep in 1997 to allow states to contribute at least 20 of the cost to enroll up to 100000 acres in areas that states designate as especial ly high priorities usda has approve d 16 state creps and several other proposals are pending third provisions in the fy2001 agriculture appropriations legislation pl 106387 require the department to implement program to enroll 500000 acres of wetlands and buffers in 6 upper midwestern states the department announced in 1997 that it was holding back 4 million acres to enroll under these options making the effective ceiling under open enrollment 324 million acres almost 16 million acres have been enrolled under these three alternatives through july 2001 including almost 190000 acres in the 16 approved creps the conservation practice installed under these alternatives that has received the most attention is buffer strips since nrcs started buffer initiative in 1997 to enroll 2 million miles of riparian buffers and filter strips by 2002 it estimates that more than 600000 miles have been enrolled enrollment under the farmable wetlands pilot program just started and results are available httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31131crs9 8 the one exception where good data are available is reduction in soil erosion rates nrcs collects these data in its natural resource inventory and it shows that overall soil erosion has dropped from 32 billion tons per year before crp and the compliance programs were enacted to 22 billion tons per year in 1997 program accomplishments the most recent open enrollment completed in february 2000 accepted 25 million acres of the 35 million acres that were offered program benefits measured in either the type of land being enrolled or the practices to be installed are documented by fsa at the time of enrollment these data also measure what the additions and expiring contracts mean for cumulative conservation benefits for example fsa identified the following benefits from the february 2000 enrollment almost 13 million acres of highly erodible land almost 275000 acres to be planted to trees over 150000 acres of wetlands and protective upland areas and almost 123000 acres to be restored to rare and declining habitat the minimum acceptable ebi for this enrollment was 246 which was nearly identical to the previous two open signups if the cost factor is subtracted from the ebi the total value of the other 6 factors has continued to rise with each enrollmen t indicating that the programs environmental benefits are growing the benefits of enrolling land under the three alternative methods which do not use the ebi has not been documented by fsa also fsa does not monitor what the program actually accomplishes while the land is enrolled so there are little hard data beyond the general conclusion that resource conditions have benefitted from this program and these benefits can be significant8 also there is little information on what happens to land or resources after the contract ends the results are probably mixed as some land is returned to production some land is reenrolled and some land lies idle issues issues have been raised about adjusting the overall objectives of the program the adequacy of the current level of erosion control retaining longterm benefits from the program the net amount of crop land that is in production the cost of the program the enrollment ceiling and options to open enrollment overall objectives the crp measures multiple environmental objectives for each bid using the ebi whether these are appropriate objectives and how to weigh each of them generates debate there are questions about whether the correct land is being enrolled and about the geographic distribution of the enrolled land any change in the ebi would lead to different mix of land being enrolled questions include should any of the current 7 ebi factors be dropped or others added should the weighting of any of these factors be changed and should more land under the ceiling be set aside to be enrolled under the alternative methods such as creps erosion control welldocumented benefit of the crp has been erosion reduction as noted above erosion rates have dropped by 1 billion tons per year since the crp and conservation compliance programs were implemented however the erosion rate has leveled off at 22 billion tons for the past several years and over the long term this rate still exceeds the rate at which soil productivity can be maintained in some areas it is unclear whether this lower rate is sufficient reduction to maintain longterm production capability questions include what is desirable goal for national level if the current level is abovehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31131crs10 that what policy changes are needed to further lower the overall rate and what role should the crp play in these policies and at what scale field farm county state or national should additional erosion reduction needs be addressed longterm benefits environmental values are protected while land is enrolled in the crp however the enduring nature of this protection has been questioned by the general accounting office gao and others since landowners are under obligation to protect these values after the payments stop except that conservation compliance requires that highly erodible lands returned to production must follow an approved conservation plan within 2 years of leaving the crp under current policies the only way to ensure that these benefits will be retained is to reenroll the land the year that the contract expires questions include what portion of the land that was in the crp is being returned to production what environmental and other benefits are being lost on land that is returned to production should other mechanisms to protect some of these benefits be considered and under what circumstances and can longterm or permanent easements play role in protecting them actual acreage reduct ion there are reports that crp is not completely successful at reducing crop acreage and therefore production some enrolled acres have been replaced by other land that is brought into producti on this slippage while widely reported has never been documented questions include exactly how widespread is slippage does it occur more in some regions or for some crops than others and are there either more severe environmental problems or different mix of problems from the new crop lands than from lands enrolled in the crp cost the crp is the most expensive conservation program the farm community supports it in part because of the amount of money it transfers to farmers for providing environmental benefits questions include is the crp sustainable indefinitely at the enrollment size and annual costs of today are there less expensive alternatives to multiyear rental agreements that could provide similar or more enduring environmental benefits and are there ways to retain the benefits created after contracts expire total enrollment levels the current enrollment ceiling of 364 million acres was the peak actual enrollment in 1993 it was not selected based on an assessment of demand or need many witnesses at farm bill hearings called for expanding the scope of the program citing that demand has exceeded available space in recent general enrollments that chronic low commodity prices could be addressed at the margin by taking more land out of production that crp could help additional landowners address environmental problems that the program could provide additional benefits and that it could address emerging environmental challenges questions include what would be the cost of increasing the size of the program how might enrollment patterns change with larger program and how might altered patterns affect commodity production how might these changes affect environmental benefits and could the program be enlarged by moving one or more of the alternative enrollment options outside the overall enrollment ceiling options to open enrollment many of the same issues apply to the three alternative enrollment options participation rates have been uneven suggesting that these options are being more aggressively marketed in some states overall less land has been enrolled than supporters had hoped for also the involvement of states in the crep raises additional questions about coordination questions include has the department offered enough incentives to attract desired enrollment levels can some states have multiple crepshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31131crs11 before all states that want them have one crep should states be allowed to enroll more then 100000 acres in crep under some circumstances is the current state requirement for creps appropriate and for the continuous enrollment does the location of participation land matter httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31131crs12 table 1 comparison of proposed crp

resources on nonfederal lands conservation compliance program description the three compliance programs conservation compliance sodbuster and swampbuster were enacted in the 1985 farm bill and are administered by nrcs9 these three programs remove producer access to certain federal farm program benefits to producers who respectively 1 farm highly erodible lands without following conservati on plan 2 bring highly erodible land into production without following conservation plan and 3 alter wetlands to produce crops under the 1985 law producers risked losing eligibility to most major farm programs on all they land they cultivated including price and income support and related programs farm storage facility loans crop insurance disaster payments storage payments and any farm loan that would contribute to erosion on highly erodible land amendments in 1990 and 1996 relaxed the reach and impact of the compliance programs in many ways including allowing graduated penalties and good faith exemptions deleting crop insurance from the benefits lost and allowing self certification when first enacted the compliance requirements generated widespread anxiety in the farm community both because these programs were new approach to meeting conservation goals and because one knew how aggressively they might be implemented perhaps the two largest implementation issues were the need to make wetland determinations at approximately 4 million sites and the need to develop compliance plans for about 140 million acres classified as highly erodible by 1990 both issues created large increase in workload for nrcs staff but today many of the past fears and problems seem to have dissipated very few compliance and swampbuster violations result in loss of benefits supporters of traditional agriculture say this reflects nearly universal compliance in the farm community while critics primarily from the environmental community wonder whether lax or limited enforcement is responsible for the high success rate program accomplishments program accomplishments have been measured in terms of reduction in soil erosion and identification of wetland acres soil erosion had declined because of compliance from almost 17 tons per acre per year to less than 6 tons on sampled tracts in the mid 1990s wetlands have benefitted from delineation and from the disincentives the national resources inventory shows that the rate of wetlands conversions on agricultural lands has declined significantly but this data set does not document the number of acres that might have been brought into production but was not because of this disincentive10 wetland protection interests seem more focused on possible changes to the wetland reserve program discussed below in this farm bill debate issues the reach of the compliance programs remains the main issue producers and farm groups continue to worry about the potential for these programs to have greater effect on producers that would alter some product ion practices and result in either higher production costs or less revenue while some environmental interests would like to see that reach extended especially for wetlands

funds are to provide the greatest possible environmental benefits for the funds spent eqip replaced four programs agricultural conservation program great plains conservat ion program water qualityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31131crs16 incentives program and the colorado river basin salinity control program that were repealed in the same bill eqip made several significant changes in conservation policy it is the first conservation program to concentrate funds in priority areas in each state where potential environmental benefits would be greatest nrcs policy has been that 65 of the funds be spent in priority areas priority areas are identified in each state by the nrcs state conservationist working with the state technical committee then approved at headquarters second policy change is eqip is the first conservation program with funding directed specifically to livestock related issues half the funds are to be used to address these issues third it is the first conservation program to limit participation by any measure of farm size livestock producers cannot access eqip funds to pay for constructing waste management facilities if they have more than 1000 animal units in recent years congress has limited eqip spending to 174 million however 105 of the omnibus appropriations for fy2001 pl 106554 provided an additional 26 million raising the total to 200 million even full funding for this program would not come close to meeting demand levels in fy1999 for example nrcs received almost 52000 applications totaling 386 million but only was able to fund almost 19000 of those applicati ons in response to this demand the clinton administration had sought higher funding levels but never submitted legislation needed to raise the authorized ceiling program accomplishments eqip funds are distributed primarily as costsharing payments to producers in fy1999 for example of the 174 million distributed 137 million was spent for cost sharing 33 million was spent for technical assistance and 4 million was spent for educational assistance program accomplishments vary widely by state depending on the physical conditions and needs in priority areas the economic research service recently looked at how eqip funds have been spent it identified five categories of practices that are being funded croprelated nutrient management livestockrelated nutrient management soil erosion and land protection water resources management and other resource concerns it found that the largest amount 39 was being spent on water resource management practices which range from more efficient irrigation systems to livestock drinking troughs it also found that while 58 of the total has been spent on livestockrelated activities only 20 has been spent specifically on livestock nutrient waste management it found that the geographic distribution of funds had been fairly even among 9 regions with the largest portion 143 going to the prairie gateway southern plains and the smallest portion 81 going to the northern great plains issues issues have been raised about relationships between this new program and the four programs that it replaced how to address the high level of demand to participate and limiting participation for farms that meet certain characteristics eqip and the programs it replaced several issues revolve around the general question of whether eqip is meant as replacement for 4 repealed programs or is intended to be more significant break with the past for example some have suggested return to some of the characteristics of one of these programs the agricultural conservation program acp which provided smaller amounts of funding but to many more participants each year to apply different mix of practices and on an annual rather than multi year cycle some also have called for eqip to be implemented using the same basic pattern of distributing fundshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31131crs17 by state that was used under the four terminated programs still others take the alternative view that eqip spending patterns are too similar to the repealed programs and do not follow the pattern of the most significant conservation needs questions include after several years of implementation to what degree do eqip funding patterns continue to replicate the funding distribution by state of the four programs that it replaced has the decline in the number who can participate in any year because more funding is available under each contract affected support for this program compared with the acp and should the program be altered to increase the environmental benefits provided outside priority areas where spending is currently concentrated in each state meeting participation demands eqip is different from the programs that it replaced in several respects as the first conservation program to assist farmers who want to address livestock issues it has greatly increased the pool of possible participants introducing more competition for funding to traditional recipients of costsharing conservation funds producers who are located outside priority areas are also finding it more difficult to participate these changes made when eqip was created in 1996 are among the reasons why demand for the program greatly exceeds available funds questions include should the overall funding level for the program be increased should funding levels be raised to level that would allow similar number of producers to participate in this program as had participated in the acp more than 125000 producers received acp funding in fy1994 the last year that funding approached 200 million should the average size of priorities areas be changed to increase the effectiveness of projects and should the maximum length or total funding level for contract be altered limiting participation of larger farms eqip is the first conservation program that limited participation based on farm size in this instance to pay for the construction of animal waste management facilities this change proved particularly contentious lawmakers left it to the department to define large operations through the rulemaking process it defined them by number of animals 1000 beef cattle 800 dairy cows 2500 pigs or 20000 chickens some farm groups opposed this change while others particularly small farm advocates contended that usda set the threshold too high questions include should this or other conservation programs be available to only portion of all producers should large farms be expected to pay for certain conservation practices that may be required by federal or state law or permit requirements as part of their farm operations without federal assistance and should eqip funds be made available to large operations to develop animal waste

exceeded the available amount program accomplishments the 35 million authorized in the 1996 farm bill was obligated by the end of fy1998 to acquire easements on more than 127000 acres in 19 states the

easement on land can be lengthy and by the end of fy1998 the last report on the program showed that this process had been completed on less than 40000 acres nrcs states that every federal dollar has been matched by an average of 6 from other participants issues issues have been raised about the disparity between the high level of interest in the program and the available funding implications for expanding eligibility and what lands are actually protected with these funds interest in participati on demand for funding has greatly exceeded the amount available nrcs reported in march 2001 that it had backlog of 747 offers involving almost 160000 acres that would require about 165 million most participating states including participating localities in those states received at least 15 million but only two states received more than 3 million in federal funds california 34 million and pennsylvania 327 million press reports indicate that interest in protecting farmland and other desirable lands continues to spread questions include how much federal funding would be appropriate what limits if any should be placed on protection efforts when federal funds are involved should the pending offer requirement be retained and should this program be integrated with other longterm land retirement and resource protection programs both within and outside of usda eligibility the changes to the ffp enacted in the crop insurance reform legislation that expanded eligibility is departure from past practices because it allows private and public entities to compete directly for federal grant funds it is not clear whether either private or public entities will have any inherent advantages over the other questions include howhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31131crs22 might the program be changed to accommodate eligible private entities if at all how will public entities react if their funding is reduced to support these new participants and will these new participants alter the geographic distribution of program spending funds by either including some new states or increasing activity in some states that already participate and decreasing activity in others distribution of funds data indicate that nrcs awards most eligible states similar amounts should states equity guide future distributions or should other considerations carry more weight such as the quality and accomplishments of the grant applicants to date the relative intensity of the conversion pressure on the parcels where offers are pending or the relative productivity or uniqueness of the land that would be protected the requests for proposal provide little detail on how nrcs makes these decisions questions center on how does nrcs decide the relative cost effectiveness of each request should the money continue to

projects councils draw on technical assistance from nrcs and financial assistance from other sources projects initiated by councils address natural resource improvements community improvement forestry education economic development water supply and quality recreation and tourism marketing and merchandising fish and wildlife and waste and waste utilization for each of these topics nrcs measures accomplishments for example efforts to improve natural resources have resulted in improvements to 500000 acres of wildlife habitat 510000 acres of lakes and 1500 miles of streams issues more than two thirds of all counties and 75 of the land area are now in designated rcd area current law authorizes up to 450 areas some accomplishments appear to be primarily related to increasing cooperation and coordination or being more efficient other accomplishments relate to implementing changes that lead directly to improved resource conditions on the ground questions include should program goal be to eventually have every county in the country participating should this program be funded at higher level that would provide additional assistance to all councils and should councils be required to be selfsustaining by withdrawing nrcs support after they complete work plans comparison of proposed provisions current law as amended in 1528 through 1538 of the 1981 farm bill pl 9798 is described above two of the bills hr 2646 and s 1267 would make numerous technical amendments which would not affect the basic direction or goals of the program the amendments appear to have the same general effects although they are drafted in different ways in hr 2646 273 would amend the rcd by making the authorization permanent it also would make changes to the rcd legislation by amending several definitions and making indian tribes eligible to participate hr 2375 does not amend the rcd legislation and it would therefore expire at the end of fy2002 in s 1267 601 would make most of the same changes as 273 of hr 2646 in s 1326 204d would extend the program authorization through fy2011 watershed program program description the purposes of the watershed program administered by nrcs include preventing erosion flood and sediment damages and furthering conservationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31131crs26 17 the watershed program was first authorized under public law 534 in 1944 for flood control in 11 specified watersheds and then generically in 1954 for all small watersheds under public law 566 some relatively minor amendments were made in 14611464 of the 1990 farm bill rehabilitation activities were first authorized in 4 state pilot program in title ii of the fy2001 agriculture appropriations pl 106387 then authorized for all states in 313 of pl 106472 the grain standards and warehouse improvement act of 2000 18 the initial 11 watershed projects were authorized in the flood control act of 1944 or pl 534 enacted in the 78th congress they are larger and encompass almost one third of the 110 million acre totaland use of both water and land in watersheds where projects are authorized17 projects may also include the development of recreation facilities and improvement to fish and wildlife habitat this program is commonly referred to as the small watershed program because large majority of the projects have been built under the authorities of the watershed protection and flood prevention act of 1954 or pl566 enacted in the 83rd congress which set maximum size limits each project has one or more local sponsors an emerging concern has been the need to rehabilitate the oldest dams and structures that are reaching or exceeding their design life congress could address many different aspects of the watershed program in the farm bill but the four bills being compared only address funding of the rehabilitation program congress first addressed the rehabilita tion question by authorizing 8 million for pilot rehabilitation program in four states ohio new mexico mississippi and wisconsin then it authorized general rehabilitation program in pl 106472 the grain standards and wareho use improvement act of 2000 which provides up to 90 million for rehabilitation through fy2005 local sponsors must cover 35 of the rehabilitation costs nrcs is to develop system to prioritize rehabilitation projects it recently estimated that more than 2000 dams need to be rehabilitated at total estimated cost of more than 540 million program accomplishments the watershed program has been major conservation activity total of 1641 projects have been approved and more than 10000 flood control structures have been built the total project costs have been 14 billion 1997 dollars including more than 85 billion of federal funds the total area encompassed by all projects is more than 110 million acres18 nrcs estimates that these projects provide more than 1 billion in benefits to agriculture and others annually these benefits center on flood control but they also include water management municipal and industrial water supply recreation fish and wildlife habitat improvement water quality improvement and land conservation this program has been funded at higher levels during some economic downturns to stimulate rural economies by providing employment issues how should the rehabilitation program address changes in the needs and purposes of watershed projects since the first projects were constructed more than 50 years ago flood control is still needed in some situations but other purposes have grown more important many of them dealing with aspects of the environment such as protection of wetlands were not recognized when this program started these changes are addressed in new projects but may not be fully recognized as older projects are rehabilitated the rehabilitation process will expand as more structures deteriorate or age questions include should other purposes receive more attention in relation to flood control should rehabilitationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31131crs27 19 the wrp was enacted in the 1990 farm bill and is placed in subchapter c of chapter 1 environmental conservation acreage reserve program and is in 12371237f of the 1985 farm bill 16 usc 38373837f 20 however it does not assess what portion of the offered acres would have been accepted if funding was not constraintbe limited to addressing safety and deterioration questions or should its purpose be expanded and how will funding levels affect the rehabilitation process comparison of proposed provisions only one of the four bills hr 2646 would amend the watershed program in hr 2646 276 would reauthorize the small watershed rehabilitation program discussed above through fy2011at funding level of 15 million annually wetlands reserve program wrp program description the wrp administered by nrcs provides mandatory funds through the ccc to restore up to 1075000 acres of wetlands and protective buffers on agricultural land19 most but not all lands are restored to their original natural condition the remainder up to 30 can be restored to different natural condition that meets the landowners objectives while providing wetland benefits before the 1996 amendments all land was enrolled in permanent easement now the program is required to use mix of permanent easements 30year easements or costsharing agreements of at least 10 years the magnitude of assistance to the landowner is greatest for the permanent easement and least for the costsharing agreement almost 90 of the enrolled land is under the permanent easement program accomplishments interest in the wrp has been high as individuals have sought to enroll many more acres than the program could accept the fy2001 nrcs budget notes report that for every acre accepted more than 5 acres of eligible lands were offered20 participation has been concentrated in the lower mississippi river valley states with the most enrolled acreage through march 2001 are louisiana 139000 acres mississippi 103000 acres and arkansas 101000 acres according to data compiled by nrcs the next two states in terms of enrollment california and missouri each have about 60000 acres in this program if interest is measured by number of contracts the largest number is in new york 673 contracts other states with large numbers of contracts include iowa 424 missouri 400 and louisiana and wisconsin 378 each issues issues have been raised about enlarging the program changing the eligibility requirements and simplifying the enrollment process scope of program in most years both the earlier bush and clinton administrations proposed enrolling larger amounts of land than congress had allowed congress did this by limiting staff time and resources available to the program in appropriations legislation the clinton administration also proposed larger enrollments because the wrp was component of its clean water action plan as well as critical to the national wetlands policy goal of netloss much of the program effort was centered on reaching this goal for agricultural lands and the information that nrcs provides about wrp is more about enrolling landhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31131crs28 rather than restoration efforts the program has reached its enrollment ceiling questions include should the overall ceiling be raised should total ceiling be replaced by an annual enrollment maximum should the justification for the program be altered if the nonetloss goal is attained on agricultural lands perhaps to enroll lands to offset losses in other land use categories and how rapidly are agricultural wetlands being restored and what benefits are those restorations providing eligible land variety of lands are eligible to enroll in the wrp as interest in the program greatly exceeds the amount of land that the program accepts options to the current pattern of eligibility might be considered these options might be based on cost nrcs reports that easement costs range from 500 per acre in upstate new york to more than 2000 per acre in california also certain types of wetlands may be more valuable because they are scarce or because they serve more important set of functions at particular location support for some types of benefits such as habitat may be greater than for other types of benefits such as flood control or improving water quality finally permanent easements provide the greatest level of protection those familiar with the program have stated that all acreage could be enrolled using permanent easements if that were allowed questions include should wrp eligibility be narrowed so long as interest is high should cost be consideration in deciding which acres to enroll should certain benefits be favored over others and should enrollment be limited to permanent easements so long as land owners are willing to offer sufficient land to be placed under that form of protection enrollment process actually enrolling land into the wrp is long process that includes initial signup appraisals and registering the easement with the deed this process is characterized by some as cumbersome and often has high transaction costs for nrcs and others who are involved questions include in what ways has the program been simplified or streamlined since its inception are there additional ways to simplify or streamline the enrollment process at what point in this process should land be considered to be enrolled and can the acreage at each stage of this process be identified at any timehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31131crs29

estimates that threatened and endangered species may benefit from about 10 of the lands enrolled in fy1999 issues issues have been raised about the importance of wildlife in the overall conservation effort and about how to retain wildlife protection benefits after contracts expire wildlife and the conse rvation effort whip is but one of many conservation programs that can provide wildlife benefits however it is the only program that is limited to wildlife the wildlife management institute wmi focused on the integrative nature of these programs in its recent report how much is enough for 2002 regional wildlife habitat needs assessment for the 2002 farm bill this report makes numerous recommendations to expand or adjust existing programs and create new ones for example for grasslands however the only whip recommendations are to substantially increase funding to 100 million annually questions include what will more funding for whip actually buy to paraphrase the wmi report title how much will be enough should whip remain as separate program or be integrated into other conservation programs and should policy makers increase efforts to coordinate wildlife goals with other agricultural goals wildlife protection in the future agreements will start to expire during the next farm bill there are provisions that give priority to renewing contracts or encourage retention of the benefits that have been generated at the end of their contract landowners will be under further obligations and only some will choose to maintain those benefits questions include what if any obligation should come after the contract for program participants should current participants be given higher priority if they would like to extend their contracts and how should any extended

amend other conservation programs in various ways proposals in some bills directly contradict other bills for example some programs would be reauthorized in some bills but repealed in others22 technical assistance technical assistance is one of four types of conservation support the federal government provides to landowners the others are financial educational and research technical assistanc is delivered by the nrcs primarily through conservation technical assistance cta activities nrcs describes cta as the intellectual capital of the agency combining expertise in soils and other sciences and engineering with knowledge of local conditions the handbook for cta is the field office technical guide which specifies standards for the design and implementation of various conservation practices both cta and the guide are central to implementing almost every conservation program that serves farmers and landowners for the mandatory programs funded through the ccc crpeqip wrpwhip and fpp technical assistance is funded as portion of total funding for each program this amounted to 90 million in fy2000 according to data supplied by nrcs to the house appropriations committees subcommittee on agriculture otherwise technical assistance is provided through the conservation operations line of the annual appropriations for nrcs and through several other program accounts this amounted to 619 million for cta and 212 million for other programs according to the same data set the gap between the need for technical assistance to implement conservation programs and the funding level for those programs has been growing in recent years some of the underlying reasons for this gap as summarized in the earlier discussion of crosscutting issues is that the conservation mission has been expanding funding devoted to most conservation activities other than land retirement programs has been growing more slowly and the federal staff to provide technical assistance has been shrinking proposed conservation legislation could further expand the mission and greatly enlarge several existing programs increasing the pressure to address this gap possible solutions that have been suggested could involve some combination of 1 shifting overall administration of some programs from nrcs to fsa 2 increasing staff and therefore the capability of nrcs to provide more conservation and serve more customers 3 allowing trained and certified individuals who are parties other than nrcs employees referred to as third parties to provide some of the services that now only are provided by nrcs or 4 altering the legislation that created the ccc to either remove the current cap on funding for technical assistance or create separate account within the ccc for technical assistance httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31131crs34 each solution has some supporters but also vocal opponents efforts to move administration of conservation programs from either nrcs or fsa to the other agency which has been proposed in congress and at usda in recent years has generated strong negative reactions repeatedly from the constituents and clients of both agencies supporters of current proposals to transfer programs from nrcs to fsa argue that the result would be reduced workload at nrcs that would allow its staff to focus on fewer programs while opponents of these transfers argue that the two agencies have different skills and capabilities so transfer would penalize the overall conservation effort while appropriators have limited funding increases and have supported staffing reductions in recent years because of other higher priorities they have also supported emergency or supplemental funding for technical assistance on numerous occasions using other parties to do some of the activities assigned to nrcs has been met with suspicion by those who worry about the quality of service or the expense of using private providers in place of free public services amending the ccc legislation in either of the suggested ways is opposed by those who would like to maximize the amount of money coming from the ccc that is distributed to producers but supported by those who view conservation as more important to these programs than current funding levels suggest three of the bills propose various responses to these concerns in hr 2646 265b would provide up to 100 million annually from fy2002 through fy2011 from the ccc with the total limited to 850 million to provide technical assistance for all the mandatory conservation programs funded through the ccc it

providing technical assistance in installing structural and land management practices and providing supporting information education and training in support of implementing the plan are listed as being approved for reimbursement section 603 would allow other parties certified by the secretary to provide technical assistance the secretary would develop guidelines for training and certification and establish training centers in eight specified locations using 50 million annually from the ccc to implement this subsection in s 1326 203 would require the secretary to establish requirements standards and procedures for certifying and recertifying other parties who are qualified to provide technical assistance potential providers would pay fee to be set by the secretary for the

plant and animal diversity306d same as hr 2646 and adds preference for large contiguous tracts of working farm and ranch landno provisions cost sharing payments274 provides cost sharing payments for restoration of 90 or less on virgin grasslands or 75 or less on restored grassland annual payments to producers could not exceed 75 of the grazing value of the landno provisions 401 limits cost sharing assistance to 75 and limits reimbursement to nrcs for technical assistance to 10 of the federal cost of restoration and the cost of acquisition program adminis tration264 makes fsa the primary implementing agencyno provisions 401 sets criteria for the sec to delegate easements to private conservation and land trust organizations and requires implementing regulations to be issued within 180 days note s 1326 does not contain any comparable proposal sec is the secretary of agriculturehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31131crs39 wrp enhancement program in hr 2375 303 would create 250000 acre program of cost sharing with states modeled after the conservation reserve enhancement program crep participants could enroll wetlands in agreements of 10 to 30 years or in easements of more than 30 years states would identify eligible land as significant habitat having water quality value or potential to reduce floods with priority given to types of wetlands that are declining or not protected by law eligible lands would include wetlands converted wetlands potential wetlands and limited buffer areas states must submit plan and contribute 25 of the program costs to participate the activities permitted and prohibited would be the same as under the grasslands reserve proposal in hr 2375 discussed above in land placed under permanent easement restoration of wetlands grassland and shrubs would be permitted while development and commercial crop and timber production would be prohibited corridor demonstration projects in hr 2375 title viii would establish one or more demonstration projects for ecosystems or watersheds using existing conservation programs as determined within 90 days of enactment by the secretary in consultation with the states agreements with states would be through plan about resource s to be used giving the secretary flexibility to make adjustments to apply programs more effectively and efficiently states would have 6 months from the date of enactment to submit plans the secretary would have 30 days to review and approve the proposal based on 4 specified criteria states would contribute an unspecified portion of necessary resources the federal portion would be funded through an unspecif ied portion of the funding for all conservation programs provided through the ccc privacy protection of data collected by federal agencies about resource conditions or farm operations that could be used to identify individuals or to locate specific sites or properties has been growing concern to producers driving this concern are the expanded ability of computers to manipulate complex data sets and efforts by environmental quality programs to locate possible sources of problem s such as groundwater pollution that might originate from agricultural activities specific concerns include potential liability and reduced property values producers and landowners reportedly have responded to these concerns by being less willing to share information about their operations in surveys conducted by agencies in usda in hr 2375 702f would protect data about individuals used for evaluation and monitoring and allow the use of data aggregated so that individuals could not be identified in the eqip provisions 201c which would establish watershed quality incentive contracts has subsection 9 excludes collected data from federal mandatory disclosure requirements except in an aggregate form to measure expected benefits in s 1276 1001 would add new section to subtitle of the 1985 farm bill funding and administration subsection stating that information associated with implementing any nrcs or fsa conservation program or with the natural resources inventory nri and the individual sample points from which that data is compiled is not public and not to be released cooperating agencies and organization however could obtain these data information from the nri could be released in aggregate form that precludes identification of individuals or specific data gathering sites httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31131crs40 in s 1326 201 is identical to privacy provisions in s 1276 except that it also includes provision that allows an individual to disclose information about his operation but that information may not be used as condition for participating in or benefitting from any program farmland stewardship program in hr 2646 275 would create new farmlan d stewardship program to be administered by nrcs to more precisely tailor and target current conservation programs using program funding on watershed basis where possible participation would require matching funds participants would submit management plan and would be encouraged to use easements where possible to implement conservation management
