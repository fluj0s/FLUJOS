india conducted total of five underground nuclear tests breaking 24year selfimposed moratorium on nuclear testing pakistan followed claiming 5 tests on may 28 1998 and an additional test on may 30 the indian tests which appear to have completely surprised the us intelligence and policy community set off worldwide storm of criticism president clinton announced on may 13 1998 that he was imposing economic and military sanctions mandated by sec 102 of the arms export control act aeca the administration applied the same sanctions to pakistan on may 30 although the indian government claimed concern about the deteriorating security and nuclear environment as its reason for testing many observers believe that domestic political factors may have been responsible for at least the timing of the tests the current bharatiya janata party bjp government is weak coalition of 13 disparate parties in power only since late march 1998 many analysts judged that by conducting nuclear tests the bjp hoped to consolidate its power by rallying strong national pronuclear sentiment the claimed size and type of weapons tested by india may hold significant implications for its future intentions as well as for future actions of pakistan and china many experts judge that the five indian tests are unlikely to satisfy technical requirements for weapon development while others think that india may have gathered enough data to preclude the necessity for further testing pakistans tests of apparently simple fission devices appear more aimed at demonstrating the possession of capability based on weapon design that it reportedly acquire d from china decade or more ago both countries nuclear tests appear to further complicate prospects for ratification of the comprehensive test ban treaty by the us senate the us response to the nuclear tests thus far has centered on the imposition of mandatory sanctions under the aeca and other legislation specific sanctions include termination of us development assistance termination of us government sales of defense articles and services termination of foreign military financing denial of credit credit guarantees or other financial assistance by the us government opposition to loans or assistance by international financial institutions prohibition on us bank loans or credit to indian and pakistan and prohibition on exports of specific goods and technology us options are limited by the evident determination of india and pakistan to preserve and develop nuclear weapons capabilities policy options include maintaining or broadening sanctions providing the president with authority to waive current sanctions in return for specific actions of restraint by india and pakistan and providing momentum to the nonproliferation process by concentrating on getting pakistan to sign the ctbt first the latter two approaches require legislation pl 10594 signed into law on july 14 1998 exempts for one year aeca restrictions on financing for food and agricultural exports in november president clinton eased some economic sanctions using oneyear waiver authority given him by the congress in october under the omnibus appropriations act

conducted unannounced nuclear tests setting off global storm of protest and criticism and negating more than two decades of effort by the united states to prevent nuclear proliferation in south asia indias five tests on may 11 and 13 broke its selfimposed 24year moratorium on nuclear testing and set the stage for pakistans tests in the twoweek interval between india and pakistans tests the united states and other countries launched vigorous but ultimatel unsuccessful campaign to convince pakistan not to follow indias lead on may 28 pakistan announced that it had conducted five nuclear tests which it followed up with single test on may 30 countries around the world joined the united states in expressing dismay and condemnation of india and pakistans nuclear tests although the strength of their concrete actions has varied greatly on may 13 president clinton imposed wide ranging sanctions on india remarking that its surprise nuclear testing recalls the very worst events of the 20th century noting that 149 nations have already signed the comprehensive test ban treaty ctbt the president called on india to define its greatness in 21stcentury terms not in terms that everybody else has already decided to reject on may 13 the us senate subcommittee on near eastern and south asian affairs held hearings on india that had been originally intended to focus on growi ng ties and economic cooperation between the united states and india but instead became forum for bipartisan condemnation of indias nuclear tests see crs issue brief 93097 usindia relations number of nations joined the united states in imposing economic sanctions on india on may 14 1998 japan announced it was suspending aid loans reportedly worth nearly 1 billion in addition to suspending 26 million in grant aid germany australia the netherlands sweden and denmark also announced economic sanctions on india of varying degrees of severity the europeans and japanese also supported the united states in postponing consideration of pending world bank loans for india amid fears by nonproliferation experts that indias tests would prompt testing by pakistan and other countries president clinton dispatched highlevel team headed by deputy secretary of state strobe talbott to pakistan to try to dissuade islamabad from respond ing in kind acknowledging the pressures on the pakistan government to test president clinton stated that refraining from testing would be great act of statesmanship and restraint on their part it was not clear what incentives the us officials intended to offer pakistan but settlement of the longstanding dispute over the nondelivery of f16 fighter planes as result of the cutoff of aid to pakistan in 1990 was widely cited as one possibility see crs issue brief 94041

new york times may 13 1998 a12 2 reuters may 28 1998background both countries have long possessed the technology and materials to build nuclear weapons india conducted its first and only previous nuclear test in may 1974 and since then has maintained ambiguity about the status of its nucle ar program pakistan probably gained nuclear weapons capability sometime in the 1980s prime ministe r nawaz sharif declared that pakistan could have tested years ago had it chosen to do so india has consistently rejected as discriminatory the nuclear non proliferation treaty npt and the comprehensive test ban treaty ctbt calling instead for global nuclear disarmament regime pakistan traditionally has maintained that it will only sign the ctbt and npt when india does so motivations and timing india the original impetus for new delhis development of its nuclear option appears to have been its sense of strategic rivalry with china dramatized by indias 1962 defeat in short border war followed by chinas first nuclear explosion in 1964 three decades of chilly relations across disputed border and chinas expanding nuclear and missil capability reportedly served to confirm indias perception of chinese threat yet until the mid1990s india showed urgency of intent to follow up on its 1974 explosion of plutonium device underground indias concerns about china have been further fueled by chinas longtime support for pakistan including the supply of arms and nuclear and missile technology india and pakis tan have fought three wars in the halfcentury since their independence see crs report 9723 indiapakistan nuclear and missile proliferation background status and issues for us policy in may 12 1998 letter to president clinton and other world leaders indian prime minister atal behari vajpayee listed concerns about the deteriorating security and nuclear environment with oblique references to china and pakistan as the impetus for indias conducting the may 1998 nuclear tests1 since 1993 india china relations had been improving as result of an agreement that called for reduction of troops along their common border talks on border demarcation and an expansion of economic and cultural ties in late april 1998 however indian defense minister george fernandes made several statements in which he referred to china as indias greatest threat fernandes alleged among other things that china had supplied pakistan with technology for mediumrange missile tested by pakistan in early april and that china had extended its military airfields in tibet and established massive electronic surveillance system in burmas coco islands indias emphasis on the china threat as rationale for its nuclear tests became diluted somewhat after pakistans blasts prime minister vajpayee told reporters on may 28 that rather than india forcing pakistans hand it was pakistan that forced us to take the path of nuclear deterrence2 in his letter to clinton vajpayee also alleged pakistans sponsorship of insurgencies in indias punjab and jammu and kashmirhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98570crs3 3 steven mufson pakistan weighs response to india new york times may 15 1998 a29 a33 4 raj chengappa nuclear dilemma

the kashmir rebellion despite the rationale offered by indian government officials for testing at this time many analysts point to domestic political factors as more likely immediate impetus prime minister vajpayee leads an unwieldy minority coalition government comprising his own bharatiya janata party bjp 12 smaller parties and numerous independents that came to power following the februarymarch 1998 parliamentary elections most of the coalition partners do not share the bjps hindu nation alist outlook and have their own locallydriven agendas since the election vajpayee has appeared to have had his hands full placating various powerful regional leaders and keeping the coalition intact previous bjp government also headed by vajpayee which came to power following the 1996 parliamentary elections fell after just 13 days when it was unable to attract sufficient coalition partners in order to pass confidence vote see crs report 98324 indias 1998 parliamentary election results the bjp has consistently pushed for india to test nuclear weapons and develop its nuclear and ballistic missile capability the bjp coalition governments national agenda for governance april 18 1998 states to ensure the security territorial integrity and unity of india we will take all necessary steps and exercise all available options towards that end we will reevaluate the nuclear policy and exercise the option to induct nuclear weapons indian government leaders however reportedly had assured us officials including ambassador to the united nations bill richardson during an april 1998 visit to india that changes in its nuclear policy were imminent3 in conducting nuclear tests the bjp government clearly played the popular national prestige card longstanding aspirations for major power status which to many indians means acceptance into the elite club of nations with recognized nuclear programs former indian foreign secretary muchkund dubey stated the indian case in 1994 the bomb option is currency of power that is critical to our survival as strong nation4 in recent years public opinion polls have shown solid majority of indians to favor nuclear testing as further indicated by the euphoric atmosphere that swept india following its nuclear tests the congress party which ruled india for 45 of the past 50 years as well as most other indian political parties soon backed the bjp decision to conduct nuclear tests according to the indian express the congress party appeared to back away from its original concerns why the tests now what was the change in the countrys threat perception whether this marks the beginning of weaponizing process in the coun try and whether the bjpled government had done its homework on the possible fallout on the nations economyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98570crs4 5vijay simha cong too sings patriotic tune on nuke tests indian express may 15 1998 6 televised address to the nation may 28 1998 in order to provide an image of national solidarity5 these concerns however have resurfaced in the following weeks and months pakistan pakistans motivations were largely selfevident in announcing the may 28 series of tests prime minister nawaz sharif described his decision as inevitable and declared we have settled the account of the nuclear blasts by india6 at the same time the quickness of pakistans rejoinder and the claimed number of tests suggest that preparations had long been under way pakistan has lived with demonstrated indian nuclear capability for more than twenty years and has been aware since at least late 1995 that indias nuclear establishment was prepared to test within short time after receiving the political goahead apart from concerns about the political costs of not testing pakistan may have been anxious to test in order to reassure itself that its weapons worked and to impress upon india and others the reality of pakistans nuclear capability in fact the sequencing of the blasts suggests that both countries scientists had only been waiting for favorable political decision while the political leaders of each country waited for their counterparts in the other to make the first move pakistans leaders knew that they had the most to lose from going first in terms of the international respons india had always shown little concern about international opinion but previous congress and coalition governments had nonetheless found reasons not to go forward in this context the reported decision by the narasimha rao government to back away from test in late 1995 following strong us diplomatic intervention tends to underscore the likely role of domestic political change as the balancetipper the decision of the bjp leadership in new delhi created an overwhelming political compulsion in pakistan to respond in kind but also may have created the hope in islamabad that its action would meet with more sympathetic international reaction than otherwise would have been the

testing the indian government described the first three may tests at the pokharan test site in the western desert near the pakistan border as heralding indias status as fullscale nuclear weapons power in the words of government statement the tests conducted today were with fission device low yield device and thermonuclear device these tests have established that india has proven capability for weaponised nuclear programme they also provide valuable database which is useful in the design of nuclear weapons of different yields for different applications and for different deliver systems india announced on may 13 that it had conducted two additional nuclear tests on that day each with yield of less than one kiloton and that these were the last tests in its planned series india according to reports had planned to conduct third test on may 13 but largely for political reasons canceled that test recovered the device and put it into safekeeping23 pk iyengar former chairman of indias atomic energy commission provided more detail on the may 11 tests in an interview with reuters he indicated that the smallest device with yield of 1000 metric tons 1 kiloton of tnt was the size that might be fired as an artillery shell or dropped from combat support aircraft the midyield explosion was from standard fission device equivalent to about 12000 metric tons 12 kilotons of tnt the size that might be dropped from bomber plane and the largest test was not full hydro gen bomb most of its 50000 to 100000 metric ton 50100 kiloton explosive force came from fission device the abomb which serves as trigger for the hbombs big fusion explosion he indicated that that device contained only small amount of fusion fuel it showed that indias thermon uclear technology worked but did not produce the megaton explosion typical of full hbomb24 an indian statement by the department of atomic energy and the defense research and development organization released may 17 provided more precise details according to this statement as reported by dow jones the may 11 tests were of fission device with yield of about 12 kilotons thermonuclear device with yield of about 43 kilotons and third test with yield of 02 kilotons the two may 13 tests were said to have yields of 05 and 02 kilotons dow jones reported that r chidambaram chairman of the atomic energy commission aec clarified the largest explosion was indeed thermonuclear one and not boostedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98570crs11 25 indian scientists provide details of nuclear tests dow jones may 17 1998 26 inaccuracies at that range would

fission trigger and secondary fusion device boosted fusion sic device does not have secondary stage chidambaram said25 the size and type of weapons tested hold significant implications for indias future intentions including the likelihood of additional tests and for threat perceptions by china and pakistan the smallest device tested on may 11 was presumably simple fissiononly weapon as such single test might provide sufficient confidence in the design to enable production the combat uses specified by iyengar are of short range ie type that could be used for delivery by artillery or tactical aircraft against pakistani targets the midsize device tested on may 11 would seem to require delivery by aircraft or shortrange missiles it would take extraordinary accuracy for ballistic missile to destroy targets at long ranges with that yield as such it might also be counte rpakistan device or have application as tactical weapon in some possible conflicts with china if as iyengar states the largest device derived most of its yield from fission then that device without the thermonuclear stage could presumably be used as standalone weapon of greater yield than the midsized device making total of three fission devices tested and perhaps usable excluding the may 13 explosions which may have been experimental device s for gathering data iyengars stateme nt implies that india could have increased the yield of the largest device greatly by simply adding more thermonuclear fuel highyield thermonuclear warhead would be critical addition to indias arsenal as counter to china the development of the agni ballistic missile with an anticipated range of 2500 km makes little strategic sense without warhead of this sort26 china could thus perceive threat from thermonucleararmed agni defense minister george fernandess statement of may 4 that china not pakistan is potential threat 1 for india underscores the most logical rationale for the agni missile the likely main value of the two subkiloton tests of may 13 would appear be the provision of scientific data eg for future computer simulation efforts given their low yields program to enable these tests

development program28 3 indias diplomacy helped to preserve the nuclear option by providi ng rationale to avoid signing the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt and the ctbt it is possible that the five tests did not satisfy technical requirements for weapon development the historical experience of the five declared nuclear weapon states strongly implies that several tests are needed to develop single weapon type and turn it into deployable weapon and india said it is developi ng several weapon types thermonuclear weapons have much more explosive force per unit weight than fission only bombs and so would be of much greater value in arming missiles but they also are much more complex requirin g more tests to validate and improve the design ensuring that missile warhead can survive the stresses of launch the cold of space and the heat and vibration of reentry takes added work finally conducting the tests over such brief period would preclude using data from one test in designing device to be tested later so that the tests probably had less value than if they had been conducted several months apart there are moreover questions as to the success of indias tests regarding the alleged thermonuclear test us official commented in may 1998 either it was not really thermonuclear weapon or it was thermonuclear weapon that did not go off as planned due to some error the general view is that the indian tests were not fully successful29 seismic data cast doubt on the claimed yield and number of tests terry wallace seismologist in an article of september 1998 found on the basis of seismic data that the may 11 explosion had yield of 1015 kt vs an announced yield of some 43 kilotons for the largest weapon that there was evidence of multiple explosions on may 11 vs claim of

of issues including the ctbt we are prepared to bring these discussions to successful conclusion so that the entry into force of the ctbt is not delayed beyond september 199934 technical aspects of pakistans nuclear testing all evidence points to pakistans nuclear weapons program being smaller and less ambitious than that of india pakistan reportedly used simple weapon design based on enriched uranium which is said to be less sophisticated approach than one based on plutonium35 such as india uses abdul qadeer khan the head of pakistans nuclear program and the father of its atomic bomb said none of these explosions of may 28 and 30 were thermonuclear we are doing research and can do fusion blast if asked36 there are few if any other references to pakistani fusion or hydrogen bomb program and the implication that pakistan could detonate hydrogen bomb soon seems doubtful in contrast india has done considerable work toward weapon of that type as discussed above under technical aspects of

obtained the plans from the chinese government in the early 1980s the bomb was simple and efficient based on highly enriched uranium and it had been tested by the chinese in 1966 united states government physicists built model of the bomb and reported that it was virtually foolproof design37 on may 28 1998 pakistan announced that it had conducted five underground nuclear tests it announced

were tested said one us intelligence official47 similarly the new york times reported that american intelligence officials said pakistan had probably tested only two weapons rather than the five announced48 wallace found seismic signals that could correspond to two explosions but discounts the plausibility of the second one49 because the yield appears lower than announced it is unclear if the devices performed as intended according to press report us officials said that the estimated yield of the pakistani test or tests of may 28 put by that report at most likely six kilotons is less than what us intelligence experts had estimated as the likely yield of even one of the principal bombs in pakistans arsenal raising questions about whether the device or devices exploded by pakistan had perfo rmed as expected50 on the other hand as noted above the chinese design is thought to be nearly foolproof there are indications that the tests were of actual weapons as distinct from test devices aq khan described the devices tested as readytofire warheads that had been miniaturized so they could fit onto ghauri missiles51 he also indicated that four of the five tests of may 28 were of lowyield tactical nuclear weapons52 according to press report intelligence analysts believe goal of the test on may 30 was to devise bomb small enough to fit on missile pakistan is believed to be

417 pm eastern timetesting actual weapons is plausible if as reported china gave pakistan the design of nuclear weapon there would be reason to deweaponize it measurements of weapon physics radiochemistry etc could be gained from weapon not specially configured as an experimental device moreover testing weapon provides information on the reliability of the weapon and of the production process testing an experimental device would provide less confidence in these key elements of reliability54 by one estimate pakistan has enough weaponsgrade uranium for 16 to 20 weapons while india is said to have enough separated plutonium for approximately 75 weapons55 pakistan would therefore have strong incentive to conduct as few tests as possible using conservative designs in weapons configurations there would be good reason for testing missile warheads and tactical nuclear warheads the ghauri missile with range of 900 miles is expected once deployed to be pakistans main deterrent of india as its range would enable it to strike almost all of that country testing warhead for that missile would seem to be pakistans highest nuclear priority similarly shortrange lowyield tactical nuclear weapons would arguably help pakistan deter conventional attack by india which has much stronger conventional force s apparently to capitalize on its conventional superiority india offered not to be the first to use nuclear weapon s most likely if pakistan offers similar pledge apparently to help offset its conventional inferiority pakistan has been reluctant to make such promise56 indeed prime minister nawaz sharif implied that its nuclear weapons could be used to counter conventional attack these weapons are to deter aggression be it nuclear or conventional57 this implicit threat to use nuclear weapons to counter stronger conventional force parallels natos rejection of policy of first use of nuclear weapons during the cold war when natos tactical nuclear weapons and the implicit link to strategic nuclear weapons were seen as counter to the warsaw pact which had numerical superiority in conventional forces it appears that pakistan could deploy warheads on the ghauri indeed

deployment on missiles and are ready for mounti ng on the ghauri61 on the other hand us defense department spokesman said on june 2 that it would probably take both india and pakistan year or two to miniaturize nuclear weapons for use on missiles62 it is though less clear if pakistan is deploying nucleararmed ghauris an official statement said that the missile was already being capped with nuclear warheads63 and pakistani foreign minister gohar ayub khan said pakistan would naturally be serially producing nuclear warheads and missiles64 the pakistani foreign ministry was quoted however as saying that reports of an official statement that pakistan was preparing to arm the ghauri were patently wrong65 and us intelligence officials said they had found sign yet that pakistan had capped the ghauri or other missiles with nuclear warhead contrary to pakistani claims last week that were later retracted66 the uncertainty about whether pakistan has armed its ghauri missiles with nuclear warheads is comp ounded by conflicting domestic and international imperatives and practical considerations deploying nuclear missile force would seem likely to have political support as another assertion of pakistans prowess and as an actual rather than potential deterrent on the other hand pakistan is probably acutely aware that deployment would ratchet up the south asian nuclear arms race perhaps prompting india to deploy nucleararmed missiles and aircraft with missile flight times of three or four minutes from one nation to the others major cities deployment would arguably increase

1998 that pakistan announced unilateral moratorium on testing moreover he continued pakistan is prepared to adhere to the ctbt however pakistans adherence to the treaty will take place only in conditions free from coercion or pressure67 regarding the latter point president clinton decided in november 1998 to lift some sanctions on india and pakistan in response to their announcements of testing moratoria and steps toward strengthening controls on exports of nuclear and missile technology68 implications for the comprehensive test ban treaty the indian and pakistani tests shattered the

early entry into force of this treaty in their speeches of september 1998 the prime ministers of india and pakistan both indicated they were prepared to join the treaty by september 1999 senate rationale for not considering the treaty in 1998 was the rejection of that treaty by these two nations if they join the treaty by september 1999 the force of that rationale would diminish the failure of us intelligence to detect indias test preparations despite many indian statements prior to may about testing and despite knowing the location of indias test site may make us ability to detect other nations test preparations less credible this could weaken us and international ability to forestall tests timely detection of preparations permits diplomatic efforts that try to thwart testing as occurred in late 1995 when the united states detected indian test preparations and apparently forestalled them with strong diplomatic initiative the intelligence failure also makes the threat of clandestine tests more serious as part of the ability to deter such tests would arise from ability to detect preparations for them on the other hand sidney drell professor of physics at stanford university stated that the global network of seismic sensors that will form the core of the treatys verification system did detect locate and identify the main nuclear blast that india detonated on may 11 and very low yield tests are of questionable value in designing new nuclear weapons or confirming that new design will work as intended any failure by the monitors to detect such tests is not the proper benchmark for determining the systems or the treatys effectiveness78 moreover an official review of the intelligence failure provided number of lessons that may help avert such failures in the future79 us response the us response to indias and pakistans nuclear tests centered on the imposition of wideranging largely economic sanctions under the arms export control act aeca and other

indian and nearly 100 pakistani entities and subsidiaries found to be involved in nuclear or missile projects waiver authority in the aeca section 102b4a of the arms export control act as amended authorizes the president to delay the imposition of these sanctions for 30 days presumably the president had this in mind when his administ ration approached the government of india after the first days nuclear detonations and averred that sanctio ns could be avoided if that government would disavow any future testing or deployment of nuclear weapons this overture was thwarted however when india conducted two more tests day later similarly for pakistan the president did not invoke the 30day delay instead issuing his determination and implementing sanctions on the day of the second round of detonation tests had the president invoked the 30day delay congress might have initiated some means for the admini stration to modify waive or terminate the sanctions by not following the procedure laid out in the aeca new legislation either freestanding or amending the arms export control act would be required to waive suspend or terminate the sanctions against india or pakistan at this point

on the middle east by kenneth katzman june 5 1998implications for us interests the indian and pakistani nuclear weapon tests along with the intensification of charged rhetoric over the kashmir dispute and other indicators of strained relations between new delhi and islamabad seriously threaten to undercut us nonproliferation and regional security interests in the first instance the open display of nuclear weapons capabilities by each country raises the risk of miscalculation that could bring about nuclear exchange the tests could also create wider reverberations such as fueling intensified efforts by iran to acquire nuclear weapons and delivery systems and causing other regional states that have decided to forego developing nuclear weapons capability to rethink their position the popular enthusiasm in pakistan and elsewhere in the muslim world over what is seen as the realization of the islamic bomb has also renewed fears that pakistan might transfer its nuclear technology or put its weapons at the disposal of radical states such as iran or iraq or even conservative saudi arabia traditional major financial benefactor97 at present pakistan appears likely to find it more advantageous to maintain nuclear monopoly in the islamic world than to dissipate its one clear claim on the support and purses of its friends and neighbors in west asia in the event that us and other international sanctions lead to extreme economic distress and the emergence of more populistnationalist government however these calculations could change in addition the actual collapse of the pakistani state either as result of economic and political crisis or military defeat could lead to an exodus of pakistani nuclear scientists and technicians to neighboring islamic countries president clinton and other us political leaders and officials have indicated several interrelated policy goals these include in the first instance persuading india and pakistan to avoid further tests and sign the ctbt and to refrain from deploying ballistic missiles armed with nuclear weapons other goals include getting both countries to agree to stop producing fissile materials and to sign the npt signing the latter would require putting all of their nuclear facilities and material under the supervision of the international atomic energy agency iaea most unlikely action under foreseeable circumstances the united states and other major powers also have called for resolution of the underlying causes of the indiapakistan rivalry at this point the goals of rolling back the nuclear programs of india and pakistan appear highly visionary given indias stance towards the npt and pakistans refusal to sign unless india does as for the more limited objectives the possibility of positive response depends very much on whether the perceived interests of india and pakistan on the one hand and the nonproliferation goals of the united states and other major powers on the other can be reconciled through diplomacy persuasion coercion or combination thereofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98570crs30 three interrelated us policy challenges three particular challenges face the administration and congress at this time the first is to find if possible an antiproliferation approach that will in fact appeal to the perceived selfinterest of india and pakistan whether positively negatively or both the second is persuading other major powers and influential countries either to support us initiatives or put forward their own plans that would garner broad international backing while the united states still remains powerful international actor in the eyes of indian and pakistani leaders us influence is probably more limited now than during the cold war era at present the european powers and russia are more interested in offering carrots than using sticks japan has at least temporarily suspended more than 1 billion of its bilateral aid for an unspecified period but is not likely to impose any other bilateral economic sanctions china which has strongly condemned india nonetheless maintains blanket policy of opposing the use of sanctions and moreover sees itself as both fair and foul weather friend of pakistan the problem of reconciling conflicting indian and pakistani objectives for many years south asian and nuclear nonproliferation specialists both within and outside the us government have largely despaired of finding formula to resolve the indiapakistan rivalry and satisfy indias aspirations for the status of nuclear weapons state althoug h it is widely agreed that the best way to stop the nuclear arms race in south asia is to resolve the underlyin g causes of tension primarily the kashmir issue that issue not only is exceedingly intractable but some current indian leaders have also have indicated their belief that indias nuclear capabilit gives it trump card for settling the issue on indias terms moreover indias aspirations to be equated with china are equally important to its foreign and security policymakers indian and pakistani national objectives analysis of india and pakistani security goals by scores of regional and nonproliferation experts both western and indian carried out over many years underscores the inherent difficulties in achieving regional nonproliferation regime indias objectives include the following though not necessarily in this order 1 the prestige and recognition of being accepted as full member of the nuclear club while not participating in discriminatory nonproliferation regime 2 being treated as more important country than pakistan rather than being equated with it 3 having the ability to deter china from using its nuclear weapons to coerce india while itself enjoying this capability against pakistanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98570crs31 98kenneth j cooper leader says india has credible deterrent washington post june 17 1998 a214 at minimum gaining pakistani recognition of the line of control in kashmir as an international border and an end to pakistani support for the antiindia secessionist movement there some hawkish bjp leaders such as home minister and minister for jammu and kashmir l k advani have called for reclaiming the pakistani held parts of kashmir including both azad free kashmir and pakistans northern areas that connect it with china how seriously the bjp leaders believe their own rhetoric cannot be determined pakistani goals are largely mirror image of indias 1 achieve the capacity to counter indias superior conventional power with nuclear equalizer that could be used either offensively under favorable circumstances or as last resort to prevent catastrophic military defeat 2 maintain close ties to other friendly andor wealthy or militarily powerful states as an offset to indias 71 population advantage and 31 military advantage 3 keep india off balance in kashmir and optimally gain international support for plebiscite that would lead to the states accession to pakistan 4 gain respect and support within the islamic world and 5 deny india effective hegemony over the south asian region areas of potential mutual selfinterest these opposing goals notwithstanding india and pakistan do have some mutual interests and it may still be possible for new delhi and islamabad to step back from fullfledged nuclear arms race neither country wants to get into nuclear exchange and both know that nuclear missiles attheready status creates situation more of crisis instability than deterrence indian prime minister vajpayee reportedly stated in midjune that india sought only minimum credible deterrent and had intention of engaging in nuclear arms race and building huge arsenals as we have seen other nuclear weapons states do because their doctrines were predicated on nuclear war vajpayee also said that india did not intend to replicate the command and control structures that the major nuclear powers maintained98 despite brave talk pakistan cannot really afford either the direct costs of nuclear arms race or the heavy costs of us and international economic sanctions these costs did not deter pakistan from testing in part because the political price to nawaz shari f of yielding to foreign pressure was even greater and in part because pakistans demonstration of nuclear weapons capability was seen as having important psychological and objective security advantages now that its nuclear capability has been demonstrated pakistan appears to be looki ng for relief from the costs india likewise paid

eastern economic review nov 5 1998 27economic price for its tests although less so than pakistan because of greater degree of selfsufficiency india has also seen sharp slowdown in inward foreign investment this may derive as much from the vajpayee governments use of the rhetoric of economic nationalism as from nervousness over the nuclear situation or the temporary loss of us trade credits and investment insurance both governments have come under considerable public criticism for being too complacent about the economic impact of the tests however meaningful political backlash probably cannot occur in either country without perception by the public that the government is being unreasonable in continuing to resist us and international overtures us and congressional options most analysis by regional security and nonproliferation experts has centered on finding mix of incentives and penalties to defuse the crisis bring india and pakistan into bilateral or international arms control regime and ease the underlying sources of rivalry deputy secretary of state strobe talbot noted during meet the press interview on may 31 1998 that although india and pakistan had regrettably crossed threshold there are plenty of bad and stupid things that they have not yet done and we hope to use the period ahead to give them every incentive not to do it to get them back from the brink few days earlier talbot observed that while both countries had ignored us pleas that they not carry out tests that doesnt mean they are deaf or blind to arguments particularly ones that appeal to their selfinterest99 current status of us nonproliferation sanctions working in cooperation with the administration congress adopted legislation during the close of the past session that provided temporary flexib ility to the president in regard to nonproliferation sanctions that affect us agricultural exports access to american bank loans and the us stance on loans from international financial institutions see section on legislation below the waiver authority granted to the president was not contingent on any specific actions on the part of india or pakistan in that sense it has been described by regional analysts as carrot that can be used by the administration to seek concessions by india and pakistan among other considera tions us officials reportedly are counting on pakistans dire financial straits and its desire to gain us support for 5 billion emergency credit from the imf the world bank and g7 to tip the balance towards accommodation with us

eastern economic review july 16 1998 70taking into account the remaining constraints imposed by current us sanctions law and the timelimited nature of the presidents current authority to waive certain sanctions american options appear to fall into three broad categories option 1 maintain or broaden sanctions under sec 102b of the arms export control act aeca and other provisions rationale and advantages given the slim prospects of reaching agreement by india and pakistan on nuclear restraint or rollback of their nuclear and missile programs some observers argue that the two countries should feel the full weight of us sanctions and those that might be imposed by other countries if nothing else some maintain the imposition of broad and painful sanctions will serve as an object lesson to other wouldbe proliferators us diplomacy under this option would concentrate on getting additional countries to impose sanctions and to use its leverage at the international financial institutions to cut off development and balance of payments loans initial us efforts in this direction received temporary boost at june 12 group of eight g8 meeting in london during which all of the members countries including the devel oped industrial democracies and russia agreed to oppose loans to india and pakistan by international financial institutions except loans to meet basic human needs101 subsequently however votes on loans at the world bank suggest that most loan requests would be regarded as meeting these criteria disadvantages perhaps the most important obstacle to this approach is that many members of congress believe that unilateral us sanctions harm us economic interests without achieving any concrete nonproliferation benefits more generally critics argue that this option leaves the united states as an outlier among the other nuclear weapons states and major powers in regard to the scope and breadth of its bilateral sanctions and could have unintended negative consequences such as an economic and political collapse of pakistan or increasing dependence of islamabad on iran andor other islamic states in june 1998 the cia reportedly warned policymakers that pakistans financial woes might cause it to sell nuclear technology to iran or other neighbors102 over time it is argued hardline adherence to sanctions could lead to significant breakdown in cooperation with us allies and with russia and china since it is questionable how long they will be prepared to maintain their aid suspensions and opposition to loans from the international financial institutions congressional role the authority to waive range of sanctions that was provided via the omnibus appropr iations bill for fy 1999 will expire in one year after that it will be up to congress whether to extend the waiver authority to allow the sanctions to be reimposedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98570crs34 option 2 provide the president with authority to waive current sanctions subject to congressional review and override in return for specific actions of restraint on the part of india and pakistan rationale and advantages the object of this approach which largely represents current polic is to offer the selective lifting of sanctions in return for specific actions by india andor pakistan to step back from their confrontation in theory the specific prior grant of waiver authority by congress gives the administration the ability to negotiate with more credibility than would be the case if the administration could only pledge to seek the lifting or modification of sanctions by congress after commitments are obtained from india or pakistan disadvantages although the clinton administration has been armed with the ability to negotiate the history of the legislation suggests strong mandate to invoke the waiver authority without regard to actions by india and pakistan both countries in fact thus far have declined to enter into quidpro quo discussions though both have indicated unilaterally that they do not intend to conduct more tests moreover india and pakistan have probably concluded that the waiver authority granted to the president under pl 105194 by congress was less aimed at reinforcing the administrations negotiating authority than desire to avoid harm to us agricultural exports and other interests congressional role this approach is current law until the end of fy 1999 the 106th congress will have to decide whether to extend the presidents waiver authority or allow it to lapse congress could also choose to expand the waiver authority to apply to arms exports and sensitive technology sales option 3 concentrate on getting pakistan to sign the ctbt first rationale and advantages this is more of tactical approach than an option but if successful it could create significant momentum towards the larger us objective of regional nonproliferation regime the option would build on the long standing special relations hip between the united states and pakistan which is grounded in the still valid 1959 mutual security treaty india would find itself in an awkward position if pakistan were to embrace the ctbt leading to intensified international pressure for following suit several factors suggest that pakistan might under the right circumstances sign the ctbt first pakistan appears to have less need than india to conduct further tests since it does not need to acquire thermonuclear capability second pakistan has been hurt more by the sanctions and existing economic problems and badly needs international assistance to avoid default on its current debts third as the weaker country pakistan has always sought an external patron to compensate for its inherent weaknesses visavis its larger rival realistically pakistan cannot expect to resurrect the close security relationship that it enjoyed during the afghan war era but greater us political and economic support and an implicit security guarantee might be enough to motivate the government of prime minister nawaz sharif to rethink its stancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98570crs35 103 see statement by karl f inderfurth assistant secretary of state for south asian affairs before the senate subcommittee on near east and south asia committee on foreign relations july 13 1998disadvantages this approach has several potential obstacles and disadvantages the pakistani government might well decide that domestic political considerations raise overwhelming obstacles to taking unilateral nonproliferation steps ahead of india regardl ess of the potential economic international economic and even security benefits india for its part may still shun signing the ctbt regardless of international opprobrium which would leave the treaty closer to coming into force on the other side of the equation should pakistan become too confident of its newly reestablished relationship with the united states it might become emboldened to take provocative steps regarding kashmir that would leave the region more unstable than at present congressional actions the congress and the administration appear to have worked closely in dealing with the changed nuclear proliferation landscape resulting from the indian and pakistani nuclear tests in testifying before the senate foreign relations committee on july 13 assistant secretary of state for south asian affairs karl f inderfurth request ed waiver authority for all sanctions currently in place against india and pakistan to be used only when the two countries make substantial progress on number of nuclear nonproliferation and other security objectives inderfurth noted that both the administration and the congress share desire to inject greater degree on consistency flexibility and effectiveness into the sanctions regimes against india and pakistan103 us business interests and the economic interests of farm communities were key to the swift passage of legislation that waived sanctions on agricultural export credits on july 14 president clinton signed into law the agriculture export relief act of 1998 pl 105194 which amends the arms export control act by exempting for one year food and other agricultural commodity purchases from nuclear nonproliferation sanctions under section 102b of that law submitted as s 2282 mcconnell on july 9 1998 the new legislation permitted
