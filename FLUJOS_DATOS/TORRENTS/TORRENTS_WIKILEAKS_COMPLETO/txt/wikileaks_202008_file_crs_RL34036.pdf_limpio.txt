division june 13 2008 abstract two ongoing federal programs that support the price and income received by dairy farmers the dairy price support program and the milk income loss contract milc program were reauthorized with modiﬁcations in the food conservation and energy act of 2008 pl 110234 the 2008 farm bill the milc program allows participating dairy farmers to receive government payment when the farm price of milk used for ﬂuid consumption falls below an established target price the enacted 2008 farm bill extends the milc program through fy2012 at the existing level of support but increases the payment percentage rate and the amount of eligible production the target price also can be increased in any month that feed costs are above certain threshold the milc program is supported by milk producer groups in the northeast and the upper midwest large farmers particularly in the west contend that the program payment limit is biased against them market prices for farm milk have been substantially above the target price for more than year precluding the need for milc paymentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34036g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and committees of congress g561

price and income received by dairy farmersthe dairy price support program and the milk income loss contract milc programwere reauthorized with modifications in the food conservation and energy act of 2008 pl 110 246 the 2008 farm bill the milc program allows participating dairy farm ers to receive government payment when the farm price of milk used for fluid consumption falls below an established target price the enacted 2008 farm bill extends the milc program through fy2012 at the existing level of support but increases the payment percentage rate and the amount of eligible production the target price also can be increased in any month that feed costs are above certain threshold the milc program is supported by milk producer groups in the northeast and the upper midwest large farmers particularly in the west contend that the program payment limit is biased against them market prices for farm milk have recently declined to levels near the target price increasing the likelihood of milc payments in 2009 separately under previous farm law the dairy price support program indirectly supported the farm price of milk at 990 per hundredweight c wt through government purchases of surplus dairy products from dairy processors the 2008 farm bill extends the dairy support program through december 31 2012 but modifies the program so that it directly supports the prices of dairy products at mandated levels this program shift was designed to help reduce the programs exposure under world trade organization limitations most dairy farm groups and the administration view the program as necessary safety net in market that is frequently characterized by volatile prices dairy processors consider the price support and milc programs to operate at crosspurposes which they say contributes to surplus milk production recent milk product price decline has resulted in government purchases of nonfat dry milk third federal dairy pricing policy tool federal milk marketing orders requires dairy processors in many regions to pay minimum price for farm milk depending on its end use federal orders are permanently authorized and most changes are made administratively by usda through the rulemaking process however number of federal order issues were brought to the attention of congress for the farm bill debate included in the final bill is provision that exempts dairy processors from paying the federal minimum price whenever they forward contract prices with dairy farmers for milk used in manufactured products separately the enacted 2008 farm bill reauthorizes the dairy export incentive program which subsidizes dairy product exports the program was created in the 1985 farm bill and was particularly active during the 1990s the enacted 2008 farm bill also contains provision that allows usda to implement 2002 farm billmandated assessment on imported dairy products but reduces the import assessment to 75 cents per cwt the import assessment is supported by most milk producer groups but opposed by dairy importers and processors see the appendix at the end of this report for sidebyside comparison of the enacted 2008 farm bill dairy provisions with

act of 2008 pl 110246 the 2008 farm bill is the most recent omnibus farm bill authorizing or reauthorizing wide range of programs for multiyear period including commodity price and income support farm credit agricultural conservation research rural development and foreign and domestic food programs among others the 2008 farm bill became law on june 18 2008 after the house and senate successfully voted to override veto of the measure subtitle of the commodity programs title title i of the enacted 2008 farm bill contains the authority for two major ongoing dairy policy tools used by the us department of agriculture usda to support the prices and incomes received by dairy farmersthe dairy price support program dpsp and the milk income loss contract milc program previous authority for these programs was governed by the 2002 farm bill pl 107171 through 2007 and extended into 2008 by the enactment of various shortterm farm bill extensions as part of more than one year of hearings and debate on the omnibus farm bill congress considered whether to reauthorize these two programs in their current forms or with modifications pl 110246 reauthorizes the milc program through september 30 2012 and the dpsp through december 31 2012 with several modifications as discussed in this report the dpsp provides indirect price support to dairy farmers through government purchases of surplus dairy products at statutory prices the milc program supports fa rmer income through direct payments to participating dairy farmers when the market price of farm milk in any month falls below legislatively mandated target price third federal dairy policy tool federal milk marketing orders requires dairy processors to pay minimum price for farm milk depending on its end use federal orders are permanently authorized and hence do not require periodic reauthorization instead changes are generally made administratively by usda and approved by farmer referendum however issues such as the proposed authority for processors to be exempt from federal order minimum prices processors when they forward contract with dairy farmers were brought to the attention of congress in the farm bill debate pl 110246 authorizes forward contract program through september 30 2012 and contains safeguards designed to ensu re that dairy farmers are not compelled by processors to participate in the program the 2008 farm bill also authorizes commission to review and evaluate federal milk marketing order policies and procedures separately the 2008 farm bill reauthorizes the dairy export incentive program it also requires alaska hawaii and puerto rico to contribute to an ongoing dairy promotion program that is currently supported by mandatory assessments on dairy producers in the 48 contiguous states this provision was included to allow usda to implement 2002 farm billmandated extension of this assessment to imported dairy products this provision was supported by most milk producer groups but opposed by dairy importers and processors see the appendix at the end of this report for sidebyside comparison of the enacted 2008 farm bill with previous law and the house and senate farm bill

g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 in fy1999fy2001 congress provided just over 325 billion in emergency spending for us department of agriculture usda farm commod ity support programs primarily to help farmers recover from low farm commodity prices the majority of these funds were for supplemental direct farm payments made to producers of certain supported farm commodities including milk of this amount dairy farmers received total supplemental market loss payments of 1 billion over three years some dairy farmer groups sought permanent direct payment program for dairy farmers to be included in the 2002 farm bill as means of supplementing dairy farm income when farm milk prices are low prior to these emergency payments dairy farmers generally were not recipients of direct government payments however some groups contended that farm milk prices had been volatile in recent years and that dairy farmers needed more income stability separately the northeast dairy compact which provided price premiums to new england dairy farmers when market prices fell below certain level expired on september 30 2001 these premiums were funded by assessments on fluid milk processors whenever fluid farm milk prices in the region fell below 1694 per hundredweight cwt supporters of the northeast compact had sought for an extension of the compact the southeastern states were seeking new authority to create separate compact however dairy processors and upper midwest producers strongly opposed regional compacts in response the farm security and rural investment act of 2002 pl 107171 the 2002 farm bill authorized new countercyclical national dairy market loss payment program upon implementation usda dubbed the program the milk income loss contract milc program this program was created as an alternative to regional dairy compacts and adhoc emergency payments to farmers by authorizing additional federal payments when farm milk prices fall below an established target price authority for the milc program originally expired on september 30 2005 as required by the 2002 farm bill however several subsequent measures granted shortterm extensions of the milc program and many other expiring farm bill authorities to allow congress to complete work on the 2008 farm bill

milc program participating dairy farmers nationwide were eligible for federal payment whenever the minimum monthly market price for farm milk used for fluid consumption class i in boston fell below 1694 per hundredweight cwt 1 eligible farmers then received payment equal to 34 of the difference between the 1694 target price and the lower mont hly market price the 2002 law required that payments be limited to the first 24 million pounds of annual milk production per dairy operation which is roughly equivalent to the total annual production of 130cow operation 1 hundredweight or one hundred pounds of milk is roughly equivalent to 116 gallons of milk httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34036g6g138g146g155g162g561g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g138g151 g141g561g157g145g142g561 g344g342 g342g350g561

extends the authority for the milc program until september 30 2012 and retains the base target price at 1694 per cwt however the 2008 farm bill makes significant changes to the lc payment structure in the following ways payment percentage rate increased until september 30 2008 dairy producer continued to receive payment equal to 34 of the difference between the 1694 per cwt target price and the market price in any month that the boston market price fell below 1694 however from october 1 2008 through august 31 2012 the 2008 farm bill raises the payment rate to 45 of the price deficiency which results in onethird larger payment to eligible farmers in months when payment is triggered the payment percentage rate will revert to the 34 level for the final month of the program september 2012 this reversion was included to minimize longterm budget outlays so that the cost of increasing the percentage payment rate does not get built into the baseline budget once the program expires production payment limit increased the 2008 farm bill maintained the payment quantity limit at 24 million pounds through september 30 2008 and then raised the payment limit to 2985 million pounds of annual production equivalent to about 160cow operation between october 1 2008 and august 31 2012 like the increase in the percentage payment rate the eligible production limit will revert to its original level 24 million lbs for the last month of program authority september 2012 so that the budget baseline for future years does not include the cost of the increase since the inception of the milc program large dairy farm operators expressed concern that the 24 million lb payment limit negatively affected their income for larger farm operations their annual production is well in excess of the limit and any production in excess of that receives federal payments an increase was not part of the housepassed version of the bill and the final level of 2985 million lbs is below the senatepassed level of 415 million lbs payment level feedprice adjustment because of the rapidly rising cost of feed some dairy farm groups had sought some type of adjustment to federal dairy support programs to soften the impact the final 2008 farm bill includes provision that adjusts upward the 1694 target price in any month when feed prices are above certain threshold the law requires usda to calculate monthly national average dairy feed ration cost based on formula that usda currently uses to calculate feed costs in any month that the average feed cost is above 735 per cwt the 1694 target price will be increased by 45 of the difference between the monthly feed cost and 735 to reduce budget exposure the threshold feed cost will rise to 950 per cwt effective for the last month of the program september 2012 g5g4g17g561g5g152g156g157g561g7g156g157g146g150g138g157g142g156g561 in 2008 the congressional budget office cbo timated that the increase in the percentage payment rate to 45 the increase in the payment limit to 2985 million lbs of annual production and the institution of new feed cost adjuster would together add 395 million to the cost of the milc program over the

cbo baseline which was the official benchmark for the scoring of the 2008 farm bill when scored against the more recent cbo baseline january 2009 the increased costs associated with changes in the milc program are in fact more than offset by lower overall program costs associated with higher projected milk prices through fy2012 even after incorporating the effect of the recent decline in milk prices g3g141g150g146g151g146g156g157g155g138g157g146g152g151g561g138g151g141g561g11g151g141g158g156g157g155g162g561g18g152g156g146g157g146g152g151g156g561 during the farm bill debate the bush administration supported continuation of milc payments at the thencurrent target price of 1694 per cw t and the 24 million lb payment cap however in order to defray the cost of milc program extension the administration recommended that the percentage payment rate be gradually reduced over fiveyear period to 20 by fy2013 the administration also wanted to base payments on historical production rather than current production in order to forestall potential challenges in the world trade organization wto the national milk producers federation nmpf the largest trade association representing dairy farmer cooperatives also supported direct payment program for farmers in order to make the program less susceptible to challenges in the wto nmpf initially proposed making direct payments of 050 per cwt to dairy farmers regardless of the level of market prices on the average production level of 2005 and 2006 up to 40000 per farm the international dairy foods association idfa the largest trade association of dairy processors opposed extension of the milc program contending that it works at cross purposes with the dairy price support program and contributes to the overproduction of milk and to high government costs instead idfa proposed dairy farm revenue insurance program that it said would provide better safety net for farmers without distorting milk markets

accepting applications for the original milc program on august 15 2002 see table 1 for milc payment history in september 2007 farm milk prices set record high as the class i boston farm milk price reached 2516 per cwt which is 922 above the 1694 per cwt target price for the latter half of 2007 and all of 2008 farm milk prices remained well above the milc trigger price precluding the need for any milc payments falling milk prices in recent months however have raised the likelihood of milc payments in 2009 while the class i boston farm milk price for january 2009 is 1899 per cwt or 205 per cwt above the trigger excluding any feed cost adjustment many dairy economists are projecting that farm milk prices will decline to the point that the milc payments will be triggered for the balance of 2009 individual producers must select which month to begin receiving payments based on their projection of potential payment rates and the possibility of hitting the production payment limit usda issued final rule on december 4 2008 amending the regulations for the previous milc program to change the payment rate formula and production limit and include the feed cost adjustment 73 federal

dairy price support program dpsp by permanently requiring usda to support the farm price of milk since 1949 congress has regularly amended the program usually in the context of multiyear omnibus farm acts and budget reconciliation acts see table 3 for recent history of spending on the dairy price support program and related activities section 1501 of the farm security and rural investment act of 2002 pl 107171 the omnibus 2002 farm bill authorized 5½year extension of the program through december 31 2007 at the thencurrent support price of 990 per hundredweight cwt of farm milk several measures were enacted to provide shortterm extensions of many expiring usda programs including the dpsp so that congress could complete work on new farm bill historically the supported farm price for milk is intended to protect farmers from price declines that might force them out of business and to protect consumers from seasonal imbalances of supply and demand usdas commodity credit corporation ccc supports milk prices by its standing offer to purchase surplus nonfat dry milk cheese and butter from dairy processors government purchases of these storable dairy products indirectly support the price of milk for all dairy farmers under the 2002 farm bill prices paid to the processors were set administratively by usda at level that would permit them to pay dairy farmers at least the federal

price of 990 per cwt of milk specified in the 2002 farm bill usda had standing offer to processors to purchase surplus manufactured dairy products at the following prices which were administratively established by usda 105 per pound for butter 080 for nonfat dry milk 113 per pound for block cheddar and 110 per pound for barrel cheese whenever market prices fell to the support level processors generally made the business decision of selling surplus product to the government rather than to the marketplace consequently the government purchase prices usually served as floor for the market price which in turn indirectly supported the farm price of milk at 990 per cwt government purchases of surplus dairy products have been relatively small since late 2003 as market prices have remained above the support price in the early 1980s the support price was 1310 per cwt and government purchases peaked at 26 billion in 1983 gradual decline in the support price to 990 significantly reduced the cost of the program from peak levels in late 2008 and early 2009 after several years of relative inactivity the price support program resumed purchases following decline in milk product prices usda estimated that it removed 115 million pounds of nonfat dry milk in 2008 and expects to remove 320 million pounds in 2009 along with small amounts of cheese and butter

extends the dairy support program for five years through december 31 2012 but modifies the program so that it directly supports the prices of manufactured dairy products at mandated levels the 2008 farm bill renames the program the dairy product price support program nd requires usda to purchase products at the following minimum prices block cheese 113lb barrel cheese 110lb butter 105lb and nonfat dry milk 080lb 2 under previous law the support price for farm milk was statutorily set at 990 per cwt and usda was given the administrative authority to establish combination of dairy product purchase prices that indirectly supported the farm price of milk at 990 although the 2008 law does not specifically state that the overall support price is 990 per cwt each of the mandated product prices in the law is equivalent to the existing product purchase prices so farm milk prices effectively continue to be supported at 990 the shift to mandated product price support program was based on proposal submitted by the national milk producers federation nmpf which contended that the previous discretion given to usda to establish purchase prices has undermined the programs effectiveness 3 nmpf also contends that shift to dairy product price support program would be viewed as less trade distorting in the wto than the previous support program see wto implications below in order to minimize program costs and the potential accumulation of excess inventories the 2008 farm bill allows usda to temporarily reduce the mandated prices when government purchases of product exceed certain specified level the law allows usda to reduce 1 the cheese purchase price by up to 010 per lb when government purchases for consecutive 12 2 usda formally announced these prices in farm service agency

bill proposal the bush administration supported the extension of the dairy price support program viewing it as lowcost stabilizing influence on farm milk prices it stated that many dairy producers see the need for floor to be kept under farm milk prices to maintain an adequate milk supply and provide safety net dairy processor groups have expressed concern that the dairy price support program in combinat ion with milc payments work at crosspurposes by artificially stimulating milk production and causing persistent surpluses they also question whether having the government as guaranteed buyer of surplus products discourages investment to produce dairy ingredients eg milk protein concentrates that are increasingly in demand in the market

obligations in the world trade organization wto modifications to dairy support might be required under new trade agreement although federal outlays for the dairy price support program have been relatively small under 100 million in recent years see table 3 the wto measures the level of support differently under current us trade obligations the aggregate measure of support for dairy is based on how much higher the domestic support price is set above fixed world reference price established in the wto at fixed level of 725 per cwt the imputed subsidy of 265 per cwt ie the 990 domestic support price less the 725 reference price is applied to all domestic milk production using this formula the united states has notified the wto that the aggregate measure of support for the dairy price support program is more than 48 billion annually and it is classified as amber box or the most tradedistorting category the current us proposal in the doha round is to reduce its total amber box support from the current 191 billion to 76 billion with dairy support representing such large percentage of the proposed new maximum some have expressed interest in shifting future policy away from price support to some type of wto compliant direct payment that is decoupled from price and production supporters of the shift to dairy product price support program maintain that under the revised program only the portion of milk production that goes into the production of the supported products would have to be notified to the wto and that fluiduse milk and milk used for unsupported manufactured products such as yogurt and ice cream would be exempt g344g342g342g350g561g8g138g155g150g561g4g146g149g149g561g11g150g153g149g142g150g142g151g157g138g157g146g152g151g561 with product

approximately twothirds of the nations fluid milk is regulated under federal milk marketing orders federal orders which are administered by the us department of agriculture usda were instituted in the 1930 s to promote orderly marketing conditions by among other things applying uniform system of classified pricing throughout the market some states california for example have their own st ate milk marketing regulations instead of federal rules producers delivering milk to federal marketing order areas are affected by two fundamental marketing order provisions the classified pricing of milk according to its end use and the pooling of receipts to pay all farmers blend price federal orders regulate dairy handlers processors who sell milk or milk products within defined marketing area by requiring them to pay not less than established minimum class prices for the grade milk they purchase from dairy producers depending on how the milk is used this classified pricing system requires handlers to pay higher price for milk used for fluid consumption class i than for milk used in manufactured dairy products such as yogurt ice cream and sour cream class ii products cheese class iii and butter and dry milk products class iv products these differences between cla sses reflect the different market values for the products blend pricing allows all dairy farmers who ship to the market to pool their milk receipts and then be paid single price for all milk based on orderwide usage weighted average of the four usage classes paying all farmers single blend price is seen as an equitable way of sharing revenues for identical raw milk directed to both the highervalued fluid market and the lower valued manufacturing market manufactured class class ii iii and iv prices are the same in all orders nationwide and are calculated monthly by usda based on current market conditions for manufactured dairy products the class i price for milk used for flui d consumption varies from area to area class i prices are determined by adding to monthly base price class i differential that generally rises with the geographical distance from m ilk surplus regions in the upper midwest the southwest and the west class i differential pric ing is mechanism designed to ensure adequate supplies of milk for fluid use at consumption centers the supply of milk may come from local supplies or distant supplies whichever is more efficient however local dairy farmers are protected by the minimum price rule against lowerpriced milk that might otherwise be hauled into their region proponents of federal orders argue that orders are necessary because dairy farmers have competitive disadvantage visàvis dairy handl ers processors when it comes to determining prices that farmers receive for their raw perishable milk critics contend that federal orders are arcane and outdated and that the complexity of the system places dairy processors at competitive disadvantage in the market

buyer at some point in the future at mutually agreed to price dairy farmer and proprietary milk handler4 theoretically can engage in forward contract whereby the farmer would deliver milk to the processor at an agreed to price and future date of delivery however prior to enactment of the 2008 farm bill if the monthly federal milk marketing order minimum price was above the forward contract price the handler was still required to pay at least the federal order price for the milk proprietary handlers therefore had little incentive to enter into forward contracts since they were prohibited from paying price less than the federal milk marketing order minimum price pilot dairy fo rward pricing program was authorized by the fy2000 omnibus appropriations act which usda implemented from mid2000 until its required expiration date of december 31 2004 5

enacted 2008 farm bill authorizes dairy forward pricing program that is to be administered in similar manner as the temporary pilot program in 20002004 like the original pilot program the forward pricing program allows dairy farmers and cooperatives to voluntarily enter into forward contracts with milk handlers any payments made by milk handlers under the contract will be deemed to satisfy the minimum price requirements of federal milk marketing orders the program applies only to milk purchased for manufactured products classes ii iii and iv and therefore does not include milk purchased for fluid consumption class i the provision allows new contracts to be entered into until september 30 2012 but contract can extend beyond september 30 2015 usda issued final rule for the dairy forward pricing program on october 31 2008 73 federal register 6486864872 dairy processor groups primarily the international dairy foods association sought this provision so that proprietary handlers could be exempt from the minimum pricing requirements of federal orders when they enter into forward contract with dairy farmers proponents contend that proprietary handlers should have the same ability to forward contract as dairy cooperatives under current law dairy cooperatives are exempt from having to pay the federal order minimum prices to its members they also maintain that forward pricing is an effective risk management tool for both farmers and processors allowing them to insulate themselves from the volatility of farm milk prices critics including the national milk producers federation were concerned that handlers might compel small farmers to participate in contract and possibly use the contract as means of undermining the federal order pricing system 4 proprietary handler is milk processing company that is owned privately or publicly by investors other than milk producers this structure differs from cooperative which is owned and operated by its farmer members 5 for more

milk income loss contract program federal milk marketing orders are permanently authorized and therefore do not require periodic reauthorization by congress instead changes to federal milk marketing orders are handled administratively by usdas agricultural marketing service the au thorizing statute for federal milk marketing orders requires usda to use formal rulemaking procedures to make changes to orders any interested party can petition usda to create new order or amend an existing one the terms of new or amended order are developed through publ ic participation producers processors and consumers in hearings held by usda prior to the issuance of the order usda analyzes the hearing records and then recommends the terms nd provisions of milk marketing orders if two thirds of the voting producers approve new or an amended marketing order the secretary then approves and issues the order some dairy producer groups have expressed concern that this rulemaking procedure can take many months and sometimes years to reach conclusion and that the process needs to be streamlined usda admits that the process is time consuming but counters that it provides for maximum industry participation and transparency the international dairy foods association idfa contends that the rulemaking process prevents dairy farmers and processors from competing with other food and beverage industries that are not faced with government intervention idfa considers federal milk marketing orders to be outdated and unresponsive to market forces and proposed that congress tablish blue ribbon
