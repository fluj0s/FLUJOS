specialist in social policy domestic social policy division temporary assistance for needy families tanf issues for the 110th congress summary enactment of the deficit reduction act of 2005 dra pl 109171 ended more than four years of congressional debate on reauthorizing the block grant of temporary assistance for needy families tanf the dra extended funding for most tanf grants through fy2010 except tanf supplemental grants that expire at the end of this year fy2008 supplemental grants go to 17 states that have high population growth or low historic funding in tanfs predecessor programs per poor person hr 6331 medicare bill enacted over president bushs veto on july 15 2008 extends supplemental grants for one year through fy2009 tanf is best known as the funding source for welfare benefits for lowincome families with children in 2006 19 million families per month received tanf cash welfare down from the historical high of five million families receiving cash welfare in the mid1990s in 2006 less than three in ten poor children were in families that received tanf cash welfare however tanf funds wide range of nonwelfare benefits and services for needy families with children in fy2006 spending on activities related to traditional cash welfare accounted for little more than half of total tanf funding while other nonwelfare activities accounted for the remainder though cash welfare is shrinking part of what tanf funds many of the issues congress might consider in the 110th congress beside supplemental grants focus on families receiving cash welfare particularly the work participation standards that apply to these families the dra made changes that require states to either increase participation among families receiving cash welfare in work or job preparation activities or reduce their welfare caseloads to meet these numerical performance standards the dra also required the department of health and human services hhs to issue rules regulations defining what specific activities count toward the participation standards hhs final regulations published on february 5 2008 allow states to count participation in fouryear college degree program toward the participation standards and provide for limited counting of rehabilitative activities however the regulations also limit counting activities such as adult basic education abe pursuing general educational development ged credential and english as second language courses generally requiring them to be counted only in conjunction with activities more closely related to work in terms of nonwelfare spending from tanf congress might consider proposals left over from tanf reauthorization proposals but not included in dra to loosen some rules for nonwelfare spending congress might also consider improving the information available on how tanf funds are used for nonwelfare benefits and services since relatively little is known about this half of tanf funding additionally legislation that affects foster care child welfare services for abused and neglected children and child care funding would have an effect on tanf since large amounts of tanf nonwelfare dollars are

grant of temporary assistance for needy families tanf is best known as funding source for cash welfare for lowincome families with children however the block grant also funds wide range of benefits and services for economically disadvantaged families it also funds activities to help achieve the goals of reducing outofwedlock pregnancies and raising children in twoparent families tanf was created in the 1996 welfare reform law pl 104193 with the funding originally slated to expire at the end of fiscal year fy 2002 congress debated reauthorization of the block grant during the 107th through the 109th congresses1 comprehensive legislation to reauthorize and revise tanf did not pass during this period and the program operated on the basis of series of temporary extensions2 the deficit reduction act of 2005 dra pl 109171 included slimmed down version of welfare reauthorization that extended tanf funding through fy2010 though tanf supplemental grants discussed below were extended only through fy2008 revised the work requirements that apply to welfare recipients and established new funding for competitive grants to demonstrate initiatives to promote healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood decision on whether and how to extend tanf supplemental grants which go to 17 states in the south and west on the basis of low historic levels of welfare funding and high population growth beyond september 30 2008 is the only must do task related to tanf in the 110th congress however congress might examine 1 for discussion of the issues raised during the welfare reform debate see crs report rl33418 welfare reauthorization in the 109th congress an overview by gene falk melinda gish and carmen solomonfears this report discusses proposals that were included in comprehensive welfare reauthorization proposals considered by congress during 2002 to 2005 comprehensive welfare reauthorization proposals refers to bills that either passed the house or were reported from the senate finance committee these bills were hr 4737 in the 107th congress hr 4 in the 108th congress and the housepassed version of s 1932 in the 109th congress 2 for listing of the temporary extensions see crs report rl32760 the temporary assistance for needy families program responses to frequently asked questions by gene falk table a1 crs2 the impact of dras provisions related to tanf work participation standards for welfare recipients additionally in light of renewed interest in issues related to poverty and disadvantaged families with children interest might be raised in the flexibility states have to use tanf funds for wide range of nonwelfare activities use of the term welfare in this report this report makes distinction between welfare and nonwelfare spending within tanf the purpose of this distinction is to emphasize that tanf funds wide range of activities that go well beyond what is traditionally thought of as welfare and related administrative and work program costs in this report the nontechnical term tanf welfare is used to denote what is technically referred to within tanf as assistance tanfs implementing regulations define assistance as payments to families to meet ongoing basic needs such as food clothing shelter utilities household goods and other personal expenses this generally conforms to what most people call welfare there are broader uses of the term welfare which may include most benefits and services paid on the basis of financial need however in this report the term welfare is used in narrow sense nonwelfare is used to describe activities such as tanffunded work supports such as child care and transportation aid tanffunded refundable tax credits and tanf activities related to family formation issues in technical terms from tanfs implementing regulations these types of activities are given the label of nonassistance background and context tanf is the block grant created in the 1996 welfare reform law that replaced the new deal program of aid to families with dependent children afdc afdc provided monthly cash welfare benefits to needy families with children with most of these families headed by single mothers concerns that afdc helped create disadvantage by discouraging work and breaking up families dominated welfare reform debates from 1970 onward culminating in the 1996 welfare reform law3 some of the most visible policies of the 1996 welfare reform law are tanf work requirements for welfare recipients time limits on the receipt of welfare and the end of federal entitlement to welfare for needy families with children 3 large body of literature that attempted to empirically estimate the impact of welfare on work effort and family structure developed prior to the 1990s this literature is reviewed in moffitt robert incentive effects of the us welfare system journal of economic literature vol 20 1 march 1992 pp 161 the literature review concluded that the available empirical evidence at the time showed that welfare reduced labor supply work effort and weakly affected family structure however the magnitude of these effects indicated that the effect of welfare was not large enough to fully explain the trends in work effort for single mothers or family structure crs3 the monthly tanf cash welfare benefit like the monthly afdc benefit before it is determined by the states and benefit amounts vary widely among the states in january 2005 the monthly cash benefit in california was 723 for family of three4 the california benefit amount is high relative to many other states though even that benefit is only fraction 54 of povertylevel income in alabama family of three received 215 per month 16 of povertylevel income table 1 shows selected economic and social indicators for 1995 2000 and 2006 as shown the cash welfare caseload plummeted from nearly 5 million to 19 million families over this period most of that caseload decline occurred from 1995 to 2000 though recently the cash welfare caseload has fallen again the number of children in families receiving cash welfare fell from 91 million to 35 million from 1995 to 2006 work among single mothers who head most welfare families increased from 1995 to 2000 with some slippage in the 20002006 period however despite the decline in receipt of cash welfare and increase in work among single mothers improvements in other social and economic indicators have been less dramatic the child poverty rate did fall from 1995 to 2000 but the 2006 rate of 174 is higher than in 2000 there remained 128 million children living in families with incomes below the poverty threshold in 2006 further the percentage of babies born outofwedlock in 2006 was 389 an alltime high table 1 welfare receipt economic

district of columbia divided by the total number of poor persons under age 18 for the year 4 for more detail on cash welfare benefit amounts under tanf see crs report rl32760 the temporary assistance for needy families block grant responses to frequently asked questions by gene falk crs4 cash welfare reaches far fewer disadvantaged children than it did prior to welfare reform the ratio of the average monthly number of children in families receiving cash welfare to the total number of children in poverty declined from about six out of ten in 1995 to less than three out of ten in 2006 tanf is not just welfare program the 1996 law granted states permission to use funds for wide range of benefits services and activities to address some of the social and economic ills afflicting disadvantaged families with children states may use their funds in any manner reasonably calculated to further tanfs purpose which is to provide states with the flexibility to achieve four goals set in statute 1 provide assistance to needy families so that children may live in their own homes or in the homes of relatives 2 end dependence of needy parents on government benefits by promoting work job preparation and marriage 3 reduce the incidence of outofwedlock pregnancies and 4 promote the formation and maintenance of twoparent families given the fixed funding of the tanf block grant states are able to use the savings from the welfare caseload decline to fund other nonwelfare benefits services and activities total funding in the tanf system comprises both the federal block grant to states and states own funds spent to meet maintenance of effort moe requirement figure 1 shows the uses of tanf and moe funds in fy2006 it shows that the categories typically associated with traditional cash welfare program cash benefits administrative costs and work activities accounted for only little more than half of total tanf funds thus tanf has the potential to make an impact on disadvantaged families with children through both its nonwelfare benefits services and activities as well as its welfare component crs5 figure 1 uses of tanf and moe funds in fy2006 source figure

act ccdf means the child care and development fund the 109th congress the deficit reduction act enactment of the deficit reduction act of 2005 dra pl 109171 ended more than four years of congressional debate on reauthorizing the tanf block grant over the 2002 to 2005 period congress passed twelve temporary extensions of the program while more comprehensive reauthorization bills remained pending the dra included slimmed down version of reauthorization extending tanf funding and making some limited policy changes5 many of the policy changes 5 the dra was budget reconciliation bill budget reconciliation bill is considered on legislative fasttrack in the senate in that consideration is timelimited and cannot be delayed by filibuster senate rule known as the byrd rule after west virginia senator robert byrd provides that senator can raise point of order on reconciliation bill provision that makes policy change that has budgetary impact to overcome such continued crs6 proposed in the reauthorization bills considered from 2002 to 2005 were not included in the dra and some of those changes may be revived for legislation in the 110th congress additionally dras changes to the tanf work participation standards have met with some criticism that also might spur proposals in this congress this section provides brief summary of the dra provisions affecting tanf for more detail please see crs report rs22369 tanf child care marriage promotion and responsible fatherhood provisions of the deficit reduction act by gene falk extension of funding the dra extended most tanf funding through fy2010 however tanf supplemental grants discussed in some detail below were extended only through fy2008 therefore the 110th congress may consider whether to further extend these grants additionally the dra eliminated two tanf bonus funds the first bonus 200 million per year was for states that achieved high performance on measures relating to achieving tanf goals the second 100 million per year was for states that reduced outofwedlock birth ratios without increasing abortions work participation standards and verifying work participation the 1996 welfare reform law established work participation standards for states welfare caseload states that fail these participation standards could be financially penalized by reduction in their block grants the tanf work participation standards are numerical standards computed in the aggregate for states cash welfare caseload the participation standards are 50 for all families and 90 for the twoparent portion of its cash welfare caseload these standards may be met either by engaging welfare adult and teen parents in specified work and job preparation activities or through reductions in the tanf cash welfare caseload revision to the caseload reduction credit the 1996 welfare reform law provided states with credit for caseload reduction that occurred from fy1995 the caseload reduction credit provided state with one percentage point reduction in its participation standards for each percent decline in its tanf cash welfare caseload from fy1995 the large caseload declines that occurred subsequent to 5 continued point of order 60 votes are needed or the provision is stricken from the bill many provisions in the comprehensive welfare reauthorization bills that changed policy but had estimated budgetary impact were not included in the final version of the dra for more information on the byrd rule see crs report rl30862 the budget reconciliation process the senates byrd rule by robert keith crs7 fy1995 meant that most states had large reductions in the standards they were required to meet for many states the effective after credit participation standard was reduced to 0 the dra revised the caseload reduction credit so that states will receive credit only for future welfare caseload reduction beginning in fy2007 states receive credit for caseload reductions measured from fy2005 forward the effect of this change is much smaller caseload reduction credits for fy2007 and higher effective after credit participation standards like the prior law caseload reduction credit states are not given credit for caseload declines estimated to come from policy changes that restrict eligibility for welfare benefits counting families in separate state programs under the 1996 welfare reform law states could provide welfare to families using state moe funds and not count those families when determining whether the state met its work participation standard states could designate families receiving welfare from moe funds as being assisted by separate state programs outside of the tanf program this effectively exempted the family from tanfs work participation standards the most common use of separate state programs was to house states twoparent welfare caseload and avoid the 90 participation standard but states also used separate state programs for other populations such as college students and the disabled the dra requires beginning in fy2007 that states count families receiving cash welfare in separate state programs when determining work participation rates this effectively ends the exemption from tanf work participation standards for families placed in separate state programs definitions of work activities and work verification before the dra the operational details of state work programs were generally left to the states federal law lists 12 categories of activities that count toward the participation standards but regulations promulgated during the clinton administration from the department of health and human services hhs explicitly allowed states to define the specific activities counted in these categories hhs also left to states how work participation would be verified ie how to determine whether recipient scheduled to be in an activity actually performed that activity the government accountability office gao in 2005 report found that the lack of further definition for what counts as work led to widerange of state practices particularly with respect to education and rehabilitative activities6 gao concluded that this led to an inconsistent measurement of work across states and recommended that hhs regulate what counts as work the dra required hhs to issue regulations providing consistent definition of work activities and describing procedures for states to verify work activity these regulations were issued in interim form on june 29 2006 then revised and published in final form on february 6 us government accountability office welfare reform hhs should exercise oversight to help ensure tanf work participation is measured consistently across states gao05 821 august 2005 crs8 8 2008 the major issues raised by those regulations are discussed below see what activities count toward the participation standards section later in this report7 promoting healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood initiatives the dra established within tanf new competitive grants totaling 150 million per year for research and demonstration projects to promote healthy marriages and responsible fatherhood the marriage promotion grants are generally for nonwelfare services and not necessarily restricted to lowincome families such as advertising campaigns education in high schools on the value of marriage and education in social skills the responsible fatherhood grants attempt to reach noncustodial parents with education in social skills as well as job training legislative issues in the 110th congress related to tanf funding the dra extended the bulk of federal tanf and moe funding through fy2010 however dra continued supplemental grants only through fy2008 making decision on their extension beyond then the business of the 110th congress unless congress acts to extend supplemental grants the fy2009 tanf grant awards beginning october 1 2008 would be reduced for the 17 states that receive supplemental grants in light of the potential for an economic slump 110th congress might also review tanfs contingency provisions for financing unanticipated spending increases because of recession supplemental grants the bulk of federal funding for tanf is in fixed basic block grant with its amount determined by the amount of funding state received under pre1996 welfare and related programs all state funding under the tanf moe is also determined by the historical level of welfare spending by the state each states basic grant and moe levels has been frozen since fy1997 it is neither adjusted for inflation nor for changing circumstances population or tanf cash welfare caseload thus tanf funding rules have effectively locked in historical levels of funding which reflected the pre1996 welfare policies of states during the welfare reform debate of the mid1990s concerns were raised that the fixed funding based on historical spending patterns disadvantaged two sets of states 1 those that paid relatively low welfare benefits and consequently had low federal grants relative to poverty in the state and 2 high population growth states 7 for detailed discussion of the differences between the interim and final regulations see crs memorandum tanf work participation regulations by gene falk available upon request crs9 the supplemental grants were added to tanf to target additional funds to such states seventeen states qualify for supplemental grants from fy1998 through fy2001 supplemental grants grew each year until they reached 319 million they have been frozen at that level since the dra extended supplemental grants at 319 million per year until the end of fy2008 table 2 shows the 17 states that receive supplemental grants and the grant amount the table shows the amount of tanf funding each of these states would lose if congress does not extend supplemental grants beyond fy2008 table 2 tanf supplemental grants in millions supplemental state grant alabama

tennessee 21565 texas 52708 utah 8704 totals 319450 source congressional research service crs based on data from the us department of health and human services hhs supplemental grants at 319 million per year have only small impact on the pattern of welfare funding relative to the number of poor children in state appendix table a1 ranks states by tanf and moe funding per poor child per year total basic block grant plus moe funding per poor child per year ranges from low of 480 in arkansas to high of over 5000 in hawaii supplemental grants bring up funding for some states with low funding per poor child for example the 480 in basic funding per poor child per year in arkansas is 23 of the national average the arkansas supplemental grant adds 38 per year per poor child raising its funding to 518 per year per poor child the 518 is 25 of the national average additionally not all states with low levels of funding per poor child receive crs10 supplemental grants some were excluded because their population growth was less than the national average oneyear extension of supplemental grants through fy2009 is included in hr 6331 medicare bill president bush vetoed the bill because of certain medicare provisions but congress overrode the veto on july 15 2008 extension of supplemental grants through fy2010 when other tanf grants expire will require further action by congress earlier in 2008 senator rockefeller introduced s 2820 which would both extend and expand supplemental grants s 2820 would fund supplemental grants through fy2010 and provide additional grants for all states with below average total federal and state tanf resources per poor child tanf recession funds tanfs fixed block grant led to concerns that funding might be insufficient in the event of recession therefore the 1996 welfare reform law included three provisions intended to allow states to supplement their annual block grant in the case of recession state may reserve or save funds during periods of economic growth to be used to pay for any increased costs associated with recession draw from contingency fund if it meets criteria of economic need expends extra state funds to reach level of 100 of fy1994 state spending and also expends extra state funds to match federal contingency funds and obtain interestbearing loans from the federal government that would have to be repaid tanf was only tested by one recession the relatively shallow 2001 recession however during and after that recession employment among single mothers slumped some and child poverty increased on national level the cash welfare caseload did not respond as it remained relatively constant during the period 2001 to 2004 when child poverty increased reserve funds unspent tanf funds have sometimes been seen not as reserves to save in the case of recession but as an indicator of lack of need the bush administrations 2002 welfare reauthorization proposal and all except one of the comprehensive reauthorization bills considered during 20022005 allowed states to designate either some or all of their unspent monies as contingency reserve funds tanf contingency fund state drew funds from the tanf contingency fund during or immediately after the 2001 recession there were two major reasons states failed to draw down contingency funds during recession first states would have had to increase spending from their own funds before they could qualify for the first matching contingency dollar second many states failed to meet the criteria of economic need based on high and increasing unemployment rates and food stamp caseloads during the recession crs11 ironically few states drew upon contingency funds in 2005 and 20068 well after the 2001 recession had ended they qualified based on high food stamp caseloads the 1996 law provided that state would be considered economically needy for contingency funds if states food stamp caseload was 10 higher than its adjusted caseload during the corresponding period in fy1994 or fy1995 fy1994 and fy1995 are adjusted downward for immigrants made ineligible for food stamps by the 1996 welfare reform law food stamp caseloads unlike cash welfare caseloads did increase with the 2001 recession and have remained historically high the food stamp contingency fund trigger is also expressed in terms of number of participants rather than rate of receipt in state population growth over the 12 or 13year period means that the number of participants in state can be higher than in the base years even if the rate at which people in the state receive food stamps declined the 2002 bush administration welfare reauthorization proposal and all comprehensive reauthorization bills considered during the 20022005 period would have made some changes to the contingency fund reauthorization proposals emanating from the senate finance committee would have made more farreaching changes to the contingency fund they would have eliminated matching requirements and made the unemployment and food stamp criteria for qualifying for contingency funds more sensitive to recent economic changes tanf loan fund tanf includes loan fund so that states running short of tanf grants could borrow funds from the federal government these loans would have to be repaid with interest aside from loans to states affected by hurricane katrina that were forgiven state has drawn loan from the fund the bush administrations 2002 welfare reauthorization proposal and all comprehensive reauthorization proposals considered during 20022005 would have eliminated the loan fund however dra extended the tanf loan fund through fy2010 potential legislative issues for the 110th congress related to families receiving welfare though welfare now accounts for only little more than half of all tanf and moe funding most issues the 110th congress might consider other than financing issues relate to families receiving welfare specifically these issues relate to the laws requirement that specified percentage of cash welfare families in each state participate in work or related activities dras changes to the caseload reduction credit require states to either 1 raise the share of families on the welfare roles working or engaged in job preparation activities or 2 reduce the cash welfare caseload although much attention has been paid to the required increase in participation standards and the impact of drarequired regulations specifying the operational details of state work programs the cash welfare caseload has been 8 this is in addition to funds drawn from the contingency fund in fy2005 and fy2006 to aid evacuee victims of hurricane katrina under pl 10968 crs12 declining at an accelerating rate over the most recent 12month period for which data are available the tanfmoe cash welfare caseload declined by 10 meeting tanf work participation standards the change in the caseload reduction credit beginning in fy2007 providing credit only for caseload reduction from fy2005 means that many states had to either quickly raise participation in activities or reduce their caseloads to meet tanfs work participation standards simultaneously states had to adjust to new rules in the form of regulations from hhs required by the dra for what specific activities count toward the participation standards and how participation is supervised and verified however couple of points might help put issues regarding tanf work participation standards in perspective first although the tanf work participation standard rules undoubtedly influence the design of state work requirements states themselves still determine the requirements that apply to individuals states are free to determine that some families may be exempt from participating and can determine that some individuals in these families may participate in activities that are not countable toward the federal standards second these tanf work participation rules affect relatively small number of families each month as discussed above while cash welfare caseloads have declined markedly within the cash welfare caseload the number of families with an adult recipient who is not employed has declined even faster families with non employed adult recipient have been the focus of most welfaretowork efforts figure 2 shows the composition of the cash welfare caseload in fy2006 childonly cases are families receiving cash welfare where the adults caring for the children are not receiving benefits on their own behalf they comprised 43 of all cash welfare families in fy2006 totaling about 830000 families per month these families have been excluded from tanfs work participation standards additionally about 8 of families were singleparent families caring for an infant 153000 families per month who may be exempted and excluded from work participation standards an additional 13 of all cash welfare families 259000 already had an employed member therefore the focus of much of the work rules is the remaining 36 of families 713000 families per month with an adult recipient who is not employed this is not to say that tanf work rules are unimportant tanf cash welfare is received by the most disadvantaged of poor families with children and policymakers remain concerned about finding effective strategies to help adults in these families move from welfare to selfsufficiency as indicated above the rules are likely to influence state policies concerning how this very disadvantaged group is served crs13 figure 2 tanf cash welfare families fy2006 source congressional research service crs analysis of the fy2006 tanf national data files note childonly families with an adult subject to sanction are considered other families with an adult for the purposes of this chart effective tanf participation standard with the revised caseload reduction credit fy2006 was the last year states received credit for caseload reduction from fy1995 in that year the caseload reduction credit reduced the statutory 50 tanf work participation standard to below 20 in 47 states among them 0 in 19 states beginning in fy2007 states are given credit only for caseload reduction from fy2005 based on caseload data for fy2005 through fy2006 most states are likely to receive caseload reduction credit against their fy2007 participation standard the national average decline for fy2005 to fy2006 in the cash welfare caseload was 6 actual caseload reduction credits might be higher or lower states are not given credit for caseload reduction that results from restricting eligibility but might get additional credit if the state is aiding cases using state dollars in excess of the tanf moe9 assuming that the average state receives credit equal to the caseload decline the national average effective allfamily participation standard would be 44 for fy2007 the twoparent standard is discussed below this is substantially 9 under existing regulations for purposes of the caseload reduction credit the fy2006 caseload may be reduced prorata for states that spend more of their own funds toward the tanf moe that is the state only needs to count the caseload that is aided by required state spending under the tanf moe crs14 higher than the national average participation rate states officially achieved in fy2006 of 32 see appendix table a2 for fy2006 official work participation rates by state states that fail to meet tanf work participation standards may be penalized by up to 5 reduction in their block grant for the first year of noncompliance though the penalty is reduced by the degree of noncompliance penalties increase for each subsequent year that state fails to meet the standards however states can either avoid or delay the penalty for failing to meet the fy2007 participation standard by either entering into corrective compliance plan or claiming reasonable cause hhs has already publically announced that it would consider requests to avoid the penalty based on reasonable cause if states legislature had not met in time to enact program changes needed to meet the fy2007 requirement10 s 1461 rockefeller would prohibit hhs from penalizing state for failing to meet participation standards for the period of time fy2007 while hhs and the state is negotiating its work verification plan and for one year thereafter twoparent participation standard president bushs fy2009 budget proposal would eliminate the higher 90 work participation standards required of twoparent welfare families all welfare reauthorization proposals that received action in 2002 through 2005 sought to eliminate the separate standard11 except the slimmed down version of welfare reauthorization included in the conference report on the dra in the 110th congress hr 3188 weller would eliminate the two parent standard additionally the elimination of the twoparent standard is included in broader responsible fatherhood legislation proposed in hr 3395 davisil and s 1626 bayh the higher participation standard for twoparent families on welfare dates back to pretanf policies under the family support act of 1988 that act first required states to provide welfare for twoparent families before then it was optional the family support act also established participation standards in the pre1996 education employment and training program for welfare families higher participation standards and stricter work requirements for twoparent families responded to criticisms that extending welfare to twoparent families without work could promote more welfare dependency12 the twoparent component of the cash welfare caseload remained relatively small even after the 1988 expansions and subsequently after states liberalized eligibility for twoparent families under tanf in fy2006 the twoparent caseload 10 see hearing to assess impact of recent changes in programs assisting lowincome families subcommittee on income security and family support of the committee on ways and

standard but retained higher hours requirements for twoparent families 12 for an overview of the debate on the family support act see after years of debate welfare reform clears 1988 cq almanac washington congressional quarterly p 349 364 crs15 averaged 98000 families per month or 5 of the total cash welfare caseload there is great deal of variation across states in the share of the cash welfare caseload that consists of twoparent families see appendix tables a3 and a4 for statebystate breakdown of the twoparent caseload versus the oneparent and noparent caseload in fy2006 though the number of twoparent families on cash welfare has remained small work participation rates for this category of families never reached the high levels envisioned either under the family support act or tanf in fy2005 the national work participation rate for twoparent families in both tanf and separate state programs was 36 only few percentage points higher than the all families work participation rate of 32 fy2005 is the last year for which this comparison is available13 as previously noted many states avoided having to meet the 90 twoparent standard by placing the twoparent component of their caseload in separate state programs in fy2006 the latest year for which official tanf work participation data are available 19 states had all of their twoparent cash welfare families in separate state programs other states generally met the standard in part through caseload reduction measured from fy1995 arkansas and the district of columbia failed the twoparent standard the combination of the two dra changes counting families in separate state programs and providing credit for welfare caseload declines only from fy2005 means that many states are in jeopardy of failing the twoparent standard failure to meet the twoparent participation standard by itself is likely to result in fairly small penalty to the states under hhs regulations the maximum penalty for failure to meet the twoparent participation standard would be prorated based on the share of the cash welfare caseload that consists of twoparent families however this would not be the case if state failed both the allfamily and twoparent participation standards the rules penalize state more heavily if they fail both standards than if they fail one of the two standards14 additionally the high twoparent participation standard potentially encourages states to calculate ways to game tanf rules through june 2007 12 states had dropped serving twoparent families with tanf or moe funds states are longer reporting information on these families though states may have shifted to serving these families with stateonly funds outside of the tanfmoe system 13 the fy2005 participation rate estimates discussed in this report represent crs estimates of participation rates in both tanf and state maintenance of effort separate state programs moessp programs the estimates do not reflect dra rule changes as data for fy2005 are insufficient to fully estimate how changes such as including certain child only families in the participation rate and changes in the definition of work activities will affect the participation rate hhs did estimate the effect of some of these changes using fy2005 data and estimated national average participation rate of 31 very similar to this reports 32 14 see regulations at 45 cfr 26151 crs16 what activities count toward the participation standards federal law lists 12 categories of activities that count toward tanf work participation standards table 3 lists these 12 categories and any statutory limitation that might apply to counting participation in these categories the statutory list influences the content of state work programs for cash welfare recipients since these are the categories of activities that count toward meeting the numerical performance standards states must meet or risk being penalized table 3 tanf work participation activities and their limitations activity statutory limitations unsubsidized employment subsidized private sector employment subsidized public sector employment work experience onthejob training job search and readiness limited to 6 weeks in fiscal year 12 weeks under some circumstances only four consecutive weeks may be counted community service programs vocational educational training limited to 12 months in lifetime only 30 of those engaged in work may be counted as participating through either vocational educational training or teen parents deemed engaged in work through education job skills training directly related to usually countable only in conjunction with employment work education directly related to usually countable only in conjunction with employment work and only for those who do not have high school degree satisfactory attendance at secondary usually countable only in conjunction with school or in course of study leading work and only for those who do not have to certificate of general equivalence high school degree provision of child care services to an individual participating in community service program source congressional research service the federal participation standards reflect workfirst approach which emphasizes job seeking and relatively rapid attachment to either job or an activity to work off welfare benefits all preemployment activities are subject to limits job search and readiness is usually limited to six weeks in year 12 weeks under certain circumstances education and training are subject to limits including 12month lifetime limit for counting vocational educational training for adults education and training other than vocational educational training counts only in conjunction with other activities more closely related to work teen parents under the age of 20 may be deemed engaged in work through education crs17 the workfirst approach to work participation is part of longstanding controversy over the effectiveness of different approaches to getting welfare recipients off the rolls and into jobs workfirst approach advocates often point to research conducted in the 1990s that found that when the workfirst and education focused programs were directly compared the longterm impact of education focused programs on increasing earnings and reducing welfare receipt was greater and sometimes smaller than programs that focus on job seeking and quick attachment to job15 additionally the impact of workfirst programs occurs faster however the evaluated programs with the largest increases in earnings and reductions in welfare tended to have strong work message like the workfirst programs but provided some flexibility for education and training for example large impacts were attributed to program operated in portland oregon during the 1990s that like other workfirst programs had job search as its most common activity however portland program recipients also often participated in education or in both job search and education during the two years following entry into the program more often than in other evaluated programs in portland job search and education were typically done sequentially not simultaneously16 additionally fairly large proportion of adults on welfare have certain barriers to employment that is they are either ill or disabled are taking care of ill or disabled children have mental health issues or have been victims of domestic violence the clinton administration explicitly sidestepped the issue of whether tanfs work activities should accommodate activities designed to address barriers to work allowing states themselves to interpret the 12 federal categories of activities and decide what specific activities were countable toward the participation standard17 the comprehensive welfare reauthorization proposals considered during 2002 to 2005 differed considerably in their approach to education and disabilities reflecting the old controversies education and training as shown above the tanf statute limits education and training as activities countable toward the tanf work participation standards vocational educational training is limited to 12 months in lifetime other educational activities are generally countable only in combination with work or those activities more closely associated with work 15 this is based on the findings of the national evaluation of welfaretowork newws newws was designed specifically to test the relative effectiveness of workfirst programs emphasizing job search against programs that emphasized education and training see us department of health and human services and us department of education national evaluation of welfaretowork strategies how effective are different welfare to work approaches 2001 16 the statement that participation in job search and education typically did not occur simultaneously is based on an unpublished crs analysis of participation patterns in the portland newws program and discussions with mdrc researchers who evaluated the program 17 see the notice of proposed rulemaking federal register vol 62 224 november 20 1997 pp 6213762138 crs18 hhs in its interim regulations required by dra prohibited states from counting coursework leading to fouryear or advanced college degree program from being counted as vocational educational training however in its final regulations published on february 5 2008 hhs reversed this policy allowing states to count all college as vocational educational training thus college can now count as the prime or sole activity of cash welfare recipient for up to 12 months after 12 months college coursework can be combined with work for example paid workstudy position as job skills training directly related to employment and thus be counted toward the tanf work participation standards however in fy2006 large share of tanf adult recipients failed to have even high school diploma or equivalent teen parents can be deemed as satisfying the participation standards through education leading to high school diploma or general educational development ged credential however adult recipients aged 20 and older may have their participation in ged program count only in combination with work or with activities more closely related to work figure 3 shows the educational attainment of tanf teen heads of households and adult recipients in fy2006 overall 42 of tanf adults and teen heads of households lacked high school diploma among the adult recipients aged 20 and older 41 lacked high school diploma or equivalent with the highest incidence being in the youngest age categories figure 3 percent of tanf adult and teen heads of households without high school diploma or equivalent fy2006 source congressional research service crs analysis of the fy2006 tanf national data files crs19 under hhs regulations participation in ged program adult basic education and english as second language esl activities are counted in two ways they may be counted within vocational educational training if they are necessary part of larger vocational education program thus if an individual is enrolled in community college vocational education program remedial adult basic education or esl classes that may be needed for the individual to succeed in the program may be counted toward tanf work participation standards pursuing ged adult basic education and esl activities may also be counted in the participation categories that may be counted only in combination with work for singleparent families this means that they count only after an individual already participated for at least 20 hours in unsubsidized or subsidized work community service work experience onthejob training job search and readiness vocational educational training or providing child care to community service recipient for single parents with schoolage child this means that activities such as pursuing ged adult basic education or esl classes can count for the remaining 10 hours of participation to meet the 30 hours of participation required of them however single parents with preschool child who comprise large share of the young tanf adults without high school degree or equivalent are required to participate for only 20 hours per week the state gets further credit by having such recipients engaged in ged adult basic education or esl activities because all 20 hours of participation must come from work or activities closely related to work rehabilitative activities research has consistently shown that fairly large share of families receiving cash welfare have noneducational barriers to work18 pretanf law exempted from participation requirements the ill and incapacitated19 and those needed in the home to care for an ill or disabled family member tanf made such exemption studies show that at least onethird of tanf adults have disabilities and one in four families on tanf include child with an impairment20 though federal benefits are available for disabled persons such as the supplemental security income program ssi and social security disability insurance ssdi21 cash welfare has 18 the tanf national data reported by states do not include information on disabilities or other barriers to employment the research is discussed below 19 hhs regulations required that illness be determined on the basis of medical evidence and that physician or licensed psychologist determine that physical or mental impairment prevents the individual from engaging in employment or training 20 see nadel mark steve wamhoff and michael wiseman disability welfare reform and supplemental security income in social security bulletin vol 65 3 january 2005 pp 1430 21 the standard for federal disability benefits from either social security disability insurance ssdi or ssi is inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or has lasted or can be expected to last for continuous period of not less than 12 months the social security standard for disability is all or nothing person either is determined disabled or not and thus eligible for benefits or not with accounting continued crs20 often served as waystation for those awaiting determination that they are eligible for them the ssi and ssdi disability determination process can take months or even span several years if the initial application is turned down and appealed additionally tanf may provide benefits to those who have impairments that are not permanent or considered severe enough to qualify them for ssi or ssdi further research by the gao concluded that former tanf cash welfare recipients with physical or mental impairments are less likely to be employed than those without impairments when those with impairments do get jobs they tend to be at lower wages than for those without impairments22 as discussed below many families dealing with disability have like those considered easier to employ left the welfare rolls and contributed to the caseload decline hhs conducted study in six states23 to examine employment barriers

health services and substance abuse are not explicitly mentioned in federal law as activities that would count toward tanf work participation standards before dra states defined these activities inconsistently across the 12 federally listed categories of work activities that are countable toward the standards some states offered certain rehabilitative services but did not count rehabilitative activities toward the federal work participation standards some states placed disabled recipients into separate state moe programs effectively exempting them from work participation standards practice not permitted under dra the hhs regulations issued under the dra place such rehabilitative activities under the timelimited job search and readiness category activities in this category are countable for up to six weeks in year 12 weeks under certain conditions that many but not all states currently meet more than four consecutive weeks of job search or readiness may be counted the time limit applies to all activities within this category this sets up zerosum situation week spent in job search reduces the period of time that rehabilitative activities can be counted by one week and vice versa the final hhs regulations provided states some additional flexibility relative to the interim regulations for counting job search and readiness under the interim regulations one hour of participation in the job search and readiness category during the week resulted in that full week being counted toward the six or 12week limit hhs final regulations convert these six or 12week limits to hourly equivalents over the course of year singleparent families with preschool children are granted up to 120 hours of job search and readiness other families are granted up to 180 hours in this category this is based on 20 hour per week requirement for single parents caring for child under the age of 6 and 30 hours per week for others these limits double if state qualifies for 12 weeks of job search and readiness further the hhs regulations allow states to count supported work programs for disabled recipients as either subsidized employment or onthejob training depending on the content of the program supported work programs in the vocational rehabilitation system combine employment with various support services hhs regulations also permit states to exempt from work participation requirements and exclude when calculating participation rates families with adults needed in the home to care for disabled child s 1730 smith would allow states to create an individualized employability plan for disabled adult or an adult caring for disabled family member and count them toward the tanf participation standards the bill would also allow states to exempt from the participation standards applicants for ssi and those who would temporarily meet the ssi standard for disability kinship care tanf cash aid is usually talked about in the context of families with children where the parents do not work sometimes because of barriers to employment or stable employment or who face low wages however sizeable share of the tanf cash aid caseload approximately 484000 children out of the 35 million children crs22 on the rolls in fy2006 is comprised of children living with relatives such as grandparents aunts or uncles many children living with relatives are doing so by private or public arrangement where relative has simply assumed responsibility for the children of parents who cannot or will not care for and support them others however are caring for children who are in foster care in this second situation court typically because of the abuse or neglect of child by their parents has ordered the child removed from the home of the parents and has given the state child welfare agency care and placement responsibility for the child children ordered to foster care who are placed by the child welfare agency with nonrelatives receive monthly foster care maintenance payment to cover their room and board however foster children who are placed by the child welfare agency with relatives sometimes receive tanf payment while tanf payment is typically worth much less than foster care payment relative caregivers are nearly always eligible for tanf payment and may turn to it for financial support because they do not meet the eligibility requirements for federally supported foster care in particular those criteria provide that any foster family home where child is placed must meet state licensing requirements in order for the state to seek federal reimbursement of foster care maintenance payment many relatives cannot meet or do not wish to undergo state foster care licensing procedures s 661 clinton and hr 2188 davis il could increase relative access to federally supported foster care maintenance payments by permitting states to establish separate licensing standards for relatives which provided the standards ensured childrens safety could include less restrictive requirements than those for nonrelatives though these bills do not amend the tanf program itself they can affect the tanf cash aid caseload by permitting greater access to an alternative source of federal help for relative caregivers raising children that is they could transfer these families from the tanf cash aid caseload to the foster care caseload child support passthrough families receiving tanf cash welfare are required to assign turn over rights to child support received from noncustodial parents to the state to reimburse it and the federal government for their welfare costs states may pay some or all of that child support to the family but must pay the cost of that passedthrough child support the dra gave states financial incentive to passthrough some child support to families receiving cash welfare by having the federal government share the cost of the first 100 in monthly child support 200 for family of two or more children in passed through child support so long as the receipt of that child support by the family does not affect familys tanf eligibility or benefit amount24 hr 896 ryan would require all child support paid by noncustodial parents to be passedthrough to tanf cash welfare family however hr 896 would 24 for an analysis of the dra child support passthrough provisions see crs report rl34105 the financial impact of child support on tanf families simulation for selected states by carmen solomonfears and gene falk crs23 leave it up to the states to decide whether the child support received by the family would affect tanf eligibility or decrease the tanf cash welfare benefit amount further caseload decline discussions of the new tanf work participation standards have tended to focus on the need to increase the number of recipients engaged in countable activities however state could meet the increased standards by either increasing engagement in activities or producing further caseload declines thus the dra gives states strong incentive to attempt to cut their caseloads from fy2005 levels25 further with fixed federal funding through fy2010 either keeping family off or moving family off the tanf cash welfare rolls helps the state meet the work participation standards without having to spend additional funds to engage its adult members in work the resulting caseload decline would free up money to help maintain funding for the nonwelfare activities funded through tanf figure 5 shows that the national cash welfare caseload has recently resumed its decline after being relatively constant for number of years over the most recent 12month period the caseload has declined by 104 the greatest decline since june 1999 to june 2000 some of these declines are likely to stem from changes in eligibility rules for tanfmoe cash welfare programs including ending tanfmoe funding for certain families twoparent families families dealing with disabilities and funding their benefits from stateonly funds outside the tanfmoe system there is reporting on the number of families receiving benefits in state only programs outside of the tanfmoe system so it is not possible to quantify at this point how much of the recent caseload reduction was caused by shifting families to stateonly programs 25 though states are not given credit for caseload declines estimated as stemming from policy changes that restrict eligibility there are number of actions states can take to reduce their caseloads without explicit policy changes the most obvious is greater enforcement of existing requirements crs24 figure 5 percentage change in families receiving tanfmoe cash welfare june to june of each year 19942007 source congressional research service crs based on data from the us department of health and human services hhs the most common metric used to evaluate welfare policies is whether they lower welfare caseloads and caseload decline is the most cited indicator of the success of welfare reform tanf goal is to end dependency on government benefits and lower cash welfare caseloads help achieve that end to the degree that receipt of welfare itself helps create disadvantage smaller role for cash welfare in society could be viewed as positive outcome families that work are eligible for benefits outside of the cash welfare system and some of these benefits such as the earned income tax credit eitc and the state childrens health insurance program schip have increased their role in supporting families with children while the role of cash welfare has diminished however the tanf welfare caseload decline raises questions about the economic security of those who face barriers to work or cannot achieve steady work the available evidence indicates that the tanf caseload decline has been broad based the decline has affected both those who were workready as well as those considered hardtoserve the urban institute using data from their national survey of american families estimated that from 1997 through 2002 the share of welfare recipients with specified barriers to work had changed little however the share of recent welfare leavers with barriers such as health conditions that limit work crs25 and poor mental health has increased26 despite the increased role of programs that supplement and support work the declining role of welfare might leave families with barriers to work or without steady work with diminished safety net to support their children potential legislative issues in the 110th congress related to nonwelfare tanf benefits and services the savings to government budgets from the cash welfare caseload decline remain within the tanf system for states to use in any manner reasonably calculated to achieve the broad purposes of the block grant in fy2006 almost half of all tanf and moe funding totaling 14 billion was available to states for benefits services and activities other than those associated with traditional cash welfare programs tanf funds are used for wide range of activities often discussed in the debate about ways to combat poverty providing early childhood programs supporting postsecondary education job retention and advancement programs and helping noncustodial parents thus while tanf cash welfare reaches less than three in ten poor children tanfs nonwelfare benefits and services can have much broader reach into the population of disadvantaged children and their families the nonwelfare component of tanf is much less debated than its traditional cash welfare programs and activities for number of reasons first the information tanf requires of states to describe the nonwelfare component of tanf precludes comprehensive and systematic examination of these activities 2006 gao report found that reporting and oversight mechanisms have not kept pace with the evolving role in tanf budgets leaving information gaps at the national level related to the numbers served and how states use funds to meet welfare reform goals27 second on the basis of what is known great deal of tanfs nonwelfare spending goes to two other federalstate program areas child care and child welfare child welfare means foster care adoption assistance and other benefits and services for children who either have been or are at risk of abuse and neglect both of these areas have their own dedicated funding streams which are supplemented with considerable dollars by tanf both of these areas also have their own policy debates which while related to tanf are sometimes conducted independently of tanf debates the welfare reauthorization proposals considered by congress during 2002 through 2005 included two relatively technical issues use of carryover funds and 26 loprest pamela and sheila zedlewski the changing role of welfare in the lives of lowincome families with children urban institute august 2006 p 28 27 us government accountability office welfare reform better information needed to understand trends in the states uses of the tanf block grant report gao06414 march 2006 crs26 whether certain services are classified as welfare that were not in the final dra agreement28 these two issues and two others relating to nonwelfare uses of tanf and moe funds are discussed below allowing carryover funds to be spent on nonwelfare benefits and services current law allows states to reserve unused block grant funds without fiscal year limit only for the purpose of paying cash welfare benefits this was intended as reserve fund for states to draw on during recessions when it was presumed that the cash welfare caseload could increase the bush administrations 2002 welfare reauthorization plan and all comprehensive reauthorization proposals considered by congress during the 20022005 period would have allowed tanf carryover funds to be used for any tanf benefit or service the proposal was not included in the final version of dra treatment of child care and transportation aid under current regulations child care and transportation aid for nonworking families is considered welfare child care and transportation aid for working families is considered nonwelfare as such receipt of these benefits by family triggers tanf requirements such as the fiveyear time limitation on federally funded benefits subjection to the work participation standards and assignment of child support the bush administrations 2002 welfare reauthorization proposal and all comprehensive welfare reauthorization proposals would have permitted child care and transportation aid for nonworking recipients to be considered nonwelfare benefit and service and hence not subject to tanf requirements this proposal was not included in the final version of dra reporting on nonwelfare benefits and services tanfs detailed reporting requirements focus on families receiving cash welfare the statutory reporting requirements date back to the 1996 welfare reform law and the reporting requirements in regulations were promulgated in the wake of that law before it became clear that the cash welfare caseload was dramatically declining and that the money saved from the caseload decline was being used in the diverse ways allowed by the tanf block grant the tanf caseload that is often cited represents families receiving tanf welfare excluding those families that receive only nonwelfare benefits and services it thus understates the number of families benefitting from tanffunded benefits services and activities in annual program reports due after the close of the fiscal year states are required to provide information on all programs funded with moe dollars with 28 the congressional budget office cbo estimated that those two policy changes did not have budgetary impact therefore they had the potential to spur objections under the senates byrd rule discussed earlier in footnote 5 crs27 description of the types of benefits and services provided and the number of beneficiaries receiving them these program reports do not capture the same information for nonwelfare programs funded with federal tanf dollars additionally program expenditure information collected by hhs fails to capture spending for child welfare benefits and services as category it is subsumed in other more general categories the result is an incomplete picture of how tanf and moe dollars are spent and how many families benefit from them the bush administrations 2002 welfare reauthorization proposal would have required reporting on nonwelfare benefits and services all of the comprehensive welfare reauthorization bills except one senate finance committeereported hr 4737 107th congress considered during 20022005 included provisions to extend the annual program report information from covering the use of only moe dollars to covering both tanf and moe dollars this would have required states to provide description and caseload number for all programs and activities funded with tanf and moe funds additionally the 2005 senate finance committee bill would have required that the child care reporting system be extended to tanffunded child care so that it would be possible to determine both numbers of families receiving this benefit as well as their characteristics eg income demographic information reporting changes were included in the final version of dra that was enacted oversight of competitive grants to promote healthy marriages and responsible fatherhood though much of the controversy during the welfare reauthorization debate focused on cash welfare recipients and their work requirements major component of the bush administrations 2002 welfare reform proposals was to provide grants to promote healthy marriages these initiatives were nonwelfare initiatives education in social skills as well as campaigns in schools and in the media on the importance of marriage the dra included 150 million per year appropriation for competitive grants to promote healthy marriages and responsible fatherhood about 100 million per year of these funds are for research demonstrations and technical assistance related to promotion of healthy marriages hhs awarded fiveyear grants to variety of organizations from this appropriation29 this amount of funding is large relative to other available funds for research and demonstrations under tanf tanf has 15 million appropriation for both state and federally initiated research projects hhs also receives an appropriation for research which was 57 million for fy2007 congress might conduct oversight to examine how these projects are likely to improve the research base from which programs to promote healthy marriage may be evaluated 29 the listing of grantees can be found at httpwwwacfhhsgovprogramsofahmabstracts indexhtm crs28 child care and child welfare financing as discussed above tanf supplements federal funding for both the child care block grant and the various federal programs that help fund foster care adoption assistance and child welfare services the supplement provided by tanf is fairly large in fy2005 total tanf and moe funding for child care totaled about 54 billion which reflected both transfers to the child care and development fund ccdf and expenditures within the tanf program at 19 of total tanf and moe funding child care is the second largest category next to cash welfare within tanf expenditures on child welfare activities for example foster care and services for families with children who have been abused and neglected or are atrisk of abuse and neglect cannot be derived directly from tanfs financial reporting system the urban institute on the basis of survey of the states reported that in state fy2004 tanfs contribution to child welfare agency funding totaled 30 billion thus child care and child welfare services together account for more than half at least 8 billion of the 13 billion of tanf and moe funding available for nonwelfare activities therefore legislation affecting either child care or child welfare financing could have an impact on how much funding is available for tanfs other activities legislation affecting child welfare funding would also have an impact on tanf as discussed above legislation has been introduced that would allow nonparent relatives caring for children to be eligible for federal foster care payments some of these relatives currently rely on tanf cash welfare30 this change could transfer some cases out of tanf and onto the foster care rolls freeing up some tanf dollars other longstanding child welfare financing issues if resolved could also affect the amount of tanf and moe funds used by the child welfare system31 conclusion the 110th congress might consider range of tanf issues number of them stem from policy changes made by congress in the dra these issues also touch on some that have been longdebated such as the role of education and training in helping recipients move from welfare to work and achieving selfsufficiency even absent scheduled reauthorization of tanf this may be an opportune time to reconsider tanf issues and the role the block grant can play to help disadvantaged families with children the context that tanf operates in has changed considerably from the time of the welfare reform debates in the early and mid1990s the cash welfare caseload has declined substantially and incentives are in place for states to seek further caseload declines nonwelfare support for the 30 see crs report rl34388 child welfare issues in the 110th congress by emilie stoltzfus 31 see crs report rl32849 child welfare financing an issue overview by

program the nonwelfare part of tanf has the potential to help disadvantaged families with children through new and innovative ways whether that is happening is an open question given the information gap on these activities illuminating tanfs nonwelfare side might recast future discussions about tanf to reflect the changing context in which the block grant operates crs30 appendix additional tables
