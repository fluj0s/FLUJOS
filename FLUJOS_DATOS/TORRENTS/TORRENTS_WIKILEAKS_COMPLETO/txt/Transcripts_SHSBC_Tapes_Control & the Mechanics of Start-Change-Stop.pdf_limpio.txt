scientology control the mechanics of startchangestop edited from the tape lectures of l ron hubbardcontrol and the mechanics of scs edited from l ron hubbards 18th acc lecture no6 dated july 22 1957 the word control has nasty connotation due to the bad 8c parents and society administers upon its individuals that is because the word control evokes moments when we were beaten down into apathy or given such conflicting commands to obey that we henceforth shudder away from any mention of the word but in scientology we have given it new meaning by adding tone 40 which makes this control exact and allows the completion of cycle of action which bad control never considered also it does not dramatize the lower emotions of the tone scale an individual who has been made to resist control winds up allergic to control and if he is allergic to it he dies because there isnt anything one can do with anything except in one way or another to view or control it if flow flows too long in one direction it has tendency to dam up and fix itself it is only necessary to reverse that to unfix the situation we go back into scientology 880 on twoway flows and we understand what is happening when you get person to get the idea of flowing something out away from him he will suddenly go anaten but it is only necessary for him to make something flow the other way toward him for short while just mental idea of flowing in for him to wake up immediately if you have somebody who is putting mockups out in front of him and he starts to go unconscious you only need to have him put them in back of him and the unconsciousness disappears thetan who is totally devoted to controlling things and who is not himself in any way controlled runs into this phenomena if this is the case one can immediately see why control of preclear is necessary if he has fought outgoing control it is only because it has gone out too long thetan cannot be upset by miscontrol or bad 8c it is just an objection i think he could take it rather easily providing he himself didnt have stuck flow on it if he himself had not done so much controlling of mental image pictures which is to say the mind the body and objects in the environment there would not be stuck outward flow when somebody comes along and controls him well he objects he objects more when it is bad control but bad control that is bad placement and handling naturally gets more on his nerves if he already has worn route which starts to come back to knock him out he doesnt like it and starts to fight flow with flows flow which flows certain time in one direction tends to continue to flow until it is totally jammed or stopped flow flowing long enough in one direction in the mind eventually flows harder and harder and not easier as one might presume this is only true when energy is being employed the more an individual outflows energy the more vacuum he creates on this side of the flow the more he flows out the more hole he leaves in the bank and eventually something is trying to pull the flow back in he has created missingness in the energy masses immediately surrounding him and this vacuum caused by the missingness tends to fill itself by pulling back on the same line its like taking rubber band and stretching it further and further the analogy isnt very good because the flow eventually just sticks his effort to hold it out there is so great that he can only hold it motionlessly out there he has got it stuck somebody comes along and threatens to disturb this stuck flow just little bit and the vacuum behind it tends to fill up too rapidly he resists this and he sticks it out there with more effort the solution to this lies in these two data one you cannot hurt thetan and two the worst that could happen on the snap back is that the bank would disarrange in some fashion and would leave him without some of his pretty pictures that flow is usually undertaken by noncreated energy he himself did not create the energy he collected it one way or the otherfrom sources on misownership basis he packed it around him and used that energy there is an actual series of electrical phenomena which occur in the field of thinkingness connected with this these things have been observed to have sufficient violence that person holding the electrodes of an emeter has had an explosion occur somewhere in the vicinity of his hands big enough to knock hole in his hands and the can an individual once in while gets tremendous explosion in front of his face or above his head and he thinks he is being attacked by something he just got too much potential and had stuck flow out there which somebody came along and disturbed and it resulted in complete electronic display any group of people playing around with such things as electric shocks on people to help them is just being incredibly stupid because they are using the wrong wavelength in the first place very gross wave called action we look at this tremendous electrical phenomena which surrounds the being and we find that mental image pictures are themselves built of energy they are not some imaginary thing imaginary means nonenergy non real not existent couldnt possibly be handled it is bad control operation the use of that word imaginary if that is the case then everything we can see is imaginary the walls floors ceilings and all the bodies one sees walking down the streets you can practically produce the same phenomena as ridge exploding with any electrical current or various electrical gimmicks of one kind or another the electronic engineer can produce this reaction very easily with condensers and resistors but his ideas of condensers are rather strange as well he thinks if you keep pumping electricity into condenser until it fills up it will eventually discharge in some fashion or another well we dont know if it has this capacity or not but we know that thetan does have some strange electrical phenomena which are not any different than the electrical phenomena of life this is not unusual to thetan because he is after all part and parcel to the mest universe and the electrical phenomena we see around us were probably some time or another generated by life the current running in this tape recorder at this moment is converted or generated by some life form or another in the past it is probably running on coal and coal is energy stored by converted by or generated by life forms trees the moment thetan starts to handle energy he runs into all the phenomena of electricity or else he wouldnt have any need of eating or sleeping that this applies to the mind then should not come as shock to anybody that it wouldnt apply to the mind then should be tremendous piece of balderdash if it has anything to do with energy then there are certain laws that energy obeys and flows are exception other electrical phenomena contain engrams each experience in life is represented by mental image picture of one kind or another which contains real energy which has real potential and which is measurable in terms of current meters which measure current measure the potential in these facsimiles furthermore they have mass you can remedy somebodys havingness with these pictures by having an individual mockup things and shoving them in you can increase the bodys weight there are many experiences which in themselves and this is what is confusing contain electrical catastrophes one can have pictures of catastrophes which when run give you repeat of catastrophe one can produce all sorts of electrical phenomena which affect beings people havent begun to dream of the number of ways by which being could be influenced by electrical phenomena one could say that is about the closest thing there is to infinity they are numberless and all obey the same laws if they are so operating and if these laws hold good then you in processing can command the obedience of this phenomena one of the phenomena is the stuck flow of control people usually control other things by energyand do not control by postulate which is the optimum thing to do they obsessively control and then one day they control just little more by energy and they decide they cannot control things any more there is other reason to it than electrical phenomena there isnt well i failed too many times to control it so i guess i cannot control it any longer they just had to try too hard and had to outflow too much worked too hard by pushing in one direction too long and they created stuck flow practically all flows are aimed in the direction of control and the anatomy of control is start change and stop starting changing and stopping things then became stuck flows one of the things we do is to back up this stuck flow of control the thetan has been going all the time in the universe controlling things and very few things have ever controlled him he has tendency to snap in on himself those times when he has been controlled whether it was good or bad control hence you get the various phenomena such as the service facsimile which finds its basic residence in just that fact the idea of training people until they develop automatic responses as in the forces has practically saturated the universe they dont ever train the person since they dont even know who the man was the whole idea of training is completely erroneous because they think that if they get some kind of automaticity going in the bank then this person like wound up doll can thereafter drive car and tanks everybody thinks that it works so that is the target of education dont apply it just memorize the data presented to you even though you dont precisely know where to fit it into your frame of reference now an auditor comes along and starts to control him with tone 40 auditing such as give that hand after while the preclear says i wonder if any of that is addressed to could it be that some of it is addressed to in the first place they are not asking to store up any of this in the bank quite the contrary i am supposed to do this every time does the fellow mean because i dont see anything else around here that will give him my hand well maybe if he does this often enough he is going to install machine which will give him my hand then it becomes sheer duplication and duplication can utterly ruin any machine the one thing that mental machinery cannot do is to exactly duplicate only thetan can duplicate he is the only being that can stand the stress and strain of is so duplication enters into this with heavy control and he finds that he must be the one who is being controlled thus he works it out and one gets back flow of control which is all there is to it he finds nut that there is great consequence to this and so becomes willing to control something and that is more or less crude explanation of how control works when used in auditing we examine this very carefully and find that control is senior to energy energy is the servant of control and not the end goal of control although it could be made so energy is energy and if it was just floating about doing nothing there would be chaos that is if there was direction to it if we take this idea of energy flows as the only method by which anything can be controlled we are in trouble that is the makebreak point of lifetime that is the reason why electronic engineers have rough time the using of too much and using it too long to control things with energy which they themselves cannot even see causes this stuck flow which eventually deteriorates into the inability to control and forces them further down to cruder methods yes we have stratum above energy there is such thing as controlling by postulate there is also such thing as mass without energy or mass without fields there can be mass with energy and it is not true that that wall is composed of little things that wiggle it is not composed of space with an idea of little particles lets not make the mistake of saying that mass has mass that is what physics got itself into and is in it so deep that it will never dig itself out when it advanced into higher physics they said that mass has mass and it made mystics out of the lot of them that is reverse postulate it is all right to say that there is nothing there there issomething there and behold is but now there is something there and we say that there is nothing there without vanishing it and we are in trouble because we are telling lie lets get the isness straight the universe is real if you run around saying that it is real it would become less offensive to you but if you go around on the second postulate and while holding firmly in mind that it is and you say it isnt you notis it and become what wall case which is lower than south that which makes something is not the thing it made and because you can make energy is reason that you are energy because the wall next to you can make electrical fields when treated properly is reason that it is an electrical field in other words that wall over there is and dont ever think it isnt if your body runs into it it will go thump we then as result of this have to admit two isnesses the isness of your body and the isness of the wall and some person with more feeling than others would admit third the thump one an vary alter and do all sorts of things such as changing mest and electricity but when you say that it isnt you run into trouble and start going blind this is actually the total reason 8c and other processes are so good you just make the preclear go around and say it is it is it is and everything brightens up and is liable to become more solid stronger and more massive that is the basic control of this universe it is one controls something by holding it in existence just by holding something in existence one is controlling it control then even enters into creation create and control are next door to each other if an individual cannot suffer control himself his ability to create is doomed he may be frantically creating but it doesnt mean that he is going to keep doing this for very long he is going to hit that stuck flow if he is creating with postulates and not with energy flows he can go on forever the number one trick of control used in this universe on thetan is to make the thetan postulate that he himself can be damaged one has to make him conceive that he is energy and that energy can be damaged by which he then has it proven to him that he can be damaged one can only damage person thoroughly and enormously by making this identification between spirit and energy or mass any psychotherapy or practice of religion and philosophy or activity concerning the mind is doomed to failure and will not and cannot work if it is based on the premise that man is mass the only reason scientology works is because it disabuses him of this fact it addresses the being and if we were going around fixing up bodies thinking that man is body made up of neurons automaticities etc we have said at once that it cannot work because it is using and confirming this identification that is the basic misidentification necessary to damage thetan or put him downscale one just has to convince him that he is mass energy and can be damaged and you have foundation for slave society the thetan who is convinced that he is chair can provenly be damaged but thetan cannot be damaged all you really have to do is disassociate the idea that thetan was energy and you have 99 per cent of his case right there people control so much energy that they eventually come to believe that they had better obey the laws of energy and so get stuck in energy he then thinks he is energy and if he produces something he is the thing this situation eventually gets into stuck flow and the moment you process him not an energy mass he starts to disconnect from all this energy without really wrecking his havingness one cannot hurt his havingness it is just another idea he found havingness works because it exercises his connection with energy it makes him responsible until he wears out whole flock of postulates and then feels better this then is direct ratio one would have to convince thetan that he was energy before one could damage him he often sets up postulate that he could be damaged so as todamage another thetan by example somebody said hell was paved with good intentions but it is actually paved with setting an example you say look what you have done to you brute you have slaughtered and he says what living being can be slaughtered thats new thought and he goes off worrying about this you pick yourself up and say guess i got that guy then one day you do it so often that you forget to get the guy or you run into too many others that convinced you that is just the method of going into agreement hence down scale cases difficulty in processing all these things actually stem from these rather stratospheric postulates and activities which may or may not be reached directly by an auditor they certainly can be attacked on gradient scale if they could be reached just like that one would have one instant clear the whole matter of i am energy energy can be damaged i can be damaged is actually necessary channel to create good solid slave society fellow who is energy cannot get out of skull and must to some degree be conceiving himself to be the content of the skull when you tell him to exteriorize he is trying to push his brains outside the skull or something of the sort when you say be three feet back of your head it is painful and it gives him headaches thetan couldnt be damaged his abilities couldnt be less we have already demonstrated that it is impossible to reduce an ability about the only thing you can do is reduce its exercise or the willingness to exercise it the answer to all this is to remember and be cognizant all the time that one is processing the thetan and not an energy mass or something solid only then can change occur thetan has plotted out orders of seniority and top amongst them is surprise i can make anybody go out of control and actually make his body just start flip flopping madly just by making him run process that isnt process but which is addressed to surprise mock up somebody and have him be surprised just have him do that for few times and he says i am feeling nervous now and the next thing you as an auditor see is that he has got all of his clamps about surprise off and all of the surprise which was more or less on automatic goes into full restimulation and he will just flip flop all over the place surprise is one of the methods by which energy could be damaged because thetan gets that associated with blow and he has all sorts of interesting mechanisms figured out but we have to have these basic mechanisms first one that one can be damaged and two that he is energy christianity for instance had this failure although they were addressing the spirit very broadly they actually brought in this mechanism called hell there were seven hells originally and these various hells were all places where thetans could be damaged they did this very interestingly they said your soul which of course made the operation you are energy punishment and damage were entered in that wasnt anywhere near as bad an operation as this dialectic materialism psychology mess that we have inherited in our modern times science is going straight ahead on the rocks of man is energy man is mass at least christian practices gave via on it they still have some spirit present in their conception of man i am more or less prone to believe some of the miracles which occurred in the early days of christianity in spite of the several christian churches which now offer large prizes to anyone who can prove that any miracle ever occurred if you were just to convince somebody that he is spirit that he did not have soul but is soul and nothing else you are liable to get miracle he would slip all the way out of being energy and being damaged into beinghimself we thus have control of the spirit as being the highest button of control or processing control of spirit would be rather direct without mumbo jumbo and lots of vias such as witch doctoring we have come to point where we can do this quite directly we can control spirit the moment that the preclear himself sees that he is control and that he is not energy sees that he can receive control communicate and respond to it he certainly will pull out of the morass tone 40 works well for some people and rather poorly for others it has lot to do with the goals of the auditor and his understanding of what he is trying to do with that process but we are probably the first and this doesnt even include buddhism to overtly address this problem very directly and without superstition and mumbo jumbo direct control of the spirit is our direct goal and when person can be controlled then he can control and when he sees that there is two way flow involved he has the situation well in hand the arc triangle and cch edited from l ron hubbards lecture 2 of the 18th acc washington dc the arc triangle is our next to the oldest property in scientology the oldest is the bank the engram and the mental image picture quite recently this almost forgotten triangle did terrific resurrection only this time we have it as control havingness and communication affinity reality and communication are an excellent description of the three basic things on which the universe is built without which in balance life could not exist affinity that is some emotional or felt consideration of proximity is basically consideration of distance but it is that consideration which says that one likes or doesnt like it in other words without some liking or disliking having some things to avoid or to go close to there would be game at all reality is that sequence which begins with postulates and ends with mass which we originally defined as an agreed upon thing reality is the agreed upon apparency of existence as per the axioms communication is an interchange of ideas between two beings who are aware that the other person is present we had to introduce with this new simplicity the radical idea that one being could talk to another being and that an interchange of ideas could take place as defined in axiom 28 and described in dianetics 1955 the manual of communication if you notice an interchange of ideas it is not very feasible unless there is an agreement of some sort or another the agreement can take the form of having mass to talk to and we thus get communication via at least we know what we are talking to if there is something there and that is reality of course we can simply postulate that something is there and talk to it talking to something is better than talking to nothing when two beings are talking to each other here on earth one normally sees the oddity of two beings standing there not confronting each other and not talking but lot of words go back and forth the reality part of that interchange would be the mass the platform whether it be earth or sidewalk that the two bodies are standing on the space so far as location is concerned enters into this those are located somewhere and therefore we know where the communication goes to and whoever receives it knows where to send the answer back to very necessary part of communication then we get the affinity factor how far away does fellow have to be to talk to you there is more than that to affinity affinity is liking and disliking understanding requires affinity reality and communication and if any corner of the arc triangle is lowered the other two corners lower accordingly we know that reality is basically an agreement and we have today the reality scale we have always known that all we had to do was introduce some agreement into the situation one had to agree at least on what one was talking about in order to talk there is communication in progress if there is agreement on anything one should have had to establish the existence of one of the other people before communication could have occurred communication occurs simply by r and little when two people are together affinity necessitates control of attention we have had lot of processes founded on arc and they have not in themselves produced tremendous results they have produced good results but we havent seen anybody step out of the graveyard and dust his hat there must be some counterparts to arc which are more workable than arc since if we know arc is true then how do we and those are basic considerations make it work in thisuniverse on this planet at this time we know that the three things add up to understanding how do we get this into processing level in the first place one has to realize blindness when one sees it one has to realize that south is an awful long way south and the basic entrance of the arc triangle breaks down to control for to which bodies and the ge beautifully respond any preclear therefore would respond to it regardless of his tone level if you were processing him via body because this is the bodys understanding it is solid therefore is control somebody comes along and says stand up straighter got your heels together suck in your guts and he will say the guy loves you might phrase it in some other way you might say damn the sergeant i could kill him which means at the ge level i love him dearly thus we have havingness or solid mass in the place of reality and verbalization in place of communication so understanding takes place in terms of control mass and communication understanding mestwise always takes place in the framework of mass and location thereof verbalized or electrical or vibratory interchanges and for affinity control if one disliked somebody on mass level one would simply refuse to control him the choice i am talking about is to control or not to control unfortunately where there are people firmly connected with mass this then is the level of interchange if people are going around in bodies then this is the level to which cases respond dont get wrong i am not trying to rephrase or redo the arc triangle i am simply telling you the action level of the arc triangle when it is in action or you are going to work on mest level becomes control or lack of it the r becomes mass and its location or lack of it since the complaint is about mass and c is some sort of vibratory electrical particle interchange symbols flying back and so forth solid if you start adding too much directness at this very low level you are liable to blow the mass up thetan learns that every once in while he loses favorite piece of bank or service facsimile he said exactly what he meant to the fellow directly with vias and got himself fired he was trying to communicate directly on mest level and threw some particles straight out without the slightest via on them and caused an explosion one has to have intention with it there has to be some livingness connected with it in other words one has to go upscale in order to make it function optimumly people who are at the lower end of control dont want mass cant have communication which becomes it will be said for at this level when coaxed to put out control communication which is absolutely direct and straight people discover something fantastic in order to accomplish this they have to go upscale or shatter themselves in the process of doing so after they have been shattered few times they hit higher tone range they say i belong up here what am i doing grubbing around here in the mest that is basically what an individual understands when he starts doing recent training drills arc to become extremely workable has to be coached where you are dealing with masses in terms of control havingness and communication we have said cch by which we mean control communication havingness or communication control and havingness and we have lined them up so that it is instantly discernible that this is the other side to the arc coin follow arc down scale as per the hubbard chart of human evaluation in science of survival and as you go down you will find an area below the bottom line of the chart that has to do with mass in other words to wrap up this whole subject the only responses still extantat the bottom of the chart can still be phrased in terms of control havingness and communication those responses do not entirely disappear as mentioned on the chart but become very coarse and massive and dont entirely disappear if life can be awakened into present it will be awakened into presence or location by control havingness and communication handled in one way or another the first cch process is very old and hardly anybody has recognized its antecedent i processed cat until he ate an editor i processed this cat up to point where he would strike at my fingers he was very timid cat and i got him to reach for my fingers and then each time he would reach i would withdraw my fingers slightly he would reach further and he got more and more ferocious so i invited an editor and he ate the editor up thats an exaggeration but he really ate the editors thetan by scaring the man with his ferocity just by inviting the cat to reach out matter how timidly and strike out at our fingers gradually so as not to startle or surprise the cat we make our fingers retreat we get the cat to put out communication line lines are solid at the bottom of the reality scale so we are right there at the cats reality the cat cant have mass is below mass and is actually trying to connect antagonistically with solid communication line so the cat does reach give that hand is just processing the cat you say give that hand the preclear doesnt and you reach over and take hold of his wrist take his hand and thank him for having given it to you after while of this he says you know there is some dim vague possibility that i might have had something to do with that i wonder if i could possibly reach that far over to your lap when he finds out that he can do it you have achieved goal for you have got him reaching for the environment in an 8c style when this is done you as an auditor better have him reach for the mest environment in terms of barriers you have just got lines recognized and he has to be moved up and out of barriers so we have 8c on walls when we get him above that the auditor puts him back on lines again and we have hand space mimicry we get him to locate the mass of the auditor the preclear cannot disobey these commands there is thinkingness involved in it because there isnt any thinkingness at that level and if you are processing any it is figure figure that is what arc becomes after long time an individual becomes body he agrees that he isnt anything but body people are never anything but bodies and bodies are dead too body is mass and therefore the realest thing there could be to body is outright control if person had body then control would be affinity if he could control something he would like it an individual who finds out control isnt killing him turns out to like his auditor that is an establishment of reality level and the affinity level at that reality level is control it goes up and not down the scale we use good tone 40 control on him and he will come upscale to having mass lets look at what this does to communication the individual of course is willing to talk he is also willing to receive objects and give objects away and so interchanges can occur we are looking at the arc where understanding takes place only in the presence of control havingness and communication on mest level this is the level at which machines of mest nature automobiles and so forth have to be run an individual cannot adequately control his car and he doesnt like his car what does he mean by like does he mean an emotion he means an ability to control it it is as solid and mesty as that one wonders why some married couples dont get along although she apparently does everything he says when an auditor decides that he will get her out from under her husband or vice versa or bush up this closure of terminals he will find out that there seems to be somefeeling for each other it is just control going on all the time one is looking here at where control is affinity they express their affinity for each other by kicking each other trying to gain control over each other by fighting below that level is love making one can understand lot by just looking at what understanding is at the level of mass it is control controlling and being controlled that is understanding psychosis is something mocked up so that it cannot be handled psychos try to make nothing out of their mass all the time they have mocked up nonhandlability people who are below 20 on the tone scale mock up things that cannot be handled and individuals above 20 mock up things when they do that can be handled or they simply try to handle anything there is thus dividing line on this control people below 20 mock up things routinely which cannot be handled and then brag about it those people are much further down scale than one thinks they are we say it is above or below 20 which seems to be precise line it is almost as if we are talking about two different universes when individuals go around mocking up things that cannot be handled and bragging about it all the time they give an auditor pretty bad time they are just daring the auditor to handle them you start sawing through with give that hand and they say this cant be handled they keep offering things that cant be handled these people are never really successful at anything they are terribly destructive they q and with mest and they have become mest they do what mest does here we enter our understanding of life in realizing that there are people around who havent the slightest desire to handle anything everybodys got something in his life that he doesnt think can be handled or thinks that he cannot handle but these people just mock it up all the time people or preclears that have given you hard time have done only that you cure them of one thing and they mock up something else that you cannot handle their whole game is the avoidance of control but they know how to control other people that is the service facsimile which is unhandlable and you handle these people by not permitting them to handle the service facsimile which is reactive enough for any reactive bank one can thus roughly divide mankind above or below 20 on the tone scale some of them mock up things which can be handled and try to handle other things these are the people that keep the world running they dont build clocks that cannot be fixed the rest of the people simply keep on mocking up things that cannot be handled and every doctor every practitioner of any kind is confronted by these people all the time because this is the dare arc becomes control havingness and communication you recognize that control havingness and communication are not the bottom because they invert and become control possible of any kind this is the cant handle it mass is admissible or viewable and communication of any kind acceptable therefore understanding is possible we have discovered that rung which solves the inversion just as we can raise any persons communication by raising his affinity and reality as we can raise affinity by raising their reality and communication so we can do these things at the bottom we can remedy control inability to handle and so forth in his life and vicinity simply by remedying his havingness we can do this by talking to him or by using straight control and we can raise his lack of mass by control and communication we will find that his havingness will increase some odd and very complicated consideration about havingness are in the way of all this but it will blow in cognitions which he probably will never mention but he will come up to cch if person has got to be identified and connected with mass he is in terribly good condition when he is at cch therefore cch is pretty high but it handles all the inversions of cch and this whole mysterious stratum the bottom substratum of the arc triangle is revealed to view and becomes workable in the hands of the auditorcontrol all by itself will level out all lower inversions of the subject of control havingness and communication the right kind of communication all by itself will do something for havingness and control hand space mimicry is solid line they will eventually have an auditor cant have on others and have on self or the three steps of trio or control trio run one way or another on somebody is also communication process if you run tell something your mother cant have and get straight answer the preclears havingness comes up so does his ability to control and his ability to communicate you can hit cch at one of its corners and get the other two to some degree because it permits the auditor to directly address the body and have something happen to the person cch then should be viewed simply as the workable factors at the lower end of the mass scale cch is pretty high level procedure but it is description also of all lower levels the harmonics of which are processed by straight cch startchangestop refer to clear procedure by l ron hubbard start change and stop is the anatomy of control this is cycle of action create survive destroy there is continue persist on the middle of the curve and other cycles within cycles of action but the important factors are start change and stop running start change and stop on an individual brings about greater self determinism selfdeterminism in the field of motion consists of by own power of choice permitting the object or body to be still or not to be still permitting thing to be changed or not to be changed permitting thing to be started or not to be started and it must be rehabilitated in the preclear in other words selfdeterminism consists here of returning the preclears power of choice over controlling or not controlling at will the preclear who is obsessively controlling will sooner or later fail to control and then will be controlled by something the obsession to control to start to change to stop will be found to enter into the arc triangle and is what depresses the preclear down scale on the tone scale these three parts of control are run flat individually in this order we run change flat and then run start again very flat and then we run stop flat it would be mistake at this point to say that this process is finished for the excellent reason that if you run change again you would find further considerations shifting in the preclear and then if you run start you would find it unflattened so you would run it again and then run and flatten stop it would not be possible to say how long you would have to run the process altogether on somebody who was total machinery and who never had been in session this would be rough process on case that is in good condition this would run easier the preclear would consider it interesting and would exteriorize quite easily the end result of this process is exteriorization for someone who is compulsively exteriorized this would be excellent as he would slide into his head and eventually come out of it again but not on compulsive basis one meets with three conditions in auditing the preclear who is compulsively interiorized the preclear who is compulsively exteriorized and the preclear who is buttered all over the universe the latter case run on csc would greatly accumulate the ability to collect himself this might not occur until you have run him for five or more hours on it if this process is continued long enough the preclear will be moving his body by postulate ie from the outside not by beams stimulus response etc this process does not go all the way up because of the preclears attention span most preclears cannot stay on process for more than few moments so you would vary the process little to keep him interested his actual response however is not important as long as he does it there is such thing as bad control only nonpositive control good control is positive control and positive control is not bad control we get lower level there than moving the body this would be scs on objects it is always safest to run this on someone you are trying out or person who cannot move about lot such as an invalid to somebody who has reality on his body one would run scs using an object instead of his body when running this process the auditor and the preclear should both stand up this gives reality and the auditor duplicating the preclear mimicry will bring about greater arc the session always fails when the auditor sits down while running scsit runs this way the auditor points out spot on the floor to the preclear and says do you see that spot good we will call that spot now you stand here ok the auditor now indicates another spot and says now do you see that other spot good well call that spot b all right now when i tell you to change the bodys position i want you to move it from spot to spot b all right good change the bodys position fine then the auditor says do you see that spot well well call that spot c we use three spots so that we dont run duplication process on him now when i tell you to change the bodys position i want you to move the body from spot b to spot c do you understand that fine change the bodys position you can ask him did you change the bodys position if his case is not too low for it is not advisable on low case at first then go back to spot it does not have to be the same spot each time as it makes the process too much like duplication brings the preclear to predict the process too easily and he will do it machinewise each time you make contact with the preclear you give the command in new interval of time you dont depend on any former understanding of the command you clear it each time and give the whole command every time you use it we make each move in time new move he doesnt have to depend on his memory so the auditor repeats the whole wording as given this is most important aspect of running any part of scs on start we emphasize start the auditor says do you see that wall over there good now when i give you this command i want you to move the body in the direction towards that wall when i say start i want you to start the body all right start fine the preclear may protest that he had to stop the body and change it as well what is happening here is that the word control is beginning to ungroup and as you get start change and stop apart and distinct from each other the individuals ability to control the body increases and he gains more confidence in being able to control it from greater and greater distance the next command would be all right when i tell you to start the body you start the body ok start the body the third command is for stop and the auditor says i am going to ask you to get the body moving towards that indicated wall and somewhere along the line i am going to tell you to stop the body is that all right he agrees and you say get the body moving you dont say start he does so and you say stop and did you stop the body you dont say your body but the body indicating the body you emphasize him as thetan doing it for it increases the preclears selfdeterminism you give the commands for each process newly each time from scs which is the three processes given above there are two other processes called startcs and stopcs startcs has the exact commands as for start in scs we emphasize start here and use change and stop only to unflatten start the purpose here is to rehabilitate the preclears ability to get things starting since he has been immobilized lot in his life when the opposing valences or conditions exercised bad control over him and prevented him from starting after preclear has been run on startcs which would flatten to some degree each one of the points of control we run stopcsthis is distinctly different process the commands are the same as used for stop in s cs but here one specializes in stopping the body one has the preclear stop the body over and over and as the preclear becomes more accustomed to doing this one then changes the process on him to this extent the auditor asks the preclear in running stopcs to stop the body absolutely still this imposes new discipline on the preclear and makes the process extremely difficult for him it is only done when scs and ordinary stopcs have to some degree been flattened following up this stop the body absolutely still one can introduce change into the process for few commands in order to unflatten the stopcs that has flattened in other words when the stop of stopcs on an object or the body seems to be flat one can run few change the body or change the object and unflatten stop once more with resultant alteration in the preclears ability to perform when stopcs seems flat then it should be unflattened at first by running changess with the emphasis on change when change longer upsets his ability to stop it starting it should be run as an alternate to stopcs in order to unflatten it again stop is the most important part of scs the preclear has been told all along the line to stop he was made effect all the time how you bring him to just this under his own control and selfdeterminism and he takes over the automaticity the same is true for change psychotic is compulsively changing all the time and changess will take over the automaticity of compulsive changing and make the person more sane
