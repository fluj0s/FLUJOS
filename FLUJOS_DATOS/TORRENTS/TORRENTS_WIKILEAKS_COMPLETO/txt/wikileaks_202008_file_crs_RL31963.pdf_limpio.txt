for or are family members of employees who work for small employers legislation considered by the 109th and earlier congresses is intended to assist small employers in offering health insurance as benefit to their workers two bills hr 525s 406 and s 1955 offer alternativ approaches to encouraging trade and professional associati ons to offer coverage to sma ll employers who are members of those groups the small business health fairness act of 2005 introduced in the house as hr 525 and in the senate as s 406 would create new groups called association health plans ahps for small firms to join into to offer coverage to their employees hr 525 was passed by the house of representatives on july 26 2005 s 1955 the health insurance mark etplace modernization and affordability act of 2005 as approved by the senate committee on hea lth education labor and pensions on march 15 2006 offers an alte rnative approach s 1955 would create associationbased health coverage groups called sma ll business health plans sbhps and would harmonize states insurance laws to achieve more universal regulatory environment for sbhps and traditional insurers the associationbased cove rage approaches described by hr 525s 406 and s 1955 would build on existing groups alread available to some small employers and individual professi onals many trade and professi onal associations offer health insurance to their members the bills would create incentives for associationbased coverage and establish rules for the coverage offered thr ough the associations the goal of ahp and sbhp legislation is to reduce the administrative challenges for small employers in seeking out contracting with and administering health benefits ahps and sbhps are hoped to provide sma ll employers with the bargaining power that larger employers have in negotiating contracts with insurers in addition ahps and sbhps may be able to offer reduced priced plans thereby enabling more employers to afford to offer such cove rage reducing the number of small firm workers without access to health insurance is another goal that has often been offered for pursuing expanded group purchasing options opponents of the ahp and sbhps appro ach raise concerns that unintended negative consequences would arise negatin g the benefits that the new groups would create this concern largely relates to fears that ahps and sbhps would increase risk segmentation in the small group market for insurance by covering mostly healthy groups leading to increased instability and higher premiums for the remaining small employers who offer coverage outside of the associations this report will be updated periodically httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31963contents introduction 1 employer purchasing groups 3 s s c i t i n b s d

hoffman and gail jensen feb 1999association sponsored health plans legislation in the 109th congress introduction an estimated 458 million people were w ithout health insurance in 20041 the number of uninsured has risen in almost every year since 1989 and is expected to continue its rise in the near term most people in the us who have health insurance obtain it through their own or family mbers employer as workplace benefit small employers however are far less likely than larger employers to provide health insurance to their workers and almost half of the uninsured work for or are family members of employees who work for sma ll employers for some small employers especially those with young and transient workforces providing health insurance may not be high priority other small empl oyers would like to offer employees health insurance but face number of difficulties while the cost of insurance is cited as the primary reason for not offering the benef it there are other significant reasons for not offering coverage such as the complex ity of offering insurance to job force with high turnover and the belief that coverage is not necessary to attract workers2 legislation under consideration by the 109th congress is intended to assist small employers in offering health insurance as benefit to their workers the bills include provisions creating new groups for small firm s to join or encouraging the growth of existing groups so that small employers can band together to offer coverage to their employees these groups are intended to reduce the administrative challenges for small employers in seeking out contractin g with and administering health benefits and to provide them with the bargaining power that larger employers have in negotiating contracts with insurers in addition some of those groups may be able to offer reduced priced plans thereby enab ling more employers to afford to offer such coverage association health plans ahps and small business health plans sbhps would build on existing groups that are alr eady available to some small employers today many trade and prof essional associations offer health insurance to their

within the employee retirement and income security act of 1974 erisa4 for all group purchasing arrangements through which two or more employers purchase insurance or benefits together the purpose of

purchasing who are the players 1999 7 small number of health insurance purch asing cooperatives hipcs exist under current law like the proposed ahps they allow small employer groups to combine their risk and purchase coverage together few of the differences between hipcs and proposed ahps are that hipcs usually offer choice of insu red plans and are not exempt from state lawsa traditional insurance company or health maintenance organization hmo sometimes the employer or employers directly establish contracts with providers and administer the plan but most often it is handled through an administration service only agreement with an insurance carrier or thirdparty administrator many self insured employers or associations pur chase stoploss insurance that covers expenditures above certain aggregate claim level andor catastrophic illness or injury when individual claims reach certain dollar threshold5 employer purchasing groups the concept of employers coming together to purchase health insurance is not new many health insurance purchasing groups for employers both large and small exist today and have wide range of features there are publicly sponsored purchasing groups and private purchasing gr oups some that selfinsure and others that bargain with carriers to offer single or multiple insured products there are number of possible advantag for employers that purchase insurance through welldesigned group by pooling their insuran ce risk together the employers in the group may be able to increase their bargaining power with carriers and share administrative functions theoretically resulting in lower premium costs further employees of those firms may be able to select from larger number of plans than if their employers were to obt ain insurance independently associationbased plans have been the subject of great deal of bipartisan interest in the 109th and past congresses many hope that associationbased coverage with the right legislative encouragement could reduce the administrative costs and burden for small employers of pr oviding health insurance as workplace benefit if very effectiv some hope that the group purchasing arrangements could even reduce the number of uninsured work ers by raising small firms coverage overall or by making the choices available through small firms more attractive to workers advocates also propose that ch groups could if enough small firms in geographic area were to join provide table form of health insurance coverage for workers who switch jobs in 1997 the latest year for which we ve data about 26 of all businesses participated in some form of pooled purchas ing for smaller firms as many as one third purchased through pooled arrangemen t but this percentage drops to about 14 for firms with 500 or more employees6 the distribution of firms and employees between associationbased plans versus other types of pooled arrangements7 is not availablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31963crs4 8 long and marquis found that 80 of businesse s participating in purchasing coalition had choice of two or more plans while only 15 of businesses participating in other purchasing groups had choice of plans 9 before the 1983 addition of the mewa prov ision to erisa selffunded association sponsored plans were exempt from state regu lation of insurance the mewa provision clarified states regulatory authority over associationsponsored plans even when the coverage offered is selffunded this er isa modification was congresss response to large number of highly publicized association plan failures many states responded to the erisa change by establishing laws to regulate such plans and by requiring those plans to abide by insurance laws already on the books including solvency and funding standards some

plans for their members to purchase associations usually offer one health pl an to their membership and often selffund those plans8 while the primary purpose of most ssociationbased plans is to create economies of scale for small firms that ba nd together for those groups with below average risk another important goal is to buy lowerpriced coverage reflecting their groups lower risk since 19839 states have the authority to re gulate health coverage sold by associations even when the coverage is selffunded for associ ations with members in multiple states this sometimes means that the benefits offered must comply with the insurance laws and regulations in all of the states in which their plans are sold including solvency and funding requi rements and consum er protections little information exists on the variety and types of coverage offered through associations or on consumer satisfaction with that cove rage it is reasonable to assume based on the large numbers of people enrolled in such plans that associations are an important contributor to the insuran ce coverage of the population associations on the other hand suffer from bad reputation based on long history of highly publ icized plan failures failures that drove the 1983 statutory change clarifying states rights to regulate such plans despite the 1983 statutory change provid ing states with regulatory authority over association plans some of the problems with those plans continue to exist today as demonstrated by recent announcements of associationbased plan failures10 these plans seem to have fallen through the re gulatory cracks some states laws do not apply to outofstate associations ot her associationbased plans suffer from fundamental instability despite the states regulations intended

purchasing provisions considered by the 109th congress have at their foundation number of goals to improve the ease with which small employers purchase insurance for their employees to re duce the cost of health insurance plans offered in the small group market and to increase the number of workers in small firms who have health insurance ahps hr 525 introduced by repres entative sam johnson was passed by the house of representatives on july 26 200511 its companion bill s 406 was introduced in the senate on april 21 2005 by senator snowe hr 525s 406 would establish association health plans as generally defined above associations offering health coverage that seek certification as ahps under the authority established by hr 525s 406 w ould be required to undergo certification process established by the partment of labor dol class certification process however would apply to ahps that offer only insured coverage options while separate process woul d apply to those offering one or more selffunded options the bill would establish number of features that plans must have to become certified as ahps in addition it would exempt many such plans from state insurance law and regulatory oversight and would remove certified ahps from states authority to apply large body of insurance laws and regulations regarding benefits consumer pr otections grievance and appeals procedures premium taxation prohibitions on discrimination and fair marketing practices it would exempt certified ahps offering one or more selffunded cove rage options from states solvency and funding laws and would estab lish the federal government as having the sole regulatory authority over these entities except in the case of state laws that prohibit the exclusion of specific diseas from coverage rela to newborn and maternal minimum hospital stays and mental health parity or require prompt payment of claims12 the bill would establish nondiscrimina tion provisions prohi biting all certified ahps from rejecting less healthy applicants from coverage or targeting those individuals for higher premiums ahps offering one or more selffunded options would be subject to federa l reserve and solvency requirements that would replace those in state statutes those provisions and the other requirements of the bills would be enforced by the applicable authority sometimes the secretary of the labor and at other times the states agencies responsible for the regulation of insurancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31963crs6 to be certified as ahps association based coverage w ould be required to include the following features ahps must offer at least one insu red health coverage option unless 1 the selfinsured plan existed be fore the date of enactment of the bill 2 membership is not

particular sma ll employer would be prohibited from being based on the health status or claims experience of its plan participants or on the type of business or industry in which the employer was engaged the bill would establish requirements regarding who may participate on the board of trustees for qualified ahps offeri ng one or more selffunded options the board would have to include owners

members of the board if they constitute not more than 25 of the membership of the board and do not provide services to the plan othe r than those on behalf of the sponsor the bill would establish an associati on health plan fund from which the secretary of labor or applicable authority would make payments to ensure continued benefits on behalf of ahps in distress the funds activities would be financed by annual payments made by ahps sbhps s 1955 introduced in the senate by senators enzi nelson and burns on november 2 2005 and reporte d out of the senate hea lth education labor and pensions shelp committee on march 15 2006 would establish health plans for small employers that are similar to ahps but with number of important differences under s 1955 onl associations offering insured

process would be ava ilable to sbhps so long as only insured coverage options are offeredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31963crs7 like hr 525s 406 s 1955 would exem pt coverage offered through sbhps from some state insurance laws and would replace some of those laws with new regulatory scheme intended to achieve consistent insurance rules across states with respect to establishing premium rates ra tes for sbhps could not vary based on the health status of employees nor the type of business or industry of employers on the other hand rates would be llowed to vary based on the claims experience of the plan so long as the rates comply with more liberalized version of the harmonized rating rules as established in title ii of the bill the harmonized rating rules in title ii generally follow after transitiona l implementation peri od the recommendations of the national association of insurance commissioners naic as specified in the small employer health insurance availa bility model act adopted in 1993 sbhps would be subject to more liberal vers ion of those rules the naicrecommended variation for index rates for different classes of business and the limitation on the number of classes of businesses for ra ting purposes would not apply to sbhps with respect to benefits sbhps would be allowed to offer basic benefit plan that would be exempt from ll states benefits requirement s as long as the sbhp also offers an enhanced benefit option to participating employ ers the enhanced benefit option must include at least those cove red benefits servi ces and categories of providers as are covered by state employee health benef it plan in one of the five most populous states california texas ne w york florida and illinois the bill provides the sbhps with the sole discretion to determine the benefit plans except that the plans must be consistent with th basic benefit and nhanced benefit rules states laws in the other areas would be retained so long as they do not interfere with the plans sole discretion to dete rmine the benefits pr ovided those retained states laws could include consumer protections grieva nce and appeals procedures premium taxation prohibitions on discrimin

board of trustees with complete fiscal control and responsibility for all operations all employers who are members of the association must be eligible to enroll all geographically available coverage options must be made available upon request to ligible employers and eligible individuals cannot be excluded because of health status the bill would establish requirements regarding who may participate on the board of trustees for qualified sbhps that are the same as those for ahps in addition the bill includes provisions that would deem existing health benefits programs to be sbhps so long as as of the date of enactment the arrangement provides health care benefits for at leas t 200 participating employers has been in existence for at least 10 years and is licensed under the laws of the statehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31963crs8 finally s 1955 in cludes provisions that go beyond sbhps and that are intended to simplify the regulatory environment for all health insurers especially those that make their products available across state lines s 1955 includes plan to create national standards regarding pr icing of health plans requi red benefits rate form and filing market conduct prompt payment of claims and in ternal review requirements under these provisions states would choose to either dopt the national standards or retain their own laws for insurers that choose to become

impact of ahps and sbhps on the small group market for insurance span the continuum of possibilities advocates of the associationbased plans view re moving some or all of the state regulatory control and creating federal standards as ways to courage the growth of pooling options by releasing multistate pools from the regula tory burdens of each state in which enrollees reside these provisions would increase the options available to small employers who want to offer insurance as benefit but cannot in addition some argue that the increased risk of small firm coverage could become spread across larger groups of employers through the pools making health insurance as accessible to workers in small firms as to those in large firms most importantly their supporters say that releasing ahps and sb hps from most state benefit ma ndates will allow those groups to offer more afford able slimmed down bene fit packages that may be desirable to workers who are now uninsured opponents raise concerns about the imp act the legislation would have on adverse risk selection in the small group ma rkets and the solvency of plans and about the dols ability to ensure that enrollees are protected from enrolling in fraudulent or inept plans these issues are examined in more detail below risk segmentation insurers naturally have incentives to select the most favorable risks among the individuals or groups that are seeking coverage while rejecting others while the goal of insura nce is to spread risk policies or practices that allow beneficial risk selection have the opposite eff ect this risk selection concern is raised regarding ahps and sbhps because of provisions exempting those entities from state laws mandating that certain benefits be covered ahps are further exempted from laws limiting and defining how policies are to be priced and defining fair marketing and business practices all 50 states have such laws many of which are intended to maintain wellspread risk in the small employer markets for insurance opponents fear that ahps nd to lesser extent sbhps would attract healthier firms since firms with sicker employees would not want plans that exclude the statemandated benefits and protections if ahps sbhps attract predominantly healthy small firms out of the traditional small group market firms with less healthy employees could face even higher premiums risk selection spiral could become activated to the detriment of those left outside of the ahpssbhps and firms with sick employees or employees with sick family members would be especially at risk the ahp and sbhp bills under consid eration have take n concerns about adverse risk selection into consideration hr 525s 406 and s 1955 include the following provisions intended to reduce these incentives to discourage ahps and sbhps fro m actively pursuing healthier employee groups and rejecting or discouraging higher risk groups from joining the bills would prohibit discriminatory membership policies and plan pricing based on health status of employees or their dependents it also would pr ohibit ahps and sbhps from requiring that member employers purchase health coverage through the ahp the bills would prohibit participating employer from providinghealth insurance coverage in the individual market for any employeehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31963crs11 excluded from the ahp or sbhp which is similar to the coverage provided under the ahp or sbhp if such exclusion is based on health statusrelated factor and such employee would otherwise have been eligible for coverage under the ahp ahps would be required to offer th eir plans to all employers who are eligible to participate and also require upon request that any employer who is eligible to participate be furnished information regarding all available coverage options sbhps requirements are similar except that they apply only to employers of more than one employee further hr 525s 406 would require ahps to abide by any state laws mandating coverage of specific diseases maternal and newborn hospitaliz ation and mental health services and restrict the ability of selfinsured health plans to become qualified asahps if an association blishes new selffunded health coverage plan after enactment of the bill then it would be required to either offer membership to broad crosssection of trades and businesses or to employers represen ting one or more of listed set of higher risk occupations selfi nsured plans that exist on the date of enactment would be grandfat hered in and therefore would not have to meet these rules some consumer advocates and state regulators have raised the concern that those provisions may not be enough to pr event risk segmentation problems over time particularly under the provisions of hr 525s 406 that bill does not provide for the fair marketing rules and other patient protections as established by the states those laws are retained by s 1955 more over concerns about both bills relate to the incentives that they create for small fi rms with healthier or younger workforces to sort themselves into the ahpssbhp mandatefree plans leaving employers with older or higher risk groups to purchase th plans that include mandated benefits without the benefit of broad distribution of risk those plans could quickly become unaffordable ensuring financially secure plans the alternative solvency and funding rules established under hr 525s 406 for selfinsured ahps have raised alarms about the risk of plan failures that c ould leave plan beneficiaries uncovered when they seek health benefits the situa tion congress addressed in 1984 when the mewa provisions were added to erisa th ey claim that more insolvencies would arise if these plans are not subject to states laws regarding plan funding and solvency the ahp legislation took these concerns into consideration hr 525s 406 include the following provisions re lated to plan funding the bill would require selfinsured ahps to establish and maintain reserves in amounts recommended by qualified actuary would require ahps to establish and maintain aggregate and specificexcessstop loss insurance and solvency indemnificationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31963crs12 13 see february 5 2003 testimony of elaine l chao secretary of labor before the senate committee on small business and entrepreneurship would require ahps to establish and maintain minimum surplus in addition to claims reserves would authorize the applicable authority the dol or the state toprovide such additiona l requirements related to reserves and excessstop loss insurance as considered appropriate would establish an association health plan fund for making payments to continue excessstop loss insurance coverage and would require ahps to make annual payments of 5000 to this account and would establish solvency standards working group to makerecommendations in this area detractors however do not feel these provisions go far enough they claim that the bill should explicitly provide for surplusreserves and indemnificationstop loss insurance that grow as the size of the plan grows even though the bill provides fairly broad authority for the applicable authority to establish additional requirements because s 1955 retains states solvency and funding standards the same issues are not likely to be raised with respect to sbhps regulatory authority hr 525s 406 would establish federal laws regarding the practices structure quality and solvency of ahps that would be enforced for many plans by dol there are pros and cons for removing states regulatory authority over qua lified ahps and establishing federal body of law for these plans that would be enfor ced by dol the pros include creating single set of federal standards to apply to ahps would reduce the cost of the benefits offered because multistate plans would not have to comply with multiple states insurance laws and they would not have to include th mandated benefits as required by each of the states in which they operate very large employers that selfinsure are exempt from stateinsurance regulation instead th ey are regulated only under erisa as enforced by the dol therefore to treat selfinsuring ahps equitably advocates say they s hould also be exempt from state insurance laws since 1996 dol has added capacity for regulating and dealing with extensive new health plan requirements especially following the enactment of the health insu rance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa the agency s testified that it will be able to act in the role of regulating nd enforcing ahp law if bill should pass13 although recent report raises significant concerns researchers analyzing mewa registration filings requested by congress in 1996 to

insurance regulation v 23 issue 1 fall 2004employer purchasing arrangements suggest that dols enforcement and oversight has been inadequate14 concerns with this regulatory approach states as traditional regulator of insurance each state has department of insurance with enforcement staff and procedures already in place the dol has not until recently had experience in this capacity while dol has always been responsible for enforcing erisas health plan requirements for selfinsured plans before 1996 there were few requirements to enforce extensive body of law the body of law that states have established has been developed over the years to address market failures and to protect the consumers who purchase health plans for example the patient protection bills that were considered at the federal level over the last few years were mostly modeled after the best of the states actions in this area by removing ahps from the regulatory authority of states and regulating those plans at the federal level many of those existing state protec tions would be lost there are federal protections hr 525s 406 and in earlier proposals but they are very few compared to the typical set of state laws equity at least one of the gr oups of opponents of ahp legislation those insured plans in the sm all group market that would remain subject to state insurance laws say that they would be put at market disadvantage by being left as the only group subject to state laws and patient protections they fear that patients in need of such protections those with histories of illness or sick family members will flock to their plans and healthier groups that view themselves as not needing such protection will move to the ahps destabilizing an already unstable small group market and will cause

insurance opti on for some workers who do not purchase coverage today the congressional budg et offices cbo analysis of hr 52515 concluded that about 620000 formerly uni nsured workers and dependents would obtain coverage by 2010 under the proposed ahp s they determined that total of about 85 million people would become covere d through the ahps but all but the 620000 would already have had employerbased coverage some individuals may lose their coverage as well the cbo estimated that about 10000 workers and their dependents w ho are currently covered through small employerprovided plans would lose that coverage if the ahp provisions were to become law16 this would happen because of the relative appeal of the ahps and hm to the better risk in the market the effect on workers left in the traditional market in which the health ier groups have exited is ri sing premiums resulting in individuals andor their employer s dropping the health coverage small employers many small employers do not offer health insurance as benefit to their employees this is due to number of factors the strongest factor in the small business owners decision not to offer coverage is generally understood to be the cost of health insurance17 but there are other important factors as well some small employers are not able to undertake the many complex tasks required to offer health insurance as benefit such as reviewing plans negotiating the terms of the contract with health insurers or hmos administering the benefit and collecting andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31963crs15 paying premiums especially on behalf of workforce with high turnover the condition of the labor market may make health insurance unnecessary for attracting sufficient workforce for certain employers in tight labor market where workers are scarce the desire to offer insurance tends to increase on the other hand when labor is plentiful certain firms may have incentive to offer insurance because even without such benefit workers are available demand for insurance among sma llfirm workers may be low relative to workers in larger firms workers at small firms on average earn less and have lower wages than workers in larger firms having less income with which to purchase insurance may suppress their demand for insurance some small employers cannot meet the minimum enrollmentrequirements imposed by insurers in the small group market many insurers require small employers to enroll all or almost all workers in the health plan without sign ificant employer contribution these minimum enrollment figures are often difficult to meet finally the costs of the same benefits are likely to be higher for asmall firm than for large firm this is because small firms lack large group to spread risks among and because the administrative costs of dealing with many small firms is high relative to the cost of fewer larger firms ahps and sbhps could offer significan t advantage to small employers who are inclined to provide health insurance to their workers the small employer would not have to independently s eek coverage to compare plans and prices nor administer the benefit this is likely to make offering insurance as benefit significantly easier for those employers insurance carriers agents and brokers traditional insurance carriers are important stakeholders in the debate over the impact of encouraging association based health coverage insu rance carriers have generally rejected associationbased proposals because they fear that providing associations that offer health plans with increased risk segmenting opportunities will l eave the insurers with relatively more disadvantaged populati on they oppose legislation that creates competitive advantages for ahps and are concerned that sicker workers will be left to the traditional insurance market increasing market instability state small group market reforms have successfully achieved some stability in the small group market by establishing ratin g restrictions intended to spread the cost of high risk groups more broadly across sm all employers and by requiring insurers that drop plans to offer other alternativ those laws would not apply to ahps offering selffunded plans in effect turnin g back time to the days before small group market reforms were passed to reduce competition based on risk selection as method for

implemented subject all sbhps as well as other qualified insurers to somewhat standardized set of laws re lated to rating and benefits rules in addition the bill would authorize commission tasked with making recommendations on standardizing other areas of insurance law as well once implemented all sbhps and insurers seeking qualification could be regulated under this standardized set of provisions that would apply across all states the good will of agents is critical to the success of any purchasing group because they are small employers primary source of information on insurance matters but when pools are advanced as part of mechanism to reduce costs by eliminating administrative fees such as agents commission brokers and agents have seen them as threat to their busin ess and have refuse d to promote them regulators regulating the business of insurance has largely been left to states18 the federal government until 1996 had very few ws or regulations that directly addressed the requi rements of health insuran ce in 1996 congress passed the health insurance portability and account ability act hipaa which significantly expanded the federal role in the regulation of insurance all states on the other hand have an ex tensive body of law establishing the rules for those who sell insurance products those rules incl ude benef it mandates or rules about what insurance carriers must include in their coverage patient protections financial solvency sta ndards fair marketing practices non discrimination requirements and rating or pricing rules state regulators as represented by the national associa tion of insurance commissioners object to provisions in ahp proposals that would exempt those entities from some or most state regulatory requirements they raise concerns that the states patient protecti ons developed in response to consumer complaints about insurance practices and uns table plans will be unde rmined without federal protections to replace them at th is time the commissioners position on the harmonization plan under s 1955 is not clear other proposals other bills have been advanced that build on the idea of creating larger purchasing pools for small employers the following approaches differ from the ahp legislation in that they create incentives for employers to take advantage of pooling options but rely largely on insured plans subject to state law both bills summarized below are based on the federa l health employees benefit program fehbp model for providing health insura nce both proposals combine tax credits with pooling incentives to address the

startup costs of the pooling arrangements the small employees health benefits program act of 2005 introduced in the senate by senator durbin as s 874 nd in the house of representatives by representative kind as hr 1955 would estab lish set of plans modeled after the federal employees health benefits prog ram fehbp to be offered nationwide employers with 100 or fewer employees coul d buy insurance through these federally sponsored offerings the plans would be preempted from some state regulation although how extensive the preemption is in tended to be is unc lear specifically states laws regarding the nat ure provision or extent of coverage or benefits would not apply19 in addition the bill would blish refundable tax credit for participating employers who did not previously offer health insurance and who pay at least 60 of the health insurance premium for employees hr 2073 the small business health insurance promotion act of 2005 was introduced in the house of representatives by representative barrow it would provide for temporary tax credits for empl oyers of 50 or fewer employees offering health coverage through qua lified health pooling arrangem ents half of the amount paid for health insurance premiums thr ough the purchasing pools would be eligible for the credit as long as those employers pay half of the premiums for employees the credit would only be available for f our years after the employer begins to participate in the pooling arrangement qualified pooling arrangements could be of two types state or federal qualified state health pooling arrangements would be comprised of at least two plans offered via states that are substantially similar to health benefits coverage in any of the four largest health benefits plans offered under the fehbp program plans offered unde r these arrangements would not be pre empted from the application of states insurance laws in addition national health pooling arrangement modeled after the fehbp program would be established jointly by the secretaries of hhs and labor in consultation with the director of the office of personnel management these approaches recognize that combining tax credits with expanded purchasing groups would address two of th problems faced by uninsured workers in small firms and their employers the credits could reduce the cost of the plans for workers while the purchasing groups would make attaining plans easier for employers proposals requiring that cred its be used only for coverage purchased through purchasing groups are aimed at pr oviding those groups with an enrollment boost increasing their ability to become si gnificant market presence allowing them to negotiate more aggressively with insurers and appearing to be more appealing to
