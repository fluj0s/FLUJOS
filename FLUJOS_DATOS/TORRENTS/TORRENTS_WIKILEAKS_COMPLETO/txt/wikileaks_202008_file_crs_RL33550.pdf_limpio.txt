with china which is designated nonmarket economy country according to us trade laws combined with chinas refusal to allow its exchange rate to float has led some in congress to introduce legislation proposing to make countervailing duty laws applicable to chin and other nonmarket economy countries this legislation seeks to provide for the assessment of additional duties on imports whose production andor importation are found to be subsidized by public entity in their country of origin and are injurious to us producer of similar merchandi antidumping another kind of trade remedy action addresses products sold in the united states at less than their fair value as defined by law in similar manner although antidumping ad and countervailing duty cvd laws and procedures generally parallel each other cvd laws contain specific provisions for investigations on imports from nonmarket economy nme countries while the ad statute does provide such guidelines initial administrative attempts in 1983 to apply countervailing remedies to allegedly subsidized imports from several nme countries led to determinations by the international trade administration ita of the department of commer ce the us agency charged with determining the existence and extent of subsidies that subsidies within the meaning of the countervailing law cannot be found in nonmarket economies these ita determinations were challenged in the us court of international trade cit which held that they were not in accordance with the law reversed them and remanded the cases to the ita on appeal the us court of appeals for the federal circuit reversed and reinstated the itas original determinationsthus affirming that the ita has the discretion not to apply the cvd law to nme countries the ita has reevaluated this decision at least with regard to china arguably in response to pressure from congress in countervailing investigation on coated free sheet cfs paper the ita partially reversed its position with regard to china and on october 18 2007 made final affirmative determination of subsidies finding net countervailable subsidies ranging from 740 to 4425 percent although the international trade commission made negative determination of injury in the investigation since the ita found in the course of its investigation that it was able to identify subsidies in china other industries are expected to pursue this course of action as of this writing there are seven other active cvd investigations on products from china legislation seeking to apply countervailing action to nme countries

action against china on two fronts since the end of 2006 first on november 27 2006 the international trade administration ita of the department of commerce the administrative agency tasked with determining whether or not subsidies exist and to what extent formally initiated countervailing duty cvd case on coated free sheet paper against china 1 the agency which has not initiated countervailing case against nonmarket economy country since 1991 declined to make any determination at that time regarding the applicability of cvd law to nme countries but said that would consider that issue during the course of the investigation2 on october 18 2007 the international trade administration announced its final affirmative determination that countervailable subsidies are being provided to producers and exporters of coated free sheet cfs paper from the peoples republic of china and finding subsidy rates ranging from 740 to 4425 percent 3 in the same investigation on december 15 2006 the international trade commission itc had preliminarily determined that there was reasonable indication that us domestic industry is materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of allegedly subsidized coated paper from china which thus refers the case back to the ita for determination on subsidies 4 on december 7 2007 however the international trade commission

the united states had requested consultations with china at the world trade organization wto over chinas use of what we contend are illegal subsidies this is the first step in the wto dispute settlement process on march 20 2007 china accepted the requests of mexico australia and japan to join the consultations on november 29 2007 ustr susan schwab announced that china has agreed to terminate twelve subsidies that the united states had identified as prohibited in the memorandum of understanding mou signed by the united states and china china agreed to end these export subsidies mostly on steel wood products and information technology and import substitution subsidies designed to encourage chinese companies to buy chinese products over imports by january 1 2008 g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 countervailing duty cvd laws provide relief to domestic industries that have been or are threatened with the adverse impact of imported g oods sold in the us market that have been subsidized by foreign government or public entity the relief provided is an additional import duty placed on the subsidized imports that is equal to the estimated amount of subsidization in order for an industry to obtain relief two th ings must be determined 1 the international trade commission must find that the domestic industry is materially injured or threatened with material injury due to the imports and 2 the international trade administration ita of the department of commerce must find that the targeted imports have been subsidized6 prior to the recent cvd investigation on cfs paper the it had determined not to apply cvd laws to nonmarket economy countries including china because the agency believed that there is adequate way to measure market distortions caused by subsidies in an economy that is not based on market principles however the ita has recently determined that it may be possible to identify subsidies in china because even though it is still designated as nonmarket economy many industries in the chinese economy operate according to market principles7 for purposes of the trade remedy laws the ita is also the agency responsible for designation of countries as nonmarket economies defined by law as any foreign country that the administering authority ita determines does not operate on market principles of cost or pricing structures so that sales of merchandise in such country do not reflect the fair value of the merchandise8 nme designations are based on the extent to which 1 the countrys currency is convertible 2 its

the second largest source of us imports and its fourth largest export market the 2326 billion 2006 us trade deficit with china and the adverse impact of chinese imports on competing us industries and workers among other things has led some in congress to support more aggressive enforcement of us trade remedy laws against chinese products 10 one area of concern has been chinas alleged use of illegal subsidy programs to bolster its industries and spur export growth many us domestic producers have complained for years that they are adversely impacted by chinas subsidizing its industries but the 1984 ruling meant that there was essentially recourse to deal with the issue however china is the chief target of us antidumping action with 62 ad duty orders outsta nding and 12 ad investigations pending as of july 20 2007 in addition ad duty amounts tend to be higher for chinese imports due in part to the methodology employed by the ita when calculating ad duties for nme countries 11 another related concern involves charges by many us policymakers business people and labor representatives that chinas currency is significantly undervalued visàvis the us dollar which they allege makes chinese exports much cheaper than they would be if chinese exchange rates were determined by market forces12 in turn they argue that the undervalued currency has contributed to the us trade deficit with china and has hurt us production and employment in several manufacturing sectors such as textiles and furniture because us companies must compete with artificially lower cost goods from china 13 the issue of alleged chinese currency manipulation has led to renewed congressional interest in applying countervailing action to imports from china and in turn to finding currency manipulation

the applicability of nme classification with regard to china was determined in an ita preliminary determination of sales at less than fair value greige polyester cotton print cloth from china march 198315 on may 15 2006 the ita reaffirmed this determination and more comprehensively in an august 30 2006 memorandum in the context of an investigation on certain lined paper from china16 according to current us law any determination that foreign country is nonmarket economy country remains in effect until specifically revoked by the ita17 therefore since the ita further determined in december 1983 that subsidies could not be found in nme countries countervailing action against china had not been initiated since 1991 until the ongoing case on coated free sheet paper was presented in chinas case however the nme designation may only be used for limited time because its world trade organization wto accession package specified that the importing wto member may use methodology that is not based on strict comparison with domestic prices or costs in china for both antidumping and countervailing actions only for 15 years after the date of accession or december 11 2016 after that date the united states and other world trade organization wto members may longer use nonmarket economy or surrogate country methodology when determining price comparability in cvd or ad investigations18

in force two countervailing duty laws both provided for the imposition on imports of already dutiable but not dutyfree products that had been subsidized in their country of origin of countervailing duty in the amount of such subsidization both laws also required determination of the existence and amount of subsidization to be countervailed but one of the laws also required finding that the subsidized imports have caused or threatened to cause injury to us domestic industry the earlier of the two laws section 303 of the tariff act of 1930 repealed was minimally modified version of the countervailing law of general applicability initially enacted by the tariff act of 1897 and at the time of the two cases above applied only to products of countries other than countries under the agreement meaning 1 any country to which the ga tt subsidies and countervailing code applied or 2 had assu med codeequivalent obligations with respect to the united states or 3 the president

to countries under the agreement consisted of comprehensive provisions including detailed procedural provisions added by the trade agreements act of 1979 pl 9639 as subtitle of title vii to the tariff act of 193019 that us law implemented the provisions of the international subsidies and countervailing code agreed to in multilateral trade negotiations under the auspices of the general agreement on tariffs and trade ga tt in geneva in april 1979 under this legislation most of which is still in force in somewhat amended language the assessment of countervailing duty requiredin addition to determination that country under the agreement or private entity in such country was providing directly or indirectly subsidy with respect to the manufacture production or exportation of merchandise imported into the united statesa determination that such imports have caused or threatened with inju ry to an industry in the united states or that the establishment of an industry in the united states is thereby materially retarded the uraa in addition to repealing section 303 and omitting subsidies from private source as being countervailable also amended the countervailing duty law of the 1979 act by incorporating into it provisions comparable to those of section 303 which do not require injury determination in countervailing investigations of subsidized imports from countries other than subsidies agreement countries the latter have been defined in the same waywith appropriate updating technical changesas the countries under the agreement under the trade agreements act of 1979

carbon steel wire rod imports from czechoslovakia and poland21 were initiated on december 13 1983 pursuant to petitions filed with the international trade administration on november 23 1983 by four us steel manufacturers the petitions alleged that manufacturers producers or exporters of the product in question in either country received public benefits within the meaning of the countervailing law specifically the petitions for countervailing action alleged that bounties or grants were provided in both countries in the form of multiple exchange rate system and partial hardcurrency retention program for exporting firms in addition czechoslovakia allegedly had in effect system of industryspecific trade conversion coefficients for the official exchange rate and tax exemption for foreign

countries to be countries not under the agreement and conducted the countervailing procedure according to provisions of section 303 hence without the need for determining injury in addition the ita considered both of them nonmarket economy nme countries but specifically pointed out that it had not yet resolved the question whether the countervailing duty law either section 303 or the countervailing duty provision of title vii applies to nonmarket economy countries as such although this issue had arisen almost year earlier in connection with cvd investigation of textile imports from china22 it was not resolved then because the cvd petition was withdrawn by the petitioners meaning that the investigation terminated23 the issue however was subsequently addressed in the preliminary determinations in the two carbon steel wire rod cases24 in both cases the ita found that nonmarket economy countries are not exempted per from the countervailing duty law since section 303 by its statutory terms as well as based on its legislative history applied to any country weighing its own tentative initial literal interpretation of the country applicability of the provision and the arguments introduced earlier in the consideration of the china textiles casefocusing on the difference in the effects of government intervention in market and nonmarket economythe ita however was disposed to not exclude nonmarket economies from its application without further review in each particular case the ita consequently had its first opportunity to determine preliminarily whether practices by government of socalled nonmarket economy country confer countervailable benefits focusing on prices as the key elements of subsidization the ita in the ensuing detailed analysis of the situation in both countries pointed out that in nonmarket economies central planners typically set the prices without any regard to their economic value as such these prices do not reflect scarcity or abundance for example when product is scarce in ma rket economy its price will increase in nonmarket economy however the price of scarce good will not go up unless the central planners mandate new higher price even if we can identify an internally set price that price does not have the same meaning as price in market economy 49 fr 6770 the ita then analyzed in detail the alleged subsid ization programs by determining first whether they would confer subsidy in market econom and then whether the conclusion would be different for an nme country the ita concluded preliminarily that multiple exchange rates currency retention schemes trade conversion coefficients and price equalization payments do not confer bounty or grant either in market or in nonmarket economies that the polish adjustment coefficient program did not constitute bounty or grant within the meaning of the law and that the agency had not received sufficient timely information on the czechoslovak tax exemption program to make determination on the basis of these findings the ita preliminarily determined that while congress did not exempt nme countries as such from the cvd law the alleged czechoslovak and polish practices were not providing bounties or grants within the meaning of the cvd law as the cvd law required the ita continued both investigations into their final phase 22 48 fr 46600 23 48 fr

unresolved issue of the application of the cvd law to nonmarket economy countries in its detailed and comprehensive final determinations in the two carbon steel wire rod cases25 the ita first concluded that congress never has confronted directly the question of whether the countervailing duty law applies to nme countries it pointed out that congress did not even debate much less legislate on this issue either in 1974 when the concept of nonmarket economy countries was introduced into trade legislation and remedies were provided specifically with respect to imports from them and congress also amended the cvd law or in 1979 when the cvd law was thoroughly restructured and the application of unfairpricing remedial legislation was dealt with in detail but only with respect to dumping by nme countries the ita found it significant that in the trade act of 1974 congress enacted remedial provisions dealing specifically with injurious imports fr om statecontrolledeconomy or communist countriesboth terms functionally equivalent to that of nonmarket economy countries used in another part of the same actin the context of antidumping and market disruption nme specific importrelief action but not with respect to countervailing action in this pointed out the ita citing the senate report on the 1974 act srept 931298 congress recognized the need for special remedial legislation applicable to statecontrolledeconomy countries because traditional fair or unfairtrade remedies were insufficient or have proven inappropriate or ineffective because in statecontrolledeconomy countries supply and demand forces do not operate to produce prices and because of the difficulty of the application of such remedies to products from statecontrolled economies cited at 49 fr 19373 likewise in the legislative history of the thorough restructuring of the cvd law by the trade agreements act of 1979 there was nothing regarding any aspect of the application of the cvd law to nme countries although the subsidies and countervailing code of the general agreement on tariffs and trade implemented for the united states by that act in article 15 explicitly permits gatt signatories to regulate unfairly priced imports from nme countries under either antidumping or countervailing duty legislation 49 fr 19373 the ita also consulted with other us government and academic sources which briefly concluded that it is only remotely possible to identify and quantify subsidies in nmes most of the analysis used thus far for subsidies is entirely inapplicable theoretically any given sale may be subsidized or not but since there is market reference point it is idle to speak in such terms to one author the countervailing duty law appears to require identification and measurement of resource transfer from the state to the producer but this is simply not measurable event in the typical nonmarket economy and the extent to which nonmarket system can be said to be subsidising will always be unclear all cited at 49 fr 19374 claiming broad discretion in this matter earlier recognized by the judiciary the ita concluded that bounty or grant within the meaning of the countervailing duty law cannot be found in an nme 26 the ita also determined that czechoslovakia and poland were nmes since they operated on principles of nonmarket cost or pricing structures so that sales or offers for sale of merchandise do not reflect the value of the merchandise accordingly the ita determined that 25 czechoslovakia 49 fr 19370 poland 49 fr 19374 26 49 fr

not receive bounties or grants and issued effective may 7 1984 final negative countervailing duty determinations27 shortly before the completion of the countervailing duty investigations of carbon steel wire rod two us chemical manufacturers filed on march 30 1984 petitions alleging subsidization of potassium chloride potash imported from the german democratic republic and the soviet union whereupon the respective investigations were initiated as of april 26 198428 because of the subsequent determination in the carbon steel wire rod cases that bounties or grants within the meaning of the countervailing duty law cannot be found in an nme and both countries were determined to be nmes the ita on june 6 1984 rescinded the two potassium chloride potash investigations and dismissed the relevant petitions29 g343g351g351g343g561 since the conclusion of the wire rod and potash countervailing duty cases see next section the ita has not initiated any countervailing investigations of allegedly subsidized imports from nme countries with one specialized exception based on petition filed on october 1 1991 the ita on november 13 1991 initiated countervailing duty investigation of ceiling and oscillating fans imported from china 30 the petitioner claimed that while china was an nme country the prc fan sector operates substantially pursuant to market principles and that the cvd law should apply the petition was apparently based on the fact that ita had meanwhile procedurally introduced into antidumping investigations of imports from nme countries the concept of marketoriented industry moi as means of determining whether an industry in an nme country is sufficiently marketoriented ie free from state control to enable the ita to use the economic data provided by the industry itself rather than those of surrogate marketeconomy country in determining fair market value of the imported product subject to the investigation the petitioners in the chinese fan cvd case claimed that the chinese fan industry was an moi with dependable selfprovided data including those relating to subsidization and hence could objectively be subjected to countervailing investigation in its preliminary investigation 31 the ita concluded that the prices of several inputs are not marketdetermined and hence the industry cannot be considered an moi but believed that the information used as the basis for the determination should be verified and did not rescind the investigation in its final more comprehensive phase of the investigation the ita concluded that the prices of several significant inputs are not marketdetermined and therefore the pc fans industry is not an moi as result the cvd law cannot be applied to the prc fan industry and the ita issued final

following the ita s negative determinations in the carbon steel wire rod cases and the dismissal of the potassium chloride cases the petitioners challenged those actions in the us court of international trade cit the court consolidated both suits and on july 30 1985 held that countervailing duty law covers countries with nonmarket economies in light of fact that governmental subsidies that are target of law may be found in nonmarket economies as well as in market economies p 548 the cit reversed the carbon steel wire rod cases and remanded them to the ita for determinations consistent with the courts opinion and set aside the rescissions of the potash cases and ordered that their investigations be resumed p 557 the cit in its detailed opinion addressed each of the four grounds on which the ita had based its determination of nonapplicability of countervailing procedure to nme countries 1 the view that subsidy cannot be conferred in nonmarket economy because subsidy by definition means an act which distorts the operation of free market both italics in the original 2 congressional silence on the issue and the apparent preference for other trade remedial procedures 3 consensus of academic opinion as to nonapplicability of cvd law to nme countries and 4 the itas asserted broad discretion to determine the existence or nonexistence of subsidies the cit held that the ita had made basic error in interpreting and administering the cvd law by concluding that in its opinion subsidies cannot be found in nonmarket economies the court emphasized that absent clear legislative intent to the contrary the plain language of the cvd law must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive p 551 hence it applies to any country and therefore does not allow for any per exemptions of any political entity fact that the ita itself appears to have recognized in its determinations the ita in the courts view instituted by administrative fiat major exemption for countries with nonmarket economies by redefining the term subsidy as distortion of the operation solely of market economy thereby attemp ting to amend the cvd law p 552 although the ita had recognized that the cvd law did not allow for per exemptions see p 3 it claimed that countries with nonmarket economies ie political entities of certain type were exempt because of their nme status illogically contradicting the meaning of the cvd statute the difficulties of the cvd law said the cit are not those of its meaning but rather problems of measurement which are precisely within the expertise of the agency the ita has the authority and ability to detect patterns of regularity and investigate beneficial deviations from those patternsand it must do so regardless of the form of the economy p 554 as to the itas argument that congress silence on the applicability of the cvd law to nme countries and its apparent preference for other remedial measuresamong them antidumping 33 this report presents the relevant c ourts views in highly summarized form and strives not to omit any of their salient points however it is also far from being legal analys is of such views if the detail or legal analysis of the

countriesthe cit pointed out that those measures have been established for remedying specific trade problems other than subsidization moreover said the court article 15 of the gatt subsidies and countervailing code implemented for the united states by the trade agreements act of 1979 clearly gives country the choice of using subsidy law or antidumping law for imports from country with statecontrolled economy p 556 the court summarily dismissed the ita s recourse to the views of economic academia that the government of country with nonmarket ec onomy cannot show what amounts to favoritism towards the manufacture production or export of particular merchandise the idea violates common sense and conflicts with rational construction of the law p 554555 itas alleged assertion of its broad discretion to determine the existence or nonexistence of subsidies p 550 was not specifically addressed by the court it was however implicitly challenged in the lengthy critique of

the us government appealed the cit decision to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit whichfocusing on the potash casesreviewed in detail the legislative history and development of relevant trade remedy laws and concluded that the cvd statute under which these investigations were conducted section 303 of the tariff act of 1930 had remained substantially unchanged from the first general countervailing duty statute the c ongress enacted in 1897 since congress had not defined the terms bounty and grant as used in section 303 the appellate court concluded it could not answer the question whether that section applies to nonmarket economies by reference to the language of the statute nor could it on the other hand answer it by concluding that on the basis of the statutory language congress has not attempted to exclude nonmarket economies from what the court believed to be the sweeping reach of the section since at the time of the original enactment there were nonmarket economies congress had occasion to address the issue hence it remained for the court to determine as best it could whether when congress enacted the countervailing duty law in 1897 it would have applied the statute to nonmarket economies if they then had existed p 1314 based on the relevant aspects of the potash case the appellate court concluded that the economic incentives and benefits provided by the soviet union and east germany to their exports of potash to the united states did not constitute bounties or grants under the applicable cvd law p 1314 the court also said it followed precedent which recognized that the agency administering the countervailing duty law ie the ita has broad discretion in determining the existence of bounty or grant under that law and further th at it could not say that the administrations conclusion that the benefits the soviet union and the german democratic republic provided for the exports of potash to the united states were not bounties or grants under section 303 was unreasonable not in accordance with the w or an abuse of discretion p 1318 in conclusion the court of appeals on september 18 1986 vacated the cit order insofar as it

the ita generally uses these data to calculate ad or cvd dutiesin which case the duties assessed are generally the most favorable to the respondent if these data are not available the ita may use facts ava ilable including data gathered from the petitioner or other external sources which may result in less favorable hig herduty margins than if the respondents data were used an adverse inference may be drawn if the ita finds that the respondent is obstructing or not cooperating with an investigation in these cases the ita may use the least advantageous figures among the facts available when calculating the duty amounts which generally results in much higher ad or cvd duties see department of commerce import administration antidumping manual chapter 6fair value comparisons

concluded that while china has enacted significant and sustained economic reforms the prc government has preserved significant role for the state in the economy37 even though the ita stood by its previous decision reaffirming chinas status as an nme country the agency also found that chinas presentday economy is significantly different from the sovietstyle economies at issue in the georgetown steel case where prices are set by central planners losses suffered by production and foreign trade enterprises are routinely covered by govern ment transfers investment decisions are controlled by the state money and credit are allo cated by the central planners the wage bill is set by the government access to foreign currency is restricted private ownership is limited to consumer goods 38 in contrast the ita determined in its march 29 2007 analysis that market forces actually determine the prices of more than 90 of products in china that wages seem to be negotiated as opposed to governmentset foreign currency is more accessible and private ownership rights are acknowledged by the chinese government39 at the same time the current prc government has instead opted to shrink the role of the state in some areas while preserving it in others but never ceding fundamental control over the economy to market forces completely 40 therefore the ita concluded even though china remains an nme country the current state of chinas economy permits the agency to determine whether the chinese government has bestowed benefit on chinese producer and whether any such benefit is specific41

antidumping investigations on cfs paper44 summary of the reasons for this determination follows given the modest imminent increase in production capacity in china and indonesia the absence of any potential for product shifting the lack of evidence of significant price effects from these imports during the period examined the moderate inventories of the subject merchandise the absence of negative effects of the subject imports on the development and production efforts of the domestic industry and our conclusion that the domestic industry is not vulnerable we find that material injury by reason of subject imports will not occur absent issuance of antidumping and countervailing duty orders against subject imports from china and indonesia we therefore conclude that the domestic cfsp industry is not threatened with material injury by reason of imports from china and indonesia 45 since the itc issued final negative cvd determination the investigation was terminated and all

in the wto dispute settlement process48 on march 9 2007 ustr susan schwab announced that china had agreed to terminate one of the nine challenged subsidy programsa regulation implemented by chinas central bank that allowed large exporters to take advantage of discounted loans not available to other companies 49 in its formal request for consultations the united states pointed to several tax laws including nine specifically cited laws and other measures that appear to be used by the chinese government in order to provide tax refunds or exemptions to chinese businesses if they purchase domestically produced goods instead of foreign products provided they meet certain export performance criteria 50 the ustr stated that these subsidies can distort trade conditions for us manufacturers small and mediumsized enterprises smes and their workers in multiple industries they are available across manufacturing sectors so they can inhibit us exports of huge range of products to china and provide an unfair advantage to chinas exports in the united states and around the world51 on february 28 2007 mexico also requested talks with china on the same list of subsidies52 on march 20 2007 china accepted the requests of australia japan and the united states to join in consultations with mexico on the subsidies issue as well as the request of australia japan and mexico to join with the

legislation to ensure we are combating all unfair tradewhether it is dumping or subsidiesthat puts american workers farmers and businesses at disadvantage 55 congress may want to consider some of the following issues as it continues to address application of trade remedies to china first the itas decision that it can identify subsidies in china has effect on chinas standing as nonmarket economy country or on the nme designations of other countries it also does not affect itas ruling that it is unable to find subsidies in nme countries other than china therefore congress may want to consider language ie that in hr 782 hr 1229 and s 796 to ensure that the cvd laws and actions specifically apply to other nme countries as well as china vietnam another us trading partner of increasing significance is also an nme country there are two antidumping orders against products from vietnam as of this writingon frozen fish filets and frozen or canned warmwater shrimp 56 on the other hand the amount of trade with the other remaining nme countries armenia azerbaijan belarus georgia kyrgyz republic moldova tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan is not particularly significant at present and to date there are outstanding ad orders or other significant trade disputes with these countries second there are currently specific factors to consider or methodologies provided for administrative authorities to use when identifying subsidies in nonmarket economies in contrast the antidumping statute does provide such methodology for determining normal value in nme countriesincluding the authority to calculate expenses using inputs and factors of production in market economy country considered appropriate to the administering authority 57 therefore congress may consider such methodologies as in hr 782 s 364 and s 796 to apply to all nme countries as well as china possibly in cluding guidelines similar to those in the antidumping statute it is important to

the use of the thirdcountry data methodology to calculate the amount of dumping58 if china retained its nme status and subsidies were found on targeted merchandise for which ad duties were already in place some of the companion ad duties might have to be revised downward in order to avoid double counting or the possible inclusion of export subsidy amounts in certain ad duty calculations in june 2005 report the government accountability office gao stated that this consideration introduces level of uncertainty about the magnitude of the total level of protection that would be applied to chinese products and may result in combined rates that are lower than might be expected 59 therefore determination by ita that it can target subsidies in china or legislation amending the statute could result in the unintended consequence of an overall reduction in the amount of protection provided 60 however since the two remedies address substantially different forms of price manipulation it is also possible that some u s industries that had previously not been able to obtain relief through the ad statute may be able to do so through cvd procedures 58 government accountability office us
