nikitin analysts in nonproliferation foreign affairs defense and trade division pakistans nuclear weapons proliferation and security issues summary pakistans nuclear arsenal consists of approximately 60 nuclear warheads pakistan continues fissile material production for weapons and is adding to its weapons production facilities and delivery vehicles pakistan reportedly stores its warheads unassembled with the fissile core separate from nonnuclear explosives and these are stored separately from their delivery vehicles pakistan does not have stated nuclear policy but its minimum credible deterrent is thought to be primarily deterrent to indian military action command and control structures have been dramatically overhauled since september 11 2001 and export controls and personnel security programs have been put in place since the 2004 revelations about pakistans top nuclear scientists aq khans international proliferation network pakistani and some us officials argue that islamabad has taken number of steps to prevent further proliferation of nuclearrelated technologies and materials and improve its nuclear security number of important initiatives such as strengthened export control laws improved personnel security and international nuclear security cooperation programs have improved the security situation in recent years current instability in pakistan has called the extent and durability of these reforms into question some observers fear radical takeover of government that possesses nuclear bomb or proliferation by radical sympathizers within pakistans nuclear complex in case of breakdown of controls while us and pakistani officials express confidence in controls over pakistans nuclear weapons it is uncertain what impact continued instability in the country will have on these safeguards for broader discussion see crs report rl33498 pakistan us relations by k alan kronstadt this report will be updated contents background 1 nuclear weapons 1 delivery vehicles 3 nuclear doctrine 4 command and control 5 security concerns 6 proliferation threat 10 pakistans response 11 pakistans nuclear weapons proliferation and security issues background the political instability and imposition of emergency rule in pakistan on november 3 2007 and the assassination of former prime minister benazir bhutto on december 27 2007 has called attention to the issue of the security of pakistans nuclear weapons and how the world can be assured they remain in safe hands during potential transitions of power some observers fear scenarios in which pakistans strategic nuclear assets are given to or stolen by qaeda sympathizers or other terrorists or future government in nuclear pakistan that might be hostile to the united states measures to improve the security of pakistans nuclear weapons have been on going and include some cooperation with the united states since pakistan and indias nuclear tests in 1998 increased attention has been given to reducing the risk of nuclear war in south asia the two countries have most recently come to the brink of fullscale war in 1999 and 2002 over kashmir and realizing the dangers have developed some nuclear risk reduction measures to prevent accidental war1 pakistan has also developed its command and control systems and improved security of military and civilian nuclear facilities after the 2004 revelations of an extensive international nuclear proliferation network run by pakistans abdul qadeer khan as well as possible connections between pakistani nuclear scientists and qaeda the pakistani government has made additional efforts to improve export controls and monitor nuclear personnel the main security challenges for pakistans nuclear arsenal are keeping the integrity of the command structure ensuring physical security and preventing illicit proliferation from insiders nuclear weapons pakistans nuclear energy program dates back to the 1950s but it was the loss of east pakistan now bangladesh in bloody war with india that reportedly triggered political decision in january 1972 just one month later to begin secret nuclear weapons program defense against india is said to be the primary motivation for pakistans nuclear deterrent observers point to the peaceful nuclear explosion by india in 1974 as the pivotal moment which gave urgency to the program pakistans path to the bomb was through uranium enrichment technology mastered by the mid1980s pakistan gained technology from many sources this extensive assistance is reported to have included among other things uranium enrichment 1 see crs report rl31589 nuclear threat reduction measures for india and pakistan by sharon squassoni crs2 technology from europe blueprints for small nuclear weapon from china and missile technology from china in 1989 the united states learned that pakistan had assembled nuclear warhead2 which then led to cutoff in military and financial aid under the pressler amendment3 when india conducted nuclear weapon tests on may 12 1998 pakistans government responded two weeks later on may 28 and may 30 with six tests at the chagai hills test site in western pakistan test yields were about 10 kilotons and 5 kilotons according to seismic analysis4 the united states imposed additional sanctions after the tests these were lifted after the september 11th 2001 attacks most observers estimate that pakistan has enough nuclear material highly enriched uranium and small amount of plutonium for about 60 nuclear weapons5 pakistans nuclear warheads use an implosion design with solid core of highly enriched uranium heu approximately 1520 kg per warhead6 pakistan reportedly continues to produce highlyenriched uranium for weapons at rate of at least 100 kg per year7 pakistan has also pursued plutoniumbased warheads since the 1990s and continues to produce plutonium for weapons pakistan has received chinese assistance for its plutonium program the 4050 megawatt heavy water khushab plutonium production reactor has been operating since 1998 second heavy water reactor is being built at khushab which will at least double pakistans plutonium production capacity8 pakistans nuclear weapons complex also includes the 300 megawatt reactor at chasma reprocessing plant at chasma fuel fabrication plant 2 1985 national intelligence council report stated that pakistan probably has workable design for nuclear explosive device and was probably year or two away from capacity to produce enough highly enriched uranium for such device 3 the pressler amendment august 1985 linked aid and military sales to two certification conditions 1 that pakistan not possess nuclear explosive device and 2 that new aid will reduce significantly the risk that pakistan will possess such device

pakistan air force and surfacetosurface missiles under the pakistan army pakistan could deliver its nuclear weapons using f16s purchased from the united states provided modifications are made it is widely believed that pakistan has made modifications to the f16s previously sold to them11 concerns have been raised about the impact of these sales on the strategic balance in south asia12 the us government maintains that the sale of additional f16s to pakistan will not alter the regional balance of power13 the contract for provision of an additional 36 aircraft was signed on september 30 2006 as was the contract for the weapons for those aircraft and contract to perform the midlife upgrade on pakistans f16ab model aircraft pakistans f16 fleet will therefore be expanded but it is unclear what portion of the fleet will be capable of nuclear mission mirage iii and v aircraft could also be used although would have limited range a5s may have been modified to carry nuclear payload14 after

weapons is compartmentalized and includes strict operational security pakistans command and control system is based on c4i2sr command control communication computers intelligence information surveillance and reconnaissance the system has three components the national command authority nca the strategic plans division spd and the strategic forces commands23 the nca was created in 2000 and for the first time the nuclear program was under military control with oversight the spd acts as the secretariat for the nca and coordinates with the strategic forces commands the army air force and navy each have their respective strategic force command but operational control remains with the nca the authority to launch nuclear strike requires consensus within the nca the nca is 10member body which consists of the president prime minister the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff the ministers of defense interior and finance the directorgeneral of the strategic plans division and the commanders of the army air force and navy24 the nca chairman who is the president of pakistan casts the final vote25 on december 13 2007 president musharraf formalized these authorities and structure

that the timing of this ordinance was meant to help the command and control system weather political transitions and potentially preserve the militarys strong control over the system the ordinance also addresses the problems of the proliferation of nuclear expertise and personnel reliability it outlines punishable offenses related to breach of confidentiality or leakage of secured information gives the spd authority to investigate suspicious conduct states that punishment can be up to 25 years imprisonment and applies to both serving and retired personnel including military personnel notwithstanding any other laws as result pakistani authorities say that the ordinance should strengthen their control over strategic organizations and their personnel security concerns pakistans nuclear weapons are reportedly stored unassembled with the fissile core separated from the nonnuclear explosives these components are stored separately from delivery vehicles department of defense report says that pakistan can probably assemble the weapons fairly quickly27 nevertheless separate storage may provide layer of protection against accidental launch or prevent theft of an assembled weapon28 as the united states prepared to launch an attack on the afghan taliban after 911 president musharraf reportedly ordered pakistans nuclear arsenal be redeployed to at least six secret new locations29 this action came at time of uncertainly about the future of the region including the direction of uspakistan relations in president musharrafs speech justifying his decision to assist the united states against the taliban he cited protection of pakistans nuclear and missile assets as one of the reasons for the dramatic policy shift30 pakistans leadership was uncertain whether the us would decide to conduct military strikes against pakistans nuclear assets if it did not do so these events in combination with the 1999 kargil crisis the 2002 conflict with india at the line of

mating the warheads with delivery systems32 in the fall of 2007 and early 2008 pakistan faced another crucial moment in its history and some observers have recently expressed concern about the security of pakistans arsenal if political instability persists33 former prime minister benazir bhutto said in an interview on november 5 2007 that while president musharraf says he is firm control of the nuclear arsenal she is afraid this control could weaken due to instability in the country34 similarly michael krepon of the henry l stimson center has argued that prolonged period of turbulence and infighting among the countrys president prime minister and army chief could jeopardize the armys unity of command which is essential for nuclear security35 us military officials have also expressed concern about the security of pakistans nuclear weapons36 director general of the international atomic energy agency mohamed baradei has expressed fears that radical regime could take power in pakistan and thereby acquire nuclear weapons37 experts also worry that while nuclear weapons are currently under firm control with warheads disassembled technology could be sold off by insiders during worsened crisis38 deputy secretary of state john d negroponte in testimony to congress on november 7 2007 expressed confidence that pakistans nuclear weapons were not at risk he said he

of the countrys nuclear weapons is good thing because thats an institution in pakistan that has in fact withstood many of the political changes over the years president musharraf has said that pakistans nuclear weapons are under total custodial controls40 the security of pakistans nuclear weapons could also be jeopardized by another conflict between india and pakistan krepon argued explaining that an escalating war with nuclear forces in the field would increase the probability of accidents miscalculations and the use of nuclear weapons this is because when tensions rise precipitously with india the readiness level of pakistans nuclear deterrent also rises because the geographical coordinates of pakistans main nuclear weapon storage sites missile and air bases can be readily identified from satellites and therefore targeted by opposing forces the dictates of deterrence mandate some movement of launchers and weapons from fixed locations during crises nuclear weapons on the move are inherently less secure than nuclear weapons at heavily guarded storage sites weapons and launchers in motion are also more susceptible to insider threats and accidents41 such war would also place stress on the armys unity of command krepon added the issue of us plans to secure pakistani nuclear weapons in case of loss of control by the pakistani government were famously addressed in secretary of state condoleeza rices confirmation hearing in january 2005 in response to question by senator john kerry asking what would happen to pakistans nuclear weapons if there was radical islamic coup in islamabad secretary rice answered we have noted this problem and we are prepared to try to deal with it42 on november 12 2007 responding to press reports about this contingency the pakistan foreign office said suffice it to say that pakistan possesses adequate retaliatory capacity to defend its strategic assets and sovereignty43 the foreign office spokesman also emphasized

pakistan nuclear security assistance soon after september 11th 200145 us assistance to pakistan which must comply with nonproliferation guidelines has included the sharing of best practices and technical measures that could help prevent unauthorized or accidental use of nuclear weapons as well as contribute to physical security of storage facilities and personnel reliability46 some press reports say that the united states provided pakistan with permissive action links pals in 2003 although former pakistani military officials have said pakistan has developed pals for their warheads without assistance47 pals require code to be entered before weapon can be detonated pakistan reportedly requires the standard twoman rule to authenticate access to nuclear release codes standard practice in nuclear weapon states48 security at nuclear sites in pakistan is the responsibility of 10000member security force commanded by twostar general former deputy secretary of state richard armitage confirmed that there has been us assistance in this area in recent interview he said the us was unlikely to intervene militarily in crisis in pakistan because we have spent considerable time with the pakistani military talking with them and working with them on the security of their nuclear weapons i think most observers would say that they are fairly secure they have pretty sophisticated mechanisms to guard the security of those49 indian national security adviser m k narayanan said that the pakistani nuclear arsenal is safe and has adequate checks and balances50 while officials and experts have expressed some assurance as to the security of nuclear weapons themselves the security of nuclear materials and knowhow also pose significant proliferation challenge 44 pentagon readies

press trust of india december 16 2007 crs10 proliferation threat51 many observers are concerned that other states or terrorist organizations could obtain material or expertise related to nuclear weapons from pakistan52 beginning in the 1970s pakistan used clandestine procurement networks to develop its nuclear weapons program former pakistani nuclear official aq khan subsequently used similar network to supply libya north korea and iran with materials related to uranium enrichment53 alqaeda has also sought assistance from the khan network according to former director of central intelligence george tenet the united states received fragmentary information from an intelligence service that in 1998 osama bin laden had sent emissaries to establish contact with the network54 other pakistani sources could also provide nuclear material to terrorist organizations according to 2005 report by the commission on the intelligence capabilities of the united states regarding weapons of mass destruction alqaeda had established contact with pakistani scientists who discussed development of nuclear devices that would require hardtoobtain materials like uranium to create nuclear explosion55 tenet explains that these scientists were affiliated with different organization than the khan network the current status of pakistans nuclear export network is unclear although most official reports indicate that at the least it has been damaged considerably director of national intelligence john d negroponte implied that the network had been dismantled when he asserted in january 11 2007 statement to the senate select committee on intelligence that pakistan had been major source of nuclear proliferation until the disruption of the aq khan network56 however when asked about the networks current status during july 25 2007 senate foreign relations committee hearing undersecretary for political affairs nicholas burns replied that 51 this section was prepared by paul

network exists but its my understanding based on our conversations with the pakistanis that the network has been fundamentally dismantled but to say that there are elements in pakistan im not sure i could say that similarly the londonbased international institute for strategic studies found in may 2007 report that at least some of khans associates appear to have escaped law enforcement attention and could resume their blackmarket business57 asked about pakistans cooperation in investigating the network burns acknowledged that the united states has not had personal consistent access to khan but added that he did not have all the details of everything weve done similarly the international atomic energy agency iaea has not yet been able to interview khan directly according to an agency official however islamabad has responded to written questions from the iaea and has been cooperative in its investigation of irans nuclear program58 khan himself told dawn news tv may 29 2008 that he would not cooperate with us or iaea investigators pakistani foreign office spokesperson told reporters in may 2006 that the government considered the khan investigation closed position that islamabad continues to maintain pakistans response undersecretary burns testified in july that the bush administration has told the pakistani government that it is its responsibility to make sure that neither the khan network nor similar organization resurfaces in the country since the revelations about the khan network pakistan appears to have increased its efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation but whether and to what extent these efforts have been successful is not yet clear it is worth noting that because khan conducted these activities as government official they are not necessarily symptomatic of failure of islamabads export controls pakistani officials argue that islamabad has taken number of steps to prevent further proliferation of nuclearrelated technologies and materials59 for example pakistan adopted new national export controls legislation in september 2004 this legislation includes requirement that the government issue control lists for goods technologies material and equipment which may contribute to designing development stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons and related delivery systems according to february 2008 presentation by zafar ali director of 57 see

to be periodically updated include items controlled by multilateral export control regimes such as the nuclear suppliers group the australia group and the missile technology control regime61 the export controls legislation also includes catchall clause which requires exporters to notify the government if they are aware or suspect that goods or technology are intended by the enduser for use in nuclear or biological weapons or missiles capable of delivering such weapons62 the legislation includes several other important elements such as enduse and enduser certification requirements and new penalties for violators since its adoption pakistan has established the secdiv and an associated oversight board the secdiv is responsible for formulating rules and regulations for implementing the legislation the board is comprised of officials from multiple agencies and is headed by pakistans foreign secretary islamabad says that it has also taken several other steps to improve its nuclear security for example the government announced in june 2007 that it is implementing national security action plan with the iaeas assistance that same month pakistan also joined the us and russianled global initiative to combat nuclear terrorism as noted above the december 2007 national command authority ordinance also includes measures to prevent the spread of nuclearrelated materials and expertise the united states has also provided relevant assistance to pakistan burns described several such efforts in his july testimony63 and according to an october 60 presentation given to partnership for global security workshop meeting the nuclear security challenge in pakistan february 2122 2008 httpwwwpartnershipforglobalsecurityorgdocumentszafar_exportpdf 61 the nuclear suppliers group is multilateral voluntary group of nuclear supplier states which have agreed to coordinate their exports of civilian nuclear technology and materials in order to prevent importers from using them to produce nuclear weapons the australia group is voluntary informal exportcontrol arrangement through which participating countries coordinate their national export controls to limit the supply of chemicals and biological agents as well as related equipment technologies and knowledge to countries and nonstate entities suspected of pursuing chemical or biological weapons capabilities the missile technology control regime is an informal voluntary arrangement in which participants agree to adhere to common export policy guidelines applied to an annex that lists items related to the proliferation of ballistic and cruise missiles rockets and unmanned air vehicles capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction 62 the chemical weapons convention implementation ordinance of 2000 regulates the import and export of chemicals in accordance with the convention 63 burns mentioned pakistans participation in the container security initiative and the secure freight initiative under these programs the united states and pakistan worked together to install screening and radiation detection equipment to scan usbound cargo he also stated that the department of energy is working with pakistan on radiation source security and is in the process of finalizing an agreement to install radiation detection equipment at pakistani ports and border crossings crs13 us government accountability office report islamabad was during fiscal years 20032006 the secondlargest recipient of bilateral us assistance designed to improve target countries export controls pakistan received such assistance from the departments of state energy and homeland security64 pakistani officials participating in an april 2007 partnership for global security workshop argued that islamabad has
