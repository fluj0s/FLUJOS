division donald j marples specialist in public finance government and finance division httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22689 summary hedge funds and private equity funds are investment pools generally available only to institutions and wealthy individuals private equity funds acquire ownership stakes in other companies and seek to profit by improving operating results or through financial restructuring hedge funds follow many strategies investing in any market where managers see profit opportunities the two kinds of funds are generally structured as partnerships the fund managers act as general partners while the outside investors are limited partners general partners are compensated in two ways first to the extent that they invest their own capital in the funds they share in the appreciation of fund assets second they charge the limited partners two kinds of annual fees percentage of total fund assets and percentage of the funds earnings the latter performance fee is called carried interest and is treated as capital gains under current tax rules several bills relating to the hedge fund issue have been introduced to date in the th 110 congress s 1624 would require private equity firms organized as publicly traded partnerships to pay corporate income tax hr 2834 hr 3996 and hr 6275 would make carried interest taxable as ordinary income hr 4351 and hr 6049 would include in gross income the portion of carried interest currently deferred offshore in foreignchartered funds in addition to summarizing the legislation this report provides background on hedge funds and private equity and summarizes the tax issues it will be updated as legislative developments warrant background private equity private equity firms buy and sell other businesses the industry can be roughly divided into two parts venture capital and buyout funds venture capitalists invest in small startup firms providing financing and management expertise their payoff usually comes when the firms are sold either by selling shares into the crs2 public stock market through an initial public offering ipo or by an outright sale to larger company buyout funds acquire ownership stakes in businesses of all sizes from small concerns to industrial giants like chrysler the bestknown form of transaction is the leveraged buyout lbo in which private equity investors use the proceeds of debt issued by the target company to acquire all the outstanding shares of public company which then becomes private the lbo deal can be very lucrative for the private equity investors they receive premium above the going market price for their stake in the target and at the end of the transaction they own the entire target company even though they have sold their shares after completion of the lbo as owners of private corporation they can pay themselves fees salaries and dividends without having to answer to public shareholders or wall street analysts an increasingly common practice is to issue debt and use the proceeds to pay special dividend to the shareholders who are the private equity investors themselves1 at the end of the process usually several years after the acquisition the company is resold either to public investors through an ipo in this case called reverse lbo or to another firm httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22689 hedge funds hedge funds trade in all financial markets employing very broad range of investment strategies some take simple speculative positions on the direction of prices of financial assets stocks bonds commodities currencies etc while others construct very complex portfolios based on price relationships across asset classes and across markets designed to produce positive returns whatever the direction of prices in the underlying markets some funds follow high risk strategies others are quite conservative hedge fund trading is not always based on shortterm strategies but in general their investment horizons are shorter than those of private equity funds whose holding periods average six to ten years the line between private equity and hedge funds is often blurred significant subset of hedge funds called activist funds also operates in the corporate takeover market such funds typically buy stake in public company and then pressure the target firm to make changes in operations such as spinning off underperforming units or assets governance eg replacing top executives or appointing hedge fund designee to the board of directors or financial structure announcing stock buyback or special dividend that will boost the share price if these efforts do not succeed in the shortterm the funds may hold on to their investments for years in essence replicating the strategy of value investors like warren buffett the boom over the past several years both private equity and hedge funds have grown rapidly in size and number because of number of factors that some call perfect storm when the bull market ended in 2000 and interest rates fell institutional investors such as pension funds and foundations turned to alternative investments to make up for low yields in traditional asset classes hedge funds and private equity were the primary beneficiaries of this shift falling share prices and the availability of lowcost debt capital created an unusually favorable situation for private equity funds they could borrow to finance acquisitions at relatively low cost and expect to sell into recovering stock market 1 kate kelly executives hedge their own ipos wall street journal april 13 2007 p c1 crs3 while there are official or comprehensive statistics on the size of either industry an often cited estimate is that there are now 80009000 hedge funds with about 12 trillion in investor funds under management decade ago the comparable estimates were 2500 funds and 200 billion in capital in private equity firms have raised more than 1 trillion in the past decade with about 200250 billion in 2006 alone in 2006 lbos accounted for 18 of the dollar value of all corporate mergers up from about 2 in the late 1990s2 in short private equity and hedge funds once marginal players now exert significant influence in the markets where they operate fund structure and compensation while private equity firms and hedge funds may differ in their investment strategies their structures are similar nearly all are organized as partnerships which means that their earnings are not taxed at the firm level most partnerships are simply straightforward conduits of taxable income or loss and tax attributes to the individual partners they can however also be used to manipulate the allocation of tax attributes and to shelter income and assets from taxation httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22689 there are two kinds of partners the fund managers who guide the investment strategy are general partners their background typically includes experience at wall street investment bank although two former secretaries of the treasury and former securities and exchange commission sec chairman now run hedge funds outside investors who contribute capital but have say in investment or management decisions are the limited partners they are generally institutional investors public and corporate pension funds insurance companies foundations and endowments or wealthy individuals the general partners often invest their own capital in the funds but this is usually small share of the total3 hedge funds typically establish multiple funds to accommodate the tax planning preferences of different investors while they generally share common pool of underlying assets they are chartered in different jurisdictions to cater to different clientele foreign investors and us taxexempt institutions may prefer to invest in foreignchartered funds while other types of us investors find it disadvantageous to invest in foreign funds by one estimate about 7000 hedge funds or about 80 of the total are registered in the cayman islands as well as their home country4 excluded from the list of limited partners is the small public investor under us law the sale of shares or interests in an investment partnership constitutes an offering of securities and must be registered with the sec if the offering is public in order to 2 ma almanac mergers acquisitions february 2007 p 82 3 according to media reports general partners accounted for

flourish the banker july 1 2006 p 1 crs4 avoid registration and the associated disclosure requirements5 most funds rely on exemptions in the securities laws that allow them to make unregulated private offerings in order to qualify for these exemptions prospective limited partners must meet various income and asset thresholds the most basic is the accredited investor standard income of 200000 or more in the past two years and at least 1 million in assets recently number of hedge funds and private equity partnerships have gone public by selling shares or units in an ipo their securities are now traded on the new york stock exchange and other major markets and may be purchased by anyone these firms which include the fortress investment group and blackstone will operate much as before but will be required to file quarterly and annual financial statements and make the full range of disclosures required by the sec types of compensation when the funds investments yield positive return both limited and general partners receive income as the value of their share of the fund increases this income as mentioned above is not taxed at the partnership level only the individual partners pay taxes usually at the capital gains rate httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22689 in addition the general partners receive compensation from the limited partners compensation structures may vary from fund to fund but the standard pay formula is called 2 and 20 that is fund managers take 2 of the funds assets each year as management fee and 20 of the total profits as kind of performance bonus6 the percentageofassets management fee is usually paid in cash and is taxed at ordinary income rates the 20 performance fee is sometimes paid in cash and sometimes credited to the managers account because the amount is often carried over from year to year until cash payment is made usually following the closing out of an investment it is called carried interest the carried interest is taxed at the capital gains rate amounts of compensation given the fact that these funds are private comprehensive figures on managers compensation are available although number of consultants and trade groups do publish estimates according to alpha magazine the top 25 hedge fund managers earned 14 billion in 20067 comparable annual lists are not published for private equity managers probably because cash distributions occur less frequently than in hedge funds and there is greater yeartoyear variation one estimate is that managers earned 45 billion over the past six years8 5 public offerors of securities must make public audited financial statements and detailed figures on executive pay among other information 6 the actual percentages may be higher or lower but the fees charged by hedge funds and private equity are generally very high compared to other investments public mutual fund fees for example average about 11 7 andrei postelnicu for hedge fund head very good year simons led industry again earning 17 billion in 2006 washington post april 25 2007 p d3 8 jenny anderson and andrew ross sorkin hedge fund operators may lose us tax break continued crs5 tax issues and proposals several bills before the 110th congress propose to change the tax treatment of fund manager earnings or of the funds themselves fund manager compensation also raises other tax issues which are set out below tax treatment of carried interest as noted above carried interest is the portion of fund managers compensation that represents percentage of the funds total investment gains under current tax rules it is generally taxed at the capital gains rate generally 15 when realized under proposals made in hr 2834 hr 3996 and hr 6275 carried interest shall be treated as ordinary income for the performance of services and thus taxed at rates up to 35 supporters of the proposals argue that carried interest is essentially fee for investment advisory services and that the appropriate treatment is to tax it like other ordinary income opponents maintain that since the source of carried interest is earnings on the funds investments it should be treated like any other investment income capital gains if held for more than year ordinary income if the holding period is less hr 6275 was passed by the house of representatives on june 25 2008 and subsequently received by the committee on finance httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22689 publicly traded partnerships publicly traded partnerships are partnerships whose interests are traded on an established exchange or in secondary market they are generally treated as corporations for tax purposes and subject to the corporation income tax with its 35 general rate with two exceptions one exception consists of partnerships with at least 90 of their gross income from passive investments such as dividends interest rents capital gains and mining and natural resources income9 these partnerships are not taxed at the corporate level s 1624 introduced on june 14 2007 by senator max baucus and others with senator chuck grassley as an original cosponsor would change the tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships that provide investment advisory and related asset management services they would be taxed as though they were corporations that is they would pay the corporate income tax on their earnings rather than pass those earnings through to be taxed only as the partners individual income in news release senator baucus stated that the bill was needed to ensure that some corporations are not disadvantaged because they conduct business in the corporate form and pay taxes as corporation asset management service and investment advisory partnerships provide the same types of active business services as their corporate competitors our tax system functions best when it is fair the tax 8 continued lawmakers look at private equity wealth international herald tribune june 22 2007 p 14 9 second exception consists of those partnerships that were publicly traded on december 17 1987 these partnerships originally grandfathered in for 10 years may now elect to retain partnership treatment by paying tax of 35 of gross income from the active conduct of business crs6 law ought to treat similarly situated taxpayers the same thus these publicly traded partnerships should be taxed as corporations10 the bill has been criticized by henry paulson secretary of the treasury on the grounds that tax policy ought not to single out one industry sector11 chairman baucus held hearing on the bill in the finance committee in august 2007 deferral of income along with its reduced tax rates capital gains income receives another benefit termed tax deferral because it is not taxed until realized carried interest shares this benefit the concept of tax deferral relates to the timing of tax payments with the idea that taxpayer prefers to pay taxes in the future rather than today because he or she can control the funds longer and use them in some other way deferral increases in value with both the length of the deferral period and the taxpayers marginal tax rate carried interest discussed above benefits from deferral since it is only taxed when realized as is the case with capital gains in addition hedge fund managers can amplify the benefits of deferral by electing to receive their compensation in shares of foreignchartered funds as mentioned above httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22689 these foreignchartered funds may appeal to different types of investors than their us chartered counterparts in addition to deferring us tax as long as the money is held offshore and not related to the conduct of trade or business the returns on the investment can compound taxfree resulting in substantial tax advantage12 the advantage is such that the new york times reported that single hedge fund citadel has deferred at least 17 billion since it was founded in 199013 hr 3996 hr 4351 and hr 6049 all introduced by chairman rangel would include compensation deferred through foreignchartered funds in the gross income of the hedge fund manager as mentioned above hr 3996 was passed by both the house of representatives and the senate though the senate amended the bill to remove this provision hr 4351 was passed by the house of representatives and referred to the senate committee on finance on january 22 2008 hr 6049 was passed by the house of representatives on may 21 2008 10 sen max baucus statement of introduction on publicly traded partnership bill june 13 2007 11 brett ferguson paulson objects to senate bill on private equity firms bna daily tax report june 28 2007 p g9 12 deferred compensation arrangements are significantly less common in us chartered funds because they result in investors losing the deduction associated with compensation and facing higher tax liabilities 13 jenny anderson managers use hedge funds as big iras new york times april 17 2007 p a1
