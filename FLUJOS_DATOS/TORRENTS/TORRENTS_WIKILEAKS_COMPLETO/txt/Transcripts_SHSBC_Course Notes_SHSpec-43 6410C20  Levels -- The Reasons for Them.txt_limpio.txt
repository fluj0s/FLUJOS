6410c20 shspec43 levels the reasons for them lrh had cognition khrushchev was overthrown because russia went into compulsive duplication of great britain and the us and tried to hold an election the term raw meat applies to 1 lack of processing 2 the pcs opinion of what he is someone who has actually started on r6 must not be returned to clearing or getting definitions audited etc he is sitting in an item and could pick up some other item out of sequence some endword that is out of sequence this could give him nasty somatics so there are solid technical reasons why pcs progress up the levels the original reason for levels was to stretch auditors out to what they were capable of it became obvious that pcs didnt gain well when run above their level despite their eagerness to be run on r6 the reason why john campbell parted company with lrh was his devotion to the machine he thought the ideal civilization was machines tending machines people who consider that they can formulate infallible plans for utopia dont think that people should have power of choice since it disrupts the utopian plans but the ideal plan has hardly been found on the political front as one can see in any newspaper furthermore since absolutes are unobtainable the ideal state will never be achieved beings are not all alike so who could judge when perfection had been attained you would never get complete agreement man is capable of his own judgment this alone keeps the absolute from being attained for instance what is the perfect piece of music all the way down the line the individual never completely loses his individuality integrity to himself is the last resort of thetan the individual can only be pushed so far richmond kelly turner commanded the uss astoria cruiser in world war ii he was captain blightype guy very grim lrh knew him maybe the source of mr roberts nothing on the astoria worked the crew was on white mutiny in which the crew acts only under direct orders takes initiative and executes nothing that is needed unless directly ordered to do exactly that that was their way of getting even thetan never gives up russia is one big white mutiny it is not that there is anything wrong with having rules and having people comply with them what is wrong is using duress continually to deny people any judgment or initiative with regard to the rules the gradient of ability relative to rules is 1 doesnt obey rules because he doesnt know them 2 total adherence to rules based on understanding of them 3 varying the rules based on higher understanding what gets interesting and can get troublesome is when you follow the rules with variations if you are trying to learn some subject follow plan or something there are two conditions that are variation from the must do it 1 total ignorance and rebellion based on aberration 2 skill and judgment enough to know which rules can be varied and how this latter condition is reached when you know the game all the way around the amateur tries to find the perfect instrument to do it the pro knows how to make use of what hes got and the rules in order to vary the rules successfully you have to know the rules cold otherwise you will fail because you are operating out of ignorance and rebellion lrh tells an anecdote about an old chinese carpenter who resists using guard on his band saw he knows what he is doing youve got to earn the right to vary the rules in life or in auditing in confronting variation from the rules the manager supervisor or whoever has to be able to differentiate between the two sources of variation ignorance or familiarity if he doesnt judgment is denied the individual who could exercise it and the supervisor gets into trouble are you dealing with ignorance or virtuosity you can enforce the rule against the person who varies it for the first reason with impunity because life is assisting you by punishing stupidity and ignorance anyway but dont shoot the second type of variation down this person has earned the right to vary the rule whether the person knows his business or not can be seen from his results if he is consistently getting results and protests the rules we can see that he is virtuoso if he is consistently unable to get results he needs more rules not less since his departure from the rules doesnt get good results the only way you will progress is over his dead body but he never dies so you cant win using force and duress against ignorance you must educate on the other hand if you combat virtuosity instead of ignorance and you create leaders for revolution that will unseat you the people who have been exported to this planet all fall into two and only two classes 1 rebellious geniuses 2 stupid criminals there is inbetween the latter rebel destructively and stupidly the former rebel intelligently they give trouble to the stupid state which thinks that it has the perfect answer one gives reactive trouble and the other gives intelligent selfdetermined trouble you had better recognize the difference between the two when you try to handle selfdetermined intelligent trouble with force this is handling thought with mass and it doesnt handle well since power of choice is the main power the person has so use duress on the former but never on the latter all protest is not the former exclusively our question in scientology is why should some people stay debased stupid and protesting becoming an ot has to do with power of choice and power of observation therefore wave of magic wand will produce an ot since it would just be another effect on the person buddha tried to wave magic wand and produces slaves horrible example of postulate gone wrong the asia minor ot jc who turned leaves into loaves and fishes or whatever just impressed everyone to the point that they are still overwhumped this is probably not what he intended the unpopularity of scientology levels comes from an unfamiliarity with the road to be walked youve got to get the guy to where he can talk to an auditor enough and tolerate control enough and be keyed out enough from the mass that he is sitting in and under enough discipline to confront the objects in the bank necessary to run out to resolve his case that may take quite awhile the easiest thing to do is to unburden the case by getting locks off you do this by 1 handling the auditing environment first you unburden the session then get the pc educated into what he is supposed to do and willing to talk to the auditor you have to explain this to him and show him the auditing comm cycle get what auditing is over to the pc this is getting the pc sessionable lrh invents the term sessionable 2 handling the betweensessions environment preparation handle ptps at first just by finding out what they are before actually auditing them we can ask the pc what the parts of his environment are cf expanded dianetics this alone helps him to sort out his problems it gives some gain get the pc to straighten out his environment so he is not sitting in his office with his house right outside the window while he is in the auditing room this is not auditing the environment it is just getting the pc to identify its parts at this point you dont want his problems with his job you just want his job named as part of his environment you are getting him sessionable which might take several sessions b auditing then you ask the pc for problems with the parts of the environment mentioned above find one that his attention is stuck on ask him what communication he hasnt completed to those terminals you handle problems very lightly but wind up with the period between sessions being clean enough so that it doesnt keep coming up at the start of each new session again this may take several sessions 3 beginning approach to the bank now we are going into the pcs past and future in 1 and 2 above we were broadening the perimeters of the pc we continue this now by beginning to handle the pcs past and future helping him to orient himself better we could run give something that happened in the past with date and place this does the same for the pcs past environment that you have done for his present environment at what is now level i you begin arc straightwire orienting the pc to his past repetitive processes if the pc gets to this point he can be audited easily 4 clay table healing using this you can straighten out the concern that the pc has about the body 5 on up the levels in completing the levels you are handling locks on gpms so they get all straightened out ready for r6 someone who hasnt been brought up through the levels isnt ready for r6 and will get into trouble
