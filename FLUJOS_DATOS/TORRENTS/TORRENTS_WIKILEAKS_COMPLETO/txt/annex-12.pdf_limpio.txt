2005 to 23 february 2006 it is noteworthy that the first financial statements cover the period 1 january 2006 to 30 ju ne 2006 implying that trading had started several week s before the prospectus had closed the company raised r80m from the public through an offer of linked units of r1 000 each unit consiste d of one ordinary share of 1c and one unsecured floating rate debenture of r99999 shortly before the launch of the prospectus an agent from pam golding properties ms mj jorgenson entered negotiations with the then owners to sell t he property to companies including rmb properties investec and others the representative of the sell ers mr ettienne lewis was satisfied that the property 2 should sell for r52m then sharemax suddenly arrive d on the scene and waterglen shopping centre investments subsidiary of waterglen shopping centre holdings bought the property for r62m1 it was then syndicated for r80m this is significant in view of the fact that valuer richard currie quite coincidentally and independently valu ed the property in december 2005 at r517m2 much later in may 2007 waterkloof shopping centre holdings instituted separate court action against basically because i had published curries views ab out the property his name was not mentioned in the summons but it was stated that the views expressed in the article prejudiced the company and its sharehol ders because at the time the property was not marketab at realistic price if the property were to have been sold it would be for lessor amount3 based on information published in the prospectus an d the cash flow statement in the financial statements for the period to 30 june 2006 the consolidated openin g balances of the company following capital raising the acquisition of property and

shopping centre holdings was at the outset unable to fund the projected interest payment from its operating profits and for that rea the socalled cash flow shortfall fund had been created15 before

operating profits were r9 938 462 but the cash generated from operations was only r8 373 779 this is reality check as to the quality of operating p rofits note the positive effect that movements in

on 30 june 2007 the group only had current assets of r460 206 compared to current liabilities of r627 85718 the current ratio is 073 which is significantly less than the norm of 100 it point s to cash flow strain it would appear that the reserve amount of r3 121 6 81 has been exhausted as was stated above there is electricity deposi t of r200 000 on the balance sheet19 the reserve fund of r100 000 appears to have been exhausted the reserve fund of r500 000 for the upgrading of t he property also appears to have been depleted there is clear evidence that any money was spent on upgrading the income statement shows that r401 685 was spent during the entire period of 18 months on maintenance20 maintenance and upgrading are patently different things the cash flow shortfall fund of r2 321 681 also app ears to have been depleted according to the projections in the prospectus it should have been applied as follo ws 18 ibid p 6 19 ibid p 18 20 ibid p 24 7 table 5 projected use of cash flow

sharemax investments pty ltd22 on 30 june 2007 this loan had grown to r1 024 91523 there are fixed repayment conditions24 this appears to be misappropriation of funds set aside f or specific purposes in the prospectus loan of r430 469 was outstanding to sharemax investments pty ltd on 30 june 2007 there are fixed repayment conditions25 it was not disclosed in the earlier prospectus that the group might need loan funding from sharemax investments pty ltd to meet interest payment commitments 4 comparing with prospectus forecasts the prospectus forecasts are for periods of 12 months starting on 1 february 200626 notably the first period starts before the prospectus had close d and does not coincide with the periods dealt with i n the financial statements the financial statements dealt with the periods 1 january 2006 to 30 june 2006 and then with 1 july 2006 to 30 june 2007 21 prospectus p 11 22 financial statements 2006 p 17 23 financial statements 2007 p 17 24 ibid 25 ibid p 18 26 prospectus p 14 8 this obstructs meaningful comparison of the prospectus forecasts with the financial statements however giving the group the benefit of the doubt lets compare the forecast for the period 1 februar 2006 to 31 january 2007 with the actual performance for the period 1 july 2006 to 30 june 2007 the latter period is five months later and gi ven the fact that the group had been forecasting rising profits this comparison should not be prejudicial table 6 prospectus forecast vs actual performance 27 prospectus forecast 1 february 2006 to 31 january 2007 actual performance 1

rate earned 837 689 subsidy 154 314 interest rate paid 991 1 003 the prospectus stated that the projections were bas ed on the rentals and escalations reflected in the cur rent lease agreement the prospectus showed that rental income would grow by 10 per annum28 clearly these forecasts were not realistic actual expenses were about 12 higher than the forecast 27 prospectus p 14 and financial statements 2007 pp 7 23 24 28 prospectus p 14 9 provision had been made in the financial statements for vacancies as was noted before the cash flow shortfall fund w as exhausted by 30 june 2007 5 valuation of property despite the weaker than projected operating performance the valuator mr sarel eloff of new wor ld valuation saw it fit to increase the valuation of the property from r63m to r73 933 56029 clearly he was riding on the wave of buoyant property market th financial statements merely state that the valuatio n was based on open market value for existing use and that the assumptions were based on current market conditions it should be noted that despite revaluation of the property waterglen shopping centre is factually insolvent with liabilities exceeding assets by r6 164 289 with the exhaustion of the cash flow shortfall fund the creative funding options have probably halted for valuation purposes it is anyway not prudent to rely on such funding mechanisms operating profits should b the basis when calculating yields based on the operating profit of r5 510 937 for 200 7 and eloffs valuation of r73 933 560 on 30 june 200 7 the historic yield was 745 the listed

review july 2007 and april 2008 sa corporate the third largest listed property fun d traded on 30 june 2007 at yield of 771 and on 3 1 july 2008 at 1176 in an ironic sense sa corporate is actually an appropriate benchmark for waterglen shopping centre and other properties managed by sharemax in 2007 11 sharemax sold ten properties to sa retail for about r1bn subsequently sa retail was taken over by sa corporate as an upshot of acquiring the ten sharem ax properties sa retail revalued its own portfolio of properties to bring it in line with the valuation f the sharemax properties this revaluation was reflected in the balance sheet of sa corporate after the takeove r it is significant that the decline in sa corporate s unit price is much higher than any of the other nine big listed property companies sa corporate and sa retail followed an aggressive acquisition strategy where size instead of value was the overriding criterion the market has now punished sa corporate for this strategy the discount to nav of 211 is indicativ of this the market is actually saying that the valuat ions done by sa retail at the time of the sharemax acquisition were too optimistic at the time sa retail issued shares at r1100 per share to pay for the sharemax portfolio with the takeover by sa corporate these shares converted in to sa corporate shares at the ratio of 305 sa corpora shares for each sa retail share that valued each s corporate share at r360 at share price of 274c on 21 may 2008 24 of the value had been lost taking the changing landscape into account it is difficult to justify yield of anything less than 10 being generous for waterglen shopping centre at present it is after all single property where the risks of investors arent spread even if one optimistically assumes that the operating profit wi ll grow by 6 in 2008 the value of the property at historic yield of 10 will only be r583m this is 216 lower than the current balance sheet valuatio n 12 and 275
