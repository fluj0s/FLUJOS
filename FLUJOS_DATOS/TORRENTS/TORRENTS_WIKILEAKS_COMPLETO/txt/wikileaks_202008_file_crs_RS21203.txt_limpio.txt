service the library of congress crs2 criminal investigations tracking and gathering communications federal communications privacy law features three tiered system erected for the dual purpose of protecting the confidentiality of private telephone facetoface and computer communications while enabling authorities to identify and intercept criminal communications title iii of the omnibus crime control and safe streets act of 1968 supplies the first level it prohibits electronic eavesdropping on telephone conversations facetoface conversations or computer and other forms of electronic communications in most instances it does however give authorities narrowly defined process for electronic surveillance to be used as last resort in serious criminal cases when approved by senior justice department officials law enforcement officers may seek court order authorizing them to secretly capture conversations concerning any of statutory list of offenses predicate offenses title iii court orders come replete with instructions describing the permissible duration and scope of the surveillance as well as the conversations which may be seized and the efforts to be taken to minimize the seizure of innocent conversations the court notifies the parties to any conversations seized httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21203 under the order after the order expires below title iii the next tier of privacy protection covers telephone records email held in third party storage and the like 18 usc 27012709 chapter 121 here the law permits law enforcement access ordinarily pursuant to warrant or court order or under subpoena in some cases but in connection with any criminal investigation and without the extraordinary levels of approval or constraint that mark title iii interception least

identify the source and destination of calls made to and from particular telephone 18 usc 31213127 chapter 206 the orders are available based on the governments certification rather than finding of court that use of the device is likely to produce information relevant to the investigation of crime any crime the devices record more than identity of the participants in telephone conversation but neither the orders nor the results they produce need ever be revealed to the participants the act modifies the procedures at each of the three levels it permits pen register and trap and trace orders for electronic communications eg email authorizes nationwide execution of court orders for pen registers trap and trace devices and access to stored email or communication records treats stored voice mail like stored email rather than like telephone conversations permits authorities to intercept communications to and from trespasser within computer system with the permission of the systems owner
