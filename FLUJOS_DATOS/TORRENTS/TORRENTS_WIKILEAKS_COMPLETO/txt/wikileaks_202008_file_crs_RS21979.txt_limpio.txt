events occur 1 pl 107297 116 stat 2322 see crs report rs21444 the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 summary of provisions by baird webel 2 pl 109144 119 stat 2660 see crs report rl33177 terrorism risk insurance legislation in 2005 issue summary and sidebyside by baird webel crs2 prior to the september 2001 attacks on the united states insurers generally did not exclude or separately charge for terrorism risks the risk of terrorism was seen as so remote that it generally was not considered in writing insurance policies the events of september 11 2001 however changed this as insurers realized the extent of possible losses current estimates of insured losses from the 911 attack are around 32 billion still the largest manmade insurance disaster on record3 the heaviest insured losses were absorbed by foreign and domestic reinsurers the insurers of insurance companies due to the lack of data on or modeling of terrorism risk reinsurers felt unable to price for such risks and so withdrew from the market for terrorism risk insurance once reinsurers stopped offering coverage for terrorism risk primary insurers who also suffered from lack of data and models also withdrew or tried to withdraw from the market in most states state regulators must approve policy form changes and state regulators generally agreed to insurer requests to exclude terrorism risks from their commercial policies just as they had long excluded war risks terrorism risk insurance was soon unavailable or extremely expensive and many businesses were longer able to purchase insurance that would protect them in future terrorist attacks although most data were anecdotal this problem was widely thought to pose threat of httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21979 serious harm to the real estate transportation construction energy and utility sectors in turn threatening the broader economy responding to the problem congress passed the terrorism risk insurance act in november 2002 trias goals and substance trias goals were to 1 create temporary federal program of shared public and private compensation for insured losses to allow the private market to stabilize 2 protect consumers by ensuring the availability and affordability of insurance for terrorism risks and 3 preserve state regulation of insurance to meet the first goal tria began shortterm program for the federal government to share insured commercial propertycasualty losses with the private insurance market the program extended from enactment through december 31 2005 the role of federal loss sharing depended on the size of the insured loss for small loss there was federal sharing for mediumsized loss the federal role was to spread the loss over time and over the entire insurance industry paying claims upfront but then recouping the payments through broad levy on insurance policies afterwards for large loss the federal government was to pay most of the losses although recoupment was possible in these circumstances as well the precise criteria under tria were as follows first the federal government would have shared in any insurers losses only if the industrys aggregate insured losses from an act of terrorism exceeded 5 million second each insurer would have been responsible for paying out certain amount in claims known as its deductible before it could call upon federal assistance its deductible was directly proportionate to particular insurers size rising from 7 of earned premiums in 2003 to 11 in 2004 3 see terrorism risk and insurance insurance information institute website available at httpwwwiiiorgmediahottopicsinsuranceterrorism crs3 and 15 in 2005 once these two thresholds are passed the federal government would have paid 90 of each insurers losses above its deductible however if the aggregate industry loss was under 10 billion for program year 1 2003 125 billion for year 2 2004 or 15 billion for year 3 2005 the amount that would have been paid to individual insurers was required to be recouped through surcharge added to all commercial insurance premiums in following years this surcharge could be maximum of 3 of premium and would last until the federal share was repaid if the aggregate industry loss was greater than the 10 billion 15 billion amount then the law imposed mandatory recoupment surcharge although the treasury secretary was given the authority to impose such surcharge the maximum amount that could be paid out under the program in given year was 100 billion the act covered only us commercial propertycasualty insured losses due to acts of international terrorism certified by the treasury secretary it did not cover losses due to acts of war declared by congress except workers compensation losses congress also carved out certain lines disallowing their coverage under tria the carvedout lines were federal crop insurance private crop or livestock insurance private mortgage insurance title insurance financial guaranty insurance of singleline guaranty insurers httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21979 medical malpractice flood insurance reinsurance and all life insurance products tria addressed the second goal to protect consumers by nullifying all commercial terrorism exclusions in force on trias date of enactment tria required propertycasualty insurers as condition of receiving federal assistance to make terrorism insurance available prospectively to their commercial policyholders by february 23 2003 the coverage could not differ materially from coverage for other types of losses each offer must reveal both the premium charged for terrorism insurance and the federal share of compensation the policyholder was not however required to purchase coverage if the policyholder declined to do so its insurer could exclude terrorism losses tria did not limit what insurers could charge for terrorism risk insurance though it did give state regulators the authority to modify excessive inadequate or unfairly discriminatory rates the legislation made this make available provision effective until the end of 2004 with the treasury secretary having the option subsequently exercised to continue it until the end of 2005 trias third goal was to preserve state regulation of insurance section 106 did so expressly with some exceptions one exception was the definition of an act of terrorism trias definition applied despite any other definition in state law second exception was trias limited preemption of state rate and form filing requirements tria preempted all prior approvals through december 31 2003 though it did allow any state to invalidate an excessive or discriminatory rate and any state with prior approval authority to review policy forms after their use thus states retained considerable authority over rates and terms for terrorism coverage third exception was trias requirement that workers compensation coverage include not only coverage for terrorism risk but also for war risk finally tria directed the treasury secretary to consult with the state regulators group the national association of insurance commissioners on several application issues in addition to the determination on the make available provisions congress directed the treasury secretary to conduct an expedited study of whether the tria program should be extended to group life insurance and allowed the secretary to extend crs4 tria to group life if the study determined that it should be the subsequent study determined that tria should not be extended to group life insurance 2005 tria extension legislation on june 30 2005 the treasury issued report on tria with treasury secretary snows accompanying letter recommending against continuation of tria in its present form4 the secretary stressed two factors the economy had become more robust since 911 and extension of tria would hinder the development of private insurance solutions by crowding out innovation and capacity building to gain support from the administration the letter specifies that any tria extension should include an increase of the event threshold from 5 million to 500 million increases in deductibles and co payments and reduction in the types of insurance covered by tria these requirements differ substantially from previously introduced legislation on the topic particularly the increase to 500 million and the reduction in the types of insurance httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21979 two bills s 467 and hr 4313 were reported out of committee to extend and revise tria different versions of s 467 passed both the senate and the house by early december 20055 s 467 was introduced in the 109th congress by senator dodd on february 18 2005 prior to the treasury report it was marked up in the senate banking housing and urban affairs committee on november 16 2005 the committee amended the bill substantially before reporting the bill favorably s 467 as reported extended the program by two years and left the framework largely intact while further limiting federal government exposure as suggested by treasury secretary snow specifically it removed additional types of insurance commercial auto burglary and theft surety farm owners multiple peril and professional liability except for directors and officers liability raised the insurer deductible to 175 in 2006 and 20 in 2007 increased the insurer copayment from 10 to 15 for 2007 and raised the event trigger to 50 million in 2006 and 100 million in 2007 after the markup the bill was brought to the senate floor and passed by unanimous consent on november 18 hr 4314 was introduced by representative richard baker on november 14 2005 and marked up by the house financial services committee on november 16 relatively minor amendments were made in committee including language prohibiting life insurers from denying coverage due to lawful travel undertaken by individuals hr 4314 as reported extended tria and revised the program extensively it limited the types of insurance covered by removing commercial auto but it expanded the program to cover domestic terrorist events also it increased the types of insurance covered to include group life and specific coverage for nuclear biological chemical and radiological nbcr events it raised the event trigger to 50 million in 2006 and an additional 50 million for every future year the program is in effect it also changed the insurer 4 see httpwwwustreasgovpressreleasesjs2618htm 5 for additional information see crs report rl33177 terrorism risk insurance legislation in 2005 issue summary and sidebyside by baird webel crs5 deductible but did so differently for different lines of insurance raising the deductible to as much as 25 for casualty insurance but lowering it to 75 for ncbr events hr 4314 would have raised the insurer copayment to 20 for events under 10 billion while lowering it gradually to 5 for events over 40 billion in the event of terrorist event the deductibles and event triggers would reset to lower levels with deductibles possibly as low as 5 in the event of large attack it removed the cap on the mandatory recoupment provision so that all money expended under tria would be recouped by the federal government through surcharge on insurers in the years after the attack hr 4314 also would have created tria capital reserve funds crf which would allow insurers to set aside untaxed reserves to tap in the case of terrorist event the majority of the text of hr 4314 was inserted into s 467 and the house passed this bill on december 7 2005 although the house called for conference committee reconciling the differences between the two bills the senate did not ultimately further amendment to s 467 samdt 2689 passed the senate on december 16 2005 and the house followed passing s 467 as amended on december 17 2005 the president signed the terrorism risk insurance extension act of 2005 into law as pl 109144 on december 22 2005 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21979 pl 109144 closely tracks the senate version of s 467 as amended by the senate banking committee the only substantial difference is an increase of the aggregate industry retention amount from 175 billion and 20 billion to 25 billion and 275 billion for 2006 and 2007 issues and outlook for the 110th congress passage of triea extended the government backstop for two years until the end of 2007 this extension however did relatively little to answer some of the fundamental questions surrounding terrorism insurance and federal involvement in this insurance it seems likely that this congress will confront many of the same questions that have marked tria debates in the past such questions may include the following should there be government terrorism insurance program at all should group life insurance be covered in such program how should the possibility of nuclear biological chemical or radiological terrorism be treated how should terrorism risk be shared between the government and private insurers should insurer reserves for future terrorism losses enjoy taxpreferred status
