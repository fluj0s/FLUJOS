believed loan forgiveness programs were lower risk than service pa yback programs since service was provided each year before forgiveness was granted and because there were not the administrative costs of tracking borrowe rs throughout school and the subsequent period of service the authors of this survey found state tracking systems were inconsistent and states had little data availa ble on the programs efficacy some programs knew the number of par ticipants with current obligations but could not separate those meeting the workforce obligation from those repaying the financial assistance

shortage area in 1974 report the gao exa mined the efficacy of program of loan forgiveness called the health profession student assistance program the program is longer in existence in the form evaluated by the gao33 the gao found this particular program with the loan forgiveness provisions in effect at the time of the evaluation was not effective on influencing where gradua tes set up their practices according to the gao it was not effective because most students were not aware the loan forgiveness was available and because those that were did not consider the forgiveness sufficient to outweigh the disadvantages of the required service in subsequent work the gao has exa mined the strengths and weaknesses of loan forgiveness versus service payback provisions in response to congressional request the gao compared the relative costs and benefits to th federal government of the national health service corps loan forgiveness and service payback programs the gao did not examine the efficacy of these programs in general but in contrasting the costs and benefits of these two programs under the specific circumstances of the national health rvice corps it found the

financial aid program to be more costly34 the gao found the administrative costs in the national health service corps service payback program were greater than those in the loan forgiveness program because students must be tracked through college and subsequently through their performance of rvice this is in contrast to loan forgiveness programs where forgiveness is provided after service and where the employee has the responsibility of applying for loan forgiveness as result administrative costs are lessened additionally the gao found that loan forg iveness recipients were more likely to complete their service commitment and to continue service after their obligation had expired loan forgiveness programs minimize the risk that someone will commit to particular major to qualify for financial aid but will not continue in the field or perform their required service35 however service payback programs may have advantages as financial aid program because these programs provide aid to students during college as expenses occur they may serve students who othe rwise could not attend thus they may broaden the pool of potential recipients to include less affluent students this may partly explain the attraction of these programs in states where in general only state residents are eligible to participate in rvice payback programs as consequence the potentially higher costs may be offset by the fact that the benefits accrue to state residents and the recipients remain in the state to fulfill their service requirements the lumina study discussed earlier is recent examination of state loan forgiveness and service payback programs it did not try to ascertain the efficacy of loan forgiveness and service payback programs in achieving states workforce or financial aid goals however as noted it did raise concerns about the lack of available evidence on this issue we really do not know whether these programs are the best way to help individuals whether currently enrolled in school or repaying loans cover educational expenses also we really do not know whether programs themselves are helping reduce workforce shortages or whether those accepting financial assistance would have worked in the occupation or geographic areas without the incentive of loan forgiveness or repayment36 over time as loan forgiveness and service payback programs have become more widespread and their popularity has risen policy discussions have become more focused on the finetuning of loan forgiven ess and service payback provisions to best meet the needs of the targeted group job or region perhaps in part due to the potential advantages of loan forgiveness programs in terms of cost and in retaining individuals in specific jobs occupations or regions mo st ed administered programs and most current legislative proposals are for loan forgiveness programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32516crs15 as noted above presently data on thes programs effectiveness are limited some outstanding questions for future re search on these programs include acquiring more data on the extent to which loan forgiveness or service payback recipients would have taken the targeted job irrespective of the program the extent to which participants remain in jobs after the expiration of the loan forgiveness or service payback program how the efficacy of these programs compares to other forms of financial aid and the extent to which these programs may be divisive when there are similar individuals working in similar jobs but only some are eligible for loan forgiveness in effect creating situation where one employee is paid more than another for the same work
