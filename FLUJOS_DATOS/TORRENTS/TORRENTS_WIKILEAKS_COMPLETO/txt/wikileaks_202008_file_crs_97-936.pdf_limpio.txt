mifflin 1885 p 297principles and purposes underlying the legislatures ability to oversee the executive are democratic principles as well as practical purposes john stua rt mill the british utilitarian philosopher insisted that oversight was the key featur of meaningful representative body the proper office of representative assembly is to watch and cont rol the government1 as young scholar and future presiden t woodrow wilsonin his 1885 treatise congressional government equated oversight with lawmak ing which was usually seen as the supreme function of legislature he wrote quite as important as legislation is vigilant oversight of administration2 the philosophical underpinning for oversight is the constitutions system of checks and balances among the legislature executiv and judiciary james madison known as the father of the constitution described the system in federalist 51 as establishing subordinate distributions of power where the constant aim is to di vide and arrange the several offices in such manner that each may be check on the other oversight as an outgrowth of this princi ple ideally serves number of overlapping objectives and purposes improve the efficiency economy nd effectiveness of governmental operations evaluate programs and performance detect and prevent poor administra tion waste abuse arbitrary and capricious behavior or ille gal and unconstitu tional conduct protect civil liberties and constitutional rights inform the general public and ensure that executive policies reflect the public interest gather information to develop new legislative proposals or to amend existing statutes ensure administrative compliance with legislative intent and prevent executive encroachment on legislative authority and prerogatives in sum oversight is way for congress to check on and check the executivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97936crs3 3 article i sec 8 and article ii secs 2 and 4 4 mcgrain v daugherty 273 us 135 177 1927 see also watkins v united states 354 us 178 187 1957 and barenblatt v united states 360 us 109 111 1959powers and prerogatives the us constitution although the constitution grants form express authority to oversee or investigate the executive or program adminis tration oversight is implied in congresss impressive array of enumerated powers3 the legislature is authorized to appropriate funds raise and support armies provide for and maintain na vy declare war provide for organizing and calling forth the national guard regulate interstate and foreign commerce establish post offices and post roads advi and consent on trea ties and presidential nominations senate and impeach house and try senate the president vice president and civil officers for treason brib ery or other high crimes and misdemeanors reinforcing these powers is congresss broad authority to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying in to execution the foregoing powers and all other powers vested by this constitution in the government of the united states or in any department or officer thereof the authority to oversee derives from these constitutional powers congress could not carry them out reasonably or respons ibly without knowing what the executive is doing how programs are being administered by whom and at what cost and whether officials are obeying the law and complying with legislative intent the supreme court has legitimated congresss investigative power subject to constitutional safeguards for civil liberties in 1927 the court found that in investigating the administration of the department of justice cong ress was considering subject on which legislation could be had or would be materia lly aided by the information which the investigation was calculated to elicit4 statutes the necessary and proper clause of the constitution also allows congress to enact laws that mandate oversight by its committees grant relevant authority to itself and its support agencies and impose specific obligations on the executive to report to or consult with congress and even seek its approval for specific actions broad oversight mandates exist for the legislature in several significant statutes the legislative reorganization ac t of 1946 pl 79601 for the first time explicitly called for legislative oversight in public law it directed house and senate standing committees to exercise continuous watchfulne ss over programs and agencies under their jurisdiction authorized prof essional staff for them and enhanced the powers of the comptroller general the head of congresss investigative and audit arm the general accounting office gao the legislativ reorganization act of 1970 pl 91510 authorized each standing committee to revie w and study on continuing basis the application administration and execution of laws under its jurisdiction increased thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97936crs4 professional staff of committees expanded the assistance provided by the congressional research service and strengthened the pr ogram evaluation responsibilities of gao the congressional budget act of 1974 pl 93 344 allowed committees to conduct program evaluation themselves or contract out for it strengthened gaos role in acquiring fiscal budgetary and programrelated informa tion and upgraded gao s review capabilities besides these general powers numerous statutes direct the executive to furnish information to or consult with congress for example the government performance and results act of 1993 pl 10362 requires ag encies to consult with congress on their strategic plans and report annua lly on performance plans goals and results in fact more than 2000 reports are submitted each year to c ongress by federal depa rtments agencies commissions bureaus and offices inspectors general igs for instance report their findings about waste fraud and abuse and their recommendations for corrective action periodically to the agency head and congress the igs are also instructed to issue special reports concerning particularly serious and flagrant problems immediately to the agency head who transmits them unaltered to congress within seven days inspectors general also communicate with members committees and staff of congress in other ways including testimony at hearings inperson meetings and written and electronic communications the reports consolid ation act of 2000 p l 106531 moreover instructs the igs to identify and describe their agencies most serious management and performance challenges and briefly assess pr ogress in addressing them this new requirement is to be part of larger effort by individual agencies to consolidate their numerous reports on financial and performance management ma tters into single annual report the aim is to enhance coordination and efficiency within the agencies improve the quality of relevant information and provide it in more meaningful and useful format for congress the president and the public in addition to these avenues congress creates commissions and establishes task forces to study and make recommendations fo r select policy areas that can also involve examination of executive ope rations and organizations there is long history behind executive reports to congress indeed one of the first laws of the first congressthe 1789 act to tablish the treasury department 1 stat 66called upon the secretary and the treasurer to report directly to congress on public expenditures and all accounts the secretary was also required to make report and give information to either branch of the legislat ure respecting all matte rs referred to him by the senate or house of re presentatives or which sha ll appertain to his office separate from such reporting obligations public employees may provide information to congress on their own in the early part of the 20th century congress enacted legislation to overturn gag rule issued by the president that prohibited employees from communicating directly with cong ress 5 usc 7211 1994 other whistleblower statutes whic h have been extended specifica lly to cover personnel in the intelligence community pl 105272 guarant ee the right of government employees to petition or furnish information to congress or member house and senate rules chamber rules also reinforce the oversight function house and senate rules for instance provide for special oversig ht or comprehensive policy oversighthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97936crs5 respectively for specified committees over matters that relate to their authorizing jurisdiction house rules also direct each standing committee to require its subcommittees to conduct oversight or to tablish an oversight subcommittee for this purpose house rules also call for each co mmittee to submit an oversight agenda listing its prospective oversight topics for the ensuing congress to the house committee on government reform which comp iles and prints the agendas the house government reform committee and the senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee which have oversight jurisdiction over virtually the entire federal government furthermore are au thorized to review and study the operation of government activities to determine their economy and efficiency and to submit recommendations based on gao reports in addition house rules require that the findings and recommendations from the government reform committee be considered by authorizing panels if presented to them in timely fashion activities and avenues oversight occurs through wide variety of congressional activities and avenues some of the most publicized are the comparatively rare investigations by select committees into major scandals or into executive branch operations gone awry cases in point are temporary select committee i nquiries into homeland security matters following the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 chinas acquisition of us nuclear weapons information in 1999 the irancontra affair in 1987 intellig ence agency abuses in 19751976 and watergate in 19731974 th precedent for this kind of oversight actually goes back two centuries in 1792 special house committee investigated the ignominious defeat of an army force by confederated indian tribes by comparison to these select panel investiga tions other congressional inqui ries in recent congresses into intelligence information and its sharing among federal agencies prior to the 911 attacks us intelligence its use about wea pons of mass destructi on before the invasion of iraq whitewater access to federal bureau of investigation files and campaign financing have relied for the most part on standing committees the impeachment proceedings against pres ident clinton in 1998 in the house and in 1999 in the senate also gene rated considerable oversight it not only encompassed the president and the white house staff but also extended to the office of independent counsel prompted by concerns about its authority jurisdiction and expenditures although such highly visible endeavors are significant they usually reflect only small portion of congresss tota l oversight effort more routine and regular review monitoring and supervision occur in other congressional activities and contexts especially important are appropriations hearings on agency budgets as well as authorization hearings for
