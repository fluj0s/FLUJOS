6309c26 shspec311 summary iii about level iv auditing do not underestimate the difficulty of r3 processes that look for the pcs goal what saves our bacon is r3sc which permits unburdening of the bank by removing the two top ris r3sc gives you variety of locks which can be called possible service facs you get perhaps five or six of these pick the one that gives the most ta to list goals on it wont be the ri but it will give you the entrance point for the goal then you can try to find goal which that fits by asking what goal wouldmight relate to possible service fac obtained from r3sc the overrestimulation of the top ris was what made finding the pcs goal difficult and prevented the goal from rocket reading to parallel with processing what the mind is doing has always been the basic mission of processing the mind is holding in the pcs two postulated ris based on his most recent goal on top of those we will have locks finding the locks takes charge off the ris we list goals against lock that gave good ta since it has been unburdened the goal can rocket read if you get the wrong goal ie too early goal you can oppose it to get up to the pt goal note that pt goal is not very hightoned it tends to be pretty degraded one when youve got the pt goal you want the top terminal this is hard to find because the gpm is truncated incomplete you can find out roughly where the pc is in the gpm and get the terminal by getting the pc to list what are you in pt that relates to the goal on all other gpms you can ask for the top oppterm but not in the case of the pt gpm this is the truncated gpm the programming for any actual gpm whether totally formed one or truncated one is to find the top ris go down through the gpm to the bottom and take out the bottomplusone ri you may have to find the next goal to get the bottom oppterm you want the goal as an ri discharged and you want what it opposes totally flat you want the pc totally out of that bank before you repair it you do it this way because the goal as an ri and its opposition hold everything fixed and rigid in the bank until they are gone go all the way down then come up check the items you found on the way down to see if any are still ticking if so they came from an incomplete list abandon that item and complete the list it came from from this you will get whole new series of ris to do the reason why we dont go from the bottom of the bank to the top is that the goal is part and parcel of every ri it you listed starting at the bottom from the goal as oppterm you tend to beef up the whole bank you throw every ri alive and the pc cant reach them he will have very heavy time you could find yourself getting turned around and heading for the bottom of the bank again it is easier to go from the top down partly because the pc has been implanted with thousands of gpms backwards the main reason is that the pc is more interested in the later ris than the earlier ones also you are unburdening as you go down coming up past actual goals while doing the goals oppose lists see p 520 above restimulates the pc more than if you just got the pt goal right off the bat but this procedure is acceptable so long as you dont try to run some far backtrack gpm if you foolishly start to run one you are committed to running it all the way out and it will be difficult since it is unreal and inapplicable to his pt condition it is great strain on the auditor and the pc the only reason why you get old backtrack gpms being restimulated in pt and coming up for example in r3sc would be something like 1 the past goal may be some kind of dichotomy with the pt goal or with goal near pt 2 it seems safe it is far from anything that is wrong with the pc even if the goal you were running turns out not to be the pt goal finish running it then take another shot at the pt goal when you have the pt goal start listing for the terminal of the first pair of ris then go right on down the pt gpm clean out the whole bottom of the gpm when you have cleaned out the whole pt gpm you have to find the goal of the next gpm down then find the top oppterm of this goal that is easy you just ask who or what would the goal as an ri oppose then despite the pcs protest about it go back and clean up the pt gpm picking up any ris that you missed on the way down when it is all cleaned up you can put polish on it by prepchecking the auditing of it and prepchecking the goal sometimes the ta will go up and stick because the pcs interest is in the next bank down all you have to do about this is to call it to the pcs attention and the ta will come down if you dont finish up gpm it will give you trouble from then on when you do your next gpm do the same top to bottom and clean it up in reverse when you get two or more items ticking on this step always take the one nearest the top and work on it say you have three items ticking as you read the line plot take the top one then you wont have to worry about the other two they will fly off and cease to be part of the list recheck for ticks etc until there are more reactions get the idea of shortcircuited electric blanket 35ft by 3ft by 10ft coalblack or fuzzy black with grey undertones sometimes it is grey this object is one actual gpm of the pcs it is made of ideas both gpm and block of concrete are ideas if you get an actual gpm out of sequence and get items out of other gpms they pile up on the pc and jam here and there pc can get gpms out of sequence and maul them about say you have carpet of these things that stretches about mile at the bottom is the earliest past say you take the third from the beginning of track and insert it between the third and fourth gpms back from pt now crisscross the items from the early gpm with the items from the fourth gpm back when you do case analysis you park two of the gpms over to the left now you find more items in the gpm that is ten back you find wrong items and it goes out of gear and is thought of as long in the past it goes out with three that are twentyfive yards away this is longshoremens work in livingness the pc may have found new use for an old goal he may have pulled it out of line so an auditor gets at it goofs and you have debris all over the place it is mechanical proposition like diving into tar pits it is that physical when you run gpm correctly the pc will start getting repetitive rocket reads as the gpm folds up as the pcs perception comes up he can start to see the gpm discharge and fall apart sometimes you have to run two or three gpm before he sees these things the further back on the track gpms are the bigger they get they are like black islands the pc can energize the whole thing by raking his thetan paws over it grubbing around in it sometimes he activates his own suppress and it all goes black sometimes the pc gets into creak of bpc in his vicinity where he feels pulled or pushed into an odd shape by unidentified bpc when pc is in trouble you have new tool to use analysis of whatever youve got for instance when you find an ri before accepting it do an ri analysis on it 1 make sure there are bypassed ris 2 find out whether it came off an incomplete list 3 find out whether the wording in it is correct 4 find out whether its position in the bank is correct 5 find out if it is from the right goal ie not from some other gpm if one of these reads finding out now saves time and trouble it is the same with goal we want to know if it is an implant goal or an actual goal and whether it is in the right place etc dont expect an analysis to be completely valid however the case can be so charged that nothing reads or that not enough can be seen to sort out what is there because of charge so we have the rule complete process cycles of action begun on the pc given available time and when you do case analysis do it and then complete what you were doing before you did the analysis eg you were opposing catgut the pc is in creak you do case analysis and find out that you had wronglyworded goal fine now go back and finish opposing catgut case analysis has shown up the fact that auditors have q and ad by finding something wrong going off to fix it and then never completing the action they were previously on this would be enough to keep pcs from going to ot the case analysis is there to take the creak out not to be followed it is the same situation as with an arc break assessment you want to find the bpc not to do something about it if you get case into repair session with lots of incomplete cycles which is now in the middle of something else finish what the pc is in the middle of because that is where his interest is or take the cycle the pcs attention is stuck in do that one first this is not necessarily the earliest cycle left incomplete however sometimes the pcs interest is in the case analysis and the auditors interest is in the case analysis it is more interesting than hodwork the pc wants to lay bricks and make things pretty if you find out that the item you are listing against is wrong dont try to complete the list complete the earlier list that you got the wrong item from the general rule of completing auditing cycles of actions begun on the pc needs to be applied using ones judgment about importances and working from fundamentals
