and federal criminal law the federal juvenile delinquency act and related matters summary juvenile offenders of federal criminal law are primarily the res ponsibility of state juvenile court aut horities the federal juve nile delinquenc act permits federal delinquency proceedings where state courts cannot or will not accept jurisdiction in the more serious of these cases the juvenile offender may be transferred for trial as an adult in federal court the act applies to those charged before the age of 21 with breach of federal criminal law occurring before they reached the age of 18 given the law enforcement predominance of state officials and the fa ct that violation of federal law will ordinarily support the asser tion of state juvenile c ourt jurisdiction most such offenders never come in contact with federal authorities many of those who do are returned to state officials to be processed through the state court system the united states attorney however may elect federal proceedings if the state courts are unwilling or unable to assume jurisdiction or the state has adequate treatment plans or the juvenile is char ged with crime of violence or with drug trafficking juvenile may be transfe rred for trial as adult only at his or her insistence or pursuant to court transfer of juvenile 15 years of age or older charged with drug trafficking or crime of violence federal juvenile linquency proceedings require ne ither grand jury indictment public trial nor trial by jury the constitutional rights available to juveniles at delinquency proceedings are otherwise much like those found in adult criminal trials juveniles found delinquent may be released under spended sentence placed on probation ordered to pay restitution andor sentenced to the custody of the attorney general for detention the period of detention if any may not exceed the term which might be imposed upon an adult offender for the same misconduct this report provides an overview of the

mischievous discretion can be admitted to overthrow the str ong presumption of innocence which is raised by an age so tender during the interval be tween seven and fourteen the infant is prima facie supposed to be destitute of criminal desi gn but this presumption diminishes as the age increases and even during this interval of youth may be repelled by positive evidence of vicious intention for tenderness of years will not excuse maturity in crime since the power of contracting guilt is measured rather by the strength of the delinquents understanding than by days and years thus children of thirteen eight and ten years of age have been executed for capital offenses because they respectively manifested consciousness of guilt and mischievous discre tion or cunning after the age of fourteen

are primarily the responsib ility of state juvenile court authorities the federal juvenile linquency act permits federal delinquency proceedings when state courts cannot or will not accept jurisdiction or in the case of limited number of crimes when there is substantial federal interest in the more serious of these cases the juvenile offender may be transferred for trial as an adult the rise in serious juvenile crime the contraction of state juvenile court jurisdiction and the ex pansion of federal cr iminal law have all contributed to the increased prevalen ce of the federal delinquency proceedings described here history of federal delinquency law in early america the law held that child until the age of 7 lacked the maturity necessary to be held crimin ally responsible thereafte r incapacity was rebuttably presumed until the child reached the age of 14 by which time acquisition of the intellectual capability to entertain criminal intent was assumed1 child found capable of the requisite intent was subject to trial and punishment as an adult other children were set free in the early twentieth century the states established juvenile court systems so that children accused of conduct that w ould be criminal in an adult might be processed apart from the criminal justice system in an environment more closelyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30822crs2 2 the creation and development of the juvenile court in the american states has been made possible by line plainly drawn between child and adult in the state law the child offender is generally dealt with on noncri minal basis and has been protected from prosecution and conviction for crime the state s come to regard him as its ward it has assumed guardianship over him it has unde rtaken to safeguard train and educate rather than to punish him it has substituted soci for penal methods the concept of juvenile delinquency for that of crime the clear dis tinction however has never been made in the federal law the child approaches the courts of the united states on the same footing as the adult the concept of juvenile deli nquency is unknown to the federal penal code national commission on law observance and enforcement w ickersham commission report on the child offender in the federal system of justice 2 1931 3 the attorney general also pointed out that 1 most of the cases involved interstate joyriding an offense for which juvenile court treatment was thought particularly appropriate 2 there were not enough juveniles brought into the federal courts to justify the establishment of juvenile courts by act of congress and 3 federal penal institutions are not adequately equipped to deal with this class of juvenile delinquency hrrepno 958 72d cong 1st sess 2 accompanying the b

recommended and congress agreed that the disparity should be adjusted by authorizing the department of justice to return juveniles charged with violating federal law to the juvenile authorities of their home state3 this solution suffered two unfortunate limitations it did not account for juveniles charged with capital crimes state law ordinarily excluded capital offenses from the jurisdiction of its juvenile cour ts second state juvenile courts had jurisdiction over juvenile s who lived and whose misconduct occurred upon indian reservations or military installations over which the state had legislative jurisdiction congress addressed these s hortcomings with the fede ral juvenile delinquency act of 19384 state juvenile proceedings remained the preferred alternative but the attorney general might instead elect to pro ceed against juvenile as an adult and federal juvenile proceedings becam possible should both parties agree5 although supplemented in 1950 by the federal youth corrections act whic h afforded federal juvenile offenders tried as adults the prospect of sp ecial rehabilitative opportunities6 the act remained essentially unchanged for over thirtyfive years in

with changes that emphasized that at least some of the juveniles who commit serious crimes merited punishment as adults the sentencing reform act of 1984 not only repealed the federal youth
