retirement income security act of 1974 erisa1 provides comprehensive federal scheme for the regulati on of privatesector employee benefit plans one of the primary goals in enacting erisa was to protect the interests of participants and beneficiaries of empl oyee benefit plans and assure that participants receive promised benefits from their employers2 to this end erisa provides for appropriate remedies sanctions and ready access to the federal courts3 n i n t g r l p r t fhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22827crs2 4 29 usc 1132a 5 while not pertinent to this report it should be noted

140 1985 11 iderisas enforcement scheme is erisa section 502a whic h allows private parties as well as government entities to bring various civil actions to enforce provisions of erisa4 in general erisa regulates two types of pension plans defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans5 defined benefit plan is plan under which an employee is promised specified future benefit traditionally an annuity beginning at retirement in defined benefit plan the em ployer bears the investment ri sk and is responsible for any shortfalls6 by contrast defined contribution plan provides each participant with an individual account that accrues benefits based on amounts c ontributed to the account by both the employer and the employee7 the employee bears the investment risk and thus the value of the account at the time of retirement is unknown erisa subjects both defined benefit and defined contribution plans to number of requirements including requirements for fiduc iary responsibility8 claims to redress breaches of fiduciary duty section 502a2 of erisa authorizes the secretary of labor participant beneficiary or plan fiduciary to bring civil action caused by breach of fiducia ry duty under section 409 of erisa that section makes plan fiduciary personally liable for breaches against an erisa plan and breaching fiduciary must make good to the plan any losses to the plan resulting from breach and restore to the plan any profits made from using the assets of the plan in improper ways9 it also subjects such fiduciary to other relief as court may deem appropriate including re moval of the fiduciary one controversial issue with respect to breach of fiduciary duty claims under erisa is that while an individual plaintiff eg plan participant ma bring civil action under section 502a2 the supreme court has found that any recovery must inure to the benefit of plan as whole10 in massachusetts mutual life insurance co v russell 11 the supreme court ruled that plan beneficiary could not br ing civil action for monetary damages against plan fiduciary who had b een responsible for the improper processing of benefit claim the plaintiff in russell who was disabled with back ailment alleged that she was injured when her employers disability committee terminated her disability benefits the court rejected the beneficiarys claim ex plaining erisa section 409 did not authorize beneficiary to bring cla im against fiduciary for monetary damages based on the text of section 409 and the legi slative history of erisa the court opinedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22827crs3 12 courts sometimes determine whether the relief plaintiff seeks is legal or equitable colleen murphy money as specific remed 58 ala l rev 119 134 2006 this distinction dates back to the days of the divided bench when england and subsequently the united states maintained separate courts of law and courts of equity see generally greatwest life annuity ins co v knudson 534 us 204 212 2002 one important way these courts differed from each other was the remedies available to plaintiffs historically the most common remedy in the courts of law was money id at 135 the most common remedy in the courts of equity was an order for an individual to do something or re frain from doing something such as with an injunction id the scope of remedies available at law and at equity have been the subject of debate while there is longer this divided court system courts may still evaluate claim based on this dichotomy 13 larue v dewolff boberg associates civil action 204174718 dsc 2005 14 larue v dewolff boberg associates 450 f3d 570 4th cir 2006that relief for an individual beneficiary was not availabl under section 409 based on the idea that plaintiff coul d only recover losses on beha lf of the entire plan larue v dewolff boberg associates in larue the plaintiff participant in 4 01k plan administered by his former employer requested that plan administrator s change an investment in his individual account the plan administrators failed to ma ke this change and the individuals account allegedly suffered losses of approximately 150000 larue brought an action against his former employer and the 401k pla n claiming the plan administrator br eached his fiduciary duty by neglecting to properly follow the investment instructions larue brought claim in district c ourt under erisa section 502a3 which permits participant to bring civil action to enjoin any act or practice which violates erisa or the terms of the plan or obtai n appropriate equitable relief for these violations12 the participant argued that because the defendants failed to invest the money as he directed his account wa s depleted and he was entitle d to receive makewhole or other equitable relief under secti on 502a313 the district court dismissed the participants claims holding that because the defendant did not possess any of the funds belonging to the participant the relief the participant sought was monetary damages and this remedy was not available to the plain tiff as equitable relief under section 502a3 larue appealed the decision arguing to the fourth circuit court of appeals that he should be able to recoup losses under both 502a3 and 502a2 of erisa14 the court affirmed the district courts decision with regard to section 502a3 finding that the makewhole relief the participan t sought could not be charact erized as equitable relief with regard to section 502a2 the cour t found that because the argument regarding section 502a2 was raised for the first time on appeal the argument was waived however the court did discuss the merits of the section 502 a2 claim relying on the russell case the fourth circuit held that rues claim failed becau section 502a2 provides remedies only for an entire plan not for an individuals account the court focused on the idea that the loss was personal to the defendant and was suffered by him alone while the court acknowledged that the participants plan account was indeed part of the entire plan the court found basis to interpret the statute in this manner and claimed that such an interpretation coul d undermine congresss in tent to limit the scopehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22827crs4 15 larue v dewolff boberg associates 2008 lexis 2014 at 14 2008 the court declined to address the section 502a3 issue due to the fact that the court found that the court of appeals erred in its interpretation of section 502a2 id at 5 16 brief for the united states as amicus curiae larue v dewolff boberg associates 2008 lexis 2014 2008 06856 17 id at 9 quoting russell 473 us at 142 18 in addition as the court points out unlike larue the plaintiff in russell received all the benefits to which she was entitled 2008 lexis 2014 at 10 2008 19 it is important to note that while the plan at issue in russell was disability plan rather than defined benefit plan the court applied the logic in russell to defined benefit plans see id at 1213 20 id at 12 21 id at 13of relief under erisa given that the plainti ff sought to recover losses only for himself the participant could not sue under section 502a2 the supreme court rejected the fourth circuits decision with respect to section 502a2 finding that although 502a2 does not provide remedy for individual injuries distinct from plan injuries that provision does authorize recovery for fiduciary breaches that impair the value of plan ssets in participan ts individual account15 the department of labor writing an amicus brief in larue had argued for this result16 in explaining the holding justice stevens writing for the majority distinguished larue from the russell case in two ways first the court explained that the type of fiduciary misconduct occurring in larue violated principal statut ory duties imposed by erisa that relate to the proper plan manageme nt administration and investment of fund assets17 conversely in russell the fiduciarys breach ie delay in processing benefit claim fe ll outside of these principal duties18 second the court found that in russell the emphasis placed on protecting the entire plan from fiduciary breach under sec tion 409 applies to fined benefit plans which were the norm at the time of the case19 however as the supreme court noted in larue defined contribution plans are more popul ar today and the entire plan language in russell does not apply to these plans the c ourt explained that for defined benefit plans fiduciary misconduct woul d not affect an individual titlement to benefit unless the misconduct detrimentally affected the entire plan by contrast for defined contribution plans fiduciary misconduct need not threaten the solvency of the entire plan to reduce benefits below the amount th at participants would otherwise receive20 the court went on to note that whether fi duciary breach diminishes plan assets payable to all participants and beneficiaries or only to persons tied to particular individual accounts it creates the kinds of harms that concerned the draftsmen of 40921 although all of the justices agreed on the outcome of the larue case they disagreed as to the reasoning behind it chief justice roberts joined by justice kennedy wrote concurring opinion suggesting that it is at least arguable that claim such as the one made in larue should be evaluated not as breach of fiduciary duty cla im but as claimhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22827crs5 22 section 502a1bof erisa authorizes plaintiff ie participant or beneficiary in an erisa plan to bring an action against the plan to recover benefits under the terms of the plan that have been wrongfully denied to participant 23 id at 22 thomas j concurring 24 id 25 2008 lexis 2014 at 24 2008thomas j concurring 26 id at

dewolff boberg assocs 2008 us lexis 2014 at 20 2008roberts j concurringfor benefits brought under s ection 502a1b of erisa22 justice roberts pointed to the fact that allowing sec tion 502a1b action to be br ought as claim under section 502a2 could allow plaintiffs to circumvent certain prot ections that exist for plan administrators under section 502a1b for example as justice roberts pointed out most courts recognize that before plainti ff can bring claim for benefits under section 502a1b that plaintiff has to exhaus t the administrative re medies available under the plan before filing suit the extra protections for plan and its administrators justice roberts explains encourage employers and others to ffer benefits to employees justice thomas writing separate concurre nce joined by justice scalia found the majoritys reliance on trends in the pens ion market and the concerns of erisas drafters to be misplaced23 justice thomas concluded that the participant had legitimate claim base d on the unambiguous text of sections 409 and 502a224 justice thomas articulated that losses to the participants indi vidual 401k account were losses to the plan because assets in the pa rticipants account were plan assets defined contribution plan the justice points out is not collection of unrelated accounts25 these plans are essentially the sum of their parts and that losses to an individual account must be losses to the plan under erisa26 concluding observations as has been pointed out the larue case affirmed that individuals participating in defined contribution plans may bring claim in the event that plan fiduciarys ina ppropriate actions create losses to an individuals account27 while some commentators praised the larue decision for offering protection to individuals in 401k plans others have suggested that the case will likely lead to an increase in litigation of claims by 401k participants who have suffered individual account losses28 one question arising from the larue decision is the implications of justice robertss concurrence courts may be faced with the issue of whether the availability of relief under sec tion 502a1b affects par ticipants ability to bring claim under section 502a229 another question is wh ether under section 502a2 participant is required to exhaust adminis trative remedies provided by plan beforehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22827crs6
