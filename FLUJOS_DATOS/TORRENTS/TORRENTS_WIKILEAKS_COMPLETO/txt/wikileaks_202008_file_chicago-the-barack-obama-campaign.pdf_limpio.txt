atid leadership develop ment combined during the march 2004 primary season to make big differetice in the level of participation of our com munities in that important election acorn is active in experimenting with methods of increasing voter patiicipation in our low and moderate income commu nities in virtually every election but in some elections we get to have our cake and eat it too work on nonpartisan voter registration and gotv which also turns out to benefit the candidate that we hold dear the march primary was not particularly important for the presidential race as kerry was just in the process ot clinching ihe dem presidential nomination but it was critical in the us senate race on march 6th state senator barack obama won the right to represent the democraticparty in the us senate campaign jack ryan won the republican nomination that day but went on to selfdestruct over sex club tevelations in his divorce papers sen obama went on to keynote the democratic convention in july and was catapulted to the national stage as sen obama puts it how did skinny kid with funny name become the democratic candidate tbr the us senate with 5 of the statewide democratic vote in sevenperson field obatna started building the base years before for instance acorn noticed him when he was organizing on the far south side of the city with the developing communities project he was very good organizer when he returned from law school we asked him to help us with lawsuit to challenge the state of illinois refusal to abide by the national voting rights act also known as motor

the developing communities project he was very good organizer acorn members meet with illinois senate candidate barack obama organizers forum 49it seemed to us that what obama needed in the march primary was what we always work to deliver anyway increased turnout in our acorn communitiesto allow massbased voter registration according to the new law obatna look the case known as acorn vs edgar the name of ihe republican governor at the time and we won obama then went on to run voter registration project with project vote in 1992 that made it possi ble for carol moseley braun to win the senate that year project vote deliv ered 50h newly registered voters in that campaign acorn delivered about 3000 ot them since then we have invited obama to our leadership training sessions run the session on power every year and as result many our newly developing leaders got tt know him belore be ever ran tor office tbus it was natural for iiumy of us to be active volunteers in his lirst campaign tor state senate and then his tailed bid tor us congress in 1996 by the time he ran for us senate we were old friends and along about early march we started to see that ihc atrican amorican community had made its move when sen obamas name was mentioned at our southside summit meeting with 700 people in attendance from three southside communities the crowd went crazy with about week to go before the election it was very clear how the africanamerican community would vote but would they vote in high enough numbers it seemed to us that what obama needed in the march primary was what we always work deliver anyway increased turmul in our acorn com munities acorn is active on the south and west sides of chicago in the south suburbs and on the east side of springtleld the state capital most of the turf where we organize in is afriean american with growing latino pres ence in chicagos little village iind the suburbs acorn members were involved in threeactivities around the primary 1 block captains were identified as early as the summer before the march primary and provided with lists of registered and unregistered voters and voter registration materi als we altendcd trainings and accountability meetings to receive our materials and make plans get tbe people registered then we came back to report on our progress we also bired voter registrars in tbe tlnal three weeks to work the supermar kets in our communities by the february 17 voter registration dead line for tbe primary acorn had registered 129x4 new voters this was an organizational best for us as of tbis writing we bave added over 27000 tcw voters 2 block captains then went to work to turn out the vote they were all vol unteers until the last few days when we received funding to pay some of our block captains in some precincts of tbe 24th ward north lawndale and tbe 15th ward west englewotd to get out the vote on tbe last saturday before the election and on election day 3 in some precincts in the 15th ward we were able to hire canvassers to work on voter turnout for full two weeks before the election each can vasser worked two to three precincts during that time the results of this activity were very interesting and mirror what professor donald green of yale university has found about voter turnout work where we were able to run crew of paid and supervised canvassers for two weeks before the election we did very well see figure i in those targeted acorn precincts in the 15th ward voter turnout improved by an average of 50 over the 50 organizers forumsocial policywinter 2003 vol 34 2

american but one knew that that wouid be the caseprevious years city election the only other election since the redistricting citywide turnoul increased hy only 14 over the same election the way the canvassers approached each door was important instead of speech about candidate they engaged the potential voter in conversation about the issues relating their issues to the importance of voting and moving them to commitment to vote in the primary in addition acorn leaders were making ihc rounds talking to their neighbors about the election 1 am proud to report that the combination of paid canvass and my volunteer work was especially successful in turning out the vote in my two precincts 34 and 51 in those precincts we boosted turnout by 82 precinct 34 and 909r prccincl 51 over the previous years turnout acorn leader denise dixon again paired with an effective canvasser increased turnout in her precinct hy 131 the best perform ing precincts were the ones with can vasser and leader who worked at least election day and the saturday before there is noticeable difference between these precincts and those that only had paid canvasser in it who wasnt local community leader were not ready to prove anything yet with our data because we have not run scientific test but we believe greens results showing that doortodoor field work for two weeks before an election yields significant results and we believe that there is correlation with strong local leaders assisting the paid canvass ing in winning even more dramatic increases the 24th ward has traditionally had high er voter turnout than in the 15th the work leading up to the election in the 24th ward was done by leaders who vol unteered their time some were paid for two half days of door knocking electionday and the saturday before turnout increased in acorn precincts in the 24th ward at rate higher than the city average but not at the rate at which it increased in the 15th overall turnout was still higher in our 24lh ward precincts than our 15th ward precincts but the rate of increase was not as dra matic none of this is rocket science hut it is important good doorknocking by com munity residents for even two half days can impact turnout good doorknocking by paid and supervised canvassers for two weeks can have dramatic impact and combination of the two especially with experienced community leaders working with the paid canvassers can make huge difference as it turned out obama won the primary handily pulling white wards as well as african american but one knew that that would be the case in each election we must act as if our work is critical for our communities that is what we did in the primary and we learned something in the process toni foulkes is chicago acorn leader ami member of
