on may 24 2000 at nato ministerial meeting in florence italy the secretary of state announced set of seventeen measures known collectively as the defense trade security initiative dtsi that was intended to not only improve the international competitiveness of us companies but also to promote international business arrangements improve the interoperability of us forces with allies in

business encouragement of better utilization of existing licenses streamlining of the licensegranting process and modern ization of the list of goods requiring licenses for export table listing each of the seventeen proposals and the status of their implementation is provided at the end this report most of the proposals are uncontroversial one proposal would single out for expedited review those license requests nato allies submit as part of the defense capabilities initiative program begun in 1998 to close the technology gap between us and othernato forces another promises to streamline the licensing process for commercial communications satellite components third would create single comprehensive export authorization permitting the exchange of broadranging technical data between us and foreign companies needed to forge variety of business arrangements such as joint ventures and product teams the enhancement of computer connectivity to enable electronic transmission between the state and defense departments of the voluminous data required to justify license requests is also proposed this process is currently transacted in paper format congressional concerns and action when the provisions of the dtsi were made known to the committees in congress members expressed general satisfaction with its intent and with the manner in which the licensing process would be revised however one proposal was singled out for special concern because of its potential implications for technology security and diversion of shipments this proposal was entitled extension of international traffic in arms regulations itar exemption to qualified countries2 under this proposal the administration offered to create broad exemptions under which unclassified defense items equipment and intellectual materials could be exported licensehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20757crs3 3 the original list of potential itarexempted states included nato members australia and japan late in 2000 state department negotiations with both the uk and australia appeared to have bogged down and dod began preliminary discussions with the netherlands as potential alternative country interested in the itar exemptio n however in july of 2001 the itar was amended instead to extend the exemption to sweden see amy svitak us turns to smaller nations as itar exemption talks stall defense news december 18 2000 p 10 and itar 22 cfr parts 124 125 126 july 10 2001free to selected companies in some foreign countries in order to qualify for the exemption foreign government would have to execute with the united states bilateral agreement ensuring that both states share congruent and reciprocal policies in export controls industrial security intelligence law enforcement and market access the president is authorized to administer defense export controls through regulations issued under authority delegated in the arms export control act aeca recently the administration has used this authority to allow licensefree trade in defense articles and services with canada the socalled canada exemption congress encouraged this exchange in light of the unique relationship enjoyed by the two countries in defense law enforcement general commercial trade intertwined industrial bases and geographical contiguity in late june of 2000 the secretary of defense communicated to the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee his intention to negotiate canadalike exemption with the governments of the united kingdom and australia3 at the same time he assured the committee that such agreements would be made legally binding on the recipient states in order to safeguard shipments from diversion route or illegal reexport to third country destinations while this stipulation to render usstyle export controls and technology security measures legally binding went beyond the language incorporated in the original dtsi members expresse d concern that it did not go far enough in its safeguards given the potential breadth of licensefree trade likely to ensue under an agreement modeled on the canada exemption this concern centered on possible thirdparty sales to undesirable buyers or diversion of defense shipments to unintended destinations enactment of the security assistance act of 2000 because of these policy concerns congress passed the security assistance act of 2000 pl 106280 enacted october 6 2000 one section of this legislation provides that exemption from us licensing requirements can be granted unless and until foreign government binds itself to impose the full range of united states export controls and laws regulations and policies befitting the level of sensitivity of the exported items this act expressly requires that before an exempti on can be granted the us government must conclude legally binding bilateral agreement which contains among other provisions specific stipulations regarding the ability to verify the identity of the end user the specific use to which the item will be applied the control of subsequent reexport of the item and the establishment of list of controlled defense articles to include all those covered by the exemption the act directs the president to certify that the agreement meets these requirements and that the foreign country has in fact promulgated thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20757crs4 4 two of the sixteen space qualified items were

implemented congressional oversight is ensured by the acts requirement that the president continue to notify congress of the details of specific defense exports made regardless of the existence of any license exemption for the recipient through enactment of the security assistance act of 2000 congress has given the president and the defense industry clear set of boundaries within which to craft licensing relief in the report of the conference committee on this bill the managers expressed approval of the overall thrust of the dtsi noting that it incorporated several recommendations made previously by the house and senate committees of jurisdiction current status of the dtsi fifteen months after the adoption of dtsi most of the proposals have been put into effect the state department has published list of natospecific projects to receive expedited license review the state and defense departments have reviewed five of nineteen active usml categories itar changes designed to encourage the creation of international defense business arrangements have been published in the federal register work has begun to increase state and defense department export data connectivity in the conference report accompanying the security assistance act of 2000 managers stated their expectation that the president will continue to keep the congress abreast of progress in bilateral negotiati ons with candidate countries including discussions on whether the resulting agreements should be treaties subject to senate approval such negotiations are ongoing with the united kingdom and australia in july 2001 the commerce and state departments resolved jurisdictional disputes for sixteen categories of spacequalified items controlled under the commerce control list ccl4 this is expected to expedite the licensing review process of commercial satellites and their components despite these advances defense industries have expressed concern that the state department has not fully implemented the initiatives and that more changes are warranted growing concern has been decline in us market share of defense items some industry analysts believe that an expeditious realization of these initiatives would increase us market share for defense items and help maintain technological superiority according to the aerospace industries association reforms have not yet made significant impact on expediting licensing or streamlining the process they argue that the state department needs to establish clear guidelines regulations and administrative procedures before defense industries can take advantage of these new licensing measures the table at the end of this report lists each of the dtsi proposals along with its current status this report will be updated as required to keep
