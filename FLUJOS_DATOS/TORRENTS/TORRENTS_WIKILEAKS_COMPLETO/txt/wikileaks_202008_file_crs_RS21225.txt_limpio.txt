reductions under the act will expire 6 the housepassed version of hr 4070 as amended contains two provisions that were not in the version of the bill approved by the social security subcommittee on april 25 2002 the first provision would add kentucky to the list of states that offer coverage under divided retirement system to public employees as specified in section 218d6c of the social security act the second provision would provide compensation for social security advisory board members crs3 recipient public agency or nonprofit institution that has custody of the recipient noncustodial federal institution private forprofit organization licensed under state law that has custody of the recipient or member of community organization individual payees are prohibited from charging fee for their services but organizational payees such as department of veterans affairs hospitals nursing homes and nonprofit agencies may charge fee for serving in this capacity7 under current law ssa is required to reissue benefits misused by an individual or organizational representative payee if the commissioner of social security hereafter referred to as the commissioner finds that ssa negligently failed to investigate or monitor the payee hr 4070 would eliminate the requirement that reissuance be subject to finding of negligence on the part of ssa as result ssa would be required to reissue any payments misused by an organizational payee or an individual payee representing 15 or more recipients such payments would be reissued directly to the recipient or to an alternative representative payee the misuse of benefits occurs when payments are used by the representative payee for purposes other than the use and benefit of the recipient the bill would authorize the commissioner to prescribe by regulation the meaning of the term use and benefit httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21225 under current law representative payees are not liable for misused funds hr 4070 would make individual payees and nongovernmental organizational payees ie those other than federal state and local government agencies liable for the reimbursement of misused funds such funds would be treated as overpayments to the representative payee not the recipient making them subject to current overpayment recovery procedures under current law qualified organizational payees may be authorized by ssa to receive payment for their services those payments are based on formula specified in the law and are deducted from the recipients monthly benefit hr 4070 would require the organization to forfeit fee payments for any month for which the commissioner or court of jurisdiction finds that the organization misused all or part of recipients benefit under current law the commissioner may impose civil monetary penalty and an assessment on persons who knowingly provide false information or knowingly withhold information to obtain social security benefits the civil monetary penalty may be up to 5000 for each violation the assessment may be up to twice the amount of benefits wrongfully paid to the individual hr 4070 would clarify that such penalties may be imposed on persons who fail to notify ssa of changes that affect their eligibility status or benefit amount8 and it would require the commissioner to issue receipt acknowledging notification of changes in recipients work or earnings status in addition hr 4070 would impose the same penalties on representative payees who misuse benefits civil monetary penalty of up to 5000 for each violation and an assessment of up to twice the amount of misused benefits 7 for more information refer to social security administration office of the inspector general organizational representative payee program testimony by inspector general james g huse jr before the senate special committee on aging may 2 2000 8 this change is not included in the senatepassed version of hr 4070 crs4 under current law nongovernmental feeforservice organizational representative payees must be bonded or licensed but they are not required to submit proof of such certification hr 4070 would require such representative payees to be both bonded and licensed if licensing is available in the state and to submit proof of such certification on an annual basis along with copy of any independent audit performed on the organization since the previous certification hr 4070 would require in addition to existing periodic onsite reviews for state institutions periodic onsite reviews of individual representative payees who serve 15 or more recipients nongovernmental feeforservice organizational representative payees and any other agency that serves as representative payee for 50 or more recipients the bill would require the commissioner to submit to congress an annual report on the findings of such reviews including the problems identified and any action taken or planned to correct the problems under current law individuals are disqualified from acting as representative payee if they have been convicted of fraudulent conduct involving social security programs hr 4070 would extend the restriction to individuals convicted of an offense under federal or state law which results in imprisonment for more than 1 year unless the commissioner determines that the individuals designation as representative payee httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21225 would be appropriate despite the conviction and to any individual who is fugitive felon as defined in the social security act9 under current law representative payees are required to complete an annual accounting report form describing how recipients benefits have been used if misuse is suspected report may be requested at any time by the commissioner hr 4070 would authorize the commissioner to require payee to collect recipients benefits in person at local ssa office if he or she fails to submit annual accounting reports provisions affecting attorney claimant representatives social security and ssi disability claimants may choose to have an attorney or other qualified individual represent them in proceedings before ssa the representative may charge fee for his or her services but the fee must be authorized by ssa under either the fee petition process or the fee agreement process under the fee petition process the representative must file fee petition with ssa after completing work on claim with copy sent to the claimant ssa determines the amount of the fee which is limited to 25 of pastdue benefits awarded based on factors including the complexity of the case and the type of services performed by the representative under the more simplified fee agreement process the representative and the claimant must file written fee agreement with ssa before decision is made on the claim10 in fee agreement cases the attorneys fee is limited to 25 of pastdue benefits awarded or 5300 whichever is less 9 under section 1611e4 of the social security act fugitive felon is defined as an individual fleeing to avoid prosecution or custody or confinement after conviction under the laws of the place from which the person flees for crime or an attempt to commit crime which is felony under the laws of the place from which the person flees or which in the case of the state of new jersey is high misdemeanor under the laws of such state or violating condition of probation or parole imposed under federal or state law 10 in 2000 an estimated 88 of attorney fees were based on fee agreements crs5 under current law if social security claimant is awarded pastdue benefits and his or her representative is an attorney ssa withholds the attorneys fee from the benefit award and pays the attorney directly if the representative is not an attorney or the claim is for ssi benefits ssa pays the total amount of the benefit award to the claimant and the representative must collect his or her fee from that individual to cover the administrative costs associated with the attorney fee payment process ssa charges an assessment of up to 63 of the attorneys fee the assessment is deducted from the attorneys fee payment11 hr 4070 would cap the assessment on attorneys fees at 100 and extend the attorney fee payment process to ssi claims12 in addition it would require the commissioner to submit report to congress on the feasibility of extending the fee withholding and payment process to nonattorney representatives13 under current law attorneys who are licensed to practice must be recognized by ssa as claimant representative even if they have been disbarred in another jurisdiction hr 4070 would authorize the commissioner to refuse to recognize as an attorney representative or disqualify if already recognized any attorney who has been disbarred or suspended from any court or bar to which he or she was previously admitted to practice or who has been disqualified from participating in or appearing before any httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21225 federal program or agency furthermore hr 4070 would authorize the commissioner to refuse to recognize or disqualify if already recognized any attorney who has been disbarred or suspended from any court or bar to which he or she was previously admitted to practice as nonattorney representative provisions affecting the payment of benefits to fugitive felons under current law the commissioner is authorized to withhold ssi benefits from fugitive felons and persons fleeing prosecution in addition ssa is required to provide to federal state and local law enforcement officials upon written request the current address social security number and photograph of any ssi recipient who is in fugitive status to assist in the individuals apprehension hr 4070 would authorize the commissioner to withhold social security benefits from fugitive felons and persons fleeing prosecution and it would require ssa to share information about those individuals with law enforcement officials in some cases the commissioner would be allowed with good cause to pay withheld social security benefits the terms governing the payment of withheld social security benefits would be prescribed by regulation 11 the assessment on attorney fees was enacted under the ticket to work and work incentives improvement act of 1999 pl 106170 and set at 63 effective january 31 2000 for each year thereafter it is set at rate not to exceed 63 needed to cover full administrative costs in 2001 and 2002 the rate has remained 63 12 the senatepassed version of hr 4070 would cap the assessment at 75 the cap would be indexed to the social security costofliving adjustment in addition the senatepassed version of the bill would not extend the attorney fee payment process to ssi claims 13 for more information on the attorney fee payment process refer to us general accounting office gao paying attorneys who represent disability applicants testimony by barbara d bovbjerg before the house ways and means subcommittee on social security june 14 2000 and systems support could improve processing attorney fee payments in the disability program testimony by barbara d bovbjerg before the house ways and means subcommittee on social security may 17 2001 crs6 in addition hr 4070 includes number of miscellaneous provisions designed to reduce fraud and abuse in the social security programs such as provision requiring individuals and businesses to notify prospective customers in advance that product or service being offered for fee is available directly from ssa free of charge as well as number of clarifying and technical amendments to the ticket to work and work incentives improvement act of 1999 and other aspects of the social security program the congressional budget office estimates that the housepassed version of hr 4070 would result in net savings of 541 million over 10 years fiscal years 20032012 hr 4070 as passed by the senate on november 18 2002 the senate passed by voice vote substitute amendment to hr 4070 the amendment senate amendment 4967 sponsored by senators baucus and grassley was discharged from the committee on finance and passed by unanimous consent the senate amendment closely resembles the housepassed version of the bill however it contains several additional provisions httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21225 first social security disability recipients are entitled to trial work period in which they may have earnings above the substantial gainful activity level for up to 9 months not necessarily consecutive within rolling 60month period without any loss of benefits under current law an individual convicted of fraudulently concealing work activity during the trial work period is not entitled to receive benefits for months in which such fraud was committed and is liable for repayment of those benefits under the senatepassed version of hr 4070 an individual convicted of fraudulently concealing work activity during the trial work period would not be entitled to receive benefits in any trial work period month and would be liable for repayment of those benefits as well as any other applicable penalties fines or assessments second an individual who receives pension from work that was not covered by social security for example some state and local government workers is subject to reduction in his or her social security spousal benefit equal to twothirds the amount of the noncovered pension under provision of current law called the government pension offset gpo under the last day rule however an individual is exempt from the gpo if he or she worked in job that was covered by social security on his or her last day of employment under the senatepassed version of hr 4070 an individual would be required to work in social securitycovered job for the last 5 years of employment to be exempt from the gpo see social security administration revision to the government pension offset exemption should be considered gao02950 august 2002 finally the senatepassed version of the bill would make several technical changes to the railroad retirement and survivors improvement act of 2001 pl 10790 ssa estimates that the senatepassed version of hr 4070 would have negligible effect on the longrange actuarial status of the social security trust funds based on the intermediate assumptions of the 2002 social security trustees report the house did not take up the senatepassed version of the bill before the 107th congress adjourned sine die
