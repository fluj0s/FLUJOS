operation of the sugar program as defined in the farm security and rural investment act of 2002 the farm bill through fy2007 when it expires in particular he promised to take steps should additional sugar imports due to the caftadr nafta and other trade agreements jeopardize the sugar program operations by exceeding the import trigger threshold should this occur the us secretary of agriculture agreed to preclude entry of additional sugar imports into the domestic sweetener market by either making direct payments to exporters or using agricultural commodities to purchase sugar to be used for nonfood use ethanol production separately for the textile and apparel issues promises were made to 1 change the rules of origin to require that all pocketings and linings come from the caftadr countries rather than third party countries like china 2 negotiate new stricter customs enforcement agreement with mexico before the caftadr cumulation rules take effect allowing mexican inputs to be used in caftadr textile and apparel products and 3 require nicaragua to increase use of us fabric to qualify as dutyfree under their tariff preference levels other accommodations were made to win house s upport of hr 3045 including passage in the house on july 27 2005 of the us trade rights enforcement act hr 3283 this bill would allow greater recourse to pursue trade complaints against china and other nonmarket economies not all interest groups however could be appeased despite efforts to win over all groups the sugar industry and some textile groups chose not to support the bill and strong democratic opposition remained over number of other issues that may prove to be enduring challenges to future trade agreements if crafted from the caftadr framework

and practice comparative advantage has been recognized for nearly 200 years as core principle explaining the efficiency gains that can come from trade among countries by virtue of their fundamental differences it states that countries can improve their overall economic welfare by producing those goods at which they are relatively more efficient while trading for the rest intraindustry trade is the other major insight that explains trade patterns in which the benefits from exchange among countries occur based on specialized production product differentiation and economies of scale many latin american countries have liberalized trade policies recognizing the contribution that trade and related investment can make to economic growth and development as an important caveat trade is at best only part of broad development agenda and is substitute for the promotion of political freedom macroeconomic stability sound institutions and the need for complementary social and economic policies 2

based on specialized production but in this case relies in large part on differences in wages skills and productivity3 certain specialized jobs have developed in central america and other developing countries where they frequently reside in production sharing maquiladora facilities economists have come to refer to such specialized production as breaking up the value added chain and it accounts for why products and particularly parts thereof as diverse as automobiles computers and apparel are often made or assembled in central america and other countries in partnership with us firms 4 this relationship discussed in more detail later provides the basis for much of the labor policy debate on the caftadr and ftas more generally5 measuring the benefits of freer trade is another difficult issue there is tendency to count exports imports and the oftmisrepresented importance of the trade balance as indicators of the fruits of trade this approach often gives undue weight to exports at the expense of understanding benefits from imports where the gains from trade are better understood by their contribution to increased consumer selection lower priced goods and improved productivity for example high tech intermediate goods imported from developed countries are the basis for future more sophisticated production in developing countries in developed countries imports from developing countries whether final goods for consumers or inputs for manufacturing enterprises reduce costs and contribute to productivity and economic welfare for all countries exports are the means for paying for these imports and their attendant benefits three caveats related to negotiating ftas are important first the discussion of costs and benefits generally assumes that ftas are implemented in multilateral setting in fact given the slow pace of world trade organization wto negotiations many countries are pursuing preferential arrangements that is regional and bilateral agreements like the caftadr latin america is full of them and depending on how they are defined they may actually be trade distorting if they promote trade diversion this occurs when trade is redirected to countries within limited agreement that does not take into account countries outside the agreement some of which may be more efficient producers preferential trade agreements are also cumbersome to manage requiring extensive rules of origin and economists disagree as to whether ftas help or hinder the movement toward multilateral trade liberalization 6 3 this differs from the standard intraindustry case between two developed countries in which goods such as automobiles are exchanged based on product differentiation and economies of scale and where differences in wage levels are not central

it increases opportunities for internationally competitive sectors and challenges import competing firms to become more efficient or do something else this fact gives rise to the policy debate over adjustment strategies because while consumers and export sector workers benefit some industries workers and communities are hurt economists generally argue that it is far less costly for society to rely on various types of trade adjustment assistance than opt for selective protectionism the frequent and forcefully argued choice of tradeaffected industries 7 the public policy difficulty is that both options have costs and benefits but result in different distributional outcomes8 because trade agreements raise difficult political choices for legislators in all countries many of whom represent both potential winners and losers fta provisions are typically limited in scope so continue to protect partially or completely certain products industries or sectors and are phased in over long period of time typically up to 1520 years for very sensitive products third there are implications in the trade negotiation process for smaller countries bargaining leverage when they choose to negotiate with large country in bilateral rather than multilateral setting both chile and the central american countries realized early in the process that there were negotiating issues over which they would be able to exert little or leverage both agreements for example do not address antidumping and subsidies reflecting an ongoing congressional concern and negotiations on certain agriculture issues were also limited given the politically sensitive nature of this issue g22g145g142g561g11g150g153g142g157g158g156g561g143g152g155g561g138g561g5g3g8g22g3g556g6g20g561 the united states was motivated by both commercial and broader foreign economic policy interests in deciding to negotiate preferential trade agreements with central america and the dominican republic geopolitical and strategic concerns also sparked interest by all parties in pursuing the caftadr proponents expected the caftadr to reinforce regional stability by providing institutional structures that can undergird gains made in democracy the rule of law and efforts to fight terrorism organized crime and drug trafficking the caftadr may also be way to expand support for us positions in the free trade area of the americas ftaa and given that the january 2005 completion date has slipped may also help rationalize the system of disparate preferential trade agreements that currently define western hemisphere trade relations critics of the caftadr pointed to equally br oad themes such as the pervasive social and economic inequality in much of the region and so supported strong labor and environment provisions as important negotiating objectives there was concern for example over the adequacy of working conditions and enforcement of labor laws in the caftadr countries the 7 for recent and accessible treatment of this subject see kletzer lori g and howard rosen easing the adjustment burden on us workers in bergsten c fred ed the united states and the world economy washington dc institute for international economics 2005 pp 31341 8 it is important to note that when staple such as underwear is produced abroad and sold in the united states as lowerpriced import compared to domestically produced good it is equivalent to an increase in real income for the us consumer this can be significant for lowwage workers in the united states the same idea holds true for industrial products and business consumers so there is trade off in the trade policy decision between keeping certain jobs through protection and losing the income gains or keeping the income gains and losing certain jobs one public policy response has been to pass trade adjustment assistance legislation to help firms and workers transition more quickly to new opportunities

that can have positive effect in raising labor standards although it is not sufficient to accomplish this goal on its own with the proliferation of regional agreements around the world trade negotiations have also become tactical issue of picking off gains where they are perceived relative to what other countries are doing it was repeatedly argued by the us business community for example that the uschile agreement the first fta after nafta was necessary to equalize treatment of us businesses competing with canadian firms that already enjoyed preferential treatment with chile the case was made for central america as well which has trade agreements with canada and mexico each with firms that compete with us businesses in the region delays with wto and free trade area of the americas ftaa negotiations only reinforced this attitude in the context of regional trade agreements history geographic proximity and economic complementarities also made the caftadr an apparently logical step 9 economic fundamentals shaped trade relationship based on exports of traditional agricultural products and later apparel from the early days of independenc agricultural exports were the centerpiece of central american economic growth the british controlled primary export production coffee bananas sugar and beef until about 1850 when us interests won over this trend continued until the 1980s and passage of the caribbean basin initiative cbi10 by becoming eligible for unilateral preferential tariff treatment us in vestment increased in the region fostering growth in central american export sectors major change to the cbi relationship occurred with passage of the caribbean basin trade partnership act of 2000 pl 106200 in response to repeated concerns over trade benefits negotiated with mexico under nafta congress passed essentially naftaequivalent treatment for the cbi countries cbtpa targeted preferences on textile apparel and other highvolume export goods not covered under the original cbi legislation the benefits were extended temporarily for period ending september 30 2008 or until beneficiary country enters into an fta with the united states 11 the uscentral americandominican republic economic relationship changed importantly under the cbtpa creating an environment in which businesses forged strategic partnerships in the increasingly complex world of textile and garment manufacturing from 1974 until 1995 global rules restricting trade in apparel between developed and developing countries mostly quotas were set out in the multifiber arrangement mfa and its successor the wtosponsored agreement on textiles and clothing tc which served as transitional arrangement to quotafree system begun on january 1 2005 in this context the cbtpa preferences provided an import benefit for the regions export sectors 12 the united states created the cbicbtpa to foster caribbean economic development and to assist us industry in responding to competition from

have been hit hard by foreign competition resulting in total job loss of over 540000 employees from 1998200213 the textile industry eg fiber yarns fabric has remained marginally competitive through use of sophisticated production technologies the apparel manufacturing industry eg shirts pants undergarments by contrast is highly labor intensive and in striving to reduce costs has moved production offshore to lowerwage countries as defined in the cbtpa us firms through subsidiary or contractual arrangements are required to use mostly us textiles as inputs to products that are assembled and exported back to the united statesa mutually beneficial strategy in 2002 some 56 of us apparel and textile imports from central america was assembled from us materials compared to less than 1 for apparel imports from china14 although this was controversial move because of the reliance on foreign lowwage workers to the detriment of some us employment many economists argued that the alternative would have been an even greater and more rapid loss of textile and garment jobs to asian competitors that use us inputs15 with the removal of textile and apparel quotas in january 2005 the trade picture changed again the caftadr countries were already losing us market share which from 1997 to 2002 declined from 117 to 94 over the same time period chinas market share increased from 91 to 130 given that us textile and apparel imports from caftadr countries are heavily concentrated in products previously covered by quotas the dominance of china and other lowcost asian producers is likely to continue caftadr producers are less competitive on pure cost basis because of their higher labor costs relative to some countries in asia the cbtpa requirement to use more expensive us inputs and the additional administrative costs associated with us preferential trade requirements 16 lowcost labor however is not the only or even the most important factor driving competitiveness17 studies suggest that the economic and social networks that developed between us and central american firms effectively created niche market in the region for certain apparel that has held up even with the growing pr esence of china in the market this relationship was made possible by the proximity of production operational efficiencies and quick turn around times for meeting increasingly shortened deadlines

critical component for maintaining this strategy it is not certain that it can counter the longterm trend in market share loss to asia18 strategic considerations were important but ultimately it is fair to ask what each country expects to gain commercially from the detailed agreement that has emerged the dollar value of us trade with central america makes the region the united states third largest latin american trading partner right behind brazil but far distant third from mexico still these are small economies see appendix b for economic data and although firms engaged in this trade may find its effects significant total caftadr trade in 2004 represented only 15 of us foreign commerce and so can be expected to have only small macroeconomic effect for the united states an fta is more balanced trade arrangement than the unilateral preferences provided in the cbicbtpa market access issues eg tariff rates quotas rules of origin were core negotiating areas although central american and dominican tariffs were already relatively low they were reduced further in particular us business interests wanted equal or better treatment than that afforded to exports from canada and mexico based on their ftas with central american countries permanent and clarified trade rules also supported the joint production arrangements already in place between us firms and those in the region finally bilateral agreement offered the united states chance to deepen other trade commitments that affect some of its most competitive industries including rules covering the treatment of intellectual property foreign investment government procurement ecommerce and services from the central american and dominican perspectives reducing barriers to the us market especially for textile and agricultural products was cause enough to proceed the caftadr also made permanent and expanded us benefits given under the cbtpa legislation but which require reauthorization by congress permanence in trade rules is an enticement for us foreign direct investment fdi which in turn can support the regions export driven development strategy the caftadr countries also faced important vulnerabilities such as the possibility that us agricultural exports of key staples such as corn and rice might overwhelm their small markets sensitivity to these and other key industry sectors were addressed in the extended tariff phaseout and safeguard schedules and as matter of development policy by caftadr country efforts to diversify the agricultural sector into nontraditional exports and nonfarm employment 19 finally there were two significant negotiation challenges the first was the need for better central american integration as part of caftadr which historically has been hampered having multiple trade rules and rules of origin in small subregion would complicate the trade picture for the caftadr to work well the ited states needed assurance that goods would 18 usitc textiles

agriculture and textile manufacturing is critical to achieve economic diversification and development what distinguishes this effort from the earlier agricultural export model is the emphasis on integrating small producers into the export system the idea is not only to tap into naturally small production capabilities but to help br ing social development to areas that previously were not integrated into the agricultural export development model it is still relatively small effort and its widespread application has yet to be fully realized but the caftadr countries see the fta as

salvador with 18 costa rica with 9 guatemala with 8 and nicaragua with 2 under the cbtpa these countries may engage in greater valueadded operations such as cutting and dyeing which has allowed them to remain selectively competitive with lowcost asian exports these restrictions are further relaxed under the caftadr 22 the usitc points out that the caftadr countries have been losing market share to asia since at least 1997 and the caftadr is seen as way to help abate this trend23 third costa rica attracted 500 million in fore ign direct investment for computer chip assembly and testing plant

fastest growing and most diversified trader in central america which explains in part why it has outpaced its neighbors on the development path24 the caftadr is intended to build on these trends support export diversification and provide longterm stable trade environment that will increase us foreign investment in the region evidence is already seen in alternative agricultural exports such as cut flowers and miniature vegetables in multiple caftadr countries as well as developing maquiladora operations to supply coil wrapped cables for the automotive sector honduras and adapting apparel

central america include electrical and office machinery computers apparel yarn fabric and plastic many of these goods are processed in some form and reexported back to the united states under productionsharing arrangements for example nearly 60 of electrical machinery exports to central america is integrated circuits going to costa rica for processing and reexport the same may be said for fabric and yarns that are exported to all countries sewn and otherwise assembled and reexported back to the united states some of these goods are consumed in th caftadr countries along with capital goods machinery and parts and agricultural products similar trends for us import trade are evident in us exports in 2004 78 of knit apparel and 76 of knit cotton and yarn fabric went to honduras and salvador although the united states exports machinery and parts to all five countries electrical machinery and particularly integrated circuits are sent to costa rica all five countries import us cereals and some such as corn and rice are among the more import sensitive products for the caftadr countries because they are staple crops and grown by small often subsistence farmers 25 the significant aspects of this trade structure are that it reflects 1 the continued historical trend of largely dutyfree regional dependence on the large us market as an important aspect of trade and development policy 2 deepening economic integration and 3 growing us direct investment over the long run 24 hufbauer kotschwar and wilson op cit p 1003 25 usitc productionsharing update developments

congressional debate over trade agreements focused on their potential economic effects on the united states congress mandated that the united states international trade commission usitc assess these effects and it released its final report in august 2004 this report provides quantitative and qualitative estimates of the caftadr effects on the us economy as whole and for selected sectors ov erall it found that the welfare value or aggregate effect on us consumers and househol ds of trade liberalization under the caftadr would be approximately 166 million less than 001 of gdp for each year the agreement is in effect 26 with respect to trade flows the reduction of relatively higher tariff rates on us goods is expected to increase us exports more than imports with the region the usitc model estimates that when the caftadr is fully implemented us exports to the caftadr countries will increase by 27 billion or 15 while imports will increase by 28 billion or 12 the effect of this trade growth on aggregate us output and employment is estimated to be minimal the largest sector increases were estimated to occur for us grains 029 for output and 031 for employment and the greatest decrease to occur for sugar manufacturing 20 for both output and employment 27 these estimates are in line with expectations voiced prior to the negotiations that the marginal effects of the caftadr

imports than those in the cbtpa it removes all duties on textile and apparel imports that qualify under the agreements rules of origin retroactive to january 1 2004 and allows for special safeguard measures during the duty phaseout period the permanence of the provisions and the more accommodating rules of origin and administrative guidelines may generate marginal increase in apparel imports from the region these provisions are intended to address the decline in us market share of textile and apparel imports from the region over the past five years most of which have been displaced by asian products despite the enhanced preferential treatment that congress afforded to central american and dominican imports under the cbtpa 30 central american and dominican apparel has been entering the united states duty free for years if it is assembled from us yarn and fabric under the socalled yarn forward rule the difference from the cbtpa is that dutyfree access applies to textiles and garments assembled from components made in either the caftadr count ries or the united states rather than just the united states31 exceptions to this rule include an enhanced cumulation rule which allows dutyfree treatment for limited quantity of woven apparel assembled from components made in canada and mexico to help us textile firms invested in these countries in addition there are exceptions for specified products affecting less than 10 of trade goods with limited amounts of material from third countries and for tariff preference levels tpls given to few imports from nicaragua and costa rica although these rules were widely supported some textile producers registered concern that they are overly restrictive and therefore limited in their intended effect of helping the region compete by lowering costs in the us market agains t asian imports us and caftadr firms that produce for the us market wanted as much flexibility as possible to use fabrics from third countries others feared however that they are too generous and that if customs procedures are not well implemented they could harm us producers by increasing opportunities for the illegal transshipment of

the shortsupply list this is the list of goods given dutyfree access if made from materials that are determined to be commercially in short supply in the united states the caftadr may also increase us exports of textiles which have risen significantly under cbtpa on balance however the usitc study estimated that it will likely have negligible impact on us production or employment32 concerns raised by certain sectors of the textile and apparel industry required assurances from the bush administration before support would be given to the caftadr promises were made to 1 change the rules of origin for textiles and apparel to require that all pocketings and linings come from the caftadr countries rather than third party countries like china 2 negotiate new stricter customs enforcement agreement

support programs were not addressed in the caftadr which focused on reducing tariffs and increasing quota levels the most costly tradedistorting policies average applied tariffs on agricultural goods by most caftadr countries are relatively low ranging from 7 to 23 most agricultural imports face tariff in the united states for all countries the pressing challenge was negotiating tariff rate quotas trqssee below for their most sensitive products34 agricultural products have the most generous tariff phaseout schedules with up to 20 years for some products eg rice and dairy this approach acknowledges that the agricultural sectors bear most of the trade adjustment costs and that they will require time to make the transition to freer trade35 all agricultural trade eventually becomes dutyfree except for sugar imported by the united states fresh potatoes and onions imported by costa rica and white corn imported by the other central american countries these goods will continue to be subject to quotas that will increase after certain period by approximately 2 each year in perpetuity with decrease in the size of the abovequota tariff 36 over half of current us farm exports to

are subject to tariffrate quotas or limits on the quantity of imports that can enter the united states before very high tariff is applied the phased reduction in agriculture protection also includes the transitional use of volumetriggered safeguards or applying an additional duty temporarily on products that are being imported in quantities deemed threat to the domestic industry37 export subsidies are eliminated except when responding to third party export subsidies sugar was the most controversial agricultural issue to resolve and us sugar growers and processors were vehement opponents of the agreement to the end the us agreed to slight numerical increases in sugar quotas for all six countries sugar and sugarcontaining products imported under the us quota system enter the united states dutyfree but exports above the quota face prohibitive tariffs raw sugar receives the largest quota by volume 28 of the total us sugar quota for the world was filled by the caftadr countries in 2003 and was major issue for this agreement the us market accounts for only 14 of the regions sugar exports representing less than 10 of the regions sugar production 38 the caftadr raises the us quota by an amount equal to 35 of the current quota in year one rising to 50 by year 15 after which the quota increases each year slightly in perpetuity this may seem large but the usitc notes that the initial increase amounts to only 1 of us production and consumption of raw sugar in 2003 and that the overall effects of the sugar provisions may be small two studies done by the usitc and louisiana state university estimated that the sugar provisions could result in decline in sugar prices of 1 usitc and 46 lsu with perhaps largely offsetting employment effects in the sugar producing and sugarcontaining product industries 39 the united states may impose sugar price mechanism to compensate central american sugar exporters in lieu of according them dutyfree treatment but key issue for some members of congress was defining precisely how this mechanism will work nonetheless the sugar producing industry remained unsatisfied with these provisions the bush administration responded in letter from secr etary of agriculture mike johanns to senator saxby chambliss and representative bob goodlatte the respective agriculture committee chairs assuring the industry that the caftadr would not be allowed to interfere with the operation of the sugar program as defined in the farm security and rural investment act of 2002 the farm bill in particular he agreed to act should additional sugar imports due to the caftadr nafta and other trade agreements cause the import trigger threshold of 1532 million short tons per year to be exceeded and threaten the sugar program operations the us secretary of agriculture agreed that in such case he would preclude entry of additional sugar imports into the domestic sweetener market by either making direct payments to exporters or using agricultural commodities to purchase sugar to be used for nonfood use ethanol production this offer also proved inadequate to bring ab out sugar industry support for the caftadr increasing grain exports was another important goal for the united states wheat is not grown in the caftadr countries and there is already larg ely free trade in this commodity staples for the 37 for example in the case of beef the central american countries have agreed to the immediate elimination of tariffs on us prime and choice cuts but have 15year tariff phaseout on other products with backloaded schedule tariff reductions in the early years and safeguard the united states has 26 outofquota tariff on beef that will be phased out over 15 years with the quota schedule defined for each country 38

protected and there is complicated system for phasing out trqs on us exports over 1520 year period as with sugar imports to the united states us exports of corn and rice will increase slowly due to the highly restrictive trqs and special safeguard measures the usitc estimates that changes in the quantity of exports from the united states will be small at first and rise by perhaps 20 by the end of the trq phaseout period the usitc ggests that the longrun effect may be small 12 of total us grain exports but notes that the potential increase in grains exports offers significant market opportunities for us white an d yellow corn growers and us rice growers40 despite the lengthy transition period toward freer trade under the caftadr concerns remain over the potentially harmful effects to central america particularly to the small commercial and subsistence farmers of further opening its markets to us agriculture41 three recent studies however agree that overall increased agricultural trade can also be one source of central american rural development in addition to increasing central american agricultural exports the majority of households are net consumers of agricultural goods and so stand to gain from lower prices the equivalent to an increase in family income because subsistence farmers produce generally does not reach the market they are unlikely to be affected greatly by changes in market prices42 still for the minority of rural net producers of agricultural goods economists also agree that adjustment policies are essential beginning with targeted income assistance for rural areas to benefit fully from the caftadr there is also critical need for increased investment in transportation and communications infrastructure education and more fully developed financial services these measures would improve agricultural productivity help transition workers toward alternative crops or nonfarm employment and integrate the rural economy more fully with the national and international economy without concerted effort in adjustment assistance the poorest segments of rural central america may remain vulnerable to the negative effects of freer trade

stood out first an inve storstate provision common in us bilateral investment treaties bits and used in earlier ftas was included it allows investors alleging breach in investment obligations to seek binding arbitration against the state through the dispute settlement mechanism defined in the investment chapter us investors have long s upported the inclusion of investorstate rules to ensure that they have recourse in countries that do not adequately protect the rights of foreign investors since bilateral investment treaties are usually made with developing countries that have little foreign investment in the united states such provision was thought unlikely to be used in th united states circumstances changed however under nafta when canada used investorstate pr ovisions to raise indirect expropriation claims against us state environmental regulations44 although none of the claims filed against the united states has prevailed congress instructed in tpa legislation that future trade agreements ensure that foreign investors in the united states are not accorded greater substantive rights with respect to investment protections than united states investors in response annex 10c of the caftadr states that except in rare circumstances nondiscriminatory regulatory actions by party that are designed and applied to protect legitimate welfare objectives such as public health safety and the environment do not constitute indirect expropriations this provision and another that allow for early elimination of frivolous suits were intended to address congressional concerns but there is uncertainty about how well the changes will operate second the caftadr countries requested greate r flexibility in the treatment of certain sovereign debt annex 10a allows sovereign debt owed to the united states that has been suspended and rescheduled not to be held subject to the dispute settlement provisions in investment chapter with the exception that it be given national and mfn treatment annex 10e extends from six months to one year the amount of time required before us investor may seek arbitration related to sovereign debt with maturity of less than one year both provisions are intended in the event of financial crisis to keep the caftadr from interfering in any sovereign debt restructuring process and are viewed by the us treasury as an accommodation to central american interests g21g142g155g159g146g140g142g156g561 the united states is the largest services exporter in the world and services trade presented number of hurdles given that the central american countries have adopted few commitments of the wtos general agreement on trade in services gats there were also many industry specific barriers that existed such as barriers to foreign insurance companies in guatemala heavy regulation licensing of foreign professionals in honduras local partner requirements in some financial services in nicaragua and numerous services monopolies in costa rica insurance and telecommunications 45 the caftadr provides broader market access and greater regulatory transparency for most industries including telecommunications insurance 44 indirect expropriation refers to regulatory and other actions that can adversely affect business or property owner in way that is tantamount to expropriation this issue and many cases are discussed in crs

and branches regulation of service industries is required to be transparent and applied on an equal basis and ecommerce rules are clearly defined critical component of delivering services46 the usitc suggests that the caftadr likely will have little effect on us services imports because the market is already largely open it does anticipate opportunities for us firms to expand into central america in particular costa rica agreed to the eventual opening of its state run telecommunications and insurance industries where there has been strong political resistance to privatization and deregulation 47 unlike the other countries doing so constitutes major structural adjustment for the costa rican economy has implications for costa rican social policy and required amending domestic laws all of which was difficult for their legislature to support if they did not receive concrete tradeoffs in other areas such as agriculture and textiles negotiators resolved these issues in two weeklong discussions held in january 2004 and their detailed commitments are presented in the relevant chapters of the caftadr because of this continued sensitivity however the caftadr was delayed until after national referendum supported moving ahead with the agreement g9g152g159g142g155g151g150g142g151g157g561g18g155g152g140g158g155g142g150g142g151g157g561 none of the caftadr countries is sign atory to the wto agreement on government procurement and complaints against purchasing processes vary from dissatisfaction with opaque and cumbersome procedures in costa rica to ou tright corruption in guatemala salvador nicaragua and honduras passed new government procurement laws in 200001 and in general there have been improvements in all countries in dealing with project bidding although transparency issues remain48 some analysts believe this is due in part to lack of incentives given that many of these countries will not be able to compete in the us government procurement market49 the caftadr grants nondiscriminatory rights to bid on contracts from central american ministries agencies and departments with the exception of lowvalue contracts and other exceptions it also calls for procurement procedures to be transparent and fair including clear advance notices of purchases and effective review specific schedules detailing exceptions and limitations were written by each country covering such diverse issues as the sale of firearms to supplying school lunch programs in addition each country provided list of subnational governments eg states and municipalities that agree to adhere to the government procurement provisions the caftadr also makes clear that bribery is criminal offense under the laws of all countries in general the provisions are supported by us

intellectual property rights ipr laws and are closing in on complying with the wto agreement on traderelated aspects of intellectual property rights trips that said all countries are subject to criticism for falling short of either clarifying or enforcing penalties for noncompliance and in some cases have simply not adopted reforms that many us industries eg sound and video recordings pharmaceuticals book publishing computer software consider necessary to protect their intellectual property piracy incomplete or inadequate legal protection and enforcement capacity remain problems and ongoing concerns exist across the range of ipr i ssues of patents trademarks and copyrights covering print electronic and other media 51 the ipr provisions in the caftadr go bey ond those in the wto they provide that all businesses receive equal treatment and that the caftadr countries ratify or accede to various international ip agreements trademark holders benefit from transparent online registration process and special system to resolve disputes over internet domain issues among other improvements copyright provisions clarify use of digital materials exceeding trips standards including rights over temporary copies of work s on computers music videos software text sole author rights for making their work available online extended terms of protection for copyrighted materials strong anticircumvention provisions to prohibit tampering with technologies the requirement that governments use only legitimate computer software the prohibition of unauthorized receipt or distribution of encrypted satellite signals and rules for liability of internet service providers for copyright infringement patents and trade secrets rules conform more closely with us norms enduser piracy is criminalized and all parties are required to authorize the seizure forfeiture and destruction of counterfeit and pirated goods the caftadr also mandates statutory damage s for abuse of copyrighted material 52 the caftadr goes long way toward meeting us business ipr protection needs and the usitc suggests that many industries will benefit fr om higher revenue if the new standards can be enforced even if laws are changed to c onform to the caftadr commitments however enforcement problems will likely continue and technical assistance may be needed to help develop the necessary capabilities 53 g18g145g138g155g150g138g140g142g158g157g146g140g138g149g561g6g138g157g138g561g18g155g152g157g142g140g157g146g152g151g561 to bring patented drug to market drug company must demonstrate

g344g345g561the ustr argued that this change was breach of the caftadr commitments and threatened to delay implementing legislation until the law was changed guatemala reversed the data protection law to the disappointment of many who argued that the caftadr provisions could delay access to future generic drugs given that data protection and patent protection often run concurrently however it is debatable whether the introduction of future generic drugs will be further inhibited by this provision an august 5 2004 side agreement among all signatories further clarifies that obligations under chapter 15 of the caftadr do not affect countrys ability to take necessary measures eg compulsory licensing for generic drugs to protect public health by promoting access to medicines for all in particular those needed to combat epidemics such as hivaids tuberculosis and ma laria among others critics however would have preferred that the side agreement include an explicit exception to the data protection requirement for cases where compulsory licensing under the wto rules might be invoked 54 g14g138g139g152g155g561g138g151g141g561g7g151g159g146g155g152g151g150g142g151g157g561 perhaps the greatest challenge to the caftadr arose over concerns about the labor and environment chapters it has become widely accepted that labor and environment provisions should be part of modern trade agreements there is considerable disagreement however over how aggressive language in trade agreements should be in addressing these issues from an economic perspective labor and environment advocates in the united states argue that developing countries may have an unfair competitive advantage because their lower standards are the basis for their lower costs which in turn are reflected in lower prices for goods that compete with those produced in developed countries55 it follows from this argument that the difference in costs is an enticement to move us investment and jobs abroad on the other hand economists have argued that developing countries have comparative advantage in labor costs consistent with the free trade model and studies suggest that these cost differentials are usually not high enough to determine business location aloneproductivity remains the primary decision factor 56 further many economists view trade liberalization as part of the overall development process that in and off itself can promote social change57 developing countries are also 54 us congress house of representatives committee on ways and means dominican republiccentral america united states

fergusson 55 the difference is that in most developing countries the social costs associated with environmental degradation pollution and poor working conditions may not be captured in or are external to the market price socalled external costs through legal regulatory and tax measures developed countries require that businesses correct or pay for many of these social problems thereby internalizing these costs to the business where they are then reflected in the final relatively higher price of the good or service in the market place 56 see stern robert m labor standards and trade in bronckers

argument as to whet her the caftadr countries guarantee core ilo principles 59 some interpreted the report to affirm that the caftadr countries laws comply with internationally recognized labor

assistance of the interamerican development bank the caftadr country ministers of trade and labor released study of their countries shortfalls in meeting and enforcing core labor principles although it documented that all countries had made recent changes to their labor laws there was clear reco gnition for the need to harmonize some laws better with ilo principles as well as address forcement of

labor standards for all member countries and the dispute settlement mechanism for arbitrating formal complaints against noncompliance it closely follows language set out in trade promotion authority tpa legislation on the principal negotiating objectives of the united states with respect to labor62 the ustr made note of this fact and further argued that the chapter goes beyond earlier ftas through labor cooperation and capacity building mechanism that will support mutual approach to improve working conditions in caftadr countries by 1 ensuring effective enforcement of existing labor laws 2 working with the ilo to improve existing bor laws and enforcement and 3 building local capacity to improve workers rights critics charged however that the caftadr labor provisions were too weak because they give different weight to the following three provisions 1 the effective enforcement of domestic labor laws 2 the reaffirmation of commitments to ilo basic principles and 3 nonderogation from domestic standards not weakening or reducing protections to encourage trade and investment 63 the first provision failure to enforce domestic labor laws can be formally challenged in the dispute resolution process as defined in the caftadr dispute resolution is not available for the other two provisions although they are supported in principle articles 162 and 166 there was also concern over the differences between labor and other dispute settlement provisions if commercial dispute remains unsettled the country faces the possibility of suspension of benefits of equivalent effect artic 2016 resulting in the raising of tariffs or payment of monetary assessment fine equal to 50 of what dispute panel determines is of equivalent effect this article does not apply to the disputable labor provision the difference is that the option for failing to resolve labor dispute is monetary assessment paid by the country which is capped at 15 million per year per violati on with recourse to an equivalent dollar value of suspended benefits higher tariffs if the fine is not paid the fine is paid into fund operated by the country in question and is to be expended for appropriate labor initiatives g3g151g561g7g151g143g152g155g140g142g138g139g149g142g561g14g138g139g152g155g561g5g145g138g153g157g142g155g561 us labor advocates have charged that the labor provisions of the caftadr will not protect the core rights of workers in any of the six countries participating in the agreement64 many 62 the 2002 tpa vote itself was highly contentious in large part because of the disagreement

g344g348g561members of congress concurred believing that the enforce your own laws standard as well as the limited dispute settlement provisions would be ineffective at compelling countries to meet basic ilo standards it was also argued that they are step backward from the provisions allowing for the suspension of trade benefits found in us unilateral preferential trade arrangements such as the caribbean basin initiative cbi and the generalized system of preferences gsp in these the united states has the option to suspend trade benefits reimpose tariffs if country does not comply with provisions of the agreement including the labor section democrats cited number of examples includ ing caftadr countries where sanctions or threats thereof compelled changes in labor laws 65 further capping the assessment in labor dispute at 15 million and having the assessment paid into fund in the offending country was seen as largely ineffective mechanism for compliance supporters of the labor chapter argued that the agreement encourages countries to improve their laws making the enforce your own laws meaningful standard that the cbi option for trade sanctions is less appealing in reciprocal free trade agreement where the united states is also subject to the discipline and further that trade sanctions are blunt instrument punishing all export workers whose products would come under the sanctions potentially worsening their situation rather than improving it it was also argued that sanctions have not been widely used tool over the lives of the cbi and gsp programs and to the contrary that an annual 15 million fine per violation is potentially significant deterrent for the caftadr countries finally technical assistance cooperation and transparency were presented as more effective tools in the long run to bring about change in central america 66 only time will tell if the caftadr labor provisions provide support and possibly effective punitive responses to encourage deeper labor rights reforms in central america these provisions are similar to those found in other ftas for which congress passed implementing legislation including chile singapore morocco and australia jordans labor provisions were different in some places many members may have accepted that those countries had adequate labor laws even if there were enforcement or other concerns this perception was clearly lacking for the caftadr countries despite efforts to make transparent their deficiencies and to correct some laws and enforcement problems hence broader support was never reached in congress over the adequacy of these provisions in the caftadr 67 g7g151g159g146g155g152g151g150g142g151g157g138g149g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 major goals included protecting and

g344g349g561the ustr argued that congressional objectives on environmental issues have been met in the proposed caftadr agreement it includes langua ge requiring all countries to enforce their laws and regulations and also creates an environmental cooperation agreement with framework for establishing cooperation commission and process to conduct capacity building all parties agree to commit to establish high levels of environmental protection and to open proceedings in the administration and enforcement of laws and regulations69 advocates raised the issue of the environmental effects of trade particularly in developing countries that may have weak laws and lax enforcement mechanisms but the environmental provisions were not the most contentious is sues in the caftadr many of these same advocates have conceded that trade agreements have not led to catastrophic pollution problems nor encouraged regulatory race to the bottom in fact there has also been certain acknowledged degree of success by having environmental issues addressed in the body of ftas in side agreements on environmental cooperation and through technical assistance programs the latter of which developing countries can use to respond to specific problems advocates still noted that much can be improved such as tightening enforcement language and ensuring that the united states allocates financial resources to back up promises of technical assistance particularly in the case of central america where commitment to public accountability is questioned in some cases 70 the trade and environment policy advisory committee supported most of the environment provisions in the caftadr and particularly the enhanced public participation process negotiated by the state department in side agreement the dispute settlement provisions effectively the same rules governing labor disputes were accepted as striking the proper balance the advisory committee still raised number of specific environmental concerns and questioned whether the caftadr would be able to meet congressional objectives on capacity building without concrete funding for the program 71 in response the seven countries signed supplemental environmental cooperation agreement eca on february 18 2005 it calls for new unit to be established in the secretariat for central american integration to administer public submissions or complaints made on enforcement issues the eca is intended to address both shortand longterm environmental goals including providing for monitoring process but does not address concerns over funding for the implementation of environmental initiatives

discussions began on the caftadr the central american countries were apprehensive over the possibility of being overwhelmed by the resource and experience advantage that the united states had to negotiate and comply with liberalized trade rules hence the need for trade capacity building which may be classified into three distinct areas beyond trade negotiation capabilities first the ability to identify priorities including where the major adjustment costs losers are expected to be and how to respond to them second the ability to develop resources to implement the agreement incl uding institutional financial and analytical resources third the capacity to benefit from the caftadr 72 the agreement created permanent committee on trade capacity building to continue work begun in the negotiation process and recommendations in the agreement call for one of its first priorities to be customs administration the third category however is arguably the most challenging it refers to the ability of business to compete in larger market learn how to export and use imports as inputs more to its advantage tap into global finance navigate customs and trade logistics problems and in other ways make the transition from local producer to international player 73 this will be difficult challenge for many central american firms particularly if barriers to world trade are reduced outside the
