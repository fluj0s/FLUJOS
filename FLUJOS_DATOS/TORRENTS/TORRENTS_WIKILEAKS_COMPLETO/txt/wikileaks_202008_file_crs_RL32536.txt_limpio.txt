information exchange matrix pilot project summary this report provides an overview of the multistate antiterrorism information exchange matrix pilot project which leverages advanced computerinformation management capabilities to more quickly access share and analyze public records to help law enforcement generate leads expedite investigations and possibly prevent terrorist attacks the pilot project is intended to demonstrate the effective use of such capabilities but it is less clear whether the project has been designed to prevent unnecessary intrusions on privacy the matrix pilot project is being administered by the institute for intergovernmental research for the department of homeland security dhs project security and access to the matrix system is managed by the florida department of law enforcement the project is being funded by the dhs office of domestic preparedness 8 million and the department of justices bureau of justice assistance 4 million privacy advocates civil libertarians and others oppose matrix and similar systems for fear that unrestricted data mining could lead to massive invasion of privacy as such systems could enable governments to scrutinize the lives and activities of ordinary citizens advocates for the matrix pilot project counter that this system allows authorized investigators to share and analyze information that is already available to law enforcement from public and stateowned data without subpoena or court order they contend that with matrix limited investigative information can be developed to generate potential leads within seconds as opposed to taking days or weeks to manually track and acquire the same information the 911 commission did not address the issue of data mining of public or private sector data for the purposes of fighting terrorism but the commission expressed concern about data sharing between government agencies and the private sector to protect the privacy of individuals the commission called for the president to promulgate guidelines to govern information sharing and establish board to oversee adherence to those guidelines it remains uncertain whether the matrix pilot project is currently designed to assess and address privacy and civil liberty concerns if not it might be possible that the pilot project could be redesigned to provide an empirical framework to evaluate the use of such data in the future and to minimize unwarranted intrusions on privacy it has been suggested that unless consensus were found regarding the use of public and private sector data for the purposes of national security and counterterrorism the unregulated use of such data could lead to abuses and unnecessary encroachments on privacy perhaps equally as important lack of consensus could lead to public rejection and subsequent loss of what many believe to be one of the greatest advantages available to the united states to prevent future terrorist attacks advanced computing

sharing drug enforcementrelated criminal intelligence19 seisint executive bill shrewsbury reportedly has asserted that the matrix system longer uses the scoring system that produced the high terrorist factor list of suspects in the weeks following the september 11 2001 attacks among other things seisint apparently longer has access to intelligence data that were previously fed into the system for demonstration purposes20 the core of the matrix pilot project is the factual analysis criminal threat solution facts with this new application law enforcement officers can more effectively query available public records with incomplete information such as partial license plate number21 in addition to the partial vehicle tag query facts includes crime mapping association charting described below and lineup and photo montage applications there are over 39 billion public records available in the facts database22 the fdle controls access to the matrix pilot program and is charged with the responsibility for assuring that the facts application is secure to participate in the matrix pilot project states sign an agreement that the system will only be used in the pursuit of criminal investigative matters according to the matrix website information sharing between the states is arranged so that each state is in compliance with its privacy laws23 while five states are currently participating in the matrix pilot project 11 states have dropped out prompted by concerns in part about how the data were being stored in central repository according to press accounts to participate in the system states initially were required to transfer control of stateowned data to matrix system administrators24 the transfers of these data to outside concerns may have violated state privacy

original 16 participating states would have covered over half of the us population to alleviate some of the privacy concerns the developers of matrix re engineered the system on the principle of distributed computing rather than housing all the data in central repository the reengineered matrix system accesses data remotely by using webbased and secured connectivity to individual statemaintained databases25 under this arrangement if the pilot program receives further funding the data remain with the states in its report entitled creating trusted network for homeland security the markle foundations task force on national security in the information age has suggested that unless consensus were found about the use of public and private sector data for criminal intelligence purposes efforts like matrix run the risk of being cut back or eliminated26 case in point would be the total information awareness tia program dod program that generated controversy in 2002 when it became known that the defense advanced research projects agency darpa had created tool to find new sources of data mine information from the new and old generate information make it available for analysis convert it to knowledge and create actionable options27 fears that tia would be used against us persons citizens or legal permanent residents prompted congress to restrict the funding for dod data mining so it could only be used for processing analysis and collaboration tools for counterterrorism with foreign nexus28 some privacy advocates have compared matrix to the tia program29 while the matrix pilot project is on smaller scale than the tia program both programs are affected by many of the same laws and underlying privacy issues30 the fdle however maintains that matrix is not similar to tia31 matrix queries only public and stateowned records state vehicle and crime records as opposed to private records mailing lists and credit histories the fdle underscores that these 25

matrix in its most current iteration has been developed in compliance with the national criminal intelligence sharing plan that was released by the doj in december 200333 matrix data sources as currently configured the matrix system accesses broad array of public data ranging from motor vehicle driving records to bankruptcy filings while much of these data have been available to law enforcement they have not been previously queried crossreferenced and analyzed with computers according to the matrix website such records include the following pilot licenses issued by the federal aviation administration aircraft ownership property ownership us coast guardregistered vessels state sexual offender lists corporate filings uniform commercial code filings or business liens bankruptcy filings and stateissued professional licenses34 according to the matrix website available records also include records that have historically been available to law enforcement agencies such records include criminal history records department of corrections information and photo images sexual offender criminal history files drivers license information and photo images and motor vehicle

marriage licenses divorce decrees or utility bill payments36 the washington post has quoted guy tunnell the current fdle commissioner and sitting chair of the matrix executive committee stating that the use of this system will be driven by threat information developed from criminal and domestic security intelligence or by actual criminal investigations he argues that matrix is an investigative tool which will not be used indiscriminately to conduct surveillance on individuals and that the system is designed to guard against inappropriate or unauthorized use37 privacy concerns privacy advocates civil libertarians and others object to the matrix pilot project because it could give the government greater and easier access to vast amounts of both public and possibly private sector data that are gathered oftentimes with expectations of privacy for purposes other than law enforcement they are also concerned with the quality of these data and the ability of individuals to correct faulty or invalid data about themselves prospect that would require some transparency in regard to the system and its data sources this would be especially important for any system that would be used to screen persons and may result in the denial of benefit the ability to travel or some other activity privacy advocates civil libertarians and others reportedly object to the possibility that the government could launch initiatives with the aid of computer programs algorithms that could be used to electronically search for or monitor patterns of suspicious behavior of persons whom the government previously had reason to suspect of criminal or terrorist activities38 in addition they are concerned about the characteristics such as life style ethnicity religious faith or income status with which the government may choose to profile individuals under certain circumstances with this system 36 ibid 37 cynthia l webb total information dilemma washington post may 27 2004 see

records washington post aug 6 2003 p a01 crs8 proponents argue that such capabilities could be of immense value to intelligence and law enforcement authorities charged with national security counterterrorism and law enforcement responsibilities for example some state that such capabilities could be used to provide valuable leads for child abductions or to identify the whereabouts of known alqaeda operatives while many may agree with these uses under certain circumstances there may also be concern about mission creep39 as these same capabilities could be used to monitor the activities of social activists and other dissenters who are opposed to governmental policies some argue such system could be used for political purposes such as undermining ones political opponents policy considerations related to data mining for counterterrorism purposes according to the markle foundation task force on national security in the information age in the past decade the quantity of personal data held by the private sector has exploded as computing and storage capabilities have rapidly advanced and associated costs have correspondingly diminished40 the same could be said of public data held by federal state and local governments much public and private sector data have been aggregated into data marts this information is often available commercially for sale from companies specializing in data aggregation like choicepoint equifax experian qsent lexisnexis and westlaw with advanced computing technologies tera and peta bytes of data can be manipulated41 and multiple data marts can be merged or cross referenced moreover computer applications are available to mine these data for the purposes of profiling pattern analysis link analysis42 transactional footprinting43 and identity verification 39 markle foundation creating trusted network for homeland security p 31 40 ibid p 30 41 terabyte is roughly trillion bytes 1012 petabyte is roughly

httpwwwdetnewscom2003metro030320d12e 112610htm crs9 even before the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks law enforcement agents in the united states had availed themselves of the seisints services for the purposes of furthering criminal investigations under limited circumstances for example through dna analysis the fbi national data center had linked several sexual assaults one involving murder in philadelphia pennsylvania and fort collins colorado the philadelphia police turned to seisint to produce list of 40 men who had lived in both cities at the time of the attacks while clearly this list included persons who were innocent of the crimes under investigation the rapist reportedly was identified from this list of potential suspects he was convicted of murder in colorado and is serving life sentence44 while on the face of it few would condemn the capture and successful prosecution of rapist and murderer privacy advocates civil libertarians and others have questioned whether appropriate policies and safeguards have been established to prevent the abuse of such information they maintain that unrestricted data mining could lead to massive invasion of privacy as such systems could enable governments to scrutinize the lives and activities of ordinary citizens45 at the same time public and private sector data can be used to help identify known and suspected terrorists as well as violent criminals such efforts are already underway at the fbiadministered foreign terrorist tracking task force ftttf46 the government accountability office formerly the general accounting office recently surveyed 128 federal agencies and reported that 52 agencies are currently engaged in 199 data mining projects for wide range of purposes but only few involve analyzing foreign and criminal intelligence to detect terrorist and criminal activities47 more recently the 911 commission issued its final report in july 2004 while the commission did not address the issue of aggregating and analyzing public and private sector data data mining the commission did expressed concerns about data sharing the commission called for guidelines to be determined by the president that would govern information sharing between government agencies and the private sector so as to protect the privacy of individuals about whom the information was being shared48 the commission also called for the establishment of an executive branch board to oversee adherence to the guidelines49 44 blake harrison matrix revolution state legislatures may 2004 p 13 45 american civil liberties union the

ibid p 395 crs10 prior to the 911 commissions final report the markle task force reported that there remain governmentwide policy guidelines for the acquisition storage and retention of privatelyheld data by the federal government for counterterrorism national security or other law enforcement purposes the report included recommendation that new guidelines should be promulgated by the executive branch that would address the following issues 1 government acquisition and use of private sector data 2 government retention of the data 3 sharing of the data by the acquiring agency with other agencies for purposes other than counterterrorism and 4 accountability and oversight50 this report also recommended that congress provide strong oversight of governmentwide activities related to the acquisition retention and sharing of private sector data for the purposes of national security counterterrorism and law enforcement in addition dods technology and privacy advisory committee tapac which was formed in the wake of the tia controversy issued report that concluded that data mining could be vital tool in the fight against terrorism but it presented significant privacy concerns when such endeavors involved data on us persons51 the tapac called for statutory and regulatory framework for data mining that would among other things require written findings by an agency head and court authorization before data mining could be conducted if it involved us persons52 other technical requirements recommended by the tapac included data minimization and anonymization53 secured systems and immutable audit trails54 as stated earlier in this report it remains uncertain whether the matrix pilot project is currently designed to assess and address privacy and civil liberty concerns if not it might be possible that the pilot project could be redesigned to provide an empirical framework to evaluate the use of such data in the future and to minimize unwarranted intrusions on privacy the markle report suggested that unless consensus were found regarding the use of public and private sector data for the purposes of national security and counterterrorism the unregulated use of such data

which specific individuals can be identified such as addresses phone numbers and social security numbers as part of this process persons identified through data mining as possibly connected with terrorist activities or other crimes would have to be reidentified 54 ibid p 50 for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32536
