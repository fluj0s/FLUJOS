from the appropriations committee five members from the ways and means committee one member from the elected majority party leadership and one member from the elected minority party leadership serve on the budget committee section 2e of hres 5 amends clause 5a2 of rule x to require that one member from the rules committee also serve on the budget committee like the appropriations and ways and means committees the rules committee is involved directly in matters relevant to the budget committee for instance the rules committee shares jurisdiction with the budget committee over congressional budget process matters also the rules committee as the houses traffic cop plays an important role in scheduling the houses consideration of budget resolutions and other budgetary mattershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31728crs2 2 however the two members from the elected party leadership are excepted from this limittable 1 changes to standing house rules affecting the congressional

of house ru x prohibits member from serving as chair for more than three consecutive congresses the limit on committee service however conceivably could prevent member from serving as chair for three consecutive congresses if the member did not become chair until his or her third or fourth consecutive congress on the budget committee under the previous house rules eith er the chair or the ranking minority member could serve on the committee for fifth congress in period of six successive congresses if the member served in the same leadership capacity during the immediately previous congress but did not serve in that capacity in an earlier congress consequently either the chair or the ranking minority memberhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31728crs3 3 under this scenario member would have serv ed his

overriding threecongress limit on member serving as the chair or the ranking minority member contained in clause 5c2 of house rule x the new rule effectively allows member first elected to serve as either the chair or the ranking minority member in his or her fourth consecutive term on the budget committee to serve for an additional two terms on this committee in the same leadership capacity instead of only one additional congress as the previous rule stipulated for example mber of the budget committee now would be eligible to serve three congresses as either chair or ranking minority

of the revenue changes expected to result from enactment of any revenue measure reported by the committee or offered but not reported as an approved committee amendment the committee must use the revenue estimates provided by the joint committee on taxation5 when revenue measure is considered on the house floor the budget committee employs these estimates fo r budget enforcement purposes6 in

revenues for fiscal year must be based on the estimates made by the budget committee presumably if the joint committee on taxation provided estimates using only macroeconomic impact analysis the budget committee could be obliged to use these estimates for budget enforcement purposesbeginning in the 105th congress clause 3h2 of house rule xiii formerly clause 7e of rule xiii before the house recodified its rules in the 106th congress provided the chair of the ways and means committee with the option to request and include in the committee report accompanying bill or joint resolution dynamic estimate of the revenue changes expected to result from enactment of the measure if the majority leader designated it as m ajor tax legislation the rule defined dynamic estimate as projection based in any part on assumptions concerning probable effects of macroeconomic feedback the dynamic estimate could be used for informational purposes but would not have direct impact on enforcement issues section 2j of hres 5 effectivel makes the reporting of dynamic revenue estimates requirement instead of an opti on the new clause 3h2 of house rule xiii prohibits from consideration ways and means co mmitteereported b ill or joint resolution that proposes to amend the in ternal revenue code of 1986 unless the committee report accompanying the measure includes macroeconomic impact analysis or the chair of the ways and means committee submits for printing in the congressional record such an analysis prior to the measures consideration on the house floor the new requirement also may be met by including in the committee report statement explaining why such an analysis is not calculable from the joint committee on taxation the new rule defi nes macroeconomic impact analysis as i an

and ii statement from the joint committ ee on internal revenue sic taxation identifying the critical assumptions and the source data underlying that estimate neither the new rule nor the congre ssional budget act cba requires the budget committee to use these estimate s for budget enforcement purposes presumably as long as alternative estimates are available8 however neither the new rule nor

history and controversies in the 1980s and 1990s by philip d winters 13 the rule was established by pl 9678 93 stat 589591 an act to provide for temporary increase in the public debt limit and first applied to the fy1981 budget resolution for the debate in the house see congressional record vol 125 sept 26 1979 pp 2633726350 in 1983 the existing separate temporary and permanent statutory limits on the public debt were combined into one pe rmanent statutory limit on the public debt pl continueddefinition of tax or tariff measure clause 5a of house rule xxi prohibits the reporting of tax or tariff measure by committee not having jurisdiction over such matter9 further during consider ation of measure reported by committee not having jurisdiction over tax or tariff measures the house may not consider an amendment carrying tax or tariff under existing precedents in the case of provision in or an amendmen t to general appr opriations measure affecting the use of funds for the administra tion of tax or tariff the burden is on the member making the point of order to show necessary certain and inevitable change in revenue collections or tax statuses or liabilities10 section 2o of hres 5 am ends clause 5a of rule xxi to clarify that tax or tariff measure includes an amendment limiting the use of funds for the administration of tax or tariff under this change presumably member raising point of order under clause 5a of rule xxi longer needs to show that such an amendment would result in necessary certain and inevitable change in revenues instead it would need to show only tex tual relationship between the amendment and the administration of the tax or tariff11 the rule change apparently would not apply to comparable provision in gene ral appropriations measure but only to an amendment offered thereto public debtlimit legislation the amount of money the federal government is allowed to borrow generally is subject to statutory limit from time to time congress must adopt gislation to raise this limit12 in 1979 the house amended its rules to provide for the automatic engrossment of joint resolution increasing the debt limit once congress agreed to the conference report on the budget resolution thereby voiding separate vote on the debtlimit legislation13 since 1979 the rule commonly referre d to as the gephardt rule afterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31728crs6 13 continued 9834 subsequently the rule was amended to reflect this change by hres 241 98th congress see congressional record vol 129 june 23 1983 pp 1716217164 14 it was repealed by hres 5 adopted on jan 3 2001 see congressional record daily edition vol 147 jan 3 2001 pp h6h11its author representative richard gephardt caused the automatic engrossment of 15 joint resolutions increasing the public debt limit 11 of these were enacted into law in several years the rule was spended because legislation changing the statutory limit was not necessary also the house and senate have used alternative legislative procedures such as the reconc iliation process to increase the public debt limit in several years since the gephardt rule was first established the rule had not been utilized since the first session of the 103rd congress and subsequently was removed from the hous rules at the beginning of the 107th congress14 section 2t of hres 5 restores the au tomatic engrossing process formerly used under the gephardt rule the new rule rule xxvii stipulates that joint resolution specifying the amount of the bt limit contained in the budget resolution automatically is deemed to have passed the house by the same vote as the conference report on the budget resolution the senate has comparable procedure and may consider such joint resolution unde r the regular legislative process separate orders hres 5 also contains f our separate orders aff ecting the congressional budget process which clarify the applicati on of certain points of order under the congressional budget act cba of 1974 and provide deeming resolution in the absence of an fy2003 budget resolution for budget enforcement purposes see table 2 three of these separate orders had been agreed to in previous congresses separate orders are not codified in the standing rules of the house references to resolution in section 306 of the cba section 306 of the cba prohibits the consideration of any bill resolution amendment motion or conference report dealing with matter under the jurisdiction of the budget committee unless that committee has reported it or been discharged from its further consideration or unless it is an amendment to such measure section 3a1 of hres 5 renews parate order adopted at the beginning of the 107th congress clarifying that the term resolution in section 306 refers to joint resolution under the clarifica tion therefore simple or concurrent resolution dealing with matter under th jurisdiction of the budget committee presumably would not be subject to section 306 point of order application of point of orde r under section 303 of the cba section 303 of the cba prohibits the consideration of any measure that c ontains spending revenue or debtlimit provision for fiscal year until congress has agreed to budget resolution for that fiscal year in the house general appropriations measureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31728crs7 15 in 1995 for example the chair responded to parliamentary inquiry about the application of budget act points of order by noting that section 303 among other sections applied to measure in its reported state and therefor did not apply to an unreported measure congressional record vol 141 mar 21 1995 p 8491 for detailed discussion of the effect of the words as reported in the cba see budget process law nnotated1993 edition by william g

congressional budget process in the 108th congress hres 5 section of hres 5descriptiona 3a1 clarifies that the term resolu tion in section 306 of the cba refers to joint resolution and not to simple or concurrent resolution section 306 prohibits the consideration of any bill resolution amendment motion or conference report under the jurisdiction of the budget committee unless it is reported by that committee 3a2 clarifies that section 303 of the cba applies to the text made in order as an original bill or joint resolution for the purpose of amendment or to the text on which the previous questi on is ordered directly to passage section 303 prohibits the considera tion of budgetary legislation until congress has agreed to budget resolution 3a3 clarifies that provision in asure that establishes new executive position at specified level of comp ensation subject to appropriation is not considered new entitlement aut hority within the meaning of the cba 3a4 provides that the fy2003 budget resolution adopted by the house during the 107th congress hconres 353 is considered to have been adopted by the 108th congress for budget enforcement purposes cba refers to the congressional budget ac t of 1974 titles iix of pl 93344 88 stat 297 332 prior to 1997 section 303 applied to any measure as reported only consequently measure that had been am ended to contain budgetary provision for fiscal year in which congress had not agreed to budget resolution would not be subject to this point of order as long as the reported measure did not contain such budgetary provision15 moreover measure that as reported contained such budgetary provision still would be subject to this point of order even though special rule eliminated the violating provision by making in order an amendment in the nature of substitute as an original bill the budget enforcement act of 1997 title x of pl 10533 balanced budget act of 1997 added new section to the cba that was intended to correct thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31728crs8 16 see joint explanatory statement of the committe of conference balanced budget act of 1997 conference report to accompany hr 2015 105th cong 1st sess hrept

h2242 18 see congressi onal record daily edition vol 145 jan 6 1999 p h34 and congressional record daily edition vol 146 jan 3 2001 p h8 respectively 19 section 303b3 of the cba provides an ex ception to the section 303a point of order for any unreported bill or joint resolution presumably the separate order also would supersede this exception 20 measure that provides new entitlement author ity that is to become effective after the current fiscal year is not s ubject to this point of orderanomaly16 section 315 provides that the words as reported in titles iii and iv of the cba refer to the text made in order for the purpose of amendment or the text on which the previous question was ordered directly for pa ssage however the bea of 1997 also eliminated the words as re ported from section 303 of the cba consequently there has been some ambi guity about whether or not section 303 applies to text made in order by special rule as was intended for example during the 105th congress the house continued to waiv the point of order against reported measures that violated s ection 303 even though the violation was corrected by the special rule making in order text as an original bill17 section 3a2 of hres 5 renews for the 108th congress separate order also agreed to at the beginning of the 106th and 107th congresses18 to clarify that the section 303 prohibition applies to the text made in order as an original bill or joint resolution for the purpose of amendment or to the text on which the previous question is ordered di rectly to passage19 prospective compensation in appropriations measures section 39 of the cba defines entitlement authority as the authority to make payments i ncluding loans and grants the budget authority for which is not provided for in advance by appropriations acts to any person or government if under the prov isions of the law containing that authority the united states is obligated to make such payments to persons or governments who meet the requirements established by that law and b the food stamp program section 401b of the cba prohibits the consideration of measure that provides new entitlement authority that is to become effective in the current fiscal year20 in addition if committee reports such measure and the amount of such spending exceeds the committees spending allo cation also referred to as its section 302a allocation associated with the mo st recently adopted budget resolution the measure may be referred to the house appropriations committee for period not tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31728crs9 21 in the senate section 401b requires such measure to be referred to the senate appropriations committee instead of simply providing the authority to do so as in the house 22 see the notes in house rules and manual for the 107th congress 106th cong 2nd sess hdoc 106320 washingt on gpo 2001 pp 988991 23 ibid p 991 also see congressional record vol 138 mar 26 1992 pp 72027203 24 the house also agreed to this separate order at the beginning of the 106th and 107th congresses the separate order agreed to in the 106th congress expired upon the adoption of the fy2000 budget resolution whereas the orde r agreed to at the beginning of the 107th congress applied to the entire congress 25 the house adopted its version of th fy2003 budget resoluti on hconres 353 on march 20 2002 the senate budget committee reported its version sconres 100 srept 107141 on mar 22 however the nate did not consider the senate budget committeereported budget resolution on the floorexceed 15 days21 if the appropriations committee does not act within the 15 days the measure is discharged automatically and placed on the appropriate calendar within the 15day period however th appropriations committee may report the measure with an amendment that limits the amount of spending several house precedents have estab lished the meaning of new entitlement authority as defined by the congressional budget act22 among them in 1992 the chair ruled that an amendment creating new executive position at specified level of compensation subject to appropriation was not new entitlement authority because payment would occur absent an appropriation23 section 3a3 of hres 5 effectively makes this ruling standing order for the 108th congress24 specifically the separate orde r clarifies that provision in measure that establishes prospectively fo r federal office or position specified or minimum level of compensati on to be funded by annual discretionary appropriations shall not be considered as providing new entitlement authority within the meaning of the congressional budget act of 1974 therefore during the 108th congress such provision presumably would not be subject to point of order under section 401b of the cba and also would not be s ubject to the 15day referral to the house appropriations committee enforcement of the housepassed fy2003 b udget resolution in 2002 congress did not agree to budget
