45 cfr 160202anger as the april 14 2003 compliance date nears20 reportedly the privacy rule has touched off quiet revolution in the health care industry21 according to ncvhs the ocr is widely viewed as not providing adequate guidance and technical assistance as evidenced by the lack of model notices of privacy practices acknowledgments authorizations and other forms the general guidance was judged to be of limited value because of special industry or professi onal circumstances and ncvhs reported that witnesses conveyed great sens of frustration that they c ould not obtain clarification from ocr or answers to the questions they submitted covered entities report the undertaking of substantial compliance meas ures ranging from the adoption of new policies the training of employees nd the development of privacy notices another area of widespread concern at the ncvhs hearings was hipaa preemption according to ncvhs witnesse s said that issues of preemption made compliance much more difficult costly and complicated the term preemption is judicial doctrine that originated through in terpretation of the supremacy clause of the united states constitution22 in effect the supremacy cl ause stands for the proposition that the constitution and the laws of the fede ral government rise bove the laws of the states as result federal law will always override state law in cases of conflict absent direct conflict however preemption depends on the intent of congress such intent may be express or implied express preemption exists when congress explicitly commands that state law be displaced where congress has not expressly preempted state and local laws two types of implie d federal preemption may be found field preemption in which federal re gulation is so pervasive that one can reasonably infer that states or localities have role to play and conflict preemption in which compliance with both federal and state regulations is physical impossibility or where the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishm ent and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress23 hipaa sets forth general rule based on the principles of conflict preemption basically this rule establishes that any federal regulation resulting from implementation of the act preempts any contrary state law24 contrary is defined as situations where 1 covered entity would find it impossible to comply with both the state and the federal requirements or 2 when the state law sta nds as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress25 congress established three exceptions to this general rule first there is an exception for state laws that the secretaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21505crs6 26 42 usc 1320d7a2ai 27 42 usc

second exception provides that state laws will not be superseded if the secretary determines that the law addresses controlled substances27 b t h f t h s exceptions require an affirmative exception determination from the secretary of hhs for the state law not to be preempted28 the third exception provides that state laws will not be preempted if they relate to the privacy of individually identifiable health information and are more stringen t than the federal requirements29 state law is more stringent if it meets one or more of the following criteria 1 the state law prohibits or further limits the use or disclosure of protected health information except if the disclosure is required by hhs to determine covered entitys compliance or is to the individual who is the subject of the individually identifiable information 2 the state law permits individuals with greater rights of access to or amendment of their individually identifiable health information provided however hipaa will not preempt state law to the extent that it authorizes or prohibits disclosure of protected health information about minor to parent guardian or person acting in loco parentis of such minor 3 the state law provides for more information to be disseminated to the individual regarding use and disclosure of their protected health informa tion and rights and remedies 4 the state law narrows the scope or durati on of authorization or consent increases the privacy protections surrounding authoriza tion and consent or reduces the coercive effect of the surrounding circumstances 5 th state law imposes stricter standards for record keeping or accounting of disclosures 6 the stat law strengthens privacy protections for individuals with respect to any other matter30 in addition to the general rule and ex ceptions congress carved out two provisions whereby certain areas of state authority will not be limited or invalidated by hipaa rules first the public health carve out saves an law providing for the reporting of disease or injury child abuse birth or death for th conduct of public surve illance investigation or intervention31 the second carve out allows stat to regulate health plans by requiring the plans to report or provide acce ss to information for the purpose of audits program monitoring and evaluation or the licensure or certification32 legislation s 16 the equal rights and equal dignity for americans act of 2003 would in section 903 reverse the august 2002 modifications to the privacy rule
