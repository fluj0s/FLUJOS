performance system implemented in large federal department the system known as the national security personnel system nsps was initially intended to cover all dod employees but has since been m odified to cover most dod employees the system has faced legal challenges from unions and employees who claim it is inconsistently applied and causes undeserved pay inequities nsps continues to face difficulties including the elimination of plans to place 145000 bluecollar workers in the system nsps however will be used as an example of both opportunities and challenges that agencies face when they create pay systems that more closely link employee performance to pay like other performancebased pay systems nsps makes job performance preeminent factor in determining employee pay under the nsps structure employee performance is more directly linke d to pay than in the general schedule the pay scale that covers most civilian federal employees supervisor and an employee who use nsps are to work together to create an annual appraisal plan that can accurately reflects an employees perfo rmance supervisor then uses the appraisal later to evaluate an employee at the end of each appraisal year an employee is assigned pay shares based on performance that represent percentage increases in pay lowerperforming employees may receive fewer pay shares or pay shares an employee must acquire at least satisfactory performance rating to be eligible for any performancebased bonuses in fall 2008 dod plans to place an additional 20000 civilian employees in nsps bringing the system to total

stated that the gs personnel system failed to allow the department to keep pace with the george w bush administrations dema nds to transform the way we think the way we train the way we exercise and the way we fight27 at best the current personnel system is based on 20th century assumptions about the nature of public service and cannot adequately address the 21st century national security environment although the current federal personnel management system is based on important core principles those principles are operationalized in an inflexible onesize fitsall system of defining work hiring staff managing people assessing and rewarding performance and advancing personnel these inherent weaknesses make support of dods mission complex costly and ultimately risky currently pay and the movement of personnel are pegged to outdated narrowly defined work definitions hiring processes are cumbersome high performers and low performers are paid alike and the labor system encourages disputeorient ed adversarial relationship between management and labor these systemic inefficiencies detract from the potential effectiveness of the total force more flexible missiondriven system of human resources management that retains those core principles will provide more cohesive total force the immense challenges facing dod today require civilian workforce transformation civilians are being asked to assume new and different responsibilities take more risk and be more innovative agile and accountable than ever before it is critical that dod supports the entire civilian workforce with modern systems particularly human resources management system and labor relations system that support nd protect their critical role in dods total force effectiveness the enabling legislation

these pay increases were distributed as onetime bonuses moreover when the local market supplement is not included as performanceba sed increase 5039 employees who were rated as valued performers level

program executive officer mary lacy responded by saying the pay system does not cost more to run because some employees get pay increases while others receive large ones100 in other media reports unions criticized nsps for its lack of transparency greg junemann president of the inte rnational federation of professional and tec hnical engineers told government executive that defense is intentionally misleading employees by simply releasing pay raise number without releasing the data that supports their number congress should ask the dod to release any and all data relating to their 76 payout101 the government accountability office released report on nsps in september 2008 stating that dod had taken some step s to implement inte rnal safeguards to ensure that nsps is fair effective and credible but added some safeguards could be improved102 specifically gao cited nine saf eguards currently in place that aim to improve nsps operation including linking employee objectives and the agencys strategic goals and mission nd requiring ongoing performance feedback between supervisors and employees103 gao added that dod could improve the implementation of some of the safeguards by having an uninvested thirdparty analysis performed on nspss pay determin ations as well as requiring publication of departmentwide rating results to increase the systems transparency additionally the report recommended dod give pay pool administrators and supervisors more guidance on rating em ployees appropriately and charged dod with creating plan to combat the increasingly negative perception employees have of nsps104 bradley bunn responded to gaos reco mmendations on beha lf of dod saying the department does not concur with all the finding and recommendations in the report but as we have implemented nsps we have heard many of the same concerns as your auditors and have attempted to differentiate between those that warrant prompt action and t hose that reflect the uncertainty and skepticism thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34673crs23 105 ibid p 69 106 ibid p 72 107 ibidtypically accompany major changes105 further dod disagreed with gaos recommendation to require thir dparty analysis of pay pool decisions saying that nsps was fair equitable and based on employee performance and had clear grievance procedures in place for an employee who disagreed with his or her rating dod also disagreed with gaos assertion that some rating scores may not have made meaningful distinctions among employees performances106 gao agreed that it should publish its agencywide rating results and said it would take steps to accomplish that goal107 concluding observations members of congress created nsps nd granted dod pay flexibilities to run the performancebased system and they may therefore choose to maintain close oversight of its implementation through the continuation of committee hearings members may remain in terested in ensuring that dod maintains transparent and fair pay system that is trusted by ad ministrators supervisors and employees members may also choose to continue to ensure that nsps maintains transparency and appropriately tr ains both managers and employ ees who are covered by the system unions have historically not favored payforperformance systems and nsps is exception congress has forced dod to collectively bargain with its employees and brought nsps under gove rnmentwide laborrelations rules members of congress may continue to use nsps as model evidencing both good and bad experiences for other agenci that may transition to performance based pay system nsps has faced and solved many challenges in its attempt to attract and retain highquality workforce overall nsps may serve to demonstrate whether performancebased pay systems can work in certain large federal agencies
