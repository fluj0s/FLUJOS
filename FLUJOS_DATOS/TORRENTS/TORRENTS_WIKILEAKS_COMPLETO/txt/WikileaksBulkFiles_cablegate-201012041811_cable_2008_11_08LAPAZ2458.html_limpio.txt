visit evo lashes out ref paz 2370 classified by ecopol chief mike hammer for reasons 14 bd 1 sbu summary in the days before his november 16 departure for the united states where he will speak at the oas and and meet with us representatives dodd lugar baukus and possibly others president evo morales and his closest cabinet advisors lashed out at wide selection of usg targets claiming that the usg has strategy of supporting united opposition front against evo for the december 2009 elections following the november 1 expulsion of dea government minister alfredo rada described the dea as insignificant and said the world will not end with the end of the presence of the dea evo announced that he is after the cia last week and in november 14 interview the state news agency abi cited presidency minister quintana as saying that the civic prefectural conspiracy was fed by the empire the united states financed by organizations that originate in usaid the cia and the dea speaking from venezuela quintana added milgroup to the mix saying that state security fired on civilians in 2003 during the riots that led to the fall of expresident gonzalo goni sanchez lozada because state security institution is not taught indoctrinated and intervened by the dea the cia and by milgroup end summary evo accuses usg of trying to unite the opposition 2 sbu at november 15 rally in cochabamba morales accused the usg of trying to help form an opposition front to oppose his next presidential run i am almost sure sisters and brothers that the next elections december 2009 if the draft constitution passes in january all the right will unite on instructions from the government of the united states at the same time evo reiterated his allegations that usaid finances the opposition 3 sbu meanwhile analysts are weighing in on the issue of combined front against evo whether comprised solely of the moderate left that is the left without evos movement toward socialism party or united with less conservative elements of what is now the conservative opposition party podemos former president carlos mesa an oftmentioned contender for leader of the elusive nonevo front opined recently that single front combining left and right is not viable in the sense that there are very distinct ideological positions between which eventually there would be opposition but this doesnt eliminate the possibility of front 4 c comment evos preemptive strike against potential opposition frontaligning them without evidence with the empireappears to be an effort to set the stage for discrediting anyone who runs against him as us stooge as of now the opposition is far from united with as many as seven potential presidential candidates former president carlos mesa former prefect manfred reyes villa tarija prefect mario cossio potosi mayor rene joaquino unidad nacional party leader samuel doria medina former president tuto quiroga and even indigenous guerrilla felipe quispe it is hard to envision how this disparate group would come together in fact many of the strategists for potential candidates complain to us that other groups and leaders will not step aside for the good of the opposition as whole end comment continued accusations against usg agencies 5 sbu according to press reports minister of presidency juan ramon quintana met in venezuela on november 14 to propose multilateral strategic alliance of governments and academics to defend the process of revolutionary change quintana reminded his audience of bolivias recent torturous civic prefectural conspiracy which he claimed had been fed by the empire the united states financed by organizations that originate in usaid the cia and the dea back in bolivia minister of government alfredo rada was also leveling accusations at usg agencies claiming that the bolivian government must deeply review the actions of agencies such as usaid and dea it is process that demands moreglobal evaluation to take the decision to normalize this relation and that means new rules of pay transparency in relations and respect for sovereignty rada said that dea was welcome to share information in the counternarcotics fight but the dea is mistaken if it thinks it can continue in the country or will return to the country to continue diverting resources of the fight against drugs to work of political destabilization or political investigationthat cant continue 6 sbu rada announced on november 16 that the bolivian national police who worked with dea will be reviewed and those that might have worked on the margin of the interests of the country will be fired rada warned that if the police acted as foreign embassy in their own institution there will be separation of these people he added if there are police who worked correctly with good results you can be secure thatthey will be able to continue their work 7 sbu from venezuela presidency minister quintana added new accusations against us agencies claiming that us agencies were behind the 2003 decision of the government of thenpresident gonzalo goni sanchez lozada to fire on civilians they consummated the most repugnant genocide in bolivia which was the genocide of the year 2003 when sanchez lozada was expelled from the country in the face of lack of moderation in the face of the doubts of the high military command to massacre the comrades alto the military group milgroup occupied the highest levels of the armed forces and took the decision that the armed forces had to massacre the people of alto to liberate caravan that had to supply the city of paz with fuel therefore this is not indirect intervention this is not interference it is direct participation in the genocide of the year 2003 note over 60 people were killed in clashes between followers of evo moraleswho had blockaded the capital city of pazand government forces the morales government has repeatedly accused sanchez lozada of genocide and recently began processing papers to request the former presidents extradition end note 8 sbu following president morales november 11 statement that he and the government are after the cia too vice minister of social movements sacha llorenti announced on november 17 that the presence of cia agents is prohibited in bolivia there exists norm that would allow the presence of those agents in the national territory and to verify their presence in the country would be grave action against our sovereignty according to llorenti the government is investigating the possible presence of external agents or of bolivians who serve external agentsthe government is decided and in this there will be step backwards on the dignification of our country and of its institutions comment 8 c morales is already campaigning hard for both the constitution and his reelection as can be seen by his standard attacks on the usg his rhetorical attacks have now led to the expulsion of both the ambassador and the dea and cannot be ignored as mere campaign stumping usaid could be next as there have been repeated highlevel attacks and socialmovement calls for its expulsion morales new focus on bolivian coconspirators either police working with the dea or any political enemy evo decides to describe as cia collaborator will almost certainly instill fear among our contacts who may become more cautious about meeting with us his threat to expel the cia from bolivia means that any one of us can be misidentified as spy and kicked out should we door be falsely accused of doinganything that displeases evo end comment urs
