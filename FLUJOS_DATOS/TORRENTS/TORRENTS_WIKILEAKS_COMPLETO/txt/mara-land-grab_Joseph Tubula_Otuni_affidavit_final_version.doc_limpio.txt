made known to by olkiombo ltd dated 25th june 2001 addressed to the permanent secretary ministry of lands and settlement and setting out the details of the dispute i mark it jto 6 that i believe your committee has access to the high court file and will be able to notice what has come as shock to many of us residents of narok by way of consent orders recorded purportedly before deputy registrar of the high court mr muiruri on 16th november 2005 that we were also surprised that the attorney general could purport to withdraw from the case after their very detailed letter of 29th may 2002 copy of which i produce and mark jto 7 that i am aware that all along the honourable attorney general had filed defence and counterclaim he had disowned the actions of the officers in the narok land registry but he has now unilaterally withdrawn his defence without notice to the other parties i believe he was obliged in law to notify the other parties in the case that i know of my own knowledge that that pressure was brought to bear on the government by the narok south member of parliament hon stephen kanyinke ole ntutu and who is brother of mr livingstone kunini ole ntutu whom the commissioner of lands described as having been fraudulently registered that i have seen press release issued on 30th september 2005 according to which hon ole ntutu visited state house on 29th september 2005 where he pledged to support the then ongoing referendum for the new constitution if the hon the attorney general mr wako who incidentally according to the copy of the press release was also present at state house on behalf of the government withdrew his defence in this case and dropped the prosecution of livingstone kunini ole ntutu in nairobi chief magistrate court criminal case 2157 of 2003 i produce copy of the press release and mark it jto 8 that according to copy of letter dated 3rd february 2006 written by the shareholders of olkiombo limited to the attorney general mr wako mr keriako tobiko unlawfully aborted the prosecution of livingstone kunini ole ntutu by the premature closure of the prosecution case without calling seven crucial witnesses i produce copy of the letter and mark it jto 9 that judgment of the chief magistrate court in the said criminal case confirms these complains raised in the said letter i produce copy of the judgment and mark it jto 10 that according to the said letter mr keriako tobiko was the advocate for company called ilngina contractors limited and according to letter c79472 dated 23rd december 2005 from the registrar of companies ilngina contractors limited is owned by kunini ntutu also known as livingstone ntutu his wife agnes narropil ntutu and his mother kiteleiki ntutu copy of the registrars letter is annexed to the letter of 3rd february 2006 aforesaid that according to the letter of 3rd february 2006 mr keriako tobiko while he was in private practice acted for livingstone ntutu in transaction involving piece of land narokcis maraololulunga9678 being sub divisional portion of piece of land narokcis maraololulunga9470 registered in the name of mr kunini ole ntutu before its transfer to his company ilngina contractors limited that the basis of such advocateclient relation is copy of letter ncclmvolxii136 dated 24th september 1999 addressed to mr keriako tobiko esq advocate by the ag clerk narok county council in response to mr keriako tobiko letter to the acting clerk dated 15th september 1999 in which the advocate made enquiries in relation to the said piece of land no9678 the ag clerk said letter is attached to the letter of 3rd february 2006 aforesaid that the clerk to council in his letter ncccrc21570304 dated 1st september 2006 to its advocate said v we cannot fail to highlight possible interference by certain high powered and wellconnected persons who may have manipulated the due process of law to defeat justice in the criminal matter and the civil cases up to the point of making the ag office withdraw its defence and statement of claim and hence facilitating decree in hccc 1565 of 2000 purported to have been given when there were stay orders in hc misc case 1271 of 2002 i produce copy of this letter and mark it jto 11 that letter nccmnrconfvolx26 dated 7th may 2004 from the senior warden to the clerk to council laments the disregard of laws by the central government authorities so far as this grabbing is concerned in that mr kunini ole ntutu forcibly entered the national reserve with arms which is an offence under the wildlife conservation and management act and nothing happened to him i produce copy of this letter and mark it jto 12 that we are even more shocked to learn that resource for people of narok district could go to the hands of one individual under the hand of mr muiruri when it was clear as we are informed that there was proper change of advocates in the matter and i understand that mr stephen kairu advocate has filed an affidavit showing that as the advocate for the party to whom the county council had leased the land he was not aware of what was going on with regard to the fraudulent consent order that i am aware that this matter has been reported to the national anti corruption campaign steering committee which has reported to his excellency the president that the purported alienation of the grabbed land by one livingstone kunini ntutu is in fact according to them corrupt deal i produce an extract of this report and mark it jto 13 that my complaint and wonder is how our judiciary can allow itself to be abused to further corruption of this magnitude and scope that i would urge the committee to recommend appropriate disciplinary action to be taken against the officers involved in this matter regardless of their rank or standing so that the people of narok can regain their confidence not only in the judiciary but in the entire government and its leadership that i am also aware that this matter is involved in the complaint concerning the honourable mr justice moijo ole keiwua i am aware that the matter is before the honourable the court of appeal that i am motivated by the interests of my electors and the people of narok and the pursuit of justice through your committee that i make this affidavit believing all that is stated herein to be true to the best of my information knowledge and belief and as advised by counsel whom i have consulted sworn at nairobi by the said joseph tubula otuni on 2007 before commissioner for oaths drawn by joseph tubula ole ketuyio p box 425 narok
