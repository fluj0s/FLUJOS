review banks v dretke1 was death penalty case in which despite brady v maryland 2 which requires the state to turn over material exculpatory or impeachment evidence the state withheld evidence that would have llowed banks to discredit two key prosecution witnesses3 in the course of litigating his federal habeas petition banks uncovered the evidence to support his brady claim the district court granted writ of habeas corpus with respect to banks death sentence but did not overturn the conviction deciding that banks had not sufficiently pressed his brady claim earlier4 the court of appeals vacated the writ5 in an opinion written by justice ginsburg the supreme court reversed the decision turned on the application of the courts since replaced cause and prejudice standard that governed when state prisoners federal habeas claim might be heard notwithstanding his failure to afford state courts the opportunity to cure the asserted defect three factors account for cause on banks behalf 1 the stat knew of but kept back information that undermined the creditability of two of its witnesses 2 before trial the state asserted that it would disclose all brady ma terial and 3 in the state post conviction proceedings the state continued to deny the substance of banks suggestions of brady violations6 after finding cause justice ginsburg addressed the prejudice issue the issue here was whether the suppressed evidence could reasonabl be taken so as to place the case in such different light as to undermine the confiden ce in the verdict the court answered this question in the affirmative7 although justices thomas and scalia dissented here in the belief that full disclosure woul d not have changed the result8 the lower courts had rejected the brady claim in part because banks had failed to properly amend his habeas petition pleadings to include the claim once he uncovered evidence to substantiate it9 banks contention was that the claim mentioned in

in the pleadings under civil procedure rule 15b in an evidentiary h earing as rule 15b instructs10 the court agreed nelson v campbell11 involved death row inmate who had filed claim under 42 usc 1983 of the civil rights statute stating that his damaged veins would make it impossible to insert an intravenous line for the lethal injection without cutting deep into his flesh and muscle nelson said that this procedure which is called cutdown was violation of his rights under the eighth amendment the writ of certiorari was limited to the issue of whether complaint broug ht under 42 usc 1983 by deathsentenced state prisoner who seeks to stay his execution in order to pursue challenge to the constitutionality of the cutdown procedure for carrying out the execution is proper recharacterization of habeas corpus petition under 28 usc 2254 the court ruled that nelson could pursue his claim that the lethal injection procedures in his case constituted cruel nd unusual punishment and that 42 usc 1983 is an appropriate vehicle for his eighth amendment claim seeking temporary stay and permanent injunctive relief the court so ruled that challenge to the method of execution under 42 usc 1983 is not equivalent to habeas corpus petition provided the challenger is not contesting his imprisonment writing for unanimous court justice oconnor agreed that nelsons claim was separate from any challenge to the methodof execution or conviction the court also said that it need not reach the difficult question of how methodofexecution claims should be classified generally12 beard v banks13was death penalty case in which the petitioner was sentenced to death on 12 counts of firstdegree murder after the pennsylvania supreme court upheld the conviction the united states supr eme court announced its decision in mills v maryland 14 which overturned death sentence wh jury understood the sentencing instructions to preclude consideration of mitigating factors not unanimously f ound to exist under the courts teague v lane standard rule15 mills could only be retroactively applied to banks case after the completion of his direct appeals if mills was not new rule of constitutional construction or if mills were watershed decision the third circuit held that mills did not announce new principle of law for retroactivity purposes and therefore its application of mills to its review of banks sentence was proper in 54 decision written by justice thomas the court decided that the rule announced in mills that sentencing sc hemes could not prevent jurors from considering mitigating

schriro case the rule for determining when constitutional criminal rulings that impose new rule are retroactive appears to be as follows if convicted person still has direct appeal available decision applies retroactively but if direct appeals are exhausted and convicted defe ndant only has incidental relief available the rule may not applysupreme court decisions16 as new rule it could only be applied retro actively if under the second exception it was watershed ru of criminal procedure implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding17 deciding that it was not watershed rule the court held that it could not be applie d retroactively and reversing the court of appeals banks conviction was ther efore constitutional justice stevens writing for the dissenting justices finding nothing novel about the mills rule stated the kind of arbitrariness that would enable 1 vote in favor of death to outweigh 11 in favor of forbearance would violate the bedrock fairness principles that have governed our trial proceedings for centuries rejecting such manifestly unfair procedural innovation does not announce n ew rulebut simply affirms that our fairness principles do not permit blatant exceptions18 in schriro v summerlin 19 the defendant summerlin was convicted and sentenced to death under an arizona law which authorized the trial judge rather than the jury to determine the presence of aggravating circumstances which would cause the defendant to become eligible for the death sentence after unavailingly exhausting his direct appeal to the arizona state supr eme court and while his habeas case was pending in the ninth circuit court of appeals the us supreme court decided in ring v arizona20 that the arizona sentencing law was unc onstitutional because jury must decide the existence of the aggravating circumstances the ninth circuit applied the ring decision retroactively on the basis that ring was substantive decision or in the alternative if it was procedural it was watershed decision the us supreme cour t reversed deciding first ring was procedural not substantive nd second as procedural it was not watershed decision21 commenting upon the differences between death row inmates granted new sentencing hearings and death row inmates denied new sentencing hearings because they are in later stage of appeals justice breyer stated certainly the ordinary citizen will not understand the difference that citize n will simply witness two individuals both sentenced through the use of unconstitutiona l procedures one individual going to his death the other saved all th rough an accident of timing22 how can the court square this spectacle with what it has called the vital importance to the defendant and to

in tennard v dretke24 the court reversed the fifth circuits decision that denied habeas relief to prisoner on death row in xas in 1986 the petitioner tennard was convicted of capital murder in texas duri ng the penalty phase of his trial tennards parole officer testified regard ing his low iq and his defense counsel argued that the low iq mitigated his culpability presented with the only two special issues used in the texas capital sentencing scheme at the time whether the pe titioners conduct was committed deliberately and whether the petitioner posed threat of future dangerousness the jury answered both issues in the affirmative the fifth circuit denied tennard certificate of appealability it held that tennard had not met the fifth ci rcuits twopart post penry test regarding whether his evidence was constitutionally relevant the court explained that tennard had failed to present evidence of uniquely severe permanen t handicap with which the defendant was burdened through fault of his own because low iq standing alone is not uniquely severe condition in any event the court emphasized nnard had not shown that the criminal act was attribut able to this permanent condition in an opinion by justice oconnor and joined by justices stevens kennedy souter ginsburg and breyer the court reversed the fifth circuit certificate of appealability should issue if the applicant demonstrates th at reasonable jurists would find the district courts assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong and this analysis must take into account the defere ntial standard of review applicable to federal habeas petitions 28 usc 2254d125 the court noted that the c onstitutional releva nce test has foundation in the decisions of this suprem court and that it could not countenance the suggestion that low iq evidence is not relevant mitigating evidence unless the defendant also establishe s nexus to the crime26 the fifth circuit should have granted the certificate of appealability reasonable jurists could conclude that the low iq evidence was relevant mitigating evidence and that the state courts unreasonably concluded otherwise in this case27 chief justice rehnquist justices scalia nd thomas each wrote separate dissenting opinions contending basically that the district court conducted the proper inquiry regarding whether the low iq evidence was
