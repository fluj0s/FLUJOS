enrollment process and its enrollment priority groups unlike medicar or medicaid va health care is not an entitlement program contrary to numerous claims made concerning promises to military personnel and vete rans with regard to free h ealth care for life not every veteran is automatically entitled to medical care from the va18 prior to eligibility reform in 1996 provisions of law govern ing eligibility for va care were complex and not uniform across all levels of care all veterans were technically eligible for hospital care and nursing home care but ligibility did not by itself ensure access to care the veterans health care eligib ility reform act of 1996 pl 104262 established two eligibility categories and required the vha to manage the provision of hospital care and medical services through an enrollment system based on system of priorities19 pl 104262 authorized the va to provide all needed hospital care and medical services to veterans with serviceconnected disabilities former prisoners of war veterans exposed to to xic substances and environmental hazards such as agent orange veterans whose at tributable income and net worth are not greater than an established means test and veterans of world war i these veterans are generally known as highe r priority or core veterans see appendix discussed in mo re detail below20 the other category of veterans are those with serviceconnected disabilitie s and with attributable in comes above an established means test see appendix c pl 104262 also authorized the va to tablish patient enrollment system to

of annual patient enrollment and require that veterans be enrolled in manner giving relative degrees of preference in accordance with specified priorities at th same time it would ve st discretion in the secretary to determine the manner in which such enrollment system would operate21 furthermore pl 104262 was clear in its intent that the provision of health care to veterans was depe ndent upon

stated previously pl 104262 re quired the establishment of national enrollment system to manage the delivery of inpatient and outpatient medical care the new eligibility standard was created by congress to ensure that medical judgment rather than legal criteria will determine when care will be provided and the level at which care will be furnished23 for most veterans entry into the ve terans health care system begins by completing the application for enrollment some veterans are exempt from the enrollment requirement if they meet special eligibility requirements24 veteran may apply for enrollment by completing the application for health benefits va form 1010ez at any time during the year and submitting the form online or in person at any va medical center or clinic or mailing or

with updated financial information demonstrating inability to defray the expenses of necessary care26 veterans status eligibility for va health care is based primarily on veterans status resulting from military service veterans status is established by activeduty status in the military naval or air service and an honorable discharge or release from active military service generally persons enlisting in one of the armed forces after september 7 1980 and fficers commissioned after october 16 1981 must have completed two years of active duty or the full period of their initial service

conditions national guard members are not granted serviceconnection fo r any injury heart attack or stroke that occurs while performing duty ordered by governor for state emergencies or activities27 after veterans status has been established the va next places applicants into one of two categories the first group is composed of veterans with service connected disabilities or with incomes below an established means test these veterans are regarded by the va as high priority veterans and they are enrolled in priority groups 16 see appendix veterans enrolled in priority groups 16 include veterans
