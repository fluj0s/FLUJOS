reference on nuclear biological and chemical nbc protection and individual collective and force protection against nbc hazards individual protection refers to specific actions taken by soldiers to protect themselves against nbc hazards it includes protection provided to the individual in an nbc environment by protective clothing andor personal equipment collective protection provides relief from individual protective clothing to group of soldiers force protection includes actions taken by commands to reduce their force vulnerability to nbc hazards this manual is for use by personnel in sc 74a and mos 54b nbc defense officers and ncos and unit leaders down to squad level sc 74a and mos 54b personnel should read chapters 2 through 5 using chapters 1 and 6 primarily as reference nbc defense officers and ncos should first read chapters 5 and 6 to develop familiarity with nbc defense equipment before starting with chapters 2 through 5 it is missionessential for these personnel to be knowledgeable on all the items presented in chapter 1 secondary audience for this manual is unit leaders down to section level these personnel should become familiar with the concepts in chapters 1 and 2 and 4 through 6 this manual is divided into six chapters chapter 1 individual protective equipment this chapter addresses individual nbc protective equipment and equipmentspecific doctrine chapter 2 mopp analysis at battalion level and below commanders and staffs must still determine appropriate levels of force protection at this level however simplified procedure is required we call this simplified procedure mopp analysis mopp analysis is process conducted by small unit leaders battalion level and below that determine the level of protection to be used by their soldiers other decisions regarding subjects such as alarm placement and automatic masking criteria will be required to conduct this analysis at the small unit level this mopp analysis constitutes that units chemical vulnerability assessment chapter 3 chemical vulnerability assessment and force protection commands determine appropriate levels of force protection by integrating nbc considerations into their decisionmaking process thisprocess begins with an estimate of the likely be faced by the force this estimate vulnerability assessmenthazards to is called chapter 4 nuclear protection this chapter addresses actions required to protect soldiers from the effects of nuclear weapons it discusses actions to be taken before during and after the attack as well as discussion of nuclear effects in special environments chapter 5 biological protection this chapter addresses actions required to protect soldiers from the effects of biological weapons it covers actions taken before and during biological agent attack and covers biological weapons effects in special environments chapter 6 collective protection this chapter covers all equipment currently available for collective protection as well as potential field expedients it provides doctrine for collective protection planning operation of collective protection systems and entryexit procedures nbc contamination avoidance and decontamination doctrine are closely related to protection doctrine therefore an understanding of fm 33 and fm 35 is required to understand this publication this publication implements the following international agreements chapter 2 stanag 2047qstag 183 emergency alarms of hazard or attack nbc and air attack only edition 6 chapter 1 stanag 2352 nbc defense equipment operational guidelines edition 3 and qstag 465 guidelines for commanders in coping with operational problems associated with miosis this manual incorporates findings from the combined arms in nuclearchemical environment

changes to publications and blank forms directly to commandant us army chemical school attn atzncmnf fort mcclellan 362055020 iic2 fm 34fmfm 119 introductio n nbc weapons are among the most hazardous on the battlefield the doctrine of many potential enemies calls for their wartime employment of nbc weapons in order to deter an enemy from exercising this option us forces must be continuously prepared to fight and win under nbc conditions to fight and win under nbc conditions requires an application of the three fundamentals of nbc defensecontamination avoidance protection and decontamination at all levels of command coupled with an effective retaliatory response avoidance the first fundamental of nbc defense is avoidance avoidance addresses individual andor unit measures taken to avoid or minimize nbc attacks and reduce the effects of nbc hazards by taking measures to avoid the effects of nbc attacks units can reduce their protective postures and decrease the likelihood and extent of decontamination required fm 3100 provides general discussion of avoidance measures see fm 33 for detailed discussion protectio n the second fundamental of nbc defense is nbc protection protection is one of the four dynamics of combat power and consists of two primary components actions to counter the enemies firepower and actions to maintain the health and morale of soldiers nbc protection encompasses both of these components its goal is the conservation of the fighting potential of the force so that it can be applied at the decisive time and place we divide nbc protection into three broad areasforce collective and individual protection force protection force protection involves actions taken by commander to reduce the vulnerability of his force to an nbc attack at the lower levels of command battalion and below this will require that the unit conduct procedure called mopp analysis the final result of this analysis will be determination of protective equipment to be worn by unit soldiers however several other decisions concerning alarm placement and automatic masking criteria will berequired as part of the analysis forces above battalion level will conduct process called vulnerability assessment and risk reduction the vulnerability assessment is an estimate of the probable impact on the force of an enemy nbc attack it occurs both prior to and after initiation of nbc warfare this assessment will be used in conjunction with mission enemy terrain troops and time available mettt information to determine acceptable means of reducing force vulnerability to enemy attack collective protection collective protection addresses the use of shelters to provide contaminationfree environment for selected portions of the force it is protection provided to group of individuals that permits relaxation of individual nbc protection individual protection individual protection involves those actions taken by individual soldiers to survive and continue the mission under nbc conditions it also addresses protection provided to an individual in an nbc environment by protective clothing andor personal equipment decontamination the third fundamental of nbc defense is decontamination it is the reduction of the contamination hazard by removal or neutralization of hazardous levels of nbc contamination on personnel and material fm 3100 provides general discussion of decontamination see fm 35 for detailed discussion retaliatio n defensive measures alone are not an effective response to enemy nbc attacks the us retains the right to retaliate in response to enemy nbc attack depending upon the situation this retaliation may take the form of nuclear conventional or political options there is requirement that the us response be strictly proportional to an enemy attack in kind us offensive biological and chemical operations are prohibited see fm 3100fmfm 112 chemical operations for general discussion of nbc retaliation iiic2 fm 341 fmfm 119 chapter 1 individual protective equipment soldiers missionoriented protection posture mopp gear protects against nbc contamination it consists of the overgarment mask hood overboots protective gloves individual decon kits detection equipment and antidotes before soldiers can protect themselves against nbc hazards they must first know what individual protective equipment is available and its capabilities protective ensemble various armies of the world use different types of chemical protective clothing for individual protection several types are available in the us army the type depends on the protection required but all fall within two major divisions permeable and impermeable permeable clothing allows air and moisture to pass through the fabric impermeable clothing does not an example of impermeable clothing is the special butyl rubber suits worn by some explosive ordnance disposal eod soldiers and decon soldiers most troops use permeable suits these are known as battledress overgarments bdos battledress overgarment bdo note the information on the bdo represents more flexible approach than was addressed in the 1985 version of this manual more recent assessments of the bdo indicated that more flexible approach was needed to optimize use of the bdos excellent nbc protection capabilitiesdescription the bdo is camouflage colored woodland or desert expendable twopiece overgarment consisting of one coat and one pair of trousers figure 11 the jacket has zipped front and the trousers have fly front and zipped legs the overgarment material consists of an outer layer of nylon cotton and an inner layer of charcoal impregnated polyurethane foam due to heavy impregnation of charcoal some charcoal may be deposited on skin and clothing under the bdo however this will not detract from the bdos chemical protective characteristics nor harm the wearer the bdo presently comes sealed in vaporbarrier bag that protects against rain moisture and sunlight the bdo is water resistant but not water proof and is normally worn as an outer garment the bdo is normally worn over the duty uniform however in high temperatures it may be worn over underwear in extreme cold weather environments the bdo should be worn between layer 2 bib overall cold weather shirt and trouser liner and layer 3 coat liner and field trousers of the extended cold weather clothing system ecwcs in extreme cold weather environments the bdo is sized to wear over articextreme cold weedier environmental clothing however mission requirements may dictate that the bdo be worn under artic clothing for example soldiers may need to wear white artic outergarment to help ensure needed cover and concealment protection capabilities the bdo provides protection against chemical agent vapors liquid droplets biological agents toxins and 10c2 fm 34fmfm 119 radioactive alpha and beta particles when the bdo is removed from its vaporbarrier bag and worn its protective qualities last for minimum of 30 days it is recommended that the bdo be replaced after 30 clays however the weartime may be extended by the commander when operationally necessary bdos worn longer than 30 days presents slightly increased risk to the wearer however the key to bdo effectiveness at anytime during wear is its serviceability the slightly increased risk that is incurred by wearing the bdo past 30 days is discussed in chapter 3 chemical overgarment risk assessment weartime for the bdo begins when it is removed from its sealed vaporbarrier bag and stops when the bdo is sealed back in its vaporbarrier bag if the original vaporbarrier bag is not available return the bdo to similar material bag and seal with common duct tape donning of the bdo regardless of the time equates to day of wear extending the weartime for the bdo affords additional flexibility operational and logistical support planning the bdo provides minimum of 24 hours of protection against exposure to liquid or vapor chemical agent exchange the bdo within 24 hours of exposure to liquid chemical agent the bdo is not designed to be decontaminated or reimpregnated for reuse serviceability the bdo becomes unserviceable if it is ripped torn fastener broken or missing or petroleum oils or lubricants are spilled or splashed on the garment for example if pol spill on bdo sleeve or trouser leg soaks through

on 12c2 fm 34fmfm 119 the legs to secure them around the ankles the footwear covers consist of polyethylene soles and latex bands in the upper portion to secure them to the legs the scalp jackettrousers are issued separately from the scalp footwear covers since the sizing systems are independent of one another the scalp being disposable lightweight impermeable suit is worn over the bdo cpog or cpuduty uniform to provide additional protection from gross liquid contamination for periods up to one hour the primary users are armor and eod personnel and personnel in collective protection who may by necessity be forced to leave that collective protection to perform some vital maintenance or reconnaissance function in such situations the scalp will also reduce reentry time secondary use of the scalp is to protect decontamination personnel from being soaked during decontamination operations commanders must be aware that wearing the scalp over the bdo will place additional burden on thesoldier increasing heat stress problems already associated with wearing the bdo the scalp weighs approximately 15 pounds integrated battlefield aircrew uniform the aircrew uniform integrated battlefield auib is standard combat uniform for aircrews designed to replace both the cpog bdo and nomex flight suit the auib provides nbc protection and protection against flames it is twopiece chemical protective uniform with protective curtain and standup collar the collar closes with hookandpile tape the suit has slide fastener front closure with protective flap and gusseted fastener leg closure for quick and easy donning and doffing the wrists and ankles have hookandpile adjustments to ensure tighter fit chest pockets are side openings for easy access when the safety harness is in use side thigh and calf pockets have bellows on one side for easy access insulated pockets for atropine injectors are provided on the upper sleeve all pockets are lined with butyl rubber toxicological agent protective apron the toxicological agent protective tap apron is intended for personnel whose duties may bring them into contact with liquid chemical agents for example those who work with toxic munitions perform decontamination in field environment handle contaminated clothing and equipment at decontamination site and handle and treat chemical agent casualties on the battlefield the tap apron provides chemical decontamination units added protection when conducting extended decontamination operations see fm 35 for further information on the use of the tap apron during decontamination operations chemical protective glove set description glove set figure 11 consists of an outer glove for protection and an inner glove for perspiration absorption the outer gloves are made of an impermeable black butyl rubber the inner gloves are made of thin white cotton these inner gloves can be worn on either hand if either outer glove is punctured or torn replace the pair of gloves when engaged in heavy work or during cold weather soldiers should wear standard work gloves or black shells over the butyl rubber gloves to protect them from damage the gloves comes in three thickness 7 14 and 25 mil the 7 mil glove set is used by soldiers such as medical teletypist and electronic repair personnel whose tasks require extreme tactility andor sensitivity and will not expose the gloves to harsh treatment the 14 mil glove set is used by soldiers such as aviators vehicle mechanics and 13c2 fm 341 fmfm 119 weapon crews whose task require tactility and sensitivity and will not expose the gloves to harsh treatment use of more durable 25 mil glove set is for soldiers who perform close combat tasks and other types of heavy labor protection capabilities the glove protects against liquid chemical agents and vapor hazards as long as they remain serviceable if the 14 and 25 mil glove set becomes contaminated with liquid chemical agent decontaminate or replace them within 24 hours after exposure if the 7 mil glove set becomes contaminated replace or decontaminate within 6 hours after exposure the contaminated gloves may be decontaminated with 5 bleach and water solution or 5 hth and water solution and reused indefinitely as long as they remain serviceable the gloves also keep biting insect vectors and radioactive fallout away from the hands see fm 35 for procedures on decontamination of gloves during the deliberate decontamination process serviceability exposure of the rubber to ds2 breakfree antiseize compound or any other petroleumbased products attacks the gloves rubber polymers and makes them very sticky avoid contact with these material if possible however replace the glove if the rubber is sticky use bleach and water to remove these compounds from the rubber gloves as soon as possible see below for means to determine glove serviceability serviceability test to determine if glove set is damaged or serviceable either fill the gloves with air and submerge in water or fill the glove with water and look for water leaks the preferred method for determining serviceability is to fill the glove with air and submerge it in water prior to submerging the glove in water hold the base of the glove with both hands using thumb and index fingers with the glove fingers hanging downward rotate the glove several times ensuring an air pocket is formed below the palm holding the inflated glove in one hand squeeze the glove and examine for escaping air and then submerge if bubbles escape the glove is unserviceable greenblack vinyl overboot gvobvo

temperatures ranging from 50f to 120f detection equipment on the battlefield soldiers need to help measure radiation and detect chemical agents they may use radiacmeters dosimeters to record cumulative gamma and neutron radiation dosages received and detector papers to detect and identify liquid chemical agents individual dosimeter the new dt236pd individual dosimeter looks like wristwatch without face wear it on the wrist to measure the cumulative dose of gamma and neutron radiation received it is designed to augment the im93 dosimeter selected trained personnel use the cp696ud radiac computerindicator to read this dosimeter figure 113 data obtained form the basis 19fm 34 110fm 34 of radiation dose exposure records units will maintain one dt236 per individual assigned plus 10 percent for loss or damage during periods of heightened tension when other contingency items are issued to soldiers the dt236pd will be issued to each individual once issued each soldier will wear the dt236pd on his wrist at all times except when being read and cleaned the readings obtained from dt236pd dosimeters in unit will be averaged and used to determine the radiation exposure status res the res determined from existing dosimetery equipment and the res based on the dt236pd will be compared and the higher of the category worst case will be used when the unit assumes mopp the dt236pd will be worn underneath the mopp suit dt236 may be decontaminated with the m258a1 and the m291 skin decon kits however if chemical agent soaks into the wristband it must be replaced the dt236 is not designed to replace existing dosimetry equipment and specifically is not designed to replace the film badge worn by medical personnel the dt236 is designed to be worn by tactical personnel only tm 11666523612 gives instructions on the care and maintenance of the dt236pd chemical agent detector paper soldiers receive two types of chemical agent detector paper the abcm8 vgh chemical agent detector paper is called m8 it detects and identifies liquid agents the m9 chemical agent detector paper detects the presence of liquid agent the m9 does not identifyagents m8 detector paper figure 114 comes in booklets of 25 sheets use the m8 paper to detect and identify liquid v or gtype nerve agents or htype blister agents the sheets are impregnated with chemical compounds that turn dark green yellow or red upon contact with liquid chemical agent color chart in the booklet helps determine the type of agent contacted the paper must touch liquid agent it does not detect vapor it is best suited for use on nonporous materials because some solvents also cause it to change color the paper is unreliable for determining the completeness of decon for example ds2 mimics positive v agent reaction blackgreen color change see fm 35 m8 paper is also in the m256m256a1 chemical agent detector kit use m9 chemical agent detector paper figure 115 to detect the presence of liquid chemical agents it does not detect chemical agent vapor the paper indicates the presence of nerve agent g and v or blister agent h and l by turning red or reddish color because of this read m9 paper with only whitelight source the selfadhesive m9 paper attaches to most surfaces when attaching it to clothing place it on the upper portion of your right arm left wrist and either your left or right ankle to allow adequate representation of contamination encountered when placing it on piece of equipment ensure the location is free of dirt oil and grease and place the paper where it will not be stepped on it is advised that m9 paper that has been placed on equipment be removed before ds2 is sprayed over it if that is not done it becomes almost impossible to remove the paper the m9 paper is usable in any weather in temperatures above 32f 0c however exposure to extremely high temperatures may produce false readings scuffs certain types of organic liquids and ds2 also cause false readings

decontaminating apparatus skills applicable to these items can be found in stp 2124 chemical agent monitor the chemical agent monitor cam figure 120 is designed to be used to detect chemical agent vapor and provide readout of the relative concentration of vapor present it can be employed to monitor personnel or vehicles prior to decontamination and after the inside of collective protection shelters relative concentrations of agents to assist in the selection of the appropriate level of protective posture the completeness of decontamination the cam draws in air and samples it for contamination it indicates the level of contamination on bar graph indicator when very light concentrations are present the cam samples for longer period of time to reduce the possibility of false indications when an agent vapor is detected the cam will provide bar graph indication of the relative concentration of the sample figure 121 although very close to what is actually there the indication is only an approximation of the concentration if 113fm 34 vapor is not present the instrument will not provide an indication if vapors are transient the cam would provide intermittent indications this is primarily function of weather time of exposure and the challenge presented see tm 3666532713p for instructions on care and maintenance m34 soil sampling kit the m34 sampling kit

sustainment requirements for operations under nbc conditions commanders must apply the sustainment imperatives of airland battle doctrine these imperatives include anticipation integration continuity responsiveness and improvisation an understanding of these imperatives can ensure prompt delivery of needed items at present units maintain two sets of 116fm 34 sets of gear to the soldier must be thoroughly thought out and planned for based on the operational situation using the sustainment imperatives as guide for your units specific quantities check with your next higher headquarters or use cta 50900 for specific quantities forward deployed unit such as an armored cavalry regiment acr may require both sets of mopp gear be immediately available based on the threat the bag is carried by the soldier as part of his individualfield gear the b bag can either be part of the troop trains or squadron trains this is again based on the threat other methods can be devised based on unit policy given low nbc threat situation such as operations urgent fury deployment to grenada in 1983 and just cause deployment to panama in 1989 units deployed at mopp zero unit sets of mopp gear including bags were palletized for immediate followon resupply if the nbc threat situation changed resupply of the second set of mopp gear into combat configured loads can also be accomplished by palletizing the needed individual protective equipment ipe this method can be used by both light and heavy units the intent of palletizing is to create push package that can either be broken down at an arrival airfield or at unit trains site for immediate issue to companylevel units or for further movement forward to units in the field the method of palletizing and movement is dependent on the type of unit and how 117fm 34 they perform their mission the configuration of the pallets themselves and where they would be kept while in garrison will be dictated by unit sop space will be crucial factor in light infantry divisions pallets must be configured so as to fit on an aircraft that will be resupplying the units in heavy divisions pallets need to be configured to fit on whatever prime mover that is designated to haul the pallets possible palletized configuration for use by light infantry unit that based on the expected nbc threat initially does not deploy with either their or b bags could be one pallet with the units bags and related ipe equipment m256series kits m8 and 9 paper m258a1m291 kits ds2 and m4 winterization kit one pallet with the units b bags and related equipment another pallet containing other unit nbc equipment one other pallet containing stb by itself since for safety reasons ds2 and stb cannot be transported together configurations will vary based on units general deployment plan gdp or contingency mission and the likelihood of an nbc threat in their area of operation ao all this would be integrated and executed through the logistics channels these items will be moved based on certain time lines dictated by the operation plan oplan and on events that are expected to occur during the operation chemical protectiv undergarment cpu description the cpu is lightweight twopiece undergarment made of nonwoven fabric with activated charcoal the jacket has zippered front with velcro wrist attachments the trouser waist has an elastic band for snug fit to the body the undergarment weighs two pounds 11 ounces note the cpu primary basis of issue indicates that it will be issued to special forces and combat vehicle crews protection capabilities the cpu provides excellent protection against all known chemical agent vapors liquid droplets biological agents toxins and radioactive alpha and beta particles the cpu is not stand alone garment the cpu is worn under standard duty uniforms such as thebattle dress uniform bdu or the combat vehicle crewmen coverall the cpu is not designed or intended to be worn under the bdo or cpog the cpu is donned when soldiers are directed to go from mopp0 to mopp1 when the cpu is used at mopp34 the protection afforded is equivalent to that provided by mopp34 ensemble using either the bdo or cpog following exposure to liquid chemical agent at mopp34 soldiers should exchange their uniform and cpu within 12 hours further cpu the should be disposed of if the exterior uniform has been exposed to liquid chemical agent do not remove the undergarment from the bag until it is ready for use when the undergarment is removed from its vaporbarrier bag and worn its protective qualities last for minimum of 15 days the protective qualities for the cpu begins to decline following 15 days however any specific decrease in cpu effectiveness has not been determined through test and evaluation the weartime for the cpu begins when it is removed from the sealed vaporbarrier bag and stops when the cpu is sealed back in the vaporbarrier bag if the original vaporbarrier bag is not available to the soldier for undergarment storage use replacement storage bag that as minimum is water resistant or water repellent when any packaging leaks are discovered seal or repair them with tape as soon as possible the cpu can also be laundered once during its 15 day utilization period note during testing the cpu was only laundered once it is not known if repeat washing will decrease cpu effectiveness and retain its protective qualities the cpu can be handwashed in fresh water or laundered by quartermaster laundry and bath unit note follow the cpu laundering instructions outlined on the size and care labels serviceability the cpu becomes unserviceable if it is ripped or torn however it can be repaired by following instructions that are provided in cpu use and care manual or tm 10840020123 the cpu remains serviceable if the vaporbarrier bag suffers damage i pinholes rips tears provided the undergarment has not been physically damaged or exposed to chemical agents the cpu comes in sealed vaporbarrier bag that protects against rain moisture and sunlight the cpu is resistant to rust rot and petroleum 118c2 fm 34fmfm 119 chapter 2 mopp analysis this chapter addresses the methodology for determining appropriate levels of protection from chemical hazards units do this by modifying their protective postures using chemical agent detectors and alarms determining automatic masking criteria and making informed decisions at the right time on the battlefield units will have incomplete intelligence concerning enemy nbc chemical capabilities however units use intelligence preparation of the battlefield ipb to estimate how many enemy fire support systems are in range where and what they are and how they could support probable enemy courses of action coa further your assessment of the enemys intent and capabilities is necessary part of the mopp analysis and directly affects your recommendations however at higher levels of command for example brigade or higher more data are available to better determine threat capabilities and intent estimates provided by these headquarters enable subordinate units to determine appropriate postures subordinate units must be given the flexibility to modify mopp guidance received from higher headquarters based on local conditions units may be granted the flexibility to raise or lower their protective posture from that recommended by higher headquarters by using the techniques described in this chapter this may be done down to platoon level and by any element that finds itself isolated if higher headquarters specifically denies this flexibility then protective postures may only be raised not lowered by these units this chapter will discuss the use of ipb as it relates to nbc operations standard mopp postures automatic masking mopp flexibility the sources and management of performance problems in mopp troop preparation mopp analysis procedures and other procedures regarding the wear of the bdo and other individual protective equipment advice on use of mopp guidance techniques for use of alarms and unmasking procedures are included as well as filter replacement criteria assessin g threat information chemical officers and ncos battalionbrigaderesponsibilities include using mopp analysis to provide their commander with the best possible nbc estimate in coordination with the s2 and s3 chemical staff personnel battalionbrigde address nbc during all phases of the battle this is done by using assessment information from higher headquarters see discussion in chapter 3 and summarizing that information for their units needs the ipb process includes evaluation of the threatthe organization composition tactical doctrine weapons equipment and their supporting battlefield functional systems of the enemy lt includes evaluating areas of operation and times of interest set by the commander terrain and weather analysis are also included in the process the final step in the process is threat integration this includes integrating the above mentioned items and enemy doctrine to determine how the enemy will fight threat integration is accomplished through development of the doctrine situation event and decision support templates used by the s2 in briefing the commander the chemical officer uses the doctrine template in his estimate to address the when where why and how the enemy will employ any nbc hazards in an ao this provides the commander the information on threat nbc employment required for developing his concept of the operation threat chemical barrier production can also be depicted on this template nbc reconnaissance will be conducted to confirm or deny whether any chemical barriers are present procedures to estimate the duration of the hazard are covered in chapter 3 next the chemical officer applies the situation template to his units actual ao to provide detailed assessment of all possible threat nbc actions that have either already happened or are anticipated based on how the battle is taking shape the situation template helps explain how future events on the battlefield can affect the units operations the events template lays out possible events that could happen as the battle progresses the chemical officer examines each forecasted event to assess all possible threat nbc interdictions that could impact on his units mission withinthe ao for example the chemical officersncos assessment includes estimating the percentage of friendly chemical casualties that could occur if the enemy employed agents at that particular time the procedure for estimating chemical casualties is discussed in chapter 3 21c2 fm 34fmfm 119 based on the situation the events template predicts possible enemy coa at certain times and places on the battlefield based on these coa decision support template is created the decision support template provides the commander with his own coa to counter the threat these coa are based on certain actions happening on the battlefield or at certain time or phase during the battle the commander may use decision points on the battlefield to initiate certain coa based on the nbc threat these decision points can result in the commander ordering higher mopp level based on an increased nbc threat at particular time or phase of the battle he may request nbc reconnaissance of critical terrain that templating indicates could be contaminated with persistent agents these are just few examples of possible input the chemical officer could provide to the s2s ipb estimate using the ipb process the chemical officernco provides the commander and staff updates on the nbc situation the chemical officer provides the following based on the time periods of interest set by the commander detailed information on enemy nbc capability based on the type of weapon systems that the enemy has available at that period of interest how the enemy would employ chemicals areas of likely employment based on threat employment doctrine detailed analysis of terrain and weather in the units ao during each period of interest mopp guidance for each period of interest templates of predicted fallout data that are updated as conditions change alternative actions the commander can initiate prior to the time period in question so as to minimize degradation of affected units continuous monitoring of s2 message and radio traffic for any nbcrelated information that could be important to the units mission prior planning based on information provided by the chemical officer will help the commander make sound decisions regular updates need to be provided to the commander because of rapid changes in the situation it is corps and higherlevel commanders responsibility to direct minimum mopp levels appropriate to the threat they are aware of the intelligence that might indicate the probable use of nbc weapons these commanders have the initial responsibility for upgrading unit protective posture ordering mopp2 through mopp4 is the responsibility of the division and lower commanders the final responsibility however is that of the company commander or platoon leader who is on the spot at thislevel there is better appreciation for what the unit can and cannot do these leaders increase or decrease their units protective posture based on an analysis of the situation and guidance from higher command final responsibility at this level retains flexibility of the system the lower echelon units leader should not decrease the protective posture below the minimum level established by the next higher headquarters without prior approval based on the threat assessment units may be directed to deploy with only their protective masks during operation just cause in panama in 1989 and operation urgent fury in grenada in 1983 several us units based on intelligence information determined that the protective mask would meet their nbc defense needs this represents an example of the flexibility that is inherent in the mopp system during operation desert shieldstorm most us units deployed to saudi arabia at mopp zero and had their mopp gear readily available again this represents based on intelligence information and the threat the flexibility that is inherent in the mopp system standard missionoriented protective posture s all leaders need to be familiar with standard mopp levels knowing these levels will aid the commander or small unit leader in making rapid and educated decisions regarding the level of mopp to be worn by his soldiers standardized mopp levels allow commanders to increase or decrease levels of protection through the use of readily understood prowords commanders determine which protective posture their subordinate units will assume figure 21 and then direct their units to assume that mopp level the commanders or leaders directive also can include based on the threat the percentage of soldiers that will mask for example mopp1 50 percent masked the system is flexible and subordinate leaders can modify their units mopp level to meet mission needs according to the procedures described on pages 38 through 43 the following standardized protective postures assume that soldiers are also carrying their individual decontamination kit m258a1 or m291 m8m9 detector paper naak and their protective mask unless the threat assessment indicates zero percent probability of nbc use mopp ready soldiers carry their protective masks with their lce the soldiers mopp gear is labeled and stored further back than the bsa and is ready to be brought forward to 22c2 fm 34fmfm 119 the soldier when needed pushing it forward should not exceed two hours units in mopp ready are highly vulnerable to persistent agent attacks and will automatically upgrade to mopp zero when they determine or are notified that chemical weapons have been used or that the threat for use of chemical weapons has risen when unit is at mopp ready soldiers will have fieldexpedient items identified for use see page 36 for further discussion on field expedient items mopp zero soldiers carry their protective masks with their lce the standard bdo and other ipe making up the soldiers mopp gear are readily available to be considered readily available equipment must be either carried by each soldier or stored within arms reach of the soldier for example within the work area vehicle or fighting position units in mopp zero are highly vulnerable to persistent agent attacks and will automatically upgrade to mopp1 when they determine or are notified that persistent chemical weapons have been used or that the threat for use of chemical weapons has risen mopp1 when directed to mopp1 soldiers immediately don the bdo in hot weather the overgarment jacket can be unbuttoned and the bdo can be worn directly over underwear m9 or m8 chemical detection paper is attached to the overgarment mopp1 provides great deal of protection against persistent agent this level is automatically assumed when chemical weapons have been employed in an area of operations or when directed by higher commandsmopp 2 soldiers put on their chemical protective footwear covers cpfcs gvos or field expedient item for example vaporbarrier boots and the protective helmet cover is worn as with mopp1 the overgarment jacket may be left unbuttoned but trousers remain closed mopp3 soldiers wear the protective mask and hood again flexibility is built into the system to allow soldiers relief at mopp3 particularly in hot weather soldiers can open the overgarment jacket and roll the protective mask hood for ventilation but trousers remain closed mopp 4 soldiers will completely encapsulate themselves by closing their overgarments rolling down and adjusting the mask hood and putting on the nbc rubber gloves with cotton liners mopp4 provides the highest degree of chemical protection but also has the most negative impact on an individuals performance mask only command the mask is worn the mask only command is given under these situations when rcas are being employed and chemicalbiological threat exists in downwind vapor hazard of nonpersistent chemical agent mask only is not an appropriate command when blister or persistent nerve agents are present 23c2 fm 34fmfm 119 24c2 fm 34fmfm 119 automatic masking automatic masking is the act of immediately masking and assuming mopp4 when encountering chemical attack indicators on the battlefield before chemical weapons usage is confirmed soldiers will don the mask only when there is high probability of chemical attack high probability chemical attack indicators are sounding of chemical agent alarm positive reading on chemical agent detector paper or chemical agent monitor soldiers experiencing symptoms of chemical agent poisoning when chemical agents have been employed commanders at all levels may establish modified policy of automatic masking by designating additional events as automatic masking criteria once this information is disseminated soldiers will mask and assume mopp4 automatically whenever one of these events occurs automatic masking criteria should be used by the commander as decision tool and is based on nbc ipb unit vulnerability analysis and mettt subordinate commanders may add automatic masking criteria at their discretion for further guidance on nbc ipb consult fm 3101 chemical staffs and units mopp system flexibility mopp is not fixed or rigid system flexibility is the key to providing maximum protection with the lowest risk possible while still allowing mission accomplishment flexibility allows subordinate commanders to adjust the amount of mopp protection required in their particular situations and still maintain combat effectiveness additionally commanders can place all or part of their units in different mopp levels or authorize variations within given mopp level for example based on high probability of chemical attack two soldiers man an observation postlistening post lpop one soldier wears mask and the other does not this ensures that if sudden attack occurred one soldier would already be masked and would not become casualty the masked soldier would be able to continue the oplp mission this type of risk assessment initiative and flexibility is key to survival on todays fastpaced highly mobile battlefield using techniques described in this section to vary the wearing of mopp gear reduces heat stress and soldier performance against the possible risk of contamination and mission accomplishment commanders make onthespotdecisions on whether to modify mopp the following paragraphs describe suggested variations soldiers may leave the overgarment jacket open at mopp1 mopp2 or mopp3 allowing greater ventilation soldiers may leave the hood open or rolled at mopp3 the various configurations of the mopp levels with the hood rolled or open are referred to as mopp open commanders decide which of these variations to use based on the threat temperature and unit work intensity soldiers wear protective gloves at mopp1 through mopp3 when handling equipment that has been decontaminated this prevents contact with agent that may have been absorbed by equipment surfaces where the hazard is from residual nuclear effects for example fallout the commander modifies mopp level based on his assessment of the situation and criticality of the mission mopp gear does not protect against gamma radiation this fact is of immediate concern to the commander other risks include burns from beta particles and ingestion of alpha particles wearing of mopp gear can reduce the risk of injury from these radiological hazards primary concern is to reduce the amount of radioactive contamination that contacts the skin and to prevent ingestion of radioactive particles once it has been determined that only lowlevel residual radiological hazard exists the commander may decide to modify the units mopp posture or procedures in fight of mission requirements for example soldiers are told to unmask remove the hoods and unbutton the bdos soldiers can cover their noses and mouths with handkerchiefs or other material that provides dust protection in lieu of their protective masks wearing of full mopp significantly reduces the beta bum and alpha particle ingestion hazard performance degradation and heat stress increase as in the case of protection from chemical hazards achievement of radiological protection involves tradeoff against the risk of mopp induced performance degration and heat illness one method of modifying the protective posture allows soldiers to wear the cloth liners from their butyl gloves this prevents radiological contamination of as much exposed skin as possible soldiers issued the m291 kit should use fieldexpedient substitutes such as wet handkerchief or commercial wetwipes to remove radiological particles that accumulate on hairy areas of the body the ration supplement sundries pack nsn 8970002689934 for females and 8970011752509 for general use contains supply of the latter items 25c2 fm 34fmfm 119 understanding and managing performance problems in nbc operations once an accurate assessment of the nbc threat has been made the key to selecting an appropriate mopp level lies in understanding factors contributing to performance degradation and heat casualties mopp4 protects soldiers by completely isolating them from the nbc environment however this encapsulation imposes both physiological and psychological stresses upon the wearer and interacts to degrade individual and unit performance other combat stress can further compound the strain of encapsulation lower mopp levels reduce the stress associated with encapsulation but increase the risk of exposure to threat agents exposure to low levels of some agents can also lead to performance degradation leaders that understand the potential problems and how these problems are countered are prepared to conduct the mopp analysis procedures presented below the successful leader will minimize performance problems and casualties through informed planning and thorough preparation physiological factors adding layers over the bdu for example protective overgarment gloves and overboots increases the risk of heat stress even at moderate environmental temperatures and work intensities this increases the possibility of heat casualties and degrades performance hunger thirst and discomfort during sustained periods of mopp wear can also seriously degrade performance heat stress in mopp body temperature must be maintained within narrow limits for optimum physical and mental performance the body produces more heat during work than rest normally the body cools itself by evaporation of sweat and radiation of heat at the skins surface mopp gear restricts these heat loss mechanisms because of its high insulation and low permeability to water vapor in addition physical work tasks require more effort when soldiers wear protective clothing because of added weight and restricted movement this results in more body heat to be dissipated than normal and body temperature tends to rise quickly the amount of heat acclimatization depends upon theamount of physical activity the level of hydration the clothing worn the load carried the state of heat acclimatization physical fitness and fatigue as well as terrain and climatic conditions adjusting the mopp level by opening the bdo jacket unblousing boots rolling up the hood and so forth will reduce barriers to body cooling the decision process for selecting appropriate adjustments is covered under the section on mopp analyses work intensity is major contributing factor to heat stress that can be managed by leaders military work is categorized as very light light moderate or heavy table 21 provides examples that can be used as guide in estimating the work intensity for particular mission or task the incidence of heat casualties can be reduced if soldiers can be allowed to lower their work intensity andor take more frequent rest breaks tables 22 and 27 provide information necessary to calculate recommended workrest cycles for various environmental conditions clothing levels and work intensities during daylight and night or fully shaded operations respectively the workrest cycles specified in the tables are based on keeping the risk of heat casualties below five percent under some operational conditions workrest cycles offer advantage to continuous work see nl entries in tables 22 and 27 there are conditions when workrest cycles offer advantage for example when the environmental and clothing conditions do not permit any cooling during rest see na entries in tables 22 and 27 leaders may choose to use the estimated tolerance times such as maximum continuous work times specified in tables 24 daylight and 29 night or shade to limit the risk of heat casualties to less than five percent although strict adherence to workrest criteria is possible during training exercises this may not be possible during combat operations tables 24 and 29 provide guidance on tolerance tunes for example the maximum number of minutes of work before the risk of becoming casualty exceeds five percent 1 of every 20 soldiers these estimates representing average expected values withing large population should be considered approximate guidance and not be used as substitute for common sense or experience individuals will vary in their tolerance once the work time limit has been reached soldiers should rest in the shade using the guidance provided in table 26 before returning to work as table 26 clearly shows reduction of mopp level during the rest period is the 26fm 34 temperature and nullifies the benefits of heat acclimatization and physical fitness increases the susceptibility to heat injury and reduces work capacity including gtolerance in pilots appetite and alertness even in soldiers who are not heat casualties the combined effects of dehydration restricted heat loss from the body and increased work effort place severe strain on the bodys functions and soldiers suffer from decrements in mental and physical performance the difficulty of drinking in mopp increases the likelihood of dehydration thirst is not an adequate indicator of dehydration soldiers will not sense when they are dehydrated and will fail to replace body water losses even when drinking water is readily available unit chain of command must take responsibility for enforcing regular and timely fluid replacement in their soldiers water requirements should be estimated using the guidelines provided in tables 23 25 28 and 210 base the recommended hourly replenishment on current work intensity temperature clothing layers and light cycle for example at moderate work intensity in mopp4 over underwear only and daylight wet bulb globe temperature wbgt of 80f 27c soldier should drink approximately 20 quarts of water per hour if working continuously or 10 quart per hour if working according to thekey to maximizing the time troops can spend performing workworkrest schedule recommended in table 22 for in minimizing heat stress workrest schedules may be supplemented by microclimate cooling mcc systems in which an air or liquid cooled vest worn under the bdo removes body heat away from skin mcc systems are available inside certain combat vehicles but mcc options are not usually available for dismounted soldiers even when workrest schedules and mcc are used an increased risk of performance degradation and heat casualties is inevitable when wearing mopp in hot weather dehydration because of higher body temperatures soldiers in mopp gear sweat considerably more than usual often more than 15 quarts of water every hour during work water must be consumed to replace lost fluids or dehydration will follow even slight degree of dehydration impairs the bodys ability to regulate itsexample 10 minutes work 50 minutes rest note that continuous work under these conditions may lead to heat casualties after 49 minutes table 24 soldiers should drink as much as possible before donning the mask and frequent drinking while working is more effective in maintaining hydration than waiting until rest periods to drink the estimates in the tables will also provide the s4 with information he can use to calculate potential drinking water requirements and allocate assets needed to get the water to the soldier additional water should be made available for such things as hygiene cooking and medical requirements training and conditioning wellprepared soldiers suffer less stress when in mopp4 than do troops who are less prepared wellprepared soldiers are those who are in good physical condition and have trained extensively in 27fm 34 protective gear physically fit soldiers are more resistant operations in mopp lead to an increased demand for to physical and mental fatigue and acclimatize more quickly to climatic heat or the heat associated with mopp wear than less fit soldiers units that anticipate deployment to regions where employment of chemicalbiological agents is possible should augment physical training programs and increase their state of heat acclimatization to optimize heat acclimatization soldiers should progressively increase the duration reaching two to four hours and intensity of exercise in the heat over 7 to 14 consecutive days finally when soldiers are required to routinely work in mopp gear it is important to practice good hygiene keep skin clean to avoid developing heat rash that can dramatically reduce the ability to regulate body temperature inadequate nutrition in addition to bodily requirements for electrolyte salt replacement caused by sustained and excessive sweating the higher work intensities typical ofcalories lack of adequate energy supplies can lead to decrements in both physical and mental performance the army has tailored its field feeding menus to provide adequate amounts of both salts and calories to support mopp operations all rations served or issued must be consumed however and potential contamination of food supplies will make it difficult to maintain adequate nutrition while in mopp the method selected to minimize feedingrelated problems depends on availability of safe uncontaminated areas as well as other operational constraints in contaminated area where there is also vapor hazard move troops into collectiveprotection facility to eat meals since collectiveprotection shelters have limited capacity rotate small groups through these facilities in contaminated area with collective protection available relocate troops to safe area for feeding by rotating small portions of the unit or by entire unit replacement if soldiers are in contaminated area 28fm 34 with detectable vapor hazard or in clean area where to induce protective postures that reduce combat they are under constant threat of nbc attack use rotating method for feeding about 25 percent at any one time and take care to prevent contaminating the food psychological factors nbc warfare threat adds to an already stressful situation because it creates unique fears in soldiers and isolates them from their environment mopp4 reduces the ability to see and hear clearly and makes it more difficult to recognize and communicate with others this creates or increases feelings of isolation and confusion the awkwardness of wearing bulky impermeable garments gloves and boots on top the bdu causes frustration in many soldiers and claustrophobia in some long periods of reduced mobility and sensory awareness degrade attention and alertness and create or increase feelings of alienation chemical filters in the protective mask make breathing more difficult this too may create feelings of claustrophobia or panic the enemy will use the chemical agent threat to exploit these weaknesses andeffectiveness the adverse impact of psychological stress during mopp operations can be minimized by the experience and confidence that realistic training in mopp4 provides wearing mopp causes physical and emotional stress tough realistic metldriven training using mopp creates stressful environment for soldiers and units successful training helps support unit preparations for battle stress encountered during conflict or war combat stress the threat of nbc warfare increases the overall psychological and physiological stress that is an integral part of combat because mopp4 is only worn when the threat of imminent attack is the greatest encapsulation increases generalized fears and anxiety about combat combat stress or battlefield fatigue can cause significant numbers of psychiatric casualties estimates range from 10 percent to 30 percent depending on the duration and intensity of battle draft fm 851 discusses combat stress 29fm 34 in detail psychological stress stems not only from the will be high leaders must take true interest in the death and destruction that characterize combat but also from the challenging operational conditions noise confusion and loss of sleep challenging operational conditions that create fatigue and cause changes in diet and personal hygiene cause physiological stress as well use of short rest breaks to provide relief from mopp combined with adequate sleep 6 or more hours of uninterrupted sleep per 24hour period is optimum 4 hours is the minimum for few days of sustained operations food and drink can sustain performance at an optimal level during the period of 0100 to 0700 leaders must be aware that the body experiences reduced mental concentration confusion nervousness and lack of clear thinking leaders should plan activities to reduce boredom fatigue inattention and discomfort these are major contributors to ineffective performance leaders can minimize the effects of combat stress by attaining and maintaining high level of unit cohesion and individual identity units must train together frequently under demanding conditions if soldiers know that they can overcome adversity together unit cohesionwelfare of their soldiers and build the confidence necessary to withstand the effects of stress leaders must keep soldiers informed about the tactical situation so that the adverse effects of ambiguity and uncertainty are minimized soldiers who become ineffective as result of combat stress should be given period of rest as close to the front as possible and given reassurance and support by all members of their unit psychological symptoms rarely will leaders on the integrated battlefield be able to distinguish between the different types of stress for example excessive sweating nausea and claustrophobia can be caused by fear and anxiety about combat by dehydration and heat illness by total encapsulation in mopp4 or even by exposure to chemical agent symptoms of stress with psychological origin could include any of the following mood unusual impatience frustration or irritability unusual fatigue or sleepiness loneliness isolation or alienation 210fm 34 feelings of helplessness claustrophobia thinking forgetfulness or absentmindedness especially common are errors in map plotting and message coding impaired decision making reasoning or judgment disorientation confusion or panic hallucinations or paranoia physical signs rapid breathing hyperventilation or rapid heart rate tachycardia cotton mouth or nausea cramps or muscle tension military task performance problems in mopp adding layers to the bdu reduces mobility agility coordination and dexterity hundreds of military tasks have been tested to determine the degradation from wearing mopp gear units operating in mopp1 and mopp2 generally do not experience significant timeincreases to perform given task with one exception extensive foot travel in mopp2 is slowed due to the effects of the overboot and gvos soldiers wearing mopp4 will take about 15 times longer to perform most tasks therefore leaders can estimate the time it will take to complete most tasks in mopp4 by multiplying the time normally required to complete tasks by 15 decisionmaking and precision control tasks are slowed even more than manual tasks for decisionmaking and precision control for example typing message or aiming tasks the normally expected completion time should be multiplied by 25 or more if soldiers have been in mopp4 for an extended period or are overheated soldiers depend on each other to ensure unit performance individual degradation will affect the unit as whole unit performance will be significantly degraded due to behavioral changes and leader exhaustion leaders must plan for slower pace of operations in mopp if accuracy is to be maintained repeatedly 211fm 34 practicing critical tasks for example training well in the following are ways in which leaders can excess of the standard can offer some improvements but this may or may not be sufficient depending on mission requirements tasks that require manual dexterity and unrestricted hearing and vision should be simplified or modified in an nbc environment command control and communications are difficult wearing the protective mask degrades hearing vision and speech all are important to effective communication individuals are difficult to identify by name or rank leading to confusion as well as contributing to failures in effective communication performance of command functions while in mopp presents problem all commanders must consider few of these challenges include the following heat stress causes personnel in leadership positions to tire rapidly and affects mental and physical capability the mask voicemitter makes speech difficult to understand the m17series mask impairs voice communication in both volume and quality on radios and field phones eye lenses of the mask narrow the field of vision note the m40series mask considerably diminishes the last three problems the hood impairs hearingminimize some of these difficulties delegate more responsibilities to reduce the stress of wearing mopp over extended periods of time increase flexibility in mopp wear as discussed earlier in this chapter the unit sop must include specific unit guidelines based on unit mission needs when using the radio ensure the microphone is held close to the voicemitter particularly when wearing the m17series mask if possible wear the microphoneequipped m24m25series mask or the m42series mask and use the vehicular communication system if operating in combat vehicle enhance verbal communications by speaking more slowly than normal and having orders repeated hand and other visual signals can be effectively employed issue written orders if time permits to ensure instructions are understood use collective protection as much as possible to eliminate the burden of mopp identifying soldiers in mopp by name and rank can be accomplished through various means one way is to use tape showing the soldiers name and rank tape is normally available in some form and there are advantages to using it when soldiers are not in mopp strip of tape with all the information already printed on it can be placed on the soldiers overgarment bag as well as on the mask carrier when the overgarments are 212fm 34 put on soldiers can pull the tape off the overgarment of using night vision devices miosis can reduce the bag and place it on their overgarment to further increase ease of identification other methods can be used as long as they suit the commanders needs in being able to identify his soldiers do not damage or interfere with the use of other equipment and allow soldiers to perform the mission unimpeded miosis although mopp gear may be the most common source of performance problems during nbc operations some chemical agents primarily the nerve agents can produce performance decrements at exposure levels below that which would cause casualties very small amounts of nerve agent such as vapor or aerosol absorbed through the eyes will constrict the pupils this condition is called miosis it may or may not involve pain andor headache the pupil is unable to dilate normally thus reducing night vision and the efficiencyefficiency of performance of other tasks at night for example navigating on foot identifying and engaging targets driving vehicles under blackout conditions and flying that requires pilots to change focus frequently symptoms of miosis range from minimal to severe depending on the nerve agent dosage victims may experience headaches when exposed to bright light severe miosis and the consequent reduced ability to see in dim light may persist for 48 hours after onset the pupil gradually returns to normal over several days full recovery may take 20 days or longer repeated exposures within this period cause cumulative effects commanders must identify personnel performing critical tasks that are dependent on night vision and initiate certain precautions to minimize miosis these precautions may include the following have key personnel mask whenever there is risk of encountering miosisproducing hazards such as when 213fm 34 close to ground equipment or personnel known to have role under nbc conditions and their need to make been contaminated with liquid nerve agent after detailed equipment decon fm 35 allow personnel to move away from their equipment have them move to contaminationfree area and conduct unmasking procedures residual contamination on decontaminated material may be sufficient to cause miosis soldiers should disperse in the open air and use the buddy system to observe for possible miosis symptoms use collective protection as much as possible troop preparation it cannot be overemphasized that soldiers and their leaders must train in mopp gear including training intimely and informed decisions just as infantrymen train extensively with their individual weapon to become proficient in its use individual soldiers should train in mopp to become more confident and proficient on individual and team tasks training in mopp4 helps leaders and soldiers understand the problems they will encounter when required to fight in mopp during preparation for combat leaders gain knowledge of individual and unit training status and take actions such as individual training and battle drills to ensure maximum preparation prior to combat leaders can ensure success on the nbc battlefield in many ways mopp4 over extended periods of time further soldiers cannot be expected to fight successfully in full mopptrain thoroughly and realistically gear if they have not trained as team with their leaders build confidence and equipment leaders are critically aware of their key training in mopp4and unit cohesion through realistic 214fm 34 practice critical visual tasks like marksmanship in the protective mask until they become automatic attain and maintain peak physical fitness and acclimatization ensure radio telephone operators rtos are trained in recognizing and transmitting nbc reports and know their importance to unit survival crosstrain crews and other critical positions plan ahead check nbc defense guidance in oplanopord anticipate projected work requirements in the next 2448 hours ensure serviceability or shortfalls of equipment through precombat inspections of nbc equipment know the most current weather data particularly wind direction plan workrest cycles appropriate to the environment and the mission ensure deployment and mounting of alarms use sops to reduce command control andcommunication tasks keep plans simple think teamwork use methods of individual identification name tags personal items encourage smalltalk while in mopp pair an experienced soldier with an inexperienced buddy whenever possible use the buddy system to ensure that all members of the unit are regularly checked for signs of stress and agent exposure work smart provide relief from mopp4 as soon as the mission allows use workrest ratios slow work rate and minimize work intensity work in the shade whenever possible enforce command drinking to reduce dehydration and heat casualties 215fm 34 rememberthe most motivated soldiers and leaders are the most likely to ignore their needs for food water and rest they are the first casualties use collective protection as much as possible enforce good eating drinking and sleeping discipline rotate jobs and people during long shifts or periods of inactivity provide relief from extreme temperatures hot or cold as soon as possible remember that even short breaks from total encapsulation are effective in sustaining performance augment units or divide work between two units schedule work for cooler time of day or at nightmopp analysis procedures commanders must perform situationbased mopp analysis to determine the appropriate mopp level this analysis enhances the probability of mission success by balancing the reduced risk of casualties due to chemicalbiological agent exposure against the increased risk of performance decrements and heat strain casualties as mopp levels increase from zero to mopp4 because there is easy formula to use in deciding an appropriate mopp level commanders must consider three situation factors when performing mopp analysis the three situation factors are mission environment and soldier factors the contributing factors to these situation factors are subject to complex interactions and full analysis is more suited to automated tactical decision aids such as the automated 216fm 34 nuclear biological and chemical information system anbacis currently in use by higher echelon planners than the simplified figures and tables of this manual at the small unit level this type of comprehensive analysis is not normally required however an understanding of the physiological and psychological factors that affect health and performance while in mopp coupled with experience gained in training under variety of environmental conditions and mission work loads will prepare you for the task the commander will need to consider mission environmental and soldier factors when performing mopp analysis mission factors ask the following questions what is the mission is it offensive or defensive what is the likelihood of chemical agent employment what agents are likely to be employed what are the likely targets what is the expected warning time for agent employment what additional protection such as shelter and cover is available how physically demanding is the work that must be performed how mentally demanding is the work that must be performed how quickly must the mission be accomplished what is the expected duration of the mission what is the likely followon mission are adequate water and food supplies available the mission will greatly influence the amount of protection needed by each soldier how important is the mission and what risks will it require the answers to several of the missionrelated questions will be provided in the ipb process once commanders understand the nature of the threat and probability of nbc weapons use they can proceed to weigh the other mission environment and soldierrelated factors that influence selection of an appropriate mopp level for instance is it day or night the best time to use chemical agents is between late evening and early morning when stable or neutral temperature gradients prevail under these conditions agents tend to linger close to the ground and move horizontally with the wind during unstable conditions in the heat of the day agents rise rapidly this rapid rise reduces the time on target and the agents casualtyproducing capabilities thus it is more likely that agents will be employed during predawn darkness and the environmental and other conditions influencing mopp analysis can be more appropriately selected forinstance the environmental heat load as measured by the wbgt index is lower at night this implies that the degree of protection can be increased to match the magnitude of the threat while achieving lesser risk of performance problems and heat casualties missionrelated factors greatly influence the amount of protection needed by each soldier when the threat of chemicalbiological agent employment is high and expected warning time for the unit is low high level of mopp is dictated to provide adequate protection however increased mopp levels can lead to performance degradation additionally the incidence of heat casualties among soldiers performing physically demanding work becomes greater with increasing mopp levels especially in high ambient heat the more critical the mission the more thorough commanders must be in their analysis the impact of decreased performance and heat casualties from mopp must be weighted carefully against the risk of casualties and potential mission failure due to chemical agents mopp analysis must consider the work intensity the mission will require and how long this work load must be maintained is time critical factor in mission success what will be required of the troops after achieving the mission objective can they rest must they digin and defend in place these are some of the critical questions the commander must answer in proceeding with mopp analysis the commander can first estimate the work intensity required to perform the mission using table 21 as guide then based on knowledge of the environmental conditions table 22 daylight or table 27 night or shade can be used to provide guidance on workrest cycles that can sustain work over long time periods the guidance in that table assumes that the commander is unwilling to sustain more than minimal 5 percent heat casualties if the time constraints of the mission are incompatible with the workrest cycles predicted the commander can assess the impact of conducting the operation using continuous work for example few or rest breaks using table 24 daylight or table 29 night or shade in addition figures 22 and 23 graphically portray the impact of continuous work on the risk of expected casualties for mopp zero and mopp4 during daylight operations these figures provide leaders with estimates on how long unit can be expected to operate under varying work loads and temperatures without sustaining more than minimal 5 percent heat casualties for example in figure 22 heat casualties can be expected to occur after about 90 minutes if soldiers work continuously at moderate intensity in bdus with the wbgt at 85f for troops working under the same conditions but in mopp4 figure 23 indicates that the 217fm 34 218fm 34 219fm 34 unit can work for only 45 minutes before the risk of heat casualties exceeds 5 percent and for 60 minutes before the risk exceeds 20 percent environmental factors ask the following questions what is the ambient air temperature what is the humidity what is the wbgt index reading for the units ao is it cloudy or sunny is it windy is it day or night the ambient environmental conditions outside weatherinside vehicle must be known before beginning assessment of how these conditions will affect the soldiers ability to successfully complete mission make sure you have accurate weather information for your location check the weather daily variation in temperature wind and humidity can be substantial from region to region know what your weather will be leaders at all echelons should use and support the extensive weather forecasting resources described in fm 3481afm 1054 wbgt information can also be obtained from the s2 or staff weather officer swo see appendix for further information on operations in special environments most army guidance for prevention of heat injury and illness is based on wbgt readings fm 2110 the wbgt reading provides single measure of the major determinants of environmental heat stress for example air temperature wind speed solar load and humidity although the wbgt provides an adequate representation of the heat stress under most conditions it is not perfect and should be interpreted as approximate guidance for instance it was not optimized for conditions commonly seen in environmental extremes such as the desert guidance based on the wbgt is appropriate only for soldiers who are fully acclimatized optimally conditioned hydrated and rested additionally wbgt guidelines do not accurately forecast injuryillness rates under conditions of lower temperatures and high humidity such as may be experienced in the early morning hours humidity levels over 75 percent substantially increase the risk of heat injury under all work conditions other critical items of weather information for the ipb and mopp analysis are wind direction and speed when the air temperature is below skin temperature approximately 92f highwinds aid in the dissipation of body heat high winds also make use of chemical agents less effective and thus decrease the probability of their use all weather information should be current using tables based on wbgt readings the commander can better manage personnel resources and minimize the potential for heat casualties remember these tables are only guide and substitute for experience soldier factors ask the following questions are the soldiers well hydrated and nourished are the soldiers well rested are the soldiers heat acclimatized are the soldiers physically fit and well trained are the soldiers healthy the maintenance of full hydration is the most important factor influencing the work performance of soldiers wearing mopp in warm environments dehydration negates the advantages of heat acclimation and high physical fitness dehydration impairs the ability to regulate body temperature reduces mental and physical work performance and increases susceptibility to heat injuriesillnesses these adverse effects become increasingly dangerous as the level of dehydration becomes more severe even as little as 2 percent loss of body weight due to dehydration degrades performance leadership can minimize dehydration by establishing policy of enforced drinking using the guidelines given in tables 23 and 25 leaders can reduce the likelihood of inadequate drinking in mopp especially when masked by taking advantage of flexible masking policies mopp125 percent masked rotating masked and unmasked soldiers often the workrest and maximum continuous work time guidance provided in this chapter assumes that all troops are fully hydrated heat acclimatized physically fit and fully rested in those cases when the commander is aware that the assumptions of the guidance do not hold the estimates in the tables must be adjusted upwards or downwards depending on the situation dehydration has the greatest impact on performance but failure to meet the other factors will also impact upon thermoregulation and performance for instance going without sleep for more than 30 hours can impair ones ability to regulate body temperature and can reduce task performance 1 if the wet globe temperature wgt kit botsball nsn 6665011038547 is used correction procedure is required reference message sgpspsp 23 may 1990 wbgt 08 x wgt 02 x dry bulb where dry bulb may be measured by removing the dial thermometer from the wgt botsball and reading the air temperature after three minutes shading the sensor from direct sunlight 220fm 34 thus the performance degradation factors 15 for physical work and 25 for mental work may require upward adjustment on the other hand downward adjustment may be necessary in the cases of overtrained or experienced troops following are some examples performance time critical an engineer unit has been ordered to construct river crossing site to provide retrograde route for unit that is already contaminated and which is conducting rearward passage of lines the threat has employed persistent agent in the engineer units assembly point the crossing must be completed in two hours which will require the unit to work steadily at moderate work load in mopp4 in full daylight the wbgt is 75f the task normally takes 90 minutes to complete but the performance degradation factor for physical work cited above is known to be 15 multiplying the performance degradation factor by the normal time 15 x 90 the mopp4 time to completion is 135 minutes thus conducting the mission in mopp4 will take longer than the commanders guidance permitted adjustments required to meet the mission guidance could include schedule additional engineer units to complete the job augment the unit with additional manpower if the hazard of liquid contamination is low adopt lower mopp posture this may reduce the performance degradation factor and allow mission completion within the twohour target tolerance time critical extensive work estimated to take one hour in mopp is required to improve platoon battle position prior to possible enemy assault within the next two hours of full daylight the 1st and 2d platoons assembly areas do not require soldiers to operate in mopp but the 3d platoon occupies contaminated terrain that is vital to the units defense the terrain provides for shade the wbgt is 80f if the commander considers mopp4 for the 3d platoon review of table 22 indicates that workrest schedule is inappropriate workrest cycle is recommended for heavy work in mopp4 at wbgt reading of 80f and table 24 shows that continuous work of only 32 minutes would be possible before incurring an initial risk 5 percent of heat casualties this does not meet mission guidance but several options are available one alternative would be to relieve the 3d platoon with fresh unit after 30 minutes if this was not possible the tables do indicate that mopp zero would allow mission completion by 3d platoon however if the hazard was vapor only mopp1masked modified posture might provide balance between the risk of chemical and heat hazardswhile assuring mission completion review of table 26 indicates that if collective protection can be used to provide rest in the shade at temperature at or below 84f wbgt the troops can cool off sufficiently in 30 minutes to repeat the 32 minutes maximum work period rest under cooler conditions and at lower mopp level can be very effective in sustaining the pace of operations in an nbc environment to gain better appreciation of the risk of heat casualties in the 3d platoon the commander next refers to the graphic in figure 23 entering the bottom of the chart at 80f and reading up until the lower edge of the shaded area for heavy work is encountered the maximum work time for light 5 percent casualties can be noted on the right axis continuing upward along the 80f line to the limit of the shaded area the time at which 20 percent of the unit would be placed at risk for heat illness can be found at about 40 minutes the analysis indicates the combination of adopting mopp4 and working continuously at heavy work load will place greater than 20 percent of the unit at risk of becoming casualties to heat this risk must be balanced against the risk of becoming chemical casualty using the procedures in chapter 3 before deciding on an optimal mopp level for the 3d platoon the process is repeated for the 1st and 2d platoons very low mopp level is clearly indicated for these units and workrest cycle of 30 minutes work30 minutes rest although not ideal could be implemented to allow the work to be completed with minimal casualties and degradation if these units did not take any rest breaks any heat exhaustion casualties might not recover in the remaining hour even with complete rest and dehydration in the shade unless cooling systems and intravenous fluids were utilized heat casualties critical your platoon has been working at moderate intensity in mopp4 for 45 minutes under clear sunny skies hostilities are not imminent but the task is time sensitive the wbgt reading is 70f two cases of heat exhaustion have occurred in the past five minutes many others have slowed the pace of work using the graphic in figure 23 you determine the unit should have been able to work for an additional 15 minutes at this pace before casualties were noted you remember that one heat casualty is often quickly followed by many others realizing that the guidance in the figure is approximate and not absolute you call for rest break lack of adequate rest slight dehydration individual variance and an underestimate of the work intensity are among the potential explanations for the mismatch between guidance and reality if mission success depended on completion of the task you are 221fm 34 confident of the work intensity estimate and 20 percent casualty rate is deemed acceptable you can estimate the time remaining for work from figure 23 by first finding the point where the lower 5 percent limit of the shaded area crosses the 45minute line reading up from this point an effective wbgt of 85f you note that 15 minutes of work may be possible before the 20 percent casualty risk point is reached use of mopp guidance as stated before higher headquarters provides directives to each battalionsize element that will include mopp level and percentage of soldiers to be masked at all times subordinate units apply flexibility and initiative to this guidance to account for local conditions failure to do this exposes units to far greater hazards in the form of heat casualties direct fire losses and mission failures the following techniques are to be used by units in applying guidance received from higher commands to meet their needs once mopp1 or 2 is established by higher headquarters subordinate units may not downgrade from this level except for the following reasons units may temporarily reduce mopp levels to conduct decontamination operations such as mopp gear exchange soldiers inside enclosures may reduce mopp level at the discretion of the platoon leader or higher commander the enclosure need not be airtight but should be capable of protecting against the initial liquid hazard soldiers may reduce mopp for medical reasons including such things as foot care at the discretion of the senior leader present when possible complete on rotating basis increase mopp in response to direct threats only the protective posture recommended by higher headquarters is intended to provide an adequate level of protection against the assessed threat of chemical attack if your unit is at that recommended level then chemical attack will probably produce few casualties increasing your units protective posture will increase the time it takes to accomplish your units mission proper mopp levels based on the assessed direct threat will increase chances of victory increase your protective posture when encountering contamination or before entering an area that is believed to be contaminated for example go from mopp2 to mopp3 you should have soldiers mask if they are in downwind hazard area and they have not deployed detectors units should not increase protective postures simply to defend against perceived but unconfirmed chemical attack on their positionsbattalions and companies many decisions on increasing or modifying mopp posture are made at squad and platoon level squads and platoons frequently conduct independent operations therefore the unit leaders training and experience are essential to successful operations under nbc conditions directives received by platoons and squads will also indicate minimum mopp level and if needed percent of soldiers masked in some cases the guidance received by battalion will be passed unaltered down to squad level however in some circumstances battalion and company commanders may modify this guidance for example brigade guidance is for all units to assume mopp1 with 25 percent of soldiers masked the battalion commander has three maneuver companies two units are in defensive positions and one is moving to reserve position the commander knows that the two companies in defensive positions are well protected dispersed covered concealed from conventional munitions from ipb templating the enemy is expected to attack in our sector with regimentalsize force in supporting attack along two battalionsize avenues of approach within the hour the battalion commander anticipates that the greatest chemical threat to his two defending companies is the enemys potential use of lethal persistent agents therefore he decides to place his two companies in defensive positions at mopp225 percent masked he directs the rest of the battalion to be at mopp10 percent masked the unit moving into reserve position remains at mopp zero25 percent masked only until they have closed on the designated position the commander determined that speed was essential therefore he did not put the third company into mopp2 until they were at their position note in the above example that the battalion commanders modification results in fewer soldiers being masked than would have occurred if the brigade guidance had been followed exactly this is as it should be in this example the battalion commander understands the intent of the brigade commanders guidance understanding that intent he then applies sound tactical judgment to the situation in this case although fewer soldiers are masked those units most vulnerable are better protected the unit that is least vulnerable to chemicals but most vulnerable to other hazards is allowed to operate at maximum effectiveness both battalion and company commanders should implement guidance from their commander in way that provides greater protection to their most vulnerable units and allows maximum effectiveness for their units that most require it units should try to mask percentage of soldiers close to that directed by brigade but should the 222c2 fm 34fmfm 119 tactical situation dictate modification sound judgment must prevail avoid issuing guidance that uses unworkable masking percentage figures platoon leader can easily implement guidance to mask 33 percent or one in three of his soldiers guidance to mask 21 percent of the platoon presents obvious unnecessary problems platoons and squads these units implement guidance from higher headquarters immediately upon receipt and in some cases without modification unit soldiers will attain the appropriate mopp level and establish rotation schedule that ensures that the proper percentage of soldiers are masked sleeping soldiers are not included as part of this percentage for example squad has ten soldiers three of which are sleeping it is directed to mask 25 percent of its soldiers which means that two of its seven soldiers need to mask this posture will be maintained unless one of the following events occurs if the unit detects the presence of chemical hazard soldiers will automatically mask and attain mopp4 as soon as possible if the unit witnesses chemical attack or there are indications one has occurred then the unit will mask and attain mopp3 and mopp4 as rapidly as possible units in downwind hazard area will mask if they have warning system in place units may unmask whenever they become involved in direct fire engagement if chemical weapons have been used or contamination hazards exist this can be done as long as some soldiers are unmasked at the time that the engagement begins units that masked due to being in downwind hazard area may unmask if collocated alarm systems have not sounded for example an armored unit is advancing within downwind hazard area its crews are masked but the unit has alarms mounted on their upwind vehicles none of these alarms have sounded when an enemy force is encountered this unit may unmask to better tight the battle units may unmask when it is essential to mission accomplishment for example an infantry platoon has been directed to attain mopp2 with 50 percent of soldiers masked this platoon is preparing to defend against an enemy force expected within the hour these preparations are going slowly and efforts to speed the work are frustrated by the high protective posture the soldiers are becoming exhausted the platoon leader has his unit unmask during this time he requires all soldiers to drink water he issues instructions and discusses his battle plans with unmasked soldiers who can now hear and speak clearly after 10 minutes he has 25 percent of the platoon mask the unit is less fatiguedas only one in four soldiers is masked higher work rate is maintained as the most laborintensive tasks are completed squad leaders order masking for 50 percent of their personnel alarms for unit defense chemical agent alarmsdetectors area critical element of units chemical defense without them unit cannot be alerted and cannot detect chemical agents until symptoms appear once chemical warfare has been initiated alarmsdetectors of some type must either already be in use or ready to be used the alternative is to have the unit mask there are numerous types of chemical agent alarmsdetectors available to soldier and unit this equipment provides them with that nbc defense necessary to ensure adequate prior warning the m8a1 chemical agent alarm is unique in that it is the only automatic chemical agent alarm presently available that provides unit with an early warning capability of possible vapor hazard nerve agents only employment techniques and procedures are discussed in detail in fm 33 additional chemical agent detectors are discussed in further detail in chapter 1 once soldiers are under attack it is important to warn others of the hazard early warning gives others more time to react this additional time saves lives and increases mission effectiveness the following rules apply when giving the alarm give the alarm as soon as an attack or hazard is detected use an alarm method that cannot be confused easily with normal combat signals or sounds all who hear or see the alarm must repeat it swiftly throughout the unit because of its limited range supplement the alarm over radio and telephone nets the four types of signals for warning personnel of an attack are vocal sound visual and audiovisual personnel should warn others using one or combination of these signals vocal the spoken word vocal alarm signal is the first way of informing troops of an nbc hazard or attack the vocal alarm for any chemical or biological hazard or attack is the word gas the person giving the alarm masks first and then shouts gas as loudly as possible everyone hearing this alarm immediately masks and then repeats the alarm the vocal alarm for the arrival of radiological contamination in unit area is the word fallout the first soldier to detect the arrival of fallout will usually be radiological monitor operating radiacmeter at the unit command post cp when this radiacmeter records an 223c2 fm 34fmfm 119 increase in dose rate to 1 centigray per hour or higher the monitor should immediately alert unit personnel using this warning should relay the warning to others and take cover immediately sound sound signals reinforce the vocal alarm to warn of the imminent arrival or the presence of nbc hazards sound signals consist of succession of short signals the following are examples rapid and continuous beating on any metal object or any other that produces loud noise succession of short blasts on vehicle horn or other suitable device an interrupted 10 warbling siren sound and vocal alarms in situations in which the sound is lost because of battlefield noises or in which sound signals are not permitted the standard handandarm signal for nbc hazards consists of the following steps put on the protective mask extend both arms horizontally sideways with double fists facing up move fists rapidly to your head and back to the horizontal position repeat as necessary visual and audiovisual if the automatic chemical agent alarms are in operation detected agents will trigger visual and auditory alarm unit the person who sees or hears an alarm signal from the alarm unit immediately masks and augments this signal with the vocal signal radiotelephone operators who hear the vocal signal immediately mask and relay the signal over the unit radio and telephone nets personnel reinforce this signal with other sounds or visual signals unmasking procedures unmasking procedures should be conducted after all available methods of agent detection have failed to indicated any agent unmasking should be conducted as soon as possible to alleviate soldiers encapsulation as quickly as possible the following two unmasking procedures will determine if unmasking is safe unmasking procedures using the m256series chemical detector kit the m256series chemical detector kit does not detect all agents therefore use an unmasking procedure also even if the detector is available these procedures take approximately 15 minutes after all tests with the kit 224including check for liquid contamination have been performed and the results are negative the senior person should select one or two soldiers to start the unmasking procedures if possible move to shady place bright direct sunlight can cause pupils in the eyes to constrict giving false signs of nerve agent exposure it is prudent to have the selected soldiers disarm before instructing them to unmask the selected soldiers unmask for five minutes reseal and clear their masks observe them for ten minutes if symptoms appear it is safe to give the all clear signal and unmask continue to watch the soldiers for possible delayed symptoms always have firstaid treatment immediately available in case it is needed unmasking procedures without an m256 chemical detector kit if an m256series kit is not available the unmasking procedures take approximately 35 minutes find shady area use m8 paper to check the area for possible liquid contamination when reasonable amount of time has passed after the attack the senior person should select one or two soldiers the selected soldiers take deep breath and break their mask seals keeping their eyes wide open for about 15 seconds they then clear and reseal their masks observe them for ten minutes if symptoms appear the selected soldiers unmask for five minutes and then remask if symptoms appear in ten minutes after remasking everyone can unmask continue to observe the selected soldiers in case delayed symptoms develop in both cases if soldiers display symptoms of agent poisoning ensure firstaid treatment is available and provided if agent is still present the senior person present must make decision of selecting one of these options move to new area and retest if mission dictates that movement cannot be conducted retest can be conducted after one hour use collectiveprotection equipment if available filter exchange criteria filter exchange criteria for all nbc filters in the inventory from the mask filters to the filters on the simplified collectiveprotective equipment scpe are based on design physical condition climatic conditions and the possible threat agent that could be employed information in the following paragraphs addresses peacetime transitiontowar and wartime exchange criteria peacetime when assessing filter exchange criteria several factors must be considered commanders and nbc personnel must monitor replacement schedules for piecesc2 fm 34fmfm 119 of nbc equipment having filters peacetime exchange criteria for all filters is one year or when the following conditions are applicable physical damage occurs filters have become water loggedwet high resistance to airflow is observed directed by higher headquarters listed as unserviceable in sb 3302 transition to war commanders will determine when their units should remove their training filters and replace them with filters from unit contingency stocks this guidance should be reflected in an sop or order factors for filter exchange consideration are unit location unit readinessdeployability alert status last filters exchange threat time available and stocks available for example forward deployed unit commander based on an enemy chemical capability in thearea of operation directs by sop that his unit install its contingency set of filters alternatively conus based unit commander determines that the basis for installing contingency filters would occur upon an increase in unit alert status for deployment to an area with an nbc threat before initiating filter exchange leaders consider the implications for their units some considerations are mission what is the unit mission enemy what is the current nbc threat assessment is our unit likely to be attacked on arrival in the operational area terrain where should filters be exchanged at home station enroute or in the operational area time when should filters be exchanged when will there be adequate time to exchange filters troops available do we have the right people available to conduct the exchange 225zc2 fm 34fmfm 119 wartime the decision to change filters is driven by two considerations the amount of chemical agent the filter has been exposed to and the time the filter has been exposed to the atmosphere these separate considerations are based on the two mechanisms by which the filter provides protection from chemical agents for all agents the filter uses mechanical filtration and absorption as the protection mechanism additionally for blood agent ck the filter uses chemical reaction the chemical reaction mechanism is degraded by prolonged exposure to ck and the absorption capacity by exposure over time to air particularly hot humid air see table 211 based on these factors the following filter changecriteria applies in an area of operation with chemical attacks confirmed and ck threat change filters annually in an area of operation with chemical attacks confirmed and ck threat change the filters iaw table 211 for units that have received chemical attacks change all filters every 30 days information available to the commander to confirm that his unit has been attacked with chemicals would include alarms from chemical agent detectors positive results from the m256 series chemical agent detector kit or soldiers experiencing chemical agent symptoms 226fm 34 chapter 3 chemical vulnerability assessmen t and force protectio n this chapter addresses vulnerability assessment and force protection at the tactical level brigade through corps and its integration into the staff estimate process the assessment provides units with an estimate of the probable impact of enemy chemical attacks on their force using this estimate commanders can help reduce the risks associated with enemy chemical weapons use and maximize force effectiveness under nbc conditions the vulnerability assessment is primary means through which the chemical officer participates in the battlefield assessment process in the assessment the chemical officer develops information for integration into the various staff estimates from the s2 the chemical officernco obtains the following information but is not limited to time periods of interest weather and terrain data threat chemical delivery capabilities threat chemical weapons efficiency information threat courses of action and intent named areas of interest nais and target areas of interest tais summary of enemy activity including any nbc attacks from the fire support officer fso the chemical officer obtains information on casualty percentages from friendly and threat conventional munitions examples of information may include casualty percentages based on target sizes casuahy percentages based on weapon system these are just some of the things that the chemical officer might require from the other staff elements to be able to provide the commander with chemical vulnerability assessment the commanders information needs from the chemical vulnerability assessment include as minimum any reports or threat nbc attacks higher headquarters nbc defense guidance minimum mopp automatic masking mopp gear availability impact of degradation on mission performance anticipated chemical casualties and how long persistent agents will remain as hazardany other pertinent information will just enhance the assessment for the commander coordinating staff officers with the chemical officers assistance use this information to assess the viability of friendly coas and to decide upon appropriate risk reduction actions the chemical officer uses the assessment to support the decisionmaking process in areas such as the development of the concept of chemical defense for example mopp guidance or chemical unit mission priorities the simplified data provided by the assessment is also useful in providing the commander information on the enemy chemical capability completion of this assessment requires use of tables and graphs contained in this manual these items were designed to accomplish two purposes first to provide commanders and staffs with an estimate of the likely effects of enemy chemical strikes and second to provide leaders with simple rapid process to support vulnerability assessment on fastmoving battlefield because of rapidly changing situations units may modify andor supplement estimates to increase their use under local conditions and to incorporate experience gained through combat the emphasis on simplicity should remain constant at battalion level and below leaders use mopp analysis see chapter 2 discussion to conduct their vulnerability assessment leaders determine the appropriate protective posture for their soldiers based on the threat and the mission this chapter is divided into two parts assessment procedures and integration of the results into operational plans to achieve appropriate levels of force protection these procedures apply to brigadelevel and higher units at these levels there is more information available and time to evaluate and incorporate applicable information into oplans this assessment process results in better synchronization of the battlefield operating systems bos such as fire support intelligence command and control mobility and survivability the assessment of chemical vulnerability supports synchronization through improved preparedness for various contingencies such as chemical attacks improved unit mobility through more pragmatic 31fm 34 approach to mopp guidance and improved tactical decision aids to support the commanders information needs the end product of the assessment process is information addressing the likely effects of enemy chemical attacks within an ao during specified time periods this assessment can be conducted prior to or after enemy initiation of chemical warfare depending on the commanders concept and the needs of the staff the assessment can be highly detailed or very brief such as few lines of information the assessment process addresses casualty effects estimates times and locations vulnerable to chemical downwind hazards chemical barriers and persistency conduct the assessment in two parts first make an estimate of the threats capability to employ chemical munitions in our forces ao within specific time period second use this information to generate simplified effects information the remainder of this second section provides detailed howto information on how to conduct this analysis see figure 31 for an overview of the assessment process estimat delivery capability determine time periods of interest time periods of interest are determined based on the commanders concept of the operation and the factors of mettt the time period of interest is determined by the chemical officer after coordination with the g2g3 sections they will normally conform to phases or the expected duration of an operation however it may oftenbe desirable to use other criteria for example light infantry unit may want to use the expected time lag between an anticipated enemy chemical attack and the needed arrival of their protective gear as the time period of interest time period could also be based on factors relating to enemy tactics for example the expected time of arrival of secondechelon force further significant weather changes could also influence the selection of time periods the time period of interest can range from 6 to 48 hours the vulnerability assessment process is generally conducted in support of the planning process and not in support of current operations brigade planning window usually focuses on 12 to 48hour period and as rule time periods of 24 hours or greater are generally used where possible based on the ipb time periods of less then six hours are usually not used for shortterm actions shorter time periods could be used to estimate the effects of initial enemy preparation fires or to estimate the effect of single chemical attack associate weather data with each time associate each time period with temperature wind speed and stability category all required information can be obtained from the chemical downwind message cdm the cdm is generated every six hours and originates from corps and division nbccs based on information obtained through the us air force weather service aws swo or fleet weather service temperature will impact primarily on agent persistency for each time period temperature should be expressed as one of the following 550c 500c 400c 300c 200c 100c 00c 100c 200c or 30c determine temperature by taking the average of the temperatures from each cdm line applicable to the time period of interest use this average temperature for all calculations except for one condition when estimating persistency for agents expected to last beyond the time period of interest use the average daily temperature of the day in which the attack occurred wind speed will impact on casualty production persistency and downwind agent travel it should be expressed as one of the following 3 6 9 12 15 or 18 kmph as rule of thumb for any wind speed above 18 kmph use 18 kmph calculate wind speed in the same manner you used above for temperature in some situations it may be necessary to modify this number for casualty estimate purposes for example if 24hour period contains six hours of expected high wind speeds very unstable conditions you will probably elect to disregard those figures and 32fm 34 develop separate lower average for casualty estimation the chemical officernco estimate that an enemy would not employ chemicals for casualty effects during that sixhour period of high winds base your decision on whether or not to do this on the magnitude and duration of the wind change and the expected enemy coa stability categories also affect casualty production and downwind agent travel however their impact is minor compared to temperature and wind speed expressed as stable inversion neutral or unstable lapse determine the stability category in the same way as temperature and wind speed other environmental factors exist that could impact on the assessment for example terrain and vegetation could affect the estimate however these factors have been incorporated in the persistency estimate process estimate delivery capability estimate the number of chemical munitions likely to be employed in your ao for each time period coordinate with the s2g2 to produce this estimate the chemical officer will provide the s2g2 with the time periods of interest the s2g2 can upon request produce information concerning the threats capability to deliver chemical munitions in your ao the estimate should indicate the number of delivery units by type and the number of rounds by agent types if available the s2g2 also provides estimates on when where and what type of agent the enemy will use in your units ao if the situation or event template does not yield needed information assume that the enemy can optimize his agent mix for example to determine the threats capability to create contamination barriers we assume they will fire all persistent agents likewise to predict casualty effects assume that the enemy will fire agents that have the greatest casualtyproducing effects when the primary threat is covert or unconventional express enemy delivery capability in terms of agent weight or as agent weight times some expected delivery means for example 205kg hd fieldexpedient land mines if threat estimates indicate limited agent supply it will be difficult to estimate how much of that supply will be used each day as an option for this situation conduct the assessment for single enemy attack based on the threats maximum employment capability during the selected time period the s2g2 will consider number of factors in making his estimate the number of employment assets within range of your unit 0ther aos the enemy assume that every deliveryforce must service do not system within range will befiring into your ao the locations of enemy chemical munitions threat forces capability to deliver chemical munitions to the firing units impact of threat attach on civilians the s2g2 estimate should provide range of numbers based on estimated threat coa for each time period for example the estimate should provide the enemys maximum capability and its likely delivery capability alternatively different estimates can be provided that would support various enemy coa estimates should not be based on friendly coa unless they would significantly impact on enemy delivery capability it is not necessary to assess every possible situation and enemy option to do so would result in inefficient use of available time the goal is to provide estimates to the commander and staff which can be later refined continuously assess the situation and look for events and options with the potential of changing the outcome of the battle generat effects information at this point you have set of time periodmunition delivery estimate combinations for each of these combinations you can now develop set of effects information casualty estimates contamination barriers persistence and times and locations of downwind agent effects effects information will provide the following estimates casualty effects ten 100meter by 200meter targets can be attacked so that troops masking within 15 seconds will suffer 10 percent casualties contamination barriers four 200meter by 400meter areas can be contaminated to level sufficient to prevent crossing persistence particular contaminated area can be crossed in mask and summer uniform in four hours it may be occupied in summer uniform possibly without mask in nine hours downwind agent effects subdivide each time period of interest into phases that correspond to specific chemical downwind hazard effects estimates likely to occur during that phase these procedures do not address the effects of specific attacks these procedures assist units in determining based on their ao and weather information periods of high or low risk from chemical attack to determine the effect of specific attack refer to fm 33 the procedures are brief unclassified and generic with respect to both agent type and delivery system they were designed for use by multiple theaters and levels of command and for applicability across the entire 33fm 34 operational continuum determine casualty effects tables 31 32 and 33 provide casualty estimates as function of temperature and agent delivered expressed in kilograms per hectare kgha they are valid for wind speeds less than 20 kmph other factors such as air stability category humidity variations in wind speeds under 20 kmph and delivery errors were found to have minimal effect on casualty estimates for given time period of hours as opposed to specific instance in time figure 32 outlines the procedures for determining casualty estimates step 1 determine the target size of interest based on ipb select targets that an enemy would target and then determine target size for example determine the area occupied by maneuver company in defensive position use intelligence data concerning enemy targeting methods and priorities at this point for example if it is known that our infantry companies are treated as 400 x 600 meter target by the enemy then that is the target size that should be used b calculate the number of hectares in the target size of interest for example given 1 hectare 10000 meters square target size 400 meters x 600 meters 240000 meters squaredetermine the number of hectares in the target area number of hectares 240000m2 in the target area 24 10000m2 number of hectares in the target area 24ha step 2 determine agent of interest the nerve agent table table 31 is based on 15 liter per minute breathing rate rest or light work and 15second masking time for tgd or vx the persistent agent table table 32 is based on mopp level zero at higher mopp levels for example mopp levels 1 to 4 tgd and vx are not effective casualty producers because of the skin protection provided by the overgarment the blister agent table table 33 applies to all blister agents table 33 is based on either mopp level zero or 1 unless it is known which agents the threat will fire assume that the most effective casualtyproducing agent in the threat stockpile will be used for example if an enemy can use gb tgd or vx assume the threat will use gb if the threat has both gb and hd assume they will use gb step 3 determine casualty level of interest estimate threat courses of action and intent coordinate with the s2g2 to estimate whether the threat attacks would intend to destroy suppress or harass our forces casualty level of interest estimates using percentages such as 25 percent or 30 percent suppression provide an example of this steps application note soviet categories of target damage include destruction destroyed target has completely lost its combat effectiveness point target is considered destroyed when there is 90 percent probability that it has suffered serious casualties or damage an area target is considered destroyed when it is highly probable 90 percent that less than 50 percent of the targets subelements including personnel or less than 50 percent of the target area have suffered serious casualties or damage suppression suppressed target has suffered sufficient damage or casualties to lose its combat effectiveness temporarily or to restrict its ability to maneuver or effect command and control an area target is considered to be suppressed when it is highly probable 90 percent that less than 25 to 30 percent of the targets subelements or 25 to 30 percent of the targets area or personnel have suffered serious damage or casualties harassment harassment fire is conducted sporadically to prevent troop movement in the open and to lower the morale of the enemy 34fm 34 step 4 determine the number of rounds required to achieve the desired casualty level assume mopp zero for all calculations unless otherwise indicated b refer at this point to tables 31 32 or 33 locate the appropriate temperature and read down until you reach casualty figure higher then the determined casualty level of interest read to the left to find the number of rounds per hectare required to produce that casualty level c multiply the number of rounds per hectare by the number of hectares in the target for example given casualty level wanted is 30 target size 24 present temperature is 500f from table 31 extract the following information casualty level 37 weapon system 152mmagent gb rounds per hectare 6 rds rounds required per x total number hectares in the target is equal to total number of rounds required for example 6rdsha x 24ha 144rds to achieve greater than 30 percent casualties on the target the enemy would have to fire 144 rounds of 152mm artillery note thd is effective at temperatures down to 300c 200f step 5 optional estimate casualties produced by specific unit of fire if intelligence analysis indicates the enemy will engage specific target with specific number of rounds calculations can be performed to estimate the expected casualties on the target for example required determine casualty percentage based on specific unit of fire for persistent nerve agents given target area 24ha agent gb temperature 500f weapon 152mm artillery intelligence estimates the enemy will fire 240 rounds at friendly target determine the number of rounds per hectare for the desired casualty effect 35fm 34 1 of rds 240rds 10rdsha target area 24ha 2 using table 32 find 10rdsha and read right to find the casualty percentage based on the 500f temperature casualty percentage 50 b to determine blister agent casualties use the same procedures as described before and table 33 however when reading right to determine casualty percentage use mopp zero or 1 rather than temperature the above procedures depict an estimated enemy capability to attack target andor estimate of casualties if the attack occurred to estimate the duration of hazards resulting from an enemy attack see the section on mopp openunmasking guidance determine downwind hazards the purpose of this section on vulnerability assessment is to identify times and locations of vulnerability or relative safety from downwind hazards during designated time period use the cdm as your basic tool during this process also use the ipb weather and terrain analysis to determine such things as prevailing winds and type of terrain this assessment does not focus on specific chemical attacks but identifies potential times and locations of high or low risks from chemical attacks hazard prediction for specific chemical attacks is contained in fm 33 two primary hazards result from downwind agent travel casualties and degradation downwind agent travel can affect large portions of the force due to the triggering of alarm systems activation of alarm systems will cause units to mask degradation effects are also enhanced by large area coverage of chemical agent concentrations casualties resulting from downwind hazards should be very few assuming units make proper use of alarm and warning systems for the vulnerability assessment use the cdm to determine whether your unit would fall into one of the following three conditions see fm 36 for stability categories high casualty risk this occurs at wind speeds of 10 kmph or less during stability categories of 5 to 7 table 34 agent clouds will produce very narrow 1 to 4 kilometers wide at 30 kilometers distance and very long beyond 20 kilometers hazard clouds dosages over 100 times the lethal levels are possible in the hazard area because the cloud is narrow and hugs the ground it may bypass alarms deployed for area defense units located close to the attack mask once they are warned since the potential dosages are too high to be completely mitigated by unit alarm systems units further away can be warned only and stand good chance of being unaffectedhigh degradation risk this occurs during stability categories of 4 or less and wind speeds less than 10 kmph agent clouds will produce wide hazard areas 2 to 7 kilometers wide at 6 kilometers distance with lethal effects rarely extending as far as 10 kilometers the casualty risk to warned unmasked personnel is low however due to the large cloud width it is possible for every unit in the downwind hazard area to be forced to mask for several hours alarms may be triggered at distances of 20 to 30 kilometers away low casualty risk this occurs at wind speeds of 10 kmph or greater at stability category 4 or less the casualty risk is very low outside the area of immediate effects see fm 33 for downwind hazard prediction significant number of units will be forced to mask however this effect will be short lived and will not extend as far as in the previous category 2 to 7 kilometers the example on the next page shows how all the information obtained can be incorporated into the assessment other information can be included and will be discussed later in the chapter this is only an example and can be modified to best suit the using command standard mopp gear and fieldexpedient items standard mopp gear is used as the primary protection means against liquid droplets however fieldexpedient items such as ponchos and rain jackets also can provide initially for period of only minutes adequate protection against the initial casualty effects of the liquid droplet component of chemical agent attack if the following two conditions are met then casualties resulting from the chemical attack will be less than an equivalent conventional attack soldiers are at mopp1 or wearing fieldexpedient covering that covers all exposed skin except the face hands and feet this fieldexpedient covering must be disposed of within 20 minutes units take protective action against chemical agent vapor by immediately masking while effective in protecting against initial liquid 36fm 34 effects fieldexpedient items are inadequate if an enemy of sporadic small scale chemical attacks or when force engages in sustained chemical warfare fieldexpedient items do not allow units to fight dirty or operate in contaminated environment for extended periods of time soldiers will suffer higher sublethal agent dosages if they remain in fieldexpedient gear too long fieldexpedient overgarments cause significant degradation to our soldiers for example heat stress operating for long periods while in fieldexpedient items also greatly increases the risk of the soldier becoming chemical casualty fieldexpedient protective gear provides shortterm protection if the threat assessment indicates low risk of chemical agent use fieldexpedient protection gear readily available provides limited backup for the overgarment fieldexpedient items must be quickly replaced by overgarments when the threat assessment indicates the enemy has the capability to employ chemical weapons the use of fieldexpedient items is an option during the period between enemy first use and delivery of standard mopp equipment to subordinate units however if unit is attacked with chemicals the delay in the receipt of mopp gear would result in unacceptable casualties to unit personnel fieldexpedient gear could also be used during periods standard mopp equipment has been expended use of nbc reconnaissance asset s battalion and higher units use nbc recon and chemical agent alarms as part of the ipb process and for unit operations the chemical officer assists the s2g2 in developing nais that relate to enemy chemical attacks based on threat doctrine likely chemical targets can be identified that support various threat coa for example brigade identifies potential avenues of approach for each of these avenues of approach likely threat countermeasures are identified threat doctrine calls for potentially restricting the use of lateral routes with chemical barriers to preclude our timely movement of forces also the detection of chemical barriers along one of our avenues of approach can indicate that the threat could be trying to channelize our forces identification of nais along routes for potential chemical attacks helps determine enemy intentions and speeds our response to threat chemical attacks if chemical attack was reported in such an nai our force 37fm 34 could send recon assets to determine the extent of the contamination and identify bypasses if necessary decontamination engineer or smoke assets can be dispatched to assist in reducing and concealing the obstacle finally the commander can be alerted that his counterattacking force may be delayed in reaching its attack position possibly requiring him to begin his movement earlier than desired monitor nais with combination of chemical alarms and units chemical units in the area units in these areas should report the occurrence of chemical attacks or of large scale artillery barrages that impact in their vicinity position chemical alarms at key points along the route to cover areas not occupied by units if an area cannot be continuously monitored dispatch nbc reconnaissance assets to the area once the threat reaches an nai that indicates they are committing to certain avenue of approach consideration is given to area defense against downwind vapor hazards for example threat chemical attacks may occur upwind of your unit by remaining aware of unit situations and weather data you can determine whether your unit is at low or high risk see fm 33 cdms to devise plan conduct map reconnaissance to determine likely wind patterns based on the terrain and wind direction locate troop concentrations upwind where an enemy can deliver chemical munitions select line between these two locations verify the wind directions in this area by survey of units in the area finally position some means of detection along this line casualty estimatio n the s1g1 assesses the probability and impact of chemicalrelated casualties this assessment addresses whether net increase in casualties will result from enemy chemical use liquid chemical attacks artillery or bomb on our units see figure 33 will create an uneven spread of contamination some portions of the targeted area will not receive any contamination applying the nbc defense principles of contamination avoidance protection and decontamination for our units provides several benefits using contamination avoidance techniques and procedures to disperse harden or camouflage friendly positions decreases vulnerability use of active measures such as nbc reconnaissance and nbc warning and reporting provides detection and identification to determine the presence of clean or contaminated areas units maximize use of nbc protection for key facilities and personnel prioritize use of nbc collective protection capabilities units coverselected high priority stocks and establish priorities for decontamination efforts if units are wearing protective gear and masks according to doctrine then net increase in casualties should result due to threat indirect fire however increased casualties will result from the following units in mopp3 or mopp4 are less effective in forceonforce battles this effect is most pronounced if the enemy operates in an undegraded posture increased direct fire casualties will probably also result from this degradation soldiers operating in contaminated areas will make errors thereby increasing their risk of becoming casualties increased heat stress casualties can occur if units in mopp3 or mopp4 are worked past the endurance limits described in chapter 2 heat casualties are likely with proper precautions heat stress should be kept to minimum psychological casualties are likely to increase because of encapsulation soldiers may show symptoms associated with chemical agents such as runny nose and eye irritation and believe it is result of chemical agents the effects of the above factors are difficult to predict without the benefit of combat experience chemical overgarment risk assessment leaders conduct mopp analysis to determine what protection level eg mopp 0 mopp1 etc should be used decisions are made based on an analysis of mission threat and the risk commander is willing to accept for example some commanders in southwest asia during operation desert shield made an initial decision that their units should go to mopp1 and don their initial set of contingency overgarments subsequently they had to decide when to replace these 38c2 fm 34fmfm 119 materials or vehicle parts chemical contamination may be detected initially when using chemical detectors remember going to mopp open or unmasking is command decision mopp open procedure mopp open is used to reduce heat stress and prolong soldier endurance when in mopp3 or mopp4 mopp open is used if the vapor on skin has decreased to the ict5 risk level but the inhalation andor liquidonskin risk remains above icts the worst case mopp open times are given in tables 36 39 311 312 314 and 316 local weather conditions may permit going to mopp open sooner procedure with cam designated personnel must survey the suspected contaminated area with the cam since the cam is designed as point detector multiple readings must be taken in and around the unit area select areas for sampling that were most heavily contaminated during the attack or lowlying areas where agent vapor may linger if cam readings are three bars or less go to mopp open if personnel show any signs of chemical agent poisoning they should go to mopp4 if meteorological conditions change use the cam to recheck the unit area as described above see table 35 for allowable mopp open times based on cam readings procedure without cam designated personnel must check the area for vapor hazard using the m256series chemical agent detector kit if m256 testing indicates positive reading for blister or nerve agent going to mopp open may exceed the ict5 risk level mopp open should not be used due to the vaporonskin ict5 risk unless mission accomplishment is jeopardized if the m256 results provide negative reading initiate action to go to mopp open and unmasking procedures if unit personnel show any symptoms of chemical agent poisoning go to mopp closed using worst case mopp openunmasking time tables the information in the tables provides planning estimates for unmasking and mopp open times for chemical agents gagf hd vx and tgd the worst case unmasking times are given in tables 37 310 313 315 and 317 tables 38 and 311 are combination of mopp openunmasking times figure 35 depicts mopp openunmasking decision flow chart for commanders to use with the mopp analysis process the times in the tables assume constant weather conditions if the weather condition changes use the following procedures to update time estimates read the worst case time from the current weatherconditions directly from the appropriate table keep track of how long the current conditions last until the next weather update when weather conditions change determine the percentage of the original worst case time remaining remaining time divided by original time determine the new worst case time for the new weather conditions multiply percent of original worst case time remaining by the new worst case time the results are the updated worst case time example the contamination is hd on sand with initial weather conditions of 90 unstable temperature gradient and 010 kmph wind speed from table 310 sand the worst case unmasking time is 53 hours b two hours later the weather changes to higher wind speed 1124 kmph percent worst case unmasking time remaining is 53253 096 c from table 310 the worst case unmasking time for the new weather conditions is 25 hours d the updated worst case unmasking time is 25 x

worst case unmasking time for the new weather conditions is now 48 hours g the updated worst case unmasking time is 48 x 075 36 hours h repeat the above procedures whenever the weather changes until

extending the wear of the cpog beyond 14 days is an option for the commander but insufficient information is available from testing to provide an estimated risk of injury or incapacitation associated with extending cpog wear beyond 14 days the heavy impregnation of charcoal in the lining of the cpog serves to continue to provide protection for the soldier against exposure to liquid chemical agents the chemical protection provided by the cpog is superior to that provided by any other type of field expedient protection such as wet weather gear in summary the bdo and cpog are both well designed

information in this section is intended to assist the commander staff and chemical staff officernco in nbc defense planning efforts concerning mopp openunmasking times for agents gagf gd gb and hd at high temperatures specifically it provides chemical officers and ncos means of estimating the allowable mopp open times based on cam readings and the worst case length of time unit may have to remain in mopp closed andor masked the term mopp open as mentioned in chapter 2 means opening at mopp 34 the overgarment jacket and rolling the for ventilation to decrease soldierprotective mask hoodheat stress the term mopp closed involves the use of till protection at mopp4 additionally the tables serve as tool for commanders and staffs to use in conjunction with mopp open or unmasking procedures furthermore the information in the tables may be used to support commanders decisions on weighing the risk of chemical casualties against degradation due to time in mopp these charts should be used in conjunction with the mopp analysis process and the commanders judgment on how well his soldiers can tolerate degradation in mopp4 following are examples if the tables indicate an agent will take too long to weather based on the commanders estimate of his units ability to fight degraded he may consider moving to clean area andor request decontamination if contamination is encountered he may use the tables to support his decisions on whether to go through or bypass the contaminated area the worst case times in the charts are based on the highest contamination levels from threat use of chemical weapons and bare skin exposure toxicity data an attacked unit area will most likely have lower levels of contamination and most soldiers will be wearing some clothing beneath their bdos the worst case times given in this section are upper time limits periodic monitoring will provide feedback on when the hazard in particular area has weathered enough to allow mopp open andor unmasking the estimates in these tables are based on the time required for given agent to weather to an acceptable risk level that is more than 5 percent incident of mild incapacitation due to vapor on skin andor inhalation if soldiers open mopp andor unmask at the stated time this risk level is abbreviated as ict5 safety based on the mopp status currently in effect the mopp level may have to be upgraded if soldiers undertake tasks that may disturb such things as soil 310c2 fm 34fmfm 119 materials or vehicle parts chemical contamination may be detected initially when using chemical detectors remember going to mopp open or unmasking is command decision mopp open procedure mopp open is used to reduce heat stress and prolong soldier endurance when in mopp3 or mopp4 mopp open is used if the vapor on skin has decreased to the ict5 risk level but the inhalation andor liquidonskin risk remains above ict5 the estimated wait time before executing mopp open procedures are given in hours at the ict5 risk level on tables 36 through 317 local weather conditions may permit going to mopp open sooner procedure with cam designated personnel must survey the suspected contaminated area with the cam since the cam is designed as point detector multiple readings must be taken in and around the unit area select areas for sampling that were most heavily contaminated during the attack or lowlying areas where agent vapor may linger if cam readings are three bars or less go to mopp open if personnel show any signs of chemical agent poisoning they should go to mopp4 if meteorological conditions change use the cam to recheck the unit area as described above see table 35 for allowable mopp open times based on cam readings procedure without cam designated personnel must check the area for vapor hazard using the m256series chemical agent detector kit if m256 testing indicates positive reading for blister or nerve agent going to mopp open may exceed the icts risk level mopp open should not be used due to the vaporonskin ict5 risk unless mission accomplishment is jeopardized if the m256 results provide negative reading initiate action to go to mopp open and unmasking procedures if unit personnel show any symptoms of chemical agent poisoning go to mopp closed using worst case mopp openunmasking time tables the information in the tables provides planning estimates for unmasking and mopp open

34fmfm 119 318fm 34 chapter 4 nuclear protectio n this chapter discusses aspects of nuclear protection that can be accomplished before during and after nuclear attack enemy or friendly soldiers on the battlefield must make defensive preparations to protect themselves soldiers nbc defense training is extremely important as is the use of terrain and shelter terrain use by knowing how terrain affects nuclear weapons soldiers can greatly reduce the risk of becoming casualties with training and practice they can learn to recognize defensive positions that will give them optimum protection against nuclear blast hills and mountains reverse slopes of hills and mountains give some nuclear protection heat and light from the fireball of nuclear blast and the initial radiation tend to be absorbed by hills and mountains what is not absorbed deflects above the soldiers because of the slope depressions and obstructions the use of gullies ravines ditches natural depressions fallen trees and caves can reduce nuclear casualties see figure 4l however predicting the actual point of an enemy attack of nuclear weapon is almost impossible friendly strike provides the soldier more time to prepare the best protection remains an area below ground with some sort of overhead cover obscuratio n in an active nuclear environment or when the threat of nuclear weapons use is high smoke can be used to attenuate the thermal energy effects from nuclear detonations chemical smoke units can provide this asset to commander if they are available for further information on the application of smoke on nuclear battlefield see fm 350 actions before an attack the actions taken before an attack are most critical because they will increase the units survivability to the greatest possible extent these actions range from selecting the right shelters fortifying those shelters and protecting vital equipment to using equipment to increase survivability these actions and good priorplanning will increase unit survivability shelter selection whenever the tactical situation permits prepare unit defensive positions these vary from individual fighting positions to improved defensive positions in nuclear environment fighting positions and improved positions 41fm 34 protect against nuclear effects primary concern should be shielding from gamma and neutron radiation gamma radiation protection requires thick layers of dense or heavy shielding material examples are lead iron and stone on the other hand light hydrogenbased material gives good neutron radiation protection examples are water paraffin and oil these materials absorb neutrons and additional gamma radiation results shielding must be provided against this secondary radiation generally the thicker the layers of each type of shielding material the better the overall radiation protection the next paragraphs discuss protection against nuclear effects foxholes digging in provides the best nuclear defense this is because earth is good shielding material wellconstructed fighting position gives excellent protection against initial nuclear effects it can also reduce residual radiation fallout figure 42 shows examples of fighting positions that give good protection soldiers must harden their foxholesfighting positions against the blast wave as time permits lining or revetting foxholes can significantly increase survivability and decrease the size of the opening into the position smaller openings allow entry of less initial and residual radiation however many metal surfaces are good thermal reflectors cover these surfaces to prevent increased danger of burns from the heat of nuclear blasts the smaller the foxhole opening the better most of the gamma radiation in the bottom of foxhole enters in through the opening the smaller opening of oneperson foxhole reduces gamma radiation two to four times below the amount twoperson foxhole allows to enter deep fighting position or foxhole gives more radiation protection than shallow one it places greater thickness of shielding material or earth between the occupants and the nuclear detonation therefore it provides greater reduction of initial radiation from entering the hole in twoperson fighting position radiation reduces by factor of two for each 16 inches of foxhole depth therefore fighting position at depth of 4 feet provides six to eight times the protection than shallow one thermal radiation can reach soldiers in foxholes by lineofsight exposure or by reflection off the sides use dark rough materials to cover potential reflecting surfaces and as protective cover for soldiers and equipment examples are wool such as blankets and canvas such as shelter halves remember that thermal exposure may still bum or char these materials avoid direct contact with them do not use ponchos or other 42fm 34 rubber or plastic materials alone as foxhole covers these items might melt and cause burns simply covering foxhole with ordinary metal screening material blocks the thermal radiation by about 50 percent use this screening for thermal protection without entirely blocking soldiers view through ports soldiers must cover exposed portions and they must keep low keeping low reduces thermal exposure just as it reduces nuclear radiation exposure fieldexpedient overhead cover an overhead covering of earth or other material reduces exposure to thermal and initial nuclear radiation and fallout overhead covering helps prevent collapse it also provides missile protection beware of poorly constructed overhead cover the cover must be strong enough to withstand the blast wave figure 43 shows some examples of good fieldexpedient overhead cover use ushaped metal pickets timbers or certain fabrics and overlay them with sandbags or earth ammunition boxes filled with earth also make good cover in constructing effective overhead cover remember the following choose dense covering materials cover in depth provide strong supports cover as much of the opening as possible vehicle provides expedient overhead cover simple and fast method is to drive vehicle over the top of foxhole figure 44 heavy armored vehicle is better than wheeled vehicle of course being inside an armored vehicle is even better as with any type of overhead cover initial radiation can still enter the fighting position through the earth sides or the openings in the sides of the vehicle between treads road wheels and tires if time allows use sandbags to cover these openings remember the vehicle is not good neutron shield also the blast wave may violently displace the vehicle and collapse foxhole earthshielded positions wellconstructed fighting positions and bunkers can provide excellent protection against all effects of nuclear detonation radiation is still the greatest concern though because of its great penetrating power radiation scatters in all directions after burst most however travels directly in lineofsight route from the fireball it is important that as much earth cover as possible be placed between the soldier and the burst the more earth cover the better the shielding table 41 illustrates the value of increasing amounts of earth shielding from hypothetical freeinair dose an open fighting position gives protection factor of eight it blocks most of the 43fm 34 lineofsight radiation and allows only fraction of scattered radiation to enter each added 6inch thickness of overhead earth cover reduces the scattered radiation by factor of two flat earth cover of an underground shelter protects much better than an equivalent thickness of cover on similar aboveground structure this is because the underground lineofsight thickness is greater see figure 45a second layer of sandbags gives more protection to fighting positions each layer of sandbags if filled with sand or compacted clay reduces the transmitted radiation by factor of two table 42 shows the payoff for adding layers of sandbags for hypothetical freeinair dose of 2400 cgy sand or compacted clay gives better radiation shielding than earth because it is denser each layer of sand or clayfilled sandbags can give up to 66 percent 44fm 34 more radiation protection than the same thickness of soil or soilfilled sandbags for example table 41 shows that 12 inches of earth gives protection factor of 24 100 cgy for hypothetical 2400 cgy dose and table 42 shows that 12 inches three layers of sand or clayfilled sandbags gives protection factor of 64 38 cgy for the same dose generally heavier sandbags protect better than lighter ones avoid cracks between sandbags to prevent radiation leakage neutron radiation can be stopped water delays and absorbs neutrons but since some gamma radiation is given off in the process dense shielding is still required damp earth or concrete protects from both forms of radiation for example only 12 inches of concrete or 24 inches of damp earth reduce neutron radiation exposure by factor of 10 wet sandbags achieve reduction factor of two for every 4inch layer other expedient neutronshielding materials include containers of water fuel or oil remember that radiation scatters in all directions and shielding must provide allaround protection protect sandbags from exposure to thermal radiation sandbags can burn and spill their contents which can then be moved more easily by the blast wave cover sandbags with small amount of earth andor sod see figure 46 to eliminate this problem covering sandbags also enhances camouflage and provides valuable additional conventional fragmentation protectionbuildings certain types of buildings offer excellent shelter from nuclear hazards and require minimum of time and effort to adapt for use choose buildings carefully the stronger the structure the better the protection against blast effects the strongest are heavily framed buildings of steel and reinforced concrete the worst choices are the shedtype industrial buildings with light frames and long beam span even wellconstructed frame houses are stronger than the latter figure 47 shows some examples of typical structures that provide good protection ammunition storage bunkers also give exceptional protection these are usually large enough for most vehicles and equipment many european rural and urban structures can provide good protection many types of preworld war ii european buildings provide good blast and radiation protection examples are farmhouses churches and municipal buildings see figure 48 for typical european rural and urban structures that provide such protection characteristics to look for include the following preworld war ii design and construction these have thick fullspan floor and ceiling beams heavy roofing tiles dense reinforced walls and in most cases full basement full basements constructed of concrete or stone make sure there is an exit directly to the outside as well as through the upper floors in case of emergency thickwalled masonry structured thickness of 36 45fm 34 centimeters greater than 1 foot is an indication of walls are wet these features include diagonal supports good preworld war ii wall construction in areas and clockworks particularly southern germany where construction buildings with the least amount of glass european details are typically concealed by stucco finish desirable windows and doors typically are protected by rollup or features underneath are noticeable when the outside folding shutters these coverings provide some 46fm 34 additional blast and thermal protection shielded building is best exterior rows of buildings in closely arranged groups towns shield buildings in the interior these shielded structures suffer less blast overpressure and structural damage than exposed structures however debris and rubble problems and fire hazards may increase toward the center of town commanders should consider using shelters located two or three rows of buildings from the edge of town to avoid serious hindrance to postattack maneuver soldiers should get belowground level the basement because it is below ground provides increased blast protection and much more lineofsight radiation protection than aboveground floors this additional protection results from the surrounding earth fill add additional radiation protection by placing layer of earth or sandbags on the floor above this additional dead weight will be significant and may require shoring up the floor alternately more protection can be gained by sandbagging smaller shelter in the basement such as sturdy table without increasing the possibility of the entire floor collapsing block windows with sandbags and enhance the radiation protection and structural strength of any aboveground exterior walls by piling dirt and sandbags against the walls generally speaking soldiers can reduce radiation by factor of 10 in basements as compared to levels in aboveground floors positions inside of the building can make difference if sufficient time is available to properly prepare it on floors above ground the center of the building offers the greatest protection from both initial and residual radiation below the ground the corners of the building give the greatest protection in either case the dose to prone soldier would be about onehalf the dose to standing soldier the lesson here is to seek shelter in an underground structure and lie in corner if an underground shelter is not available lie in the center of shelter under sturdy table see figure 49 other options include lying inside fireplace under stairway or in bathroom where the plumbing and relatively close spacing of walls might provide increased structural strength tents tents are not preferred shelter against the effects of nuclear weapons personnel routinely conducting activities in tents such as medical maintenance and supply personnel are particularly vulnerable tent does provide some protection it initially provides good thermal radiation protection the secondary fire hazard is serioushowever and in most cases the blast wave will not blow the smoldering tent far enough away to prevent damage and injury from subsequent fires you can increase protection inside the tent if the situation requires continuing operations in tentsuch as may be the case for some field hospital situationsachieve some degree of protection by piling dirt and sandbags as far up the sides of the tent as possible lying on the floor is still the safer profile for personnel and may be preferable for bed patients tent offers essentially resistance to blast winds ensure that equipment and glassware are secure all loose pieces of equipment such as small instruments chairs clipboards and bottles will be propelled by the blast and can cause serious injuries beware of tent pole breakage broken and splintered tent pole can cause serious injuries piling sandbags around the center pole gives some additional support it also helps ensure enough clearance to the ground to allow soldiers to evacuate the smoldering tent after the initial flash armored vehicles armored vehicles give good nbc protection in most situations tanks provide the best vehicular protection available lightly armored vehicles also give good protection these vehicles include infantry fighting vehicles armored personnel carriers selfpropelled artillery and some heavy engineer equipment if time is available improve this protection with any of the 47fm 34 following seven actions get as low as possible inside an armored vehicle crew members normally elevated in tank turret should get on the floor of the armored vehicle this applies to the tank commander gunner and loader assuming such low position reduces the radiation received by factor of four keep all hatches shut obviously an open hatch will expose the crew unnecessarily to explosion effects it could also subsequently allow the entry of fallout particles and scattered gamma radiation close any other openings such as the main gun breech prevent injury while inside an armored vehicle the blast wave will throw soldiers violently about inside an armored vehicle wear combat vehicle crew cvc helmet or kevlar helmet with chin strap secured to help prevent head injuries secure all loose equipment inside the vehicle the force of the blast can throw about unsecured loose equipment inside the vehicle such as tools weapons and helmets and cause injury or death dig in armored vehicles hull defilade or place them in trenches or cuts in roadways see figure 410 this provides some limited lineofsight radiation protection and considerable blast protection hull defilade fighting position or trench that allows half of the vehicle sides to be covered can reduce gamma radiation by as much as factor of two use sandbags as radiation shielding single layer of sandbags placed on top of tank turret or armored vehicle hull provides valuable overhead gamma shielding each layer of sandbags reduces the gamma radiation by factor of two wetting the sandbags enhances the neutron radiation shielding and protects thesandbags from thermal damage although blast damage is generally least for headon orientation rearon orientation may be preferable this places the mass of the vehicles engine between the potential radiation source and the crew this rearon orientation can reduce potential radiation exposure to half that of headon or broadside exposure at distances above the median lethal dose to the crew in rearon orientation significant damage to the tank is not expected wheeled vehicles avoid using wheeled vehicles as shelter generally wheeled vehicles provide little or protection from the effects of nuclear explosions worse still they are particularly vulnerable to overturning this exposes drivers and passengers to increased risk the percent of casualties from blast effects is dramatically greater for personnel in wheeled vehicles than for those in the open see table 43 the percent of casualties expected from radiation is the same for both soldiers should protect themselves as much as possible inside vehicles if they must accomplish missionessential activities such as communications command and control in wheeled vehicle they should wear their kevlar helmets with chin straps secured this precaution helps prevent head injuries if the vehicle is overturned secure all loose equipment inside the vehicles inadequately secured equipment such as weapons radios desk file cabinets field safes racks and generators can tip over or slide across van floor and cause serious injuries such items can also be thrown to 48fm 34 the ceiling and cause injuries when the vehicle turns over tying down blocking and bracing the equipment will help plan for and prepare adequate field shelters immediately adjacent to facilities that require soldiers to continue operations in wheeled vehicles parking the vehicle inside or under shelter gives some protection to soldiers inside existing or natural structures such as ammunition bunkers underpasses tunnels and caves are in this category aircraft ground operations revetments give little protection against blast overpressure however revetments and barricades protect aircraft from damage by dynamic wind these also protect aircraft from other hazards such as the impact of rocks sand and other aircraft or aircraft debris the tactical situation may require revetting for protection from conventional weapons blast and fragmentation damage use overhead cover for aircraft if it is available close doors and windows against damaging overpressure these openings expose the compartment interior to damaging thermal radiation tiedowns can reduce damage from tumbling of the aircraft generally tiedowns do not produce excessive stress on tiedown points aircraft plexiglass windows shatter into fragments this can happen at low blast overpressure 15 pounds per square inch when there is other significant damage tape the edges and the centers of windows this reduces the extent of fragmentation and the nuisance fragments may cause to cockpit operations electromagnetic pulse prior to an attack where enough warning has been given to the soldiers commanders must ensure that any electronic equipment such as radios and computers is turned off and protected electromagnetic pulse emp is the highenergy short duration pulse similar in some respects to bolt of lightning generated by nuclear detonation it can induce current in any electrical conductor and temporarily disrupt or overload and damage components of improperly protected or unprotected electronic equipment transient radiation effects on electronics tree and emp are discussed in fm 33actions during an attack nuclear attack indicators are unmistakable the bright flash enormous explosion high winds and mushroomshaped cloud clearly indicate nuclear attack an enemy attack would normally come without warning initial actions must therefore be automatic and instinctive dropping immediately and covering exposed skin provide protection against blast and thermal effects immediate actions an attack occurring without warning is immediately noticeable the first indications will be very intense light heat and initial radiation come with the light and blast follows within seconds time to take protective action will be minimal if exposed when detonation occurs soldiers should do the following immediately drop facedown log large rock or any depression in the earths surface provides some protection close eyes protect exposed skin from heat by putting hands and arms under or near the body and keeping the helmet on remain facedown until the blast wave passes and debris stops falling stay calm check for injury check weapons and equipment damage and prepare to continue the mission soldiers in foxholes can take additional precautions the foxhole puts more earth between soldiers and the potential source of radiation they can curl up on one side but the best position is on the back with knees drawn up to the chest see figure 411 this bellyup position may seem more vulnerable but arms and legs are more radiationresistant and will protect the head and trunk store bulky equipment such as packs or radios in adjacent pits if they prevent soldiers getting low in their foxholes or place these items over the face and hands for additional radiation and blast protection soldiers inside shelters should take protective actions blast wave can enter the shelter with great force and the debris it carries can cause injuries lying facedown on the floor of the shelter offers worthwhile protection however soldiers should avoid the violent flow of air from doors or windows lying near wall appears safer than standing away from wall near wall reflection may increase the pressure wave this is better though 49fm 34 than risking being blown out and injured by the blast constructing baffles or turns in shelter entrances can prevent overpressure buildups and entry of dust and debris see figure 412 nuclear casualties blast thermal radiation and nuclear radiation all cause nuclear casualties except for radiation casualties treat nuclear casualties the same as conventional casualties wounds caused by blast are similar to other combat wounds thermal burns are treated as any other type of burn first aid cannot help radiation casualties these casualties will be referred to medical facilities that can handle them actions after an attack protection must not stop when the attack ends immediately after an attack soldiers must check for radioactive contamination and then must reduce the hazard with basic soldier skills decon decontaminationtechniques to reduce radioactive contamination are to brush scrape or flush radiological contamination from surfaces as minimum unit personnel cover foxholes and shelters and radiac operators begin continuous monitoring covering the mouth with handkerchief reduces the contaminants entering the lungs this method is generally preferable to masking to avoid trapping contamination in the mask filter for the commander posts trike actions include damage assessment and restoration of combat power nuclear effects in special environment s the effect of nuclear attack in different geographic and climatic environments is very distinguishable the effects of terrain and weather on the use of nuclear devices may cause special problems for commanders having to operate in these extremes appendix discusses these conditions in further detail 410c2 fm 34fmfm 119 chapter 5 biological protection this chapter discusses aspects of protection that must be accomplished before during and after biological attack an enemy force could use biological weapons or toxins anywhere on the airland battlefield therefore protection against biological agents could apply to both our close and rear operations protection against biological agents and toxins employed against soldiers begins long before the actual attack happens biological agents enter the body through the skin respiratory tract and digestive tract key preparations begin with personal health maintenance followed by nbc defensive training which all soldiers must master leaders conduct defensive planning against possible biological agent attack units prepare sops that specify their biological defense techniques and procedures enemy capabilities and intent are continuously assessed to determine whether an enemy might use biological agents disease has been part of the human experience throughout the centuries and has tong been problem in time of war and peace affecting both military and civilian populations often accounting for more casualties than conventional weapons actions before an attack preparations before an attack can be accomplished long before biological attack happens personal health maintenance and realistic training are just few ways in which the commander can minimize his biological casualties personal health maintenance all soldiers and leaders must adhere to the basic principles of good health this applies especially under nbc conditions soldiers must continually follow these basic principles such as uptodate immunizations good hygiene area sanitation and physical conditioning so unit efficiency will not suffer severe degradation uptodate immunizations immunizations reduce the chances of soldiers becoming biological casualties many diseases uncommon in the united states such as cholera and plague are prevalent in other parts of the world proper immunizations protect against many known diseaseproducing biological agents all soldiers receive basic immunizations medicalpersonnel periodically screen these records and keep them up to date if soldiers or units deploy to areas in which specific diseases are prevalent readiness preparation may include receiving additional immunizations for needed protection this prophylactic inoculation should be part of the ipb process and needs to be brought to the commanders attention medical and technical intelligence can also furnish information to support assessments recommendations may be finished on needed precautions andor medications that are needed prior to deployment during times of peace or war good hygiene soldiers should protect against the spread of disease by practicing good health habits the best defense against biological agents is good personal hygiene keeping the body as clean as possible this means not only washing the face and hands but also all parts of the body particularly the feet and exposed skin hands need to be cleaned before meals or anytime bare hands are used to help ingest food and liquid or when smoking soldiers should brush their teeth and they must shave shaving may seem unimportant in the field but it is required to achieve proper seal of the mask this is important because biological agents and toxins are usually most effective when received via the respiratory system or the skin small nicks scratches and cuts are unavoidable in field situation germs either naturally occurring or intentionally employed as biological agents enter these breaks in the skin and will cause infections if left untreated soldiers should clean any breaks in skin with soap and water followed by firstaid treatment area sanitation another good way to stop the spread of disease is to keep the area clean bury all empty ration packets and residue locate construct and use field sanitation facilities properly latrine facilities should include soap and water for washing of hands latrines need to be cleaned daily avoid leaving such facilities open and make sure they are properly filled and marked before moving to help prevent accidental digging in the areas control of insects preventing spread of field sanitation may 21101 and rodents is also essential in disease additional information on he found in fm 2110 and fm 51c2 fm 34fmfm 119 physical conditioning good physical condition requires maintaining the body in wellrested wellfed healthy state good physical fitness program will get soldiers in good shape and also increase their emotional health soldiers should get as much exercise and rest as the situation permits and they must remember to eat properly good eating habits will help sustain the soldier if they keep healthy their bodies will be better able to tight off germs high level of physical fitness also reduces the likelihood of heat stress when mopp gear is worn for extended periods physical and emotional energy levels will be high prior to any action but can quickly decrease if the soldier is not in good physical condition continuous operations will require that soldiers learn to sleep in short naps and in mopp3 or mopp4 this is also part of the conditioning process it may also become necessary for soldiers to eat smaller portions at more frequent intervals training to missionessential task list metl tasks in mopp4 supports physical and emotional conditioning do not conduct physical training pt in mopp4 safety constraints dictate sound judgment which the commander must weigh nbc defense training the complexity of the airland battlefield requires commanders to train their units to live work and fight in contaminated environment nbc training must be fully integrated into all areas of unit training individual and collective unit that is welltrained and wellequipped is much better prepared to operate successfully leader training is especially critical to unit readiness individual training small unit leaders are the key to effective training of our soldiers leaders must know their soldiers capabilities and capacities starting with basic training and continuing throughout their military careers soldiers learn practice and train to perform individual nbc survival tasks leaders are directly responsible for reinforcing these tasks through continuous training thereby instilling soldier confidence these survival tasks are in stp 211smct leaders should master the nbc knowledge and skills required of them as contained in stp 2124 or stp 21111 mqs collective training unit nbc ncos and officers must provide guidance and help develop training programs for their units the guidance must include long and shortrange attainablegoals unit army training and evaluation programs arteps will indicate tasks that are to be accomplished under nbc conditions units must train to standard those nbcspecific tasks that are found in the arteps units will be severely hampered in mission execution if they have not prepared for operations under nbc conditions units train to standard based on their metl leaders must plan and conduct tough training in support of their metl and under realistic conditions including operations of critical collective tasks under nbc conditions actions during an attack if threat forces attack with biological agents there may be little or warning this will depend on the s2s and your ipb assessment we cannot detect or identify biological agents with our currently fielded detector kits and systems soldiers in unit automatically mask when there are high probability indicators of an attack to protect themselves against contamination biological attack indicators biological agents may be disseminated as aerosols liquid droplets or dry powder biological attack indicators fall into two groups to indicate high probability or possible attack high probability attacks with biological agents will be very subtle if favorable weather conditions prevail symptoms can appear from minutes to days after an attack has occurred indicators may be the following mysterious illnessmany soldiers and civilians sick for unknown reasons large numbers of insects or unusual insects large numbers of dead wild and domestic animals mass casualties with flulike symptoms fever sore throats skin rash mental abnormalities pneumonia diarrheas dysentery hemorrhaging or jaundice possibility indicators of possible biological attack are any of the following artillery shells with less powerful explosions than he rounds aerial bombs that pop rather than explode mist or fog sprayed by aircraft or aerosol generators unexploded bomblets found in the area immediate actions putting on the protective mask and keeping the clothing buttoned up protects adequately against living biological agents but an agent can gain entry through clothing using two routes one openings such as button holes zipped areas stitcting and poor sealing at 52c2 fm 34fmfm119 ankles wrist and neck and two through minute pores in the fabric of clothing putting on ones protective ensemble greatly increases the protection level of the individual soldier toxins however require the same amount of protection as liquid chemical agents since rapidwarning biological agent detection device is fielded consider any known agent cloud as chemical attack and take the same actions prescribed for chemical attack for collective protection personnel must be housed inside shelter with an efficient air filter system many buildings can be converted into temporary shelters if cracks are carefully sealed and filter system with ventilating mechanism is installed chapter 6 discusses different collectiveprotection systems that provide the needed protection it must be emphasized that in order to counter biological attack protective measures must be initiated before an attack the use of the nbcwrs is an effective and established means for giving advanced warning along with intelligence data provided by the intelligence community actions after an attack actions after biological attack include taking samples with the m34 m256series or cbask and identifying casualty by the symptoms they exhibit and treating those symptoms early recognition of symptoms and their treatment will increase recovery time and hopefully decrease fatalities it is necessary to isolate soldiers showing symptoms of disease this isolation helps prevent possible spread to others if the disease is communicable it is also necessary to limit the number of personnel providing care to these casualties treatment of live biological agent or toxin casualties requires medical assistance as soon as possible an indication of live biological agent attack is large number of soldiers and civilians with unexplained illnessover short period the threat also has wide variety of toxins these can be dispensed alone or with other carriers or agents symptoms associated with some toxins mimic other illness or chemical casualty symptoms toxin symptoms may include any of the following dizziness mental confusion or double or blurred vision tingling of skin numbness paralysis or convulsions formation of rashes or blisters coughing fever aching muscles and fatigue difficulty in swallowing nausea vomiting andor diarrhea bleeding from body openings or blood in urine stool or sputum spit shock these symptoms appear in minutes or hours after the toxin attack soldiers should decontaminate immediately after toxin attack they should either wash with soap and water or use the m258a1 or m291 decon kits appropriate selfaid and buddyaid vary depending on the agent soldiers first mask to prevent inhaling or ingesting agents they then should remove agents from exposed skin observe each other for early symptoms of toxic exposure and request medical assistance operation in special environments biological protection must be considered when operating in different weather and terrain environments biological agents and toxins will be altered depending on where they are employed appendix discusses several types of special operations and how biological agents or toxins affect operations in those environments 53c2 fm 34fmfm 119 chapter 6 collective protectio n collective protection is required to provide safe environment for soldiers to carry out tactical functions such as medical care command control and communications without being restricted by wearing nbc protective clothing collectiveprotection equipment cpe is integrated into some weapon systems to increase their effectiveness in an nbc environment planning for collective protection should be an integral part of plans for the airland battlefield commanders must examine and accurately plan for the additional manpower and logistics needed to operate in collectiveprotection mode collective protection does not replace mopp gear it only allows the commander to reduce mopp levels while in contaminated environment collective protection can provide relief from mopp4 for eating rest and hygiene understanding entryexit procedures will greatly impact on the effective use of collectiveprotection systems types of collective protection cpe provides protection to group of individuals under nbc conditions that permits relaxation of individual nbc protection under nbc conditions cpe allows soldiers to function effectively cpe comes to unit aseither component of piece of equipment or as toe asset this includes equipment such as the m51 shelter and the m20 scpe used together these systems enhance units capability to perform its mission in an nbc environment there are four basic types of cpe vent ventilatedfacepiece overpressure hybrid and total systems table 61 see table 62 for the advantages and disadvantages of each system ventilatedfacepiece system ventilatedfacepiece systems supply filtered air to the protective mask canisters both the m25a1 and m42 masks of combat vehicle crew members and the m24 and m43 aircrew protect ive masks the systems are assigned as gpfus and are rated by their airflow capacity in cubic feet per minute the currently fielded systems are given in table 63 except for the m13a i gpfu the components of these systems are similar the filtered pressurized air supplied to individuals extends the mopp gears capabilities it reduces breathing resistance through masks and it aids in sweat evaporation in addition it can provide warm air to facepieces in cold weather 60fm 34 overpressure system an overpressure system is an enclosure of pressurized purified air gas and particulate filters remove any nbc contamination from the air the system does not protect against gamma radiation or neutrons the air pressure precludes leakage of contaminated air into the enclosure personnel enter and exit through protective entrance this entrance is anair lock and it prevents contamination from entering the enclosure overpressure systems for fixed sites are discussed in detail in fm 341 m51 shelter system the m51 shelter is trailermounted system figure 6l it features an overpressure and environmental control system the shelter is predominately used by battalion aid stations and other medical units it can also be used as temporary rest and relief shelter m20 simplified collectiveprotection equipment the scpe provides cleanair shelter for use against chemical and biological warfare agents and radioactive particles figure 62 it is lightweight and mobile and it allows unit commanders to convert existing structures into protected command control and operations centers just as the m51 the scpe can be used as temporary 61fm 34 rest and relief shelter for example as break area for personnel working in heavy maintenance and supply operations or as command and control center it provides contaminationfree environment in which 10 soldiers can work eat or rest without the encumbrance of the ipe the m20 can be erected without the liner using only the protective entrance and blower compartment places such as bank vault or warehouse freezer are examples of where an m20 without liner can be placed any cracks or holes will need to be sealed in the doorway bib section is available that will fit between the protective entrance and the frame of any door and when taped down seals the entrance from outside contamination entry and exit restrictions remain the same for guidance on maintenance and parts of the scpe see tm 3424028812p modular collectiveprotection equipment modular cpe provides positive pressure nbc protection to variety of vans and shelters the system includes variety of equipment consisting of gpfus protective entrances and various installation kits figure 63 an example of mcpe application to weapon systems includes mounting on wheeled or tracked vehicle on the m292 expandable van or on series of vans linked together figure 64ventilated race mask inside the enclosure with the option of using the positive pressure the ventilated face mask or both the system can be used during closedhatch positive pressure operations or openhatch ventilated face mask operations figure 65 during openhatch operations the positive pressure reduces the amount of vapor contamination that enters if contamination enters the system helps purge the interior of toxic vapors see figure 66 for components of the hybrid system total system hybrid system combines with some form of environmental control to make total system figure 67 this system reduces heatstress casualties however it increases the logistical burden primarily because of maintenance the mla1 abrams main battle tank has total system during closedhatch operations the system provides positive pressure and crew cooling during openhatch operations the system will provide cool filtered air to the ventilated facepiece and cooling vest before initiating openhatch operations soldiers must be masked before exiting the mia1 tank to prevent any possibility of chemical agent exposure additionally the system provides modest overpressure that significantly reduces the amount of contamination infiltrating the crew compartment consequently the time required to purge contamination is reduced associated equipment collectiveprotection associated equipment includes cooling and alarm systems and protective entrances cooling systems cooling reduces heat stress in soldiers operating in extremely hot andor humid conditions mopp gear significantly increases the potential for heat stress making cooling systems desirable the two basic types are crew compartment and individual crew hybrid system the hybrid system provides protection for personnel in combat vehicles vans and shelters the system combines positive pressure and 62fm 34 63i fm 34 compartment cooling provides air conditioning to the compartment individual cooling is more effective when used while mopp gear is worn the choice of cooling system depends on the vehicle type and primary mission the next generation of combat vehicles will provide individual and compartment cooling systems collectiveprotection alarm systems unit toe chemical detection equipment and warning assets provide area warning to unit positions these assets will also provide warning to occupants of collectiveprotection systems dedicated alarms are particularly useful for systems that must operate alone and away from supporting units unless an alarm is provided carry out full entry andor exit procedures whenever anyone enters andor exits even if an alarm is available occupants must conduct internal monitoring this can be less frequent than when there is known external hazard protective entrances protective entrance provides an interface between the contaminated environment and the protected enclosure it enables shelter users to remove contaminated clothing and perform decontamination procedures providing relatively clean environment before entry into the shelter in contaminated environment overpressure systems not having protective entrance air lock must minimize contamination entering the enclosure they must establish drills and procedures for this purpose these systems are usually on smaller s250type shelter systems and combat vehicles an example is main battle tank weight and space constraints make an air lock unfeasible system without an air lock consists of clean shelter area only during liquid or vapor chemical attack the system must remain closed and soldiers must not enter or exit opening the doors allows contamination inside and the crew must assume higher mopp level until the interior is purged or decontaminated the disadvantages of systems without an air lock emphasize the need for an air lock in contaminated environment an air lock prevents contamination from entering the enclosure the air lock is pressurized and contamination is eliminated through the use of filtered air air pressure in the entrance is slightly less than that in the protective enclosure but slightly more than outside pressure air passing through the air lock purges contaminants that might enter during entry or exit of personnel or equipment this air comes from the protective enclosure the filter unit or both different protective entrance configurations create variations of the overpressure category these variations are thosewith single air lock and those with twostage air lock single air lock in most cases vans and shelters modified for collective protection use singlecompartment protective entrance an example is the m12 protective entrance figure 68 this variation consists of the clean shelter area and an air lock figure 69 before entering the air lock from contaminated area personnel must remove their mopp gear except gloves and mask minor exposure to chemical agent vapor is possible between overgarment removal and entrance into the air lock clothing tends to absorb any chemical agent vapor in the atmosphere during this brief exposure the amount of agent absorbed depends on agent concentration in the atmosphere length of exposure type of agent type of clothing exposed and climatic conditions the air purge in the air lock flushes out the contaiminated air brought in it also reduces the amount of absorbed agent on clothing before the soldier enters the protective shelter after soldier andor piece of equipment enters the protective shelter monitoring ensures hazardous levels of agent were not carried inside twostage air lock adding contamination control area c ca to single airlock system creates twostage air lock figure 69 entering soldiers remove mopp gear in the cca this affords better control of the liquid and vapor hazards of entry and exit integral protective entrances 64fm 34 integral protective entrances are designed to offer improved accessibility more convenient storage and transport and reduced setup time there are two types of integral protective entrances internal and external integral protective entrances are smaller than the detachable protective entrances and require less airflow during the purge cycle the integral protective entrance and the shelter door are provided as single bolt assembly integral protective entrances are currently designed for the s250 and s280 shelters internal integral protective entrance deployed internally the integral protective entrance can remain in its functional configuration and need not be stowed for transport since it is contained within the shelter it is much less vulnerable on the battlefield figure 610 external integral protective entrance the external integral protective entrance is used for shelters that cannot sacrifice the internal space figure 611 the selfsupporting integral protective entrance must be stowed for transport fieldexpedient collective protection the unventilated shelter is the only type of fieldexpedient collective protection such shelter has very little value because of the lengthy setup time and rapid depletion of usable oxygen wide variety of structures may be made into unventilated shelters such variety makes specific instructions difficult generally the effectiveness depends largely on the tightness of the seal the shelter must be airtight and all openings must remain sealed as long as the hazard exists because sealing creates stagnant air supply inside the shelter occupancy is limited to relatively short period 65fm 34 collectiveprotection planning providing for collective protection should bean integral part of plans for the airland battlefield protective environment allows soldiers to carry out technical functions without the burden of mopp gear also soldiers need protective environment where they can seek relief from mopp gear in addition logistics manpower and other considerations enter into the planning for collective protection collectiveprotection uses avoiding or displacing from contaminated terrain is desirable neither is always possible it may be necessary to cross occupy or remain in contaminated terrain otherwise the enemy could channel our movement and deny us key terrain features that could give our forces tactical advantage every unit is equipped trained and conditioned to fight under contaminated conditions when the mission requires however individual efficiency and morale may decrease with time and at some point relief from wearing mopp gear is necessary the best relief method is rotating contaminated soldiers to known clean area even in the worst situations clean areas exist rotation is the least costly in terms of manpower and logistical support however the tactical situation may preclude displacement or rotation to clean areas these situations require collective protection collectiveprotection systems like mopp are flexible flexibility allows the commander to maintain balance between mission capability and nbc survivability the commander must consider the threat mission tactical environment and type of collective protection in assessing specific situation the commander must decide if the reduced mopp levels and relief are worth the additional logistics and manpower burden for fixedsite collectiveprotection planning see fm 341 logistics commanders must plan for supplies maintenance including filter replacement and transportation to support collectiveprotection systems supply adequate supply planning is key element in effective use of collectiveprotection systems these systems are not supply intensive however operation of such systems requires continuous resupply of consumable and expendable items included are items that provide means of contamination avoidance such asrain gear ponchos and plastic bags these will keep liquid contamination away from the overgarment survival under nbc conditions could depend on these items therefore it is not question of merely maintaining special purpose collectiveprotection supplies it is matter of obtaining needed quantities of existing supplies arrange to have supplies to support extended operations of shelter kept inside the shelter if possible plan for the needed supplies and stockpile them before an attack as minimum these supplies should include protective clothing expedient contamination avoidance items decon kits detector kits and filters these will allow shelter users to conduct an exchange provide adequate food and water if the shelter will operate for long periods within the contaminated area if the shelter requires fuel ensure it is requisitioned and stored if the system has an external power supply store fuel outside and away from the shelter plan for supplies to maintain operation of personnel in the shelter these supplies include pens paper batteries and parts maintenance in most cases maintenance of collectiveprotection systems is minimal at organizational levels most systems have little or operators maintenance other than be fore during and afteroperation checks and services operators may need to reset circuit breakers or perform system startup procedures at the unit level maintenance is usually limited to troubleshooting and removal andor replacement of major components or major subassemblies changing expended or contaminated filters is the most significant maintenance task during gpfu operation soldiers in charge of protective shelters must be aware of the need for replacing filters both the gas and particulate filters require periodic replacement gas filter the useful life of gas filter decreases as operating time and exposure increase as the filter removes contaminants from the air its residual capacity decreases long exposure to moisture also decreases filter capacity for removing chemical agents gas filter life expectancy varies it depends on the size and design of the collectiveprotection hardware to determine when to replace gas filter the shelter attendant or another responsible soldier must maintain log of the filter unit operation then soldiers should change gas filters according to the systems technical manual in general new filters can withstand several chemical attacks in most cases missions of 48 to 72 hours can be accomplished in contaminated environment without filter change given this capacity filter change during periodic unit maintenance is often advisable soldiers should change filters with the same criteria they use for 66fm 34 mask filters see chapter 2 coordinate filter change operations with the unit chemical nco particulate filter within the gpfu particulate filter collects radiological contamination and other particles from the air such accumulation on the filter does not decrease its filtering efficiency it does decrease the airflow because of the increase in resistance in most cases this increase in resistance is very gradual it is unusual for the airflow resistance to increase to level that affects the flow rate appreciably personnel should replace this filter at the same time they replace the gas filter or when the system drops below the minimum overpressure level specified in the systems technical manual contaminatedfilter disposal filters do not decontaminate or neutralize contamination they merely collect and contain it therefore contaminated filters are hazardous replacing and disposing of these filters require care to prevent hazard to personnel or spread of contamination burning does not destroy radiological contamination therefore soldiers should bury filters contaminated with radioactive particles depth of burial depends on the radiation intensity and soil conditions generally burial under 3 feet of packed earth is adequate this depth reduces the exposure hazard to less that 1 percent of the initial exposure hazard see fm 33 for further guidance soldiers must mark burial sites with contamination markers they must bury or burn filters contaminated with chemical or live biological agents or toxins if burning is selected they should place the filters in pit soak them with fuel and ignite them the heat of combustion kills most biological agents in the filter commanders should establish detailed procedures for filter disposal during peacetime and wartime situations transportation collectiveprotection systems may or may not have organic transportation for maneuver unit the decision to carry shelter or components is matter of priority for example there may be indication the threat will employ chemical agents or the tactical situation may be unsuitable for collective protection therefore the maneuver commander may decide not to transport the m51 or scpe into battle on the other hand the threat may be actively employing chemical agents or thetactical situation may be suitable for employment of collective protection the commander may choose to accept the transportation burden for the advantage of readily available shelter system when the decision is made against having shelter assets in the maneuver units based on the ipb these assets should be retained in the unit trains area ready for use this allows quick response to changes in the tactical situation manpower manpower planning for collectiveprotection systems encompasses several factors while in mopp4 these include setup and teardown times lost time from entry and exit procedures and shelter security commanders must estimate these requirements based on information in the next paragraphs setup and teardown times table 64 shows approximate setup and teardown times these are only estimates actual times will vary with the situation and degree of training entry times commanders should estimate entry processing times for units based on the mopp gear doffing times in table 65 shelter security commanders must ensure that security is maintained around any protective shelter security requirements depend on the tactical situation type and strength of security element depend upon several factors these are the type of operation being conducted at the shelter location on the battlefield and personnel available to protect the shelter physical security involves the immediate area around the shelter and shelter entrances patrols ops or both protect the area around the shelter the best means of physical security are ops position an op where observers can give early warning to the main shelter area of any unusual activity or an attack several ops provide overlapping observation around the shelter operation area where terrain restricts effective observation or the number of personnel prohibits sufficient ops patrols can maintain security shelters with high entryexit require attendants post attendants at the shelter entrance to control entry they should also assist in the external operations of the warning burning filters contaminated with chemical agents or toxins may produce downwind vapor hazard warn units downwind after burning cover ashes with the excavated dirt and mark the site with contamination markers disposal of any filters after normal maintenance in peacetime also requires special handling and disposal of these as hazardous waste this includes all mask filters and canisters and collectiveprotection equipment filters material that has been determined to be hazardous waste must be transported stored treated and disposed of as such 67fm 34 antennas away from the shelter if possible they should place antennas so that hill or other obstacle is between antennas and the enemy latrines collectiveprotection shelters may include sanitary facilities if the shelter is in permanent structure use existing facilities consider the location of existing sanitary facilities in selecting portion of the building for soldier relief facility where water and sewage facilities are not available provide covered containers or chemical toilets illumination have lights installed if power is available and also always provide batteryoperated lights for emergency use keep electric light usage to minimum to prevent excessive heat buildup in the shelter an alternative would be to use cold light sources such as chemical safety lights shelter exact duties before during and after an nbc attack should be outlined in the unit sop soldiers assigned as shelter attendants and their duties will be discussed later in the chapter other requirements these requirements are already part of the commanders planning however commanders must readdress each of these to consider the effect of collective protection communications personnel use wire communication systems to communicate with those in adjacent shelters or immediately outside the shelter they may require radios for communications with adjacent units some distance away if they use radio systems they should remote thethemlites take blackout precautions where required ensure that lights needed to service filter units or generators are shielded from the enemy camouflage construct or emplace shelter sites in areas that provide cover andor concealment dense woods or urban areas are best commanders must ensure that construction and emplacement actions are well camouflaged water have filled canteens or other water containers placed inside the shelter provide each occupant at least 3 quarts of drinking water for each day of anticipated occupancy even if piped water is available maintain an emergency reserve of drinking water additional water may be needed for hygiene warning and detection plan for warning and chemical detection devices m8a1 m256series kits or cam in each protective shelter these devices serve several purposes they detect an nbc attack and determine if the shelter interior is contaminated these devices also monitor soldiers going through decon and determine when soldiers can safely leave the shelter in addition they warn of shelter system failure 68c2 fm 34fmfm 119 operation of collectiveprotection systems collective protection does not replace mopp gear nor the mopp doctrine for example the ventilatedfacepiece system enhances mopp gear protection overpressure systems create an artificial environment this changes the nature of the nbc threat and allows the commander to order lower mopp levels commanders and soldiers should be familiar with several actions before during and after an nbc attack to make the use of collectiveprotection systems more efficient and effective actions before an attack before an nbc attack occurs several actions should make the use of collective protection easier commanders should determine appropriate mopp levels accomplish collectiveprotection planning ensure personnel are accounted for and briefed on the threat situation individual soldiers should assume the appropriate mopp level check protection system for proper operation know entry and exit procedures but these do not have to be followed until an actual agent attack accomplish individual protective actions before an attack the shelter attendant should inspect and maintain the shelter filter system inspect and maintain the communication system know entry and exit procedures actions during an attack during an attack suspend or minimize entry into the shelter shelter attendant should don mask and alert shelter occupants aid in securing air lock doors prevent unauthorized personnel from entering the shelter test periodically for contamination if entry from ted environment is mission essential internal monitoring becomes critical faulty entry and exit procedures may cause hazardous contamination levels inside vapor absorbed into clothing can do the same to minimize this risk use the following procedures monitor the shelter interior every 15 minutes using detectormonitoring equipment if hazardous level of agent are detected insidesuspend shelter operations soldiers should assume the appropriate mopp level and evacuate the shelter however if mission dictates the commander my elect to have soldiers don their protective masks to continue to opeate inside the shelter this may lengthen the time required to purge the shelter and restore safe conditions when detectormonitoring equipment longer indicates the presence of contamination inside proceed with unmasking procedures and then resume shelter operations further actions during an attack will depend on the type of collective protection systems that are components of weapon system or toe assets require separate explanations weaponsystems collective protection soldiers in weapon systems with collective protection should anticipate the attack they must be at the same mopp level as the other soldiers or be protected by having the collectiveprotection system functioning those who are protected by the collectiveprotection system may continue at the reduced mopp levels shown in table 65 those who are not protected by collective protection when an attack occurs should activate the collectiveprotection system and assume mopp4 they must remain at that level until the shelter interior is purged required purge times vary with the interior shelter volume and the airflow check specific technical manuals for each system when the required purge time passes soldiers should unmask as outlined in stp 2124smct when the allclear signal is given soldiers may resume the modified mopp level shown in table 65 during an attack restrict entry and exit personnel or equipment should enter or exit except when absolutely mission essential when an entry must be made monitor the interior air use detectormonitor equipment and determine if the entry introduced contaminants if the test detects chemical agent assume mopp3 or mopp4 purge the air until tests are negative and then perform the unmasking procedures after the allclear signal soldiers may assume modified mopp levels toe collectiveprotection systems the commander decides whether or not to use toe collectiveprotection assets basis for the decision is the determination that more effective command and control less performance degradation or relief from mopp gear is mission essential if this decision is made in anticipation of an attack special setup procedures are necessary however if the decision is made after the attack occurs soldiers erecting the shelter must carefully avoid transferring liquid contamination to the 69c2 fm 34fmfm 119 shelter interior also the interior air must be purged as specified in the tm for the system next the air must be tested continuously with detectormonitoring equipment until the reading is negative if operations begin before the urge is complete soldiers must maintain maskonlyposture until they receive the all clear signal limiting entry and exit of collectiveprotection systems contamination entry when entry must be performed soldiers must monitor the interior this ensures contaminantes have not entered to minimize entry and exit requirements the commanander may choose to locate outside the shelter and let the staff operate inside liaison officer appointed by the commander coordinates between the commander staff and troops direct coordination with troops and staff consumes large portion of time performing entry and exit procedures when collectiveprotection system is used for relief from mopp gear the commander must ensure coordination of certain arrangements these include moppgear resupply and security shelters used for soldier relief require great number of entry and exit cycles in addition soldiers must continuously monitor helter operations this monitoring ensures the system functions properly and that contaminants have entered the systemdecon iaw fm 35 soldiers also must take the following actions ensure contaminated items are not stowed in cpe acquire decon support if required resupply expendable such as ipe mask and shelter filters and individual decon kits continue entry and exit procedures until one hour after detectors indicate the absence of agent vapors outside the shelter resume beforeattack actions but continue periodic monitoring of shelter interior with detectormonitoring equipment after an attack the shelter attendant will pass the all clear signal to the shelter occupants when safe to do so service the filter system if needed assist entry and exit procedures continue attendant duties entry and exit procedures for collectiveprotection system s actions after an attack vapor and liquid contamination hazard may remain for some time after an attack once it is determined that hazard longer exists ted soldiers should conductentry and exit are slow and therefore the commander must allowrisky procedures only those soldiers 610fm 34 that are mission essential to enter and exit entry and exit are the procedures between individual protection and collective protection stepbystep instructions allow for safe transition from individual to collective protection and back differences between procedures depend on two variables the type of mopp gear and the type of collective protection two possible mopp gear ensemble combinations are used in the examples to follow groundtroop ipefield protective mask with hood carrier helmet with chemical protective cover individual weapon armored vest if worn and mopp gear combat vehicle and aircrew ipetank or aircraft mask with hood combat vehicle crewman or aircraft crewman helmet individual weapon armored vest if worn and mopp gear each ensemble and type of enclosure have certain characteristics that dictate different steps therefore procedures for particular combination are composite of general guidelines for individual and collective protection entry and exit procedures in this chapter illustrate the necessity to modify procedures based on their application and system configuration procedures presented here give steps common to all entry and exit procedures actual procedures for particular system should be more specific these are in the systems technical manual and they should also appear in the unit sop guidelines for an sop are at appendix b collectiveprotection shelter or van with an air lock select site for shelter erection that is free of liquid contamination soldiers setting up the shelter either m51 or scpe should perform steps 1 through 9 of the entry procedures they should do this before entering the selected setup site or handling unpackaged liners or supportkit components if setting up shelter where the external agent concentration produces relative hazard reading of one bar or less on the cam indication that agent is present entry into the shelter is unlimited where the external concentration of agent produces cam reading of sevenbar or more entries should be discontinued unless they are mission essential soldiers entering the shelter should follow the entry instructions when liquid contamination is detected or suspected on their overgarments establish hot line at least 4 feet from the air lock check the floor area between the hot line and the entrance for evidence of liquid contamination use both visual check and detectormonitoring equipment if contamination is present decontaminate this area cover it with plastic sheet poncho or similar material or find another areaif possible if possible remove overgarments in room or covered area that is separate from the room in which the entrance is located and establish the hot line at the doorway between the two rooms keep the room with the air lock as clean as possible equipment allow equipment to enter the shelter unless it is known to be free of contamination preposition decon kits alarms detector kit samplers and cam inside the air lock these components require periodic replenishment depending on the frequency of entries the cam will require fresh batteries based on the technical manual guidance entry instructions for groundtroop ensemble it is best to doff remove items from top to bottom because upper parts of the ensemble overlap lower parts this order minimizes contamination transfer soldiers can perform entry steps with or without assistance from buddy or shelter attendant however soldiers can perform some steps more easily and safely with help therefore the buddy system is strongly recommended soldiers in the groundtroop ensemble should use the following 13 steps step 1 use detector paper to determine areas of gross liquid contamination on your equipment and garments give special emphasis to these areas and use fieldexpedient absorbents such as sand dirt or rags to remove the gross liquid contamination take special care to avoid touching these areas during overgarment doffing note if radiological or biological hazard is present lightly wipe down the overgarment with hot soapy water prior to entry into the shelter this will dampen the overgarment and reduce any secondary aerolization of either radiological or biological contamination while conducting doffing procedures step 2 remove lce mask carrier and helmet before crossing into the shelter if the hood is worn over the lce loosen the hood straps remove your m258a1 or m291 and your m 1mill waterproof bag and take them with you step 3 untie the ankle cords and open the velcro and zippers of both trouser legs step 4 undo rear snaps of jacket leaving top snap closed undo the remaining two front snaps untie waist cords but leave zipper closed step 5 undo shoulder straps remove them from beneath the arms and reattach them over the shoulder 611fm 34 use assistance if possible loosen the neck cord decontaminate your mask and hood with your m258a1m291 skin decon kit the m258a1 decon kit is twopacket twostep process use both packets over the same area take special care to decontaminate around the eye lenses inlets and voicemitter decon solutions may leave residue on the eye lenses to prevent this reverse the order of application of the decon packets use packet 2 first and then use packet 1 the m291 decon kit replaces the m258a1 and is singlepacket onestep application instructions are included in the m291 packet open the packet slip fingers into the pad strap and decon your mask and hood thoroughly cause burnsdo not reverse the order of the packets in the m258a1 kit when decontaminating skin it may the m291 can also be used to decontaminate equipment that needs to be taken into the shelter step 6 decontaminate gloves before rolling hood use assistance if possible leave the hood zipper closed grasp the hood by the straps and lift the hood off your shoulders and partially off your head until most of the back of your head is exposed roll the hood start at your chin making sure the zipper and neck cord are tucked into the roll and work around the entire mask until the rolled hood will stay up off your shoulders roll the hood tightly against your mask without pulling the hood off the back of your headwarning note if your assistant is also entering the shelter steps 1 through 6 should be performed on him or her before proceeding to step 7 step 7 undo the top jacket snap and open the jacket zipper with one hand pull the sleeve band over your hand without loosening your glove make fist if necessary remove that arm from the sleeve repeat for your other arm place jacket away from the entry path step 8 stand against wall or other support for balance and unsnap and unzip your trousers use assistance if possible pull or have the assistant pull your trousers over the heels of your chemical overbootsgvos for removal or walk the trousers off to do this alternately lift one foot while holding trouser material to the ground with your other foot leave the overboots or gvos on and place trousers away from the entry path note your assistant if also entering the shelter should perform steps 7 and 8 now before proceeding to step 9step 9 airlock entry groundbased shelter with airlock entry is not applicable to the patriot note specific reference to the m14 protective entrance pe does not appear in this manual b for van with air lock go up the steps and loosen your overboot laces or gvo clasps open the door remove one overboot or gvo at time toss it away from the steps and step into the air lock with your exposed field boot do not touch exposed field boots on the exterior platform surface or stairs after removing your overboots or gvos note when you are operating an airlock system in contaminated environment the protective entrance and shelter interior must be monitored with detection equipment step 10 enter air lock and ensure door is closed when the low pressure indicator light in the pe module goes out rotate the purge time clockwise to its full extent do not set the purge time until after the low pressure light goes out step 11 decontaminate your gloves again then decontaminate the bottom rolled portion of your hood wait for completion of the purge cycle when the timer bell sounds loosen your gloves but do not remove them yet step 12 trained operator will use the cam if available to detect and indicate the relative level of chemical agent vapor hazard present on personnelclothingequipment as well as the interior of the peshelter when sampling results are negative stop breathing hold your breath remove your mask and hood and place them in your mlmla1 waterproof bag remove warning suspected false positive reading must be verified with other monitoring equipment such as m8m9 paper and m256 detector kit before proceeding further your gloves and drop them to the floor carry the m1mial with you step 13 enter the shelter and resume breathing warning when entries are performed in contaminated environment monitor every 30 minutes if detectormonitoring shows positive all personnel should mask until the source of the contamination is located and removed andor further tests indicate the contamination is 612fm 34 exit instructions for groundtroop ensemble overgarment donning procedures for exiting the shelter are less timeconsuming and risky than doffing procedures whenever possible ensure replacement or spare overgarments are prepositioned inside the shelter for systems with high rate of entry and exit commanders must provide for periodic resupply of spare overgarments soldiers should follow these four steps step 1 put on clean overgarments overboots and gloves inside the shelter step 2 check the compartment control module ccm to ensure the air lock m14 pe is unoccupied stop breathing and step into the entrance taking your m1m1a1 bag with you step 3 open the m1m1al bag remove your mask by the straps with one hand and make sure the hood is inside out over the front place your mask to your chin and face and pull the head harness over your head tighten cheek straps clear and seal your mask and resume breathing unroll the hood pull the hood over your head attach the straps and tighten the neck cord step 4 exit the air lock and ensure the pe door is fully closed after exiting entry instructions for combat vehicle and aircrew ipe use of the cvc mask m25seriesm42 or aircraft crewman helmet with different mask m24m43 configuration requires differences in removing and handling the hood the microphone cord hangs down to the shoulders it can transfer contamination if not secured to the helmet in some way the microphone boom must be tucked in well against the helmet otherwise it snags the hood in addition the main power cord extends beyond the hood if contaminated it will be very difficult to decontaminate to avoid these problems soldiers should use the following four steps step 1 if you wear your vehicle helmet underneath your hood the first step is to remove the hood from back to front from your helmet then remove it from around the eye lenses and then from the filter hose if you wear your hood underneath your helmet remove your helmet first then remove the hood from your mask in the manner described step 2 with mask and helmet if applicable still on remove your overgarment jacket and trousers use the same basic procedures outlined for troops in the groundtroop ensemble with one exception when performing the doffing procedure bend at your waist to prevent the filter canister and hose from touching you when your overgarment is being removedwarning ensure the undressing area is well ventilated and remove contaminated overgarment from the hot line area to avoid buildup of vapor step 3 proceed to the air lock or hot line remove boots as you step into the air lock step 4 just before entering the protective enclosure remove your mask helmet add gloves seal your mask inside your m1m1a1 bag and enter the enclosure note for systems without an air lock remove your mask helmet and gloves only after tests indicate the absence of vapor place your mask inside your mlm1al bag and seal the bag warning do not touch the eye lens area or the canister hose these are difficult to decontaminate and are potential transfer hazards exit instructions for combat vehicles and aircrew ipe overgarment donning procedures for exiting the shelter are less timeconsuming and risky than doffing procedures whenever possible ensure replacement or spare overgarments are prepositioned inside the shelter for systems with high rate of entry and exit commanders must provide for periodic resupply of spare overgarments soldiers should follow these four steps note for systems without an air lock all soldiers don mopp gear before anyone exits the protective enclosure after the exit those remaining reseal and purge the enclosure when vapor contamination drops below detection levels the remaining soldiers can follow unmasking procedures step 1 put on clean overgarment overboots or gvos and gloves inside the shelter step 2 check to ensure the air lock is unoccupied stop breathing and step into the entrance taking your mlm1al bag with you step 3 open the m1m1a1 bag don mask and put on gloves note bib

weather and terrain and how they affect the needs for nbc protection must receive special consideration certain weather conditions will greatly influence use of nbc weapons likewise different types of terrain will alter the effects of nbc weapons also the type of operation can directly bear on the need for nbc protection this appendix discusses several types of operations with emphasis on nbc defense cold weather operations cold weather and other severe climatic conditions create many new problems in individual protection such conditions may exist in the extreme northern united states alaska and northern europe generally these conditions alter the planning and implementation of individual nbc defensive measures the following paragraphs explain some of these particular situations and the procedures that soldiers should take to protect themselves nuclear blast effects at subzero temperatures the radius of damage to material targets can increase the increase can be as much as 20 percent these targets include such items as tanks ifvs apcs artillery and military vehicles precursor wave over heatabsorbing surfaces can increase the dynamic pressure wave however tundra irregular terrain features and broken ice caps break up the pressure wave blast effects can drastically interfere with troop movement blast can break up covers and cause quick thaws the result can be avalanches in mountainous areas in flat lands blast may disturb the permafrost sufficiently to restrict or disrupt movement thermal effects ice and snow have high reflectivity this may increase the minimum safe distance as much as 50 percent for unwarned troops and even warned exposed troops reflectivity may also increase the number of personnel whose vision is affected by the brilliant flash or light dazzle especially at night the pale colors normally used to cover material in cold environment give an advantage their low absorption properties may make personnel less vulnerable to thermal effects cold temperatures also reduce thermal effects on materials snow ice and evenfrost coverings on combustible material greatly reduce the tendency of materials to catch fire however thermal effects will dry out exposed tundra areas and grass fires may result radiation effects the number of passable roadways is limited already by weather conditions and radiological contamination on roadways may further restrict resupply and troop movement seasonal high winds in the arctic may present problem in radiological contamination predictions these winds may reduce dose rates at ground zero at the time they extend the area coverage and create problem for surveymonitoring teams hot spots or areas of concentrated accumulation of radiological contamination may occur in areas of heavy snow and snow drifts monitoring for nuclear radiation requires the use of batterypowered radiac equipment it is imperative that these instruments be kept warm to maintain maximum efficiency in extreme cold radiological surveys normally are limited to those areas or routes occupied or used by large units aerial survey is most practical in extreme cold weather areas survey and monitoring procedures are covered in fm 33 protection against nuclear attack at low temperatures troops operating in the field are particularly vulnerable to all of the effects produced by nuclear detonation because of the difficulty in digging foxholes and underground fortifications for protection shelters and fortifications constructed from snow and ice provide some protection and wherever possible should be constructed to take maximum advantage of the additional protection provided by natural terrain features tents that provide necessary warmth for living will not provide protection from radioactive fallout maximum use consistent with the tactical mission must be made of natural terrain features to provide protection against fallout snow and ice although not as effective as earth in reducing radiation hazards are readily available and can be used to provide shielding against radiation effects loose snow falling on contaminated area has halfthickness of about 60 centimeters 24 inches that is 60 centimeters of loose snow covering the contamination will reduce the dose rate to about half the original value thirty centimeters 12 inches of hardpacked snow will reduce the dose rate by about a0c2 fm 34fmfm 119 onehalf and may be of value when considering constructing radiation shield over contaminated areas or onehalf and may be of value when considering around shelter biological biological warfare in the arctic is possibility most vectors will not survive and it is more difficult to aerosolize live biological agents in freezing temperatures toxins on the other hand are less susceptible to the cold it has been found that the survival of microorganisms increased significantly at temperatures below freezing temperature inversions that exist over snowfields tend to prolong the integrity of an aerosolized biological cloud it would thus disperse more slowly and thus remain threat for longer period if an attack with these agents occurs most likely it will be delivered by covert means it is important therefore to be alert at all times to the possibility of sabotage personnel are more susceptible to live biological agents in arctic environments this is because of the rapid rate with which diseases will spread in the warm crowded conditions it is more difficult to assure the requirement for food water rest and cleanliness in cold weather troops suffering from dehydration or from lack of nourishment or rest will be particularly vulnerable to biological attack chemical in arctic conditions chemical agents act differently according to whether they are blister nerve blood or choking agents blister agents usually blister agents are ineffective as casualty producers because the temperature is well freezes and becomes solid at 14 c 58 f however some blister agents or combinations have very low freezing points these can be effective as harassing agents because their vapors produce eye irritation requiring soldiers to mask since troops wear additional clothing the possibility of skin contact is greatly reduced the greater danger is from blister agents carried inside heated area hence an attack by blister agents at low temperatures can present real hazard nerve agents in arctic operations nerve agents may play an important role by forcing troops to mask agent evaporation takes several hours and soldiers must remain masked for long periods significant contamination at low temperatures and wind speeds may remain several days liquid soman gd freezes and becomes solid at 42 c 43 f except in severely cold conditions nerve agents will remain liquid and liquid agents are easily absorbed by outer garments and other porous material absorbedagents become vapor hazard or even contact hazard if transported into heated area and chocking agents require soldiers to mask blood and blood and chocking agents vapor hazards from blood especially chocking agents remain extremely hazardous and non persistent throughout the low temperature range these agents may be disseminated as liquid solid or aerosol and require masking whenever they are used blood agent ac is extremely hazardous even as low as 65 f 54 c individualequipment problems mask soldiers should add the m4 winterization kit to masks for cold weather use for the m17series and m40series masks pull the hood voicemitteroutlet valve assembly cover opening to below the cover this prevents moisture from wetting inner clothing in extreme cold soldiers wearing masks with winterization kits installed will experience greater breathing resistance this increases with work load and it becomes even more pronounced with fatigue in extreme cold environments the hood may be prone to tearing and the zipper apt to malfunction soldiers should wear their mask carriers beneath their outer garments this allows body heat to keep the masks warm and flexible wearing masks in this manner requires an adjustment to donning time after each wearing soldiers must inspect their masks for ice formation especially in the inlet and outlet valve areas to prevent frostbite soldiers should place small piece of tape over the exposed metal rivets inside the facepiece the tape should be just large enough to cover the metal and not so large it interferes with donning fitting the mask requires care soldiers must adjust the head harness only tight enough to create good seal if the mask is too tight it will restrict blood flow to certain areas of the face and make those areas more susceptible to frostbite to don the protective mask in arctic conditions soldiers should take the following eight actions stop breathing remove mask from under parka remove gloves or mittens as needed to properly don the mask lower parka hood don the mask note do not clear the mask by exhaling large amount of air into it as is done in warm weather large amount of air exhaled into the mask will frost the cold eye lenses instead exhale steadily and slowly the outlet valve may stick to the seat if this occurs lift the outlet valve cover and rotate the disk with finger while exhaling only after freezing the valve reseat the valve cover check the mask for leaks by pulling down the cheekbelow their normal freezing points liquid mustard arent a1c2 fm 34fmfm 119 flaps of the iceparticle prefilter and covering the inlet valves with your hands fasten the cheek flaps and resume normal breathing raise the parka hood and fasten your outer garment to remove the mask in arctic conditions soldiers must take the following five actions brush snow or ice particles from your mask remove gloves or mittens as necessary to remove mask remove mask and immediately dry face and inside of mask note perspiration collects around the facepiece take care when removing the mask to prevent perspiration from freezing on your face and causing frostbite use small towel or cloth to wipe your face and inside of mask to prevent ice formation wipe your mask thoroughly before storing it when possible further dry the mask by placing it in warm heated environment but avoid placing it in direct heat store mask in carrier put on gloves or mittens m24125series and m43series masks with these masks the facepieces become brittle from the cold and can be broken to prevent this the mask should be carried beneath outer garments to keep warm along with keeping them warn the faceform is required to prevent creasing and cracking especially in cold weather battle dress overgarment the bdo is not adversely affected by cold temperatures commanders and leaders must be particulary sensitive to the possibilities of their soldiers receiving cold weather injuries particularly frostbite occurring when soldiers are in mopp3 or mopp4 soldiers are most susceptible to frostbite on their hands fingers around the elastic in the arms of the overgarment and from the buildup of sweat that occurs while wearing the mask and rubber gloves the chances of hypothermia will increase when the mopp level is reduced the bdo is worn under environmental cold weather parkas clothing in keeping with the layered principle overheated soldiers may need to vent their chemical protective clothing by opening and cooling down the body core temperature and then reestablishing the protective posture before doing this though the commander must consider the threat and degree of risk involved the production of body heat makes the bdo breast pockets particularly well suited for carrying items requiring protection from freezing for example m256m256al kits and naak chemical protective overboots and gvos both covers are worn seasonally but do not fit over the vaporbarrier vb boots required in extreme environments during winter operations the vb boots provide adequate protection when worn in conjunction with chemical protective clothing the vb boots are doublelayered natural rubber with an air pocket in between chemical protective gloves normal procedure when donning the protective gloves is to first put on the cotton liners and then the rubber gloves during winter operations in chemical environment use the wool glove liners part of the black leather glove set under the butyl rubber gloves to absorb and wick away perspiration from hand surfaces proper glove fit is required to preclude restricting blood circulation and cold weather injury in an extreme cold environment the arctic mittens should be worn over the rubber gloves to provide warmth when mittens are removed the glove surface should be decontaminated before redonning the mittens nerve agent antidote fit mark i ii arctic weather affects the mark i ii kit when the temperature is below 32 f 0 c the kit may not function properly when the temperature dips below 40 f 5 c remove the kit from the carrier and store it in the shirt pocket keep it as close to body temperature as possible this precludes the danger of severe muscle spasms andor shock from injecting an extremely cold liquid into muscle if the kit freezes do not use it but acquire replacement in addition protection from freezing must be provided during transit storage and resupply operations because freezing and thawing render the kits unserviceable care must be taken during the use of the naaks to ensure penetration through winter clothing to the muscle m258aim291 skin decontamination kit as with any cold liquid on the skin the m258ai must be used when chemical agents contact the skin even though there is risk of cold injury warming the kit prevents possible frost bite the m291 kit will alleviate this problem since it is resinbased kit additional information relating to decon in arctic environments is in fm 35 m256m256al chemical agent detector kit arctic weather affects the kit when temperature is 15f 21c or below the kit can give inaccurate indications solutions in the capsules freeze and the solutions will not work even if reheated also it is difficult or even impossible for the heat tabs to heat the enzyme window to reaction temperature take care to keep the kit at temperature above freezing however do not place it directly on source of heat such as vehicle heater if possible warm it with body heat by placing it inside the parka system of identifying sample of suspected agent a2 us government printing office 1996 72802740078fm 34 is to collect the suspected agent and place it on m8 or m9 paper once collected the m8 or m9 paper is warmed and covered in box or can while the m256m256a1 is inside the box or can this will heat both the suspected agent sufficiently to enable detection by the m256m256a1 kit soldiers can place samples into empty ammunition cans and apply external heat to cause agent offgassing the external heat source may be small fire heat tab burning c4 or trip flare m8 and m9 detector paper both m8 and m9 detector paper are not specifically limited in the cold but can detect only liquid that would probably be frozen if the specific substance is thickened or frozen sample is collected with stick or scraper and wiped onto sheet of wither m8 or m9 paper the sample is placed on heated surface such as an operating vehicle or power generator to stimulate thawing of the suspected agent so that identification is expedited because of the possibility of offgassing this procedure should not be performed inside heated vehicle or tent collective protection for collective protection chemical hazards become true challenge in the cold successful cold weather operations are dependent upon heated shelters without these combat effectiveness is decreased most collectiveprotection systems have proven to be reliable and durable in the cold fluctuations in pressure may occur when the system is exposed to high winds in cold environments indirect vapor absorption presents the greatest problem in entry and exit for this reason it is important to have detection capability in the shelter itself which is currently prescribed in normal entryexit procedures if agent is detected soldiers in the shelter will immediately mask the soldiers inside the shelter will be monitored to identify who has brought in the contamination once identification has been made the soldier exits and the shelter is then immediately purged if followon detection proves negative soldiers may resume entryexit procedures desert operations desert operations present many varying problems desert daytime temperatures can vary from 90f to 125f 32c to 52c an unstable temperature gradient results and this is not particularly favorable to nbc attacks however with nightfall the desert cools rapidly and stable temperature gradient results possibility of night or early morning attacks must be considered in all planning of desert operations nuclear nuclear defense planning is generally much the same in desert as in other areas there are few exceptionshowever lack of vegetation and permanent fixtures such as forests and buildings makes it necessary to plan for and construct fortifications construction may be difficult because of inconsistencies of the sand but sand in combination with sandbags will give additional protection from radiation exposure blowing winds and sands can produce widespread areas of radiological contamination the varying terrain may make radiological survey monitoring very difficult biological most aerosolized live biological agents are ineffective weapons in desert areas an exception is sporeforming biological agents this is result of low humidity and the ultraviolet radiation of direct sunlight troops crossing or occupying desert terrain face little danger from longterm live biological contamination except for sporeforming agents but because of favorable night conditions covert aerosolized attack could occur effectiveness of the live biological agent however would quickly diminish with daytime heat toxins are resistant to this harsh environment these can be employed in the same way as chemical agents chemical most chemical attacks will be spot or on target attacks this is because of rapid agent evaporation for example with neutral temperature gradient 90f 32c temperature and light wind mustard evaporates rapidly the concentration will be less than 50 percent in one hour desert soil may be very porous for example an attack with an unthickened liquid agent may occur in support of predawn attack soil soaks up agent when the sun rises it begins to heat the surface the agent evaporates and rapidly creates downwind hazard and the downwind hazard area increases because of lack of vegetation and permanent building to alter the wind flow soldiers must take care to place alarm systems for the widest possible coverage nonpersistent agent attack is unlikely during daylight hours weather conditions would rapidly blow away any agent night brings about reverse of weather conditions and creates ideal conditions for an attack at night agents linger and settle into low areas such as foxholes in planning for defense plan any strenuous activity for night hours this will reduce the heat stress caused by wearing mopp gear take care to ensure that sleeping soldiers are masked if appropriate also ensure that they are checked periodically to make sure that mask seals are not broken this is because an attack is more likely at night than in the day way to accomplish this is to use the buddy system or to have the a3fm 34 guard check soldiers during rounds the unit sop must address this subject jungle operations tropical climates require the highest degree of individual discipline and conditioning to maintain effective nbc defense readiness dominating climatic features of jungle areas are high constant temperature heavy rainfall and very high humidity in thick jungle there is usually little or wind and the canopy blocks much of the sunlight from the ground commanders must expect and plan for rapid decrease in unit efficiency they must also expect heat casualties in addition they must ensure that special precautions are taken to maintain unit nbc defensive equipment in usable condition the rapid mildew dry rot and rust inherent in jungle areas impose this requirement nuclear dense vegetation has little influence on initial effects of nuclear detonations except that the heavy canopy provides some protection against thermal radiation the blast wave creates extensive tree blowdown and missile effects some falling particles are retained by the jungle canopy and reduced radiation hazards may result subsequent rains however will wash these particles to the ground particles will concentrate in water collection areas and produce radiation hot spots biological jungles provide excellent conditions for threat use of live biological agents and toxins warm temperatures high humidity and protection from sunlight all aid survivability of diseasecausing microorganisms low wind speeds and jungle growth limit downwind hazards strict adherence to field sanitation procedures especially vector and rodent control is essential in jungles these procedures will help control the naturally occurring diseases that abound soldiers should mask and role down sleeves to cover exposed skin from possible contact with live biological agents and toxins toxins are well suited to this environment and soldiers should defend against toxins just as they defend against chemical agents chemical chemical agents used in jungle areas can cause extreme problems for friendly forces persistent agents delivered by artillery shells and aircraft bombs penetrate the canopy before dissemination these agents can remain effective on jungle floors for long periods high temperatures can increase vapor hazards from liquid agents nonpersistent agent vapors hang in the airfor extended periods because of low wind speeds however these wind speeds minimize downwind vapor hazards chemical agents employed in jungle areas make mopp gear necessary for ground operations however high temperature and humidity combined with the heatloading characteristics of mopp gear make mopp gear uncomfortable to operate in mountain operations terrain and weather in mountainous areas dictate requirement for high degree of nbc defense preparedness rugged terrain limits the employment of large forces adjacent units may not be able to provide mutual support also there is reduced logistical support and difficult rapid maneuver in these circumstances small us units can impede harass or canalize numerically superior threat forces the intention is to dissipate threat strength and compel threat forces to fight decisive battle under unfavorable circumstances mountain warfare requires friendly units to be almost completely selfsufficient in nbc protection nuclear nuclear targeting in mountainous areas is easier than in flat terrain the reasons are the lack of roads and trails and the slow speed at which troops must move digging foxholes and building other protective shelters are difficult in rocky or frozen ground improvised shelters built of snow ice or rocks may be the only possible protection radiological contamination deposit may be very erratic because of rapidly changing wind patterns hot spots may occur far from the point of detonation and low intensity areas may occur very near it limited mobility makes radiological surveys on the ground difficult and the difficulty of maintaining constant flight altitude makes air surveys highly inaccurate natural shelters provide some protection from nuclear effects and radiological contamination these natural shelters include caves ravines and cliffs clear mountain air extends the range of casualtyproducing thermal effects added clothing required by cool mountain temperatures however reduces casualties from these effects rockslides or snowslides are potential problems units operating under nuclear warfare conditions should carefully select positions where they will not be hit or trapped by slides biological defense against live biological agents does not differ in principle in mountains from that in flat terrain except in extreme cold for detailed explanation see cold weather operations on page 94 a4fm 34 chemical aerial delivery will most likely be the means of chemical munitions employment in mountain warfare this results from difficult logistic problems and increased munitions requirements for cold weather employment troops should be constantly alert for air strikes and they should take protective actions immediately defense against chemical attacks in mountains is similar to that in flat terrain where cold temperatures prevail refer to cold weather operations on page 94 urban terrain operations to plan nbc defense commanders must be fully familiar with how urban terrain will affect their mission nuclear without some preparation average buildings give inadequate shelter from nuclear blast if used correctly ground floors and basements of steel or reinforced concrete offer excellent protection from most effects except overpressure soldiers should avoid windows because of possible injuries from flying debris and glass soldiers also may receive severe burns through openings facing ground zero sewers storm drains and subway tunnels are readily available in most urban areas these provide better protection than groundlevel buildings soldiers should not use structures of wood or other flammable materials because these could burst into flames see chapter 4 for preparation procedures buildings do provide measure of protection against radiological contamination troops who must move in or through suspected contaminated urban areas should take this into consideration they should travel through buildings sewers and tunnels however they should consider the dangers of collapse because of blast soldiers also should consider hazards of debris and firestorms resulting from ruptured and ignited gas or gasoline lines biological buildings and other urban structures can provide some immediate protection from direct spray however the stable environment of these structures may increase persistency of live biological agents toxins are very effective in an urban environment and soldiers should take the same precautions prescribed for chemical agents covert operations are particularly well suited for urban employment existing water and food supplies are prime targets soldiers personal hygiene becomes veryimportant commanders must establish and consistently enforce sanitary and personal hygiene measures including immunizations they must also ensure that troops drink safe water and never assume that hydrant water is safe chemical urban structures can protect against spray attacks but this exchange for overhead cover creates other problems chemical agents tend to find and stay in low areas such as those found in urban locations examples are basements sewers and subway tunnels soldiers should avoid these low areas stay times of agents such as gb greatly increase when settled in these areas once an attack occurs detection of chemical contamination becomes very important soldiers must thoroughly check areas before attempting to occupy or traverse them they also may have to relocate some defensive positions airborne and airassault operation s airborne and airassault divisions launch operations into specific limited objective areas this provides threat forces with an opportunity to use nbc weapons effectively as deterrent commanders should avoid massing troops and aircraft in and around relatively small landing zones lzs and drop zones dzs such massing invites disaster if the area of operation has only few suitable lzs or dzs the enemy may choose to contaminate them with persistent chemical agents any landing operation attempted in these zones would then require troops to dress in fill mopp gear it could also require extensive decon of aircraft see chapter 8 of fm 35 troops operating from bases near lzs or dzs could be subjected to further chemical attacks with both persistent and nonpersistent agents this would require extended wear of mopp gear suppression of threat fire is critical to successful operation small elements should use several lzs or dzs simultaneously this technique helps them avoid presenting lucrative targets for nuclear weapons after landing these elements should use separate routes to approach the objective and they should mass only at the last possible moment before assault also commanders must give planning consideration to either of two options they can extract the force within short time or provide quick linkup with ground mobile task force these plans allow for relief from wearing mopp gear a5fm 34 appendix b guidelines for the nbc portion of collectiveprotection system so p this is intended as guide for units in the field each unit should modify and expand this guidance to develop its own sop each sop should consider peculiarities of unit organization mission equipment and environmental situation an sop should delineate operational details of shelter or van equipped for collective protection for example details must include nbcrelated duties of guard where applicable and entry and exit procedures the sop should consider the following type and location of the shelter or van frequency of and requirements for entries and exits general climate of the area of operationstemperate arctic tropic or desert local environmental conditions number of nonshelter personnel assigned to the same site as the shelter or van use the following general guidance in preparing an sop for operation of nbc protective shelters or vans modify it for prevailing conditions clean area around the protective entrance provide procedures to decontaminate the area surrounding the shelter or van if liquid agent is present there are several methods turn or remove top layer of soil remove snow or add clean layer of soil or sand clean surface can be obtained by laying down piece of plastic cardboard canvas plywood or other material use of any one of these can prevent tracking in contaminated mud soil or liquid using either soap or detergent with water wash the entrance steps and entrance door handle then decontaminate the steps and door handle and rinse with water whenever possible provide overhead cover such as canvas fly or similar equipment for the area in front of the entrance this protects removed clothing and equipment personnel entry procedure s cover entry procedures to ensure the least risk of contamination to soldiers and equipment inside and theleast interference with tactical operations each entry involves trade off consider this question for each person does the time that may have to be spent in masks and the corresponding degradation of combat mission performance justify entry of this person general guidance provide general guidance for integration of nbc operations with combat mission operations guidance could include the following during active chemical operations the shelter guard checks all soldiers for contamination using chemical agent detector or detector paper unless the absence of contamination can be verified assume soldiers are contaminated and they must perform the specific entry procedures detector paper detects agents only in liquid form most likely thickened liquid agents unthickened agents absorb into overgarment materials and cannot be detected by detector paper however agent vapor may desorb from clothing inside shelters or vans and present vapor hazards the cam can detect desorbing vapors one of the guards main nbc duties is assisting entering soldiers he must help them decontaminate and remove contaminated overgarments he therefore must check himself periodically for contamination especially his gloves preliminary steps indicate steps required to decide if person should be allowed entry you could use the following in your sop use chemical agent detector or detector paper and check for the presence of liquid chemical agent on soldiers check each soldiers weapon overgarment gloves mask and hood assembly helmet and overboots buddy or guard assists the soldier when necessary after the detector check store contaminated items outside use protective cover such as plastic or canvas near the entrance and ensure items are not in the path of the entrance door carefully evaluate the need for grossly contaminated soldiers to enter consider possible interior bofm 34 contamination and resulting degradation determine if these will be offset by combat mission performance of entering soldiers entry into shelter or van describe procedures for entering give sufficient detail to avoid confusion standardize these procedures or at least make them compatible with and similar to those for larger shelters your sop could include the procedures such as those that follow if liquid contamination is detected on soldiers follow these procedures warning when entries are performed in contaminated environment monitor every 15 minutes if detector changes color or the cam indicates more then one bar all soldiers should mask until the source of contamination is located and removed andor further tests indicate contamination is longer present note location of any liquid agent on the entering soldier use decontaminants only on areas known to be contaminated soldier removes lce and unfastens velcro tabs tie cords and trouserleg zippers decontaminate hood effective decon may require two soldiers the soldier to be decontaminated first soldier 1 turns and faces the shelter guard or buddy soldier 2 soldier 2 loosens drawstrings over the voicemitter soldier 1 turns and soldier 2 wipes top back and sides of the hood with single passes of decon wipes soldier 2 then decontaminates his own gloves he tightly rolls the hood up and off soldier 1s overgarment jacket tucking straps into the roll this prepares the hood for removal after soldier 1s hood is decontaminated he performs the same procedures for soldier 2 soldier 1 turns and faces soldier 2 soldier 2 unsnaps the jacket top to bottom and then unzips it soldier 1 turns his back to soldier 2 and soldier 2 carefully removes the jacket soldier 2 unfastens snap and tie cordon the waistband and opens trouser front zipper on soldier 1 he slowly rolls trousers down to the hips with one roll soldier 1 can do these latter two steps if necessary leaning forward soldier 1 places both hands against the van or shelter while soldier 2 pulls trouser legs off one at time trouser legs turn inside out as they come off overboots remain on this prevents transfer of contaminated items soldier 1 then helps remove soldier 2s trousers soldier 1 loosens own overboots carrying an m258a1 or m291 decon kit and hism1m1a1 waterproof bag soldier 1 checks to be sure the air lock is unoccupied he opens the entrance door and prepares to remove overboots soldier 1 stands before the entrance removes the second overboot and steps into the entrance with his exposed boot he carefully places the overboots away from the entry path closes the door and starts the purge cycle during entrance purge the soldier decontaminates gloves mask and hood including outer portion of the rolled hood and then loosens both gloves after completion of air purge the soldier removes his mask and hood removal and storage of mask and hood assembly ensure soldiers know detailed procedures for removing the mask and hood assembly you could use the following in your sop still wearing the loosened gloves soldier 1 bends at the waist with legs apart he grasps the back of the rolled hood and lifts it forward over his head he grasps the mask at the outletvalve covers and pulls it down he bows his head to slip his face out of the mask still holding the mask so filters face the floor he lifts mask and hood off his head the soldier places the mask and hood assembly into his m1m1a1 bag and seals the bag tightly he loosens and drops his gloves to the floor then he enters the shelter carrying his m1m1al bag shelter or van emergency operations familiarize soldiers with the procedures to follow should an equipment failure occur and the alarm sounds you could use the following procedures if an alert is given and the shelter or van is prepared for nbc operations the alarm system alerts occupants to any of several types of equipment failure soldiers should handle equipmentrelated emergencies according to each systems organizational maintenance manual if one of the following conditions occurs shelter or van occupants should take the actions given sudden loss of positive pressure in the shelter lights and horns on the ccm signal an alarm occupants put on masks an assigned occupant confirms this signal by checking ccm power lights and horn if alarms are confirmed and compartment positive pressure is lost occupants must remain masked while the assigned operator pursues the problem he uses the organizational maintenance manual to locate the problem and if possible repair it the operator may not find the problem readily or perhaps he cannot repair it in either case occupants must dress at the appropriate b1fm 34 mopp level malfunctioning of gasparticulate filter unit if the changefilter light comes on occupants put on masks an assigned occupant determines if the filter is operating he follows procedures in the organizational maintenance manual if filters need to be replaced occupants must work in the appropriate mopp gear until filters are replaced air is purged and detectors indicate masks can be removed warning never change filters during chemical attack contamination of interior by entry of contaminated item or personnel refer to monitoring procedures if the interior becomes contaminated occupants must work in appropriate mopp gear until the airflow purges agent from the air and detector indicates agent is longer present wipe off any unabsorbed liquid agent from equipment use wet rag if moisture will not harm equipment warm the interior by turning air conditioner off this may enhance evaporation and resorption of agent from materials selective use of forced air from heat source can also aid in contamination removal decon begun shortly after agent is deposited is most effective interior procedures for occupant s monitoring procedures describe stepbystep monitoring procedures you could include the following in your sop each or van must have chemical agent detector kit placed at the downstream end of the airflow this is usually near the door ensure the undressing area is well ventilated and remove contaminated overgarments from the hot line area to avoid buildup of vapor if the detector indicates presence of chemical agent occupants must mask immediately check shelter pressure door and power if these are operating properly change filters replace filters according to sop and the appropriate operational maintenance manual exit describe special b2procedures exit procedures for shelteroccupants emphasize the importance of contamination avoidance your sop could include the following if an attack is imminent occurring or has occurred occupants leaving the shelter should put on mopp gear the local situation and the shelter sop will give guidance occupants may need to leave the shelter temporarily or for brief periods during an attack they should carefully avoid contamination of their mopp gear this minimizes contamination and reduces reentry time and risk in shelter or van with more than one occupant one may be assigned outside duties that person should be rotated if possible this helps to minimize lowlevel exposure and its cumulative effects operating procedures for shelter guards or nonshelter personnel describe operating procedures for shelter guards and nonshelter personnel including visitors shelters or vans may be colocated with another unit if so assign nonshelter personnel as shelter guards when possible nonshelter personnel are those not essential to the operation of shelter or van mission equipment guards attend to outside tasks this reduces the number of entries and exits you could use the following procedures in your sop exiting when leaving the shelter soldier enters the air lock contamination may be present or suspected outside or higher authority may prescribe continuous wearing of masks if so the soldier masks if required he dons mopp gear using prescribed procedures monitoring once chemical alert has been issued but before an attack the shelter guard monitors for agent presence using chemical agent detector andor detector paper after chemical attack ceases the guard periodically monitors outside air using detector or detector paper he determines if aerosol or liquid agent is still present the guard also monitors the air periodically for agent vapor using detector kit assisting shelter or van operations shelter guards and nonshelter personnel assist in shelter or van operations they perform such tasks as refueling generators realigning antennas and assisting in entry and exit of shelter personnel and visitorswarningfm 34 disposal of contaminated equipment and clothing give directions for disposal of contaminated equipment and clothing cover both emergency and prolonged nbc operations you could use the following paragraph in your sop store contaminated equipment and clothing out of the way of entering soldiers this helps avoid confusion and contamination spread choose location under the shelter or van if possible later when possible take contaminated items to equipment decon stations for cleaning and possible reissuesupplies of expendable items cover the commanders guidance for storage of supplies of certain expendable items in protective shelters or vans these are for use by soldiers entering and leaving the shelter or van include the following decon materials such as
