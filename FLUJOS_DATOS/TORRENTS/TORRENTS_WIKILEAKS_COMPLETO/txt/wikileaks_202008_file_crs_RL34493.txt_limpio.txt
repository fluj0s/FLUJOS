technology policy resources science and industry division nanotechnology and us competitiveness issues and options summary the projected economic and societal benefits of nanotechnology have propelled global investments by nations and companies the united states launched the first national nanotechnology initiative in 2000 since then more than 60 nations have launched similar initiatives in 2006 global public investment in nanotechnology was estimated to be 64 billion with an additional 60 billion provided by the private sector more than 600 nanotechnology products are now in the market generally offering incremental improvements over existing products however proponents maintain that nanotechnology research and development currently underway could offer revolutionary applications with significant implications for the us economy national and homeland security and societal wellbeing these investments coupled with nanotechnologys potential implications have raised interest and concerns about the us competitive position the data used to assess competitiveness in mature technologies and industries such as revenues and market share are not available for assessing nanotechnology in fact the us government does not currently collect such data for nanotechnology nor is comparable international data available without this information an authoritative assessment of the us competitive position is not possible alternatively indicators of us scientific and technological strength eg public and private research investments nanotechnology papers published in scientific journals patents may provide insight into the current us position and serve as bellwethers of future competitiveness by these criteria the united states appears to be the overall global leader in nanotechnology however other nations are investing heavily and may lead in specific areas of nanotechnology some believe the us leadership position in nanotechnology may not be as large as it has been in previous emerging technologies efforts to develop and commercialize nanotechnology face variety of challenges eg technical hurdles availability of capital environmental health and safety concerns and immature manufacturing technology and infrastructure some advocate more active federal government role in overcoming these challenges including funding to aid in the translation of research to commercial products general and targeted tax provisions incentives for capital formation increased support for development of manufacturing and testing infrastructure standards and nomenclature development and education and training creation of science technology and innovation parks and efforts to establish stable and predictable regulatory environment that keeps pace with innovation some support more limited federal role some who hold this view maintain that the market free from government interventions is most efficient they assert that federal efforts can create market distortions and result in the federal government picking winners and losers among technologies companies and industries others oppose federal support for industrial research and applications labeling such efforts corporate welfare still others argue for moratorium on nanotechnology rd until environmental health and safety concerns are addressed contents introduction 1 current and

promising areas of technological development and among the most likely to deliver substantial economic and societal benefits to the united states in the 21st century with so much potentially at stake global competition has emerged among nations and companies to develop and capture the value of nanotechnology products competitiveness generally refers to the comparative ability of nation or company to bring products or services to markets assessments of competitive strength generally rely on indicators such as revenues market share and trade however since nanotechnology is still largely in an early stage of development the us government does not collect this type of data for nanotechnology products in addition nanotechnology is not discrete industry but rather technology applied across wide range of products in disparate industries for which nanotechnology products generally account for small fraction of total sales for these reasons an assessment of us industrial competitiveness in nanotechnology in the same manner that analysts would assess the competitiveness of mature industries is not possible at this time alternatively this report reviews national nanotechnology research and development rd investments scientific papers and patents as indicators of current us scientific and technological competitiveness and potential indicators of future industrial competitiveness in nanotechnology products the federal government has played central role in catalyzing us rd efforts in 2000 president clinton launched the us national nanotechnology initiative nni the worlds first integrated national effort focused on nanotechnology the nni has enjoyed strong bipartisan support from the executive branch the house of representatives and the senate each year the president has proposed increased funding for federal nanotechnology rd and each year congress has provided additional funding since the inception of the nni congress has appropriated total of 84 billion for nanotechnology rd intended to foster continued us technological leadership and to support the technologys development with the longterm goals of creating highwage jobs economic growth and wealth creation addressing critical national needs renewing us manufacturing leadership and improving health the environment and the overall quality of life the united states is not alone in seeking to tap the perceived potential of nanotechnology following the creation of the nni more than 60 nations have established their own national nanotechnology initiatives many based on the us crs2 model estimated global annual public investments in nanotechnology including those of the united states reached 64 billion in 2006 with another 60 billion invested by the private sector1 in addition some countries have established strategic plans nanotechnologyfocused science technology and innovation parks venture capital funds and other policies and programs to accelerate the translation of nanotechnology research into products to exploit its economic potential these investments and policies coupled with generally optimistic expectations have raised interest and concerns about the global competitive position of the united states in the development and commercialization of nanotechnology in 2003 congress enacted the 21st century nanotechnology research and development act pl 108153 assigning responsibilities and initiating research efforts to address key challenges in the act congress explicitly established global technological leadership commercialization and national competitiveness as central goals of the nni national nanotechnology initiative the national nanotechnology initiative is federal government rd initiative coordinated by the white house involving 25 departments and agencies including 13 that conduct nanotechnology rd president bill clinton launched the nni in 2000 and congress provided 464 million in rd funding to nni agencies in fy2001 since then congress has more than tripled annual funding providing 149 billion in fy2008 bringing cumulative appropriations for nni activities to 84 billion president bush has requested 153 billion for the nni in fy2009 the nni budget is an aggregation of the nanotechnology components of the individual budgets of nniparticipating agencies the nni budget is not single centralized source of funds that is allocated to individual agencies in fact agency nanotechnology budgets are developed internally as part of each agencys overall budget development process these budgets are subjected to review revision and approval by the white house office of management and budget and become part of the presidents annual budget submission to congress the nni budget is then calculated by aggregating the nanotechnology components of the appropriations provided by congress to each federal agency in 2003 congress provided statutory foundation for some of the activities of the nni through the 21st century nanotechnology research and development act pl 108 153 the act established national nanotechnology program nnp and provided authorizations totaling 37 billion over four years fy2005fy2008 for five nni agencies the national science foundation department of energy nasa national institute of standards and technology and the environmental protection agency in total congress appropriated 29 billion for these agencies during this period or approximately 79 of total authorized funding the act did not address the participation of several agencies that fund nanotechnology rd under the nni including the department of defense national institutes of health and the department of homeland security 1 profiting from international nanotechnology lux research december 2006 p 2 crs3 the activities of the program shall include ensuring united states global leadership in the development and application of nanotechnology advancing the united states productivity and industrial competitiveness through stable consistent and coordinated investments in longterm scientific and engineering research in nanotechnology accelerating the deployment and application of nanotechnology research and development in the private sector including startup companies and encouraging research on nanotechnology advances that utilize existing processes and technologies congress has expressed interest in understanding whether the current level of appropriations and the portfolio of activities pursued by the nni is sufficient to achieve these goals there are variety of perspectives on the sufficiency and balance of activities and resources devoted to nanotechnology rd regulation and infrastructure this report provides an overview of nanotechnology current and anticipated applications indicators of us scientific and technological strength and issues and options congress may opt to consider for the federal role if any in promoting the nations competitive position in nanotechnology current and anticipated applications nanotechnology term encompassing nanoscale science technology and engineering involves the understanding and control of matter at scales between 1 and 100 nanometers nanometer is onebillionth of meter by way of comparison the width of human hair is approximately 80000 nanometers at this size the physical chemical and biological properties of materials can differ in fundamental and potentially useful ways from the properties of individual atoms and molecules on the one hand or bulk matter on the other hand nanotechnology research and development is directed toward understanding and creating improved materials devices and systems that exploit these properties as they are discovered and characterized2 most nanotechnology products currently on the market such as faster computer processors higher density memory devices better baseball bats lighterweight auto parts stainresistant clothing cosmetics and clear sunscreen are evolutionary in nature offering valuable but generally modest economic and societal benefits 2 the national nanotechnology initiative strategic plan nanoscale science engineering and technology subcommittee national science and technology council the white house december 2007 crs4 over the next five to ten years proponents see nanotechnology offering the potential for additional evolutionary improvements in existing products beyond the next ten years they believe that nanotechnology could deliver revolutionary advances that could transform or replace existing products and industries and create entirely new ones some hopedfor applications discussed by the technologys proponents involving various degrees of speculation and varying timeframes include new prevention detection and treatment technologies that reduce death and suffering from cancer and other deadly diseases3 new organs to replace damaged or diseased ones4 clothing that protects against toxins and pathogens5 clean inexpensive renewable power

public policy could affect the ability of the united states to capture the future economic and societal benefits associated with these investments congress established programs assigned responsibilities authorized funding levels and initiated research to address key issues in the 21st century nanotechnology research and development act the agency budget authorizations provided for in this act extend through fy2008 see text box national nanotechnology initiative for discussion of authorizations and appropriations14 both the house and senate have held committee hearings related to amending and reauthorizing this act in 2008 companion report crs report rl34401 the national nanotechnology initiative overview reauthorization and appropriations issues by john f sargent provides an overview of nanotechnology the history goals structure and federal funding of the national nanotechnology initiative and issues related to its management and reauthorization as the state of nanotechnology knowledge has advanced new policy issues have emerged in addition to providing funding for nanotechnology rd congress has directed increased attention to issues affecting the us competitive position in nanotechnology and related issues including nanomanufacturing commercialization environmental health and safety concerns workforce development and international collaboration views and options related to these issues are presented later in this report us competitiveness indicators nanotechnology is by and large still in its infancy accordingly measures such as revenues market share and global trade statistics indicators often used to assess and track us competitiveness in other technologies and industries are not available for assessing the us position in nanotechnology to date the federal government does not collect data on nanotechnologyrelated revenues trade or employment nor is comparable international government data available nevertheless many experts believe that the united states is the global leader in nanotechnology for example survey of us business leaders in the field of nanotechnology showed 63 believe that the united states is leading other countries 14 under the act congress authorized 37 billion over four years fy2005fy2008 for five nni agencies the national science foundation department of energy nasa national institute of standards and technology and the environmental protection agency in total congress appropriated 29 billion for these agencies during this period or approximately 79 of authorized funding several nni agencies including two with large nanotechnology rd budgets the department of defense and national institutes of health did not receive budget authorizations under the act crs6 in nanotechnology rd and commercialization while only 7 identified the united states as lagging behind other countries15 however some believe that in contrast to many previous emerging technologies such as semiconductors satellites software and biotechnology the us lead appears narrower and the investment level scientific and industrial infrastructure technical capabilities and science and engineering workforces of other nations are more substantial than in the past charles vest president of the national academies of engineering and member of the presidents council of advisors on science and technology pcast asserted early in 2008 that nanotechnology was the first emerging technology where we the united states dont have huge lead vest added that it was also the first emerging technology in which the federal governments efforts included commercialization as specific goal and thus was the first real test of the united states looselycoupled publicprivate partnership in the new competitive environment16 evidence of commercialization of nanotechnologybased products is generally available for example the woodrow wilson international center for scholars project on emerging nanotechnologies counts more than 600 companyidentified nanotechnology products on the market more than half of which are produced by companies based in the united states17 some private organizations have attempted to estimate current nanotechnologyderived revenues and to estimate future revenues for example lux research estimates that products incorporating nanotechnology produced 50 billion in global revenues in 200618 less than 01 of global manufacturing output and that by 2014 revenues will reach 26 trillion or 15 of projected global manufacturing output19 in the absence of comprehensive and authoritative economic output data eg revenues market share trade indicators such as inputs eg public and private research investments and nonfinancial outputs eg scientific papers patents are now used to gauge nations current and future competitive position in emerging technologies these indicators offer insights into nations scientific and technological strength which may serve as foundation for future product and process innovation 15 survey of us nanotechnology executives conducted by small times magazine and the center for economic and civic opinion at the university of

httpcommercesenategovpublic_filesluxresearchsenatecommercecommitteetesti mony4242008pdf crs7 however research and development investments scientific papers and patents may not provide reliable indicators of the united states current or future competitive position scientific and technological leadership may not necessarily result in commercial leadership andor in national competitiveness for the following reasons basic research in nanotechnology may not translate into viable commercial applications though formal assessment of the composition of the nni budget has been made there is general consensus that the nni investment since its inception has been focused on basic research the national science foundation defines the objective of basic research as seeking to gain more comprehensive knowledge or understanding of the subject under study without applications in mind20 therefore while basic research may underpin applied research development and commercialization that is not its primary focus or intent in general basic research can take decades21 to result in commercial applications and many advances in scientific understanding may not present commercial opportunities basic research is generally available to all competitors even when basic research presents the potential for commercial exploitation it may not deliver national advantage open publication and free exchange of research results are guiding principles of federally funded fundamental research22 and research conducted by us colleges and universities this approach may allow for the rapid expansion of global scientific and technical knowledge as new work is built on the scaffolding of previous work however the information is available to all competitors us and foreign alike and thus may not confer competitive advantage to the united states usbased companies may conduct production and other work outside of the united states in todays economy supply chains are global and the work required to develop design produce market sell and service products is generally conducted where it can be done most efficiently even if usbased companies successfully develop and bring nanotechnology materials and products to market work may be conducted and the economic value captured outside of the united states federal policies and investments may offer tools that can make the united states the most attractive place for companies to conduct greater share of value adding activities contributing to us economic growth and job creation 20 science and engineering indicators 2008 national science foundation january 2008 21 for example the first working fuel cell was built in 1843 but the first semicommercial use of fuel cell did not occur for more than hundred years when the technology was used in nasas project gemini space program even today commercial production and use of fuel cells is limited and federal technology development efforts continue 22 national security decision directive 189 states that it is the policy of this administration that to the maximum extent possible the products of fundamental research remain unrestricted the directive allows for restriction of some results through national security classification fundamental research is defined in the directive as including both basic and applied research in science and engineering but distinct from proprietary research and industrial development design production and product utilization for further information on us policy toward unrestricted access to federallyfunded fundamental research see crs report rl31695 balancing scientific publication and national security concerns issues for congress by dana shea crs8 useducated foreign students may return home to conduct research and create new businesses in the era following world war ii many of the most gifted and talented students from around the world were attracted to the science and engineering programs of us colleges and universities for many years many of those who graduated from these programs decided to stay in the united states and contributed to us global scientific engineering and economic leadership today many foreign students educated in the united states have economic opportunities in their home countries that did not exist for previous generations some nations are making strong appeals and offering significant incentives for their students to return home to conduct research and create enterprises thus federal support for universities in general and scientific and engineering research activities in particular may contribute to the development of leading scientists and engineers who might return to their home countries to exploit the knowledge capabilities and networks developed in the united states small businesses may lack the resources needed to bring their nanotechnology innovations to market federal programs such as the small business innovation research sbir program and the small business technology transfer sttr program support leadingedge nanotechnology research by small innovative firms federally funded university research can produce small startup ventures these small businesses may develop commercially valuable technology and even successfully develop new nanotechnology materials tools processes or products but lack the capital infrastructure or sales and distribution channels to effectively bring such advances to market us companies with leadingedge nanotechnology capabilities andor their intellectual property may be acquired by foreign competitors foreign companies may acquire leadingedge nanotechnology companies or their intellectual property this can take place for example as the result of an intentional business strategy to be acquired common exit strategy for startup companies hostile takeover if the enterprise is public company or when business has failed or is failing in the latter case the company or its intellectual property might be acquired at fraction of its development cost or potential value us policies or other factors may impede nanotechnology commercialization make it unaffordable or make it less attractive than foreign alternatives federal state and local policies eg taxes environmental and health regulations ethical restrictions and other factors eg availability quality and cost of labor proximity to markets customer requirements manufacturing infrastructure public attitudes may prevent or discourage commercialization of nanotechnology innovations in the united states companies may be prohibited from producing commercially viable product in the united states may be unable to do so affordably or may find comparatively favorable conditions eg lower taxes or tax holidays fewer regulatory restrictions qualified available and less costly workforce outside the united states comparisons of aggregate national data may be misleading for example small nation with limited resources may be unable to pursue leadingedge research across broad spectrum of nanotechnologyrelated disciplines and applications and instead opt to seek technological dominance in discreet area by investing in crs9 limited set of disciplines and applications or even single one in such case that country may become the strongest competitor in given area while analysis of aggregate numbers might obscure this strength alternatively rapidly developing nation may invest substantial capital in nanotechnology research but lack key elements such as strong scientific and technological infrastructure mature industry service and private capital infrastructure experienced scientists engineers managers and entrepreneurs andor marketoriented business climate needed to fully capitalize on such an investment in addition the concept of national competitive position may differ from the past as result of increased globalization of research technical talent and production for example the worlds leadingedge research in field of nanotechnology might be conducted at an american university by chinese students supported by research funds from germanbased corporation with engineering underway in russia plans to manufacture in taiwan shipping by greekflagged vessels and technical support provided online and by telephone from india in such an example the global distribution of knowledge workers investors and producers make the determination of national competitiveness more difficult just as other countries might benefit from us nanotechnology rd so too might the united states benefit from nanotechnology rd conducted in other nations through variety of means including studying published research results acquiring or licensing patents conducting joint business ventures and by fostering business environment that attracts production and related activities some economists assert that international rd collaboration can benefit the united states as well by improving the productivity of the rd process23 with these caveats the following section reviews input and noneconomic output measures as indicators of the us competitive position in nanotechnology 23 economic report of the president council of economic advisors the white house 1989 p 225 crs10 research and development investments24 national research and development investment is an input measure that may provide some perspective on how successful nation and the firms within the nation may become in producing scientific and technical knowledge that can lead to innovative products and processes however the longterm value of these investments may be affected by variety of factors such as the capability of the scientists and engineers conducting the rd and the tools available to them the efficiency of the system eg businesses supply chains infrastructure innovation climate government policies for translating rd results into commercial products the fields of nanoscience and nanotechnology pursued the balance in fundamental research applied research and development efforts and balance in rd directed at exploiting commercial opportunities meeting societal needs eg health environment addressing government missions eg defense homeland security and nondirected efforts to expand the scientific knowledge frontier public investments the united states has led and continues to lead all nations in public investments in nanotechnology rd however the estimated us share of global public rd investments in nanotechnology has fallen as other nations have established similar programs and increased funding in the early part of this decade many nations followed the us lead and established formal national nanotechnology programs in recognition of the potential contributions nanotechnology may offer for economic growth job creation energy production and energy efficiency environmental protection public health and safety and national security according to mike roco past chair of the national science and technology councils nstc nanoscale science engineering and technology nset subcommittee at least 60 countries have adopted national nanotechnology projects or programs25 japan germany and south korea are making substantial sustained investments across broad range of nanoscale science engineering and technology and are strong competitors for global leadership more recently china and russia have increased investments in nanotechnology in addition others such as israel singapore and taiwan have focused their resources on either 24 comparisons and aggregations of investments in rd across organizational and national boundaries are fraught with imprecision and inaccuracy one challenge with quantifying public or private investment in nanotechnology rd relates to the definition of nanotechnology used by different governments and institutions there is significant debate in and among federal agencies with respect to what should be considered and thus counted as nanotechnology rd not withstanding the nni definition as well as within and between companies industries and governments in addition to substantive definitional disagreements about nanotechnology some seek to take advantage of the cachet of the term nano or nanotechnology strong interest in nanotechnology on the part of policymakers investors and consumers may induce some to characterize nonnanotechnology activities or products as nanotechnology or to characterize an entire effort as nanotechnology rd when in fact only portion of it is devoted to nanotechnology conversely some firms may not characterize nanotechnology research efforts as nanotechnology out of concern for potential negative reactions from customers or unwanted regulatory attention 25 roco mc international perspective on government nanotechnology funding in 2005 journal of nanoparticle research 2005 vol 76 crs11 specific nanotechnology niche or on technology development in contrast to fundamental research26 lux research estimates that total 2006 public global rd investments increased 10 over the 2005 level reaching 64 billion international investment levels can be compared using differing methods producing substantially different perspectives on leadership for example using currency exchange rate comparison the united states ranks ahead of all others with federal and state investments of 178 billion in 2006 278 of global public rd investments followed by japan 975 million 152 and germany 563 million 88 when national investments are adjusted using purchasing power parity ppp exchange rates which seek to equalize the purchasing power of currencies in different countries for given basket of goods andor services27 china ranks second in public nanotechnology spending in 2006 at 906 million behind only the united states japan drops to third as its pppadjusted investment falls to 889 million28 comparative international public funding for nanotechnology rd is provided in table 1 table 1 top ten countries in public nanotechnology rd 2006 in millions of us dollars in millions of us dollars using currency exchange rates using ppp exchange rates united states 1775 united states 1775 japan 975

russia 184 source profiting from international nanotechnology lux research december 2006 26 ranking the nations nanotechs shifting global leaders lux research november 2005 p 2 27 the use of pppadjusted numbers may distort the comparative value of national rd investments since the basket of goods used to adjust prices generally which may include food and other consumer items may bear little resemblance to the goods and services purchased for nanotechnology research and development in addition while salaries of researchers in countries such as china may be lower than in other countries ie more research can be bought with dollar in china than in the united states the cost of nanotechnology research equipment is likely to be essentially the same in all countries 28 profiting from international nanotechnology lux research december 2006 pp 89 crs12 private sector investments private investments in nanotechnology rd come from two primary sources corporations and venture capital investors globally corporations invested an estimated 53 billion in nanotechnology research and development in 2006 this figure represents 19 increase over the 2005 estimate growth rate nearly twice that of global public rd investments29 faster growth in corporate rd may be an indicator that nanotechnology research is moving closer to commercial production as with public rd investments on ppp comparison basis the united states led the world in 2006 in private sector rd investments in nanotechnology with an estimated 19 billion investment led by companies such as hewlettpackard intel dupont general electric and ibm japans 17 billion in private investments in nanotechnology rd led by companies such as mitsubishi nec and hitachi ranks close second behind the united states the private investments of companies headquartered in these two nations account for nearly threefourths of corporate investment in nanotechnology rd in 2006 in contrast to its high ppp ranking in public rd investment china ranks fifth in corporate investment accounting for only about 3 of global private rd investments in nanotechnology30 strength in an existing industry base may be driver for private investment in nanotechnology innovations for example multiwalled carbon nanotubes mcwnts offer significant improvements in lithiumion liion battery life japans strength in liion batteries is seen as driving force in japans leading position in the manufacture of mwcnts and japanese companies investments in tonscale production capabilities31 venture capital investment earlystage equity investment generally characterized by high risk and high returns provides another possible indicator of international competitiveness in 2007 venture capital for nanotechnology reached an estimated 702 million worldwide of which usbased companies received 632 million approximately 9032 scientific papers the quantity of peerreviewed scientific papers published by scientists and engineers of each nation is one indicator of the scientific leadership of that nation the scientific journals used to generate such counts tend to be considered among the most reliable and prestigious in the fields nevertheless as tool for assessing national competitiveness this indicator has shortcomings for example paper counts do not assess the level or significance of contributions made by each of the authors while an article may list principal investigator such as university professor as the lead author the other authors possibly graduate students or postgrads from 29 profiting from international nanotechnology

important contributions to the work publication of scientific paper may also represent recognition of its unique scientific insights yet offer little or potential for useful applications or commercial relevance output of peerreviewed papers the united states leads all other nations in peerreviewed nanotechnology papers published in scientific journals national bureau of economic research nber analysis reported that the united states 24 share of global publication output was more than double that of the next most prolific nation china33 however this share represents decline from the early 1990s when the united states accounted for approximately 40 of nanotechnology papers the nber working paper concludes taken as whole these data confirm that the strength and depth of the american science base points to the united states being the dominant player in nanotechnology for some time to come while the united states also faces significant and increasing international competition34 quantitative analysis of published scientific papers comparing the united states to the europe union eu nations as whole was prepared by united kingdombased evaluametrics ltd following an inquiry from the congressional research service in december 200735 evaluametrics analysis shows that the number of nanotechnology papers more than doubled between 2000 and 2005 using fractional count of papers36 the united states maintained about 22 share of papers from 2000 to 2005 the eu27s37 share of papers fell from 32 to 25 during this period while chinas share rose from 11 to 20 viewed from this perspective the eu27 led the united states in output of nanotechnologyrelated scientific papers but the eu27 share has been in decline chinas share is approaching that of both the united states and the eu27 see figure 138 using an integer count with each paper assigned to the nation of the lead authors address yields similar results by this method the eu27 led the world in 2006 with

performed using information from thompson scientifics science citation index selecting papers based on two filters list of specialist journals and list of key nanorelated words in the title of the paper 36 using fractional count approach if paper has multiple authors of different nations fraction of the paper is assigned to each country in proportion to the nations listed in the authors addresses thus paper with three authors two of which list us addresses and one of which has an address in the united kingdom would be allocated as 067 twothirds of paper to the united states and 033 onethird of paper to the united kingdom 37 the eu27 represents the combined output for the 27 nations of the european union 38 for purposes of this analysis evaluametrics attributes taiwans data to china crs14 and china with approximately 23 evaluametrics analysis of preliminary data shows that china may have surpassed the united states in share of papers in 200739 evaluametrics analysis of the papers by scientific disciplines reveals regional differences the united states articles were more heavily weighted toward the biological and medical fields chinas toward chemistry and engineering and

canada citations to peerreviewed papers another measure of global leadership in nanotechnology is the quality and value of peerreviewed papers one measure of the quality and value of paper is the frequency with which it is cited in other peerreviewed papers evaluametrics analysis shows that papers attributed to the united states are much more frequently cited than those attributed to china the eu27 and the rest of the world as whole this held true overall and separately in each of the four disciplines examined biology chemistry engineering and physics40 the us lead was particularly pronounced in biology china fell below the world average number of citations in each of the four disciplines as well as overall the eu27 performed near the world average in engineering and physics and somewhat higher in chemistry using slightly different citation metric41 56 of us papers have 10 or more citations in contrast to only 38 for the eu27 and approximately 30 for china the netherlands and germany lead the eu27 in papers with 10 or more citations with approximately 45 each papers in highimpact journals second measure of the quality of nations papers is the share of its papers in influential journals review of science nature and physical review letters which pcast refers to as high impact journals shows the united states accounted for more than 50 of nanotechnologyrelated papers in these journals in 2004 however while the absolute number of papers in these journals attributed to the united states has grown 40 using the potential citation index metric based on the mean fiveyear citation counts to papers in the given journals 41 using the actual citation index metric for papers published in 2003 and cited between 2003 and 2007 crs16 continuously since 1991 the us share of papers has fallen as other countries collectively increased their production at an even faster rate42 patents patent counts assessments of how many patents are issued to individuals or institutions of particular country are another indicator used to assess nations competitive position according to the us patent and trade office uspto patent grants ownership rights to person who invents or discovers any new and useful process machine manufacture or composition of matter or any new and useful improvement thereof by this definition patents may be an indicator of future value and national strength in technology product or industry by this measure the united states position appears to be very strong united states assignees dominate all other countries in patents issued by the uspto according to an analysis by the uspto of patents in the united states and in other nations us origin inventors and assigneesowners have the most nanotechnologyrelated us patents by wide margin the most nanotechnologyrelated patent publications globally but by narrower margin followed closely by japan and the most nanotechnologyrelated inventions that have patent publications in three or more countries 317 an indication of more aggressive pursuit of international intellectual property protection and by inference of its perceived potential value by this measurement the united states is followed by japan 269 germany 113 korea 66 and france 3643 there has been rapid growth in nanotechnology patents in the uspto and european patent office epo patent databases 2007 study reports that the number of us nanotechnology patents in the uspto and epo databases grew at near exponential pace between 1980 and 2004 the study showed that each year since 1990 us assignees have accounted for approximate twothirds of all patents in the uspto database in 2004 us assignees accounted for 669 of uspto nanotechnology patents44 42 the national nanotechnology initiative at five years assessment

the united states accounting for more than 67 of patents based on full text search of patents for nanotechnologyrelated key words followed by japan germany france and canada in 2003 the united states japan germany canada and france continued to rank in the top five with the republic of korea and the netherlands jumping several spots each to sixth and seventh places respectively ireland and china made their first appearance in the top 20 nations with respect to patent citations by subsequent patents possible indicator of the usefulness of patent the study showed us nanotechnology patents dominated citations and reflected strong interactions with japanese and german patents45 patent counts however have shortcomings in assessing future competitiveness experience shows that not all patents have equal value some patents are blockbusters that largely define products and industries and result in substantial wealth creation and competitive advantage for its owners other patents are useful but offer only moderate value and some patents are never realized in materials products or processes patent counts do not attempt to assess the relative value of each patent instead assigning equal value to each thus nation with high patent count in nanotechnology may not benefit as much as nation with fewer but more valuable patents in addition companies may choose not to patent particular idea even one with significant value for variety of reasons for example public exposure of the idea as required by the patent application process may enable other companies to engineer around their patent finding way to do what the original patent accomplished but in way that is sufficiently different that it qualifies for new patent alternatively company may be able to block the original patent holder from further improvements by filing patent applications that essentially block out potential improvements or unscrupulous producers may ignore the patent and use the intellectual property without compensating the patent holder instead of filing for patent company may choose instead to hold valuable intellectual property as trade secret in contrast to patents which provide protection for defined periods trade secrets can extend indefinitely the cocacola company has held its formulas for coke as trade secret for over 100 years46 the federal role in us competitiveness issues and options congress has provided 84 billion in funding for nanotechnology rd under the national nanotechnology initiative and more than tripled annual funding since 45 huang

nanotechnology investments programs and policies stirring debate about how the federal government can best ensure us competitiveness in this field while there is broad consensus that us competitiveness in nanotechnology is important there are wide variety of views about the role the federal government could or should play in supporting this objective these perspectives are reflective of longrunning policy debates over the appropriate role of government in promoting research development innovation and industrial competitiveness some argue that the federal role should be limited to funding basic research rd needed to meet agency mission requirements and development of the us scientific and technical workforce47 some believe the federal government should also fund development efforts that move nanotechnology closer to commercial products especially in light of its potential economic and societal benefits48 others assert that the federal governments role in competitiveness should be limited to establishing healthy business environment and allowing market forces and the private sector to shape us competitiveness49 among those concerned about nanotechnologys potential adverse implications for health safety and the environment are those who support more active federal role in funding environmental health and safety ehs research to better understand characterize and regulate nanotechnology50 and those who prefer the federal government act to slow the development and commercialization of nanotechnology pending further ehs research51 47 vannevar bushs 1945 seminal report to president truman science the endless frontier advocated this approach to support both government mission needs and industrial requirements 48 this perspective is exemplified by president clintons first technology policy statement technology for americas economic growth new direction to build economic strength february 22 1993 the brookings institution also advocates this position 49 organizations such as the cato institute and the heritage foundation generally support such an approach 50 this position is held by many organizations including the woodrow wilson international center for scholars project on emerging nanotechnologies environmental defense and dupont 51 the etc group and natural resources defense council are advocates for this approach crs19 survey of industry views on the federal role survey of us nanotechnology business leaders indicated this community was divided on the desired level of government involvement in the development of nanomanufacturing technologies with 45 wanting government to take the lead in rd and commercialization incentives and 43 wanting limited participation another 11 of respondents said they wanted government to stay out of it among the most significant barriers to growth identified by us nanotechnology business leaders in survey conducted by small times magazine and the university of massachusettslowell were intellectual property issues 46 lack of financing 45 lack of available prototype facilities 43 and lack of nanotechnology safety standards 36 ninetytwo percent of respondents identified access to unique equipment and facilities as very important and 91 identified access to processes and tools to reduce timetomarket from rd as very important nearly three of five respondents indicated that they use or planned to use shared use facilities at local universities with science and engineering labs 25 electronic labs 24 and biotech labs 17 topping the list followed by specific diagnostic equipment 14 and microfabrication labs 12 more than threefourths of the nanotechnology executives surveyed identified internal rd as the primary source of expertise for the development of products and processes another 9 of executives identified industry associations or consortiums as their primary source of expertise while only 7 identified collaboration with universities source survey of us nanotechnology executives conducted by small times magazine and the center for economic and civic opinion at the university of massachusettslowell fall 2006 technology development much of the public dialogue on how the government can advance us strength in nanotechnology has focused on federal technology funding advocates for increased federal support put forth variety of arguments some believe that the federal government should provide increased funding for downstream research ie applied research and development closer to commercial products including production prototypes52 those who advocate this position generally assert that many promising research breakthroughs and early technology developments fail to make it to market this failure they argue results from inadequate funding mechanisms to bring the technology to state of maturity in which private corporations and other sources of capital are willing to invest in the technology or in the company that holds the technology to bring it to market for example they assert that investor demand for shortterm returns can result in companies being unable to invest in higherrisk longerterm technology development projects needed to sustain their viability in the future similarly according to these advocates venture capitalists and other investors often have exit strategies andor seek returns in timeframe generally three to five years inconsistent with the 52 this position is held by many small technology businesses and startups crs20 longerterm development horizons of emerging and enabling technologies with federal investments say supporters technical risk could be reduced to level that enables promising research and earlystage technologies to overcome the valley of death53 and reach the marketplace where the nation would be able to capture their economic and societal benefits one rationale offered by some economists for federal funding of rd is that the private sector underinvests in rd because many of the benefits economic and societal are captured by others particularly where the results cannot be easily appropriated for production and profit54 however as research moves closer to commercialization private sector incentives to invest increase and the rationale for federal rd funding is diminished another argument for government rd funding put forth by economists and others is that the development of emerging and enabling technologies may be beyond the ability of any single company or industry to develop due to high cost high risk lack of requisite expertise and an inability to capture adequate returns while single company or industry may not be able to achieve adequate returns across its limited line of products and services the economic benefits that accrue across all industries may be sufficient even sweeping another justification for federal funding say advocates is that institutional legal cultural and other barriers may inhibit or prevent all parties from working together to share the costs and risks of rd the national cooperative research act of 1984 pl 98462 and the national cooperative production amendments of 1993 pl 10342 sought to spur collaborative research and manufacturing efforts by lowering legal barriers opposition to expanded federal rd efforts stem from variety of perspectives including those who believe that such efforts may be ineffective or counterproductive view held by many economists the best way to deal with the many changes in demand that occur in dynamic economy is to allow investors and workers to respond to such changes government allocation of investment that ignores market signals usually stunts growth by diverting labor and capital from more productive uses an industrial policy that increases government planning government subsidies and international protectionism would only be burden on our economic life and threat to our longterm economic prosperity55 53 the valley of death is term applied to the period in the innovation process generally between development of laboratory prototype and its widescale commercial adoption the term is an analogy intended to highlight the difficulties in overcoming barriers to innovation by evoking comparison to the crossing of barren desert strewn as one writer says with the carcasses of great innovations 54 economic report of the president council of economic advisors the white house 1989 p 223 55 economic report of the president council of economic advisors the white house continued crs21 some economists assert that public rd funding displaces private rd investment in his book the economic laws of scientific research cambridge university scientist terence kealey argues that public rd funding actually decreases overall rd funding as companies reduce their rd investments and rely on public investments56 other research suggests that evidence of displacement is ambiguous57 opponents also argue that industry not government is best suited to make commercial technology decisions citing the failure of some highprofile commerciallydirected government efforts such as the concorde supersonic transport aircraft failed effort of the governments of the united kingdom and france opponents further contend that governments responding to political interests not market signals have often continued to invest in technologies such as those supported by the us synfuels program that have been proven by markets and technological developments to be economically unsound58 libertarian opposition to increased federal rd such as that put forth by the cato institute is grounded in philosophy of limited government and reliance on the free market libertarians generally assert that markets free from government interventions are the most effective mechanism for allocating resources to the most promising opportunities in their view government interventions represent an industrial policy in which the preferences of politicians and bureaucrats are substituted for market forces andor objective criteria when the federal government provides direct andor indirect financial support to particular technology59 assert these advocates it may not only provide direct benefit to the technology especially with respect to existing technology or alternatives but it may also signal technology developers and investors that the technology may receive future preferential treatment by government as well this may as result skew corporate development activities and private investments toward lesspromising directions producing more costly andor less beneficial results many libertarians also see government financial support for technology development as an inappropriate involuntary transfer of wealth from taxpayers to private interests including large highly profitable companies the cato institute has labeled such efforts corporate welfare and has expressed concerns that such 55 continued 1984 p 88 56 kealey terrence the economic laws of scientific research new york

companies and industries as well crs22 efforts may create an unhealthy relationship between government and industry that might corrupt both60 options for federal efforts to support technology development include both direct support and indirect support direct support there are variety of mechanisms that the federal government might use to support downstream research some favor direct approach with the federal government providing grants or loans to companies universities and or consortia to support research and development activities that move their work closer to commercial production examples of this approach include the national institute of standards and technologys nist technology innovation program tip its defunct predecessor the advanced technology program atp also administered by nist and the multiagency small business innovation research sbir program according to nist the mission of tip is to accelerate innovation in the united states through highrisk highreward research in areas of critical national need61 as originally conceived atp was intended to support the development of emerging and enabling technologies that offered the potential for significant economic andor societal returns to the nation the sbir program operating at each of the major rd funding agencies provides funding to help advance technology development with goal of commercialization for additional information see crs report 96402 small business innovation research program and crs report rs22815 the technology innovation program both by wendy h schacht indirect support in addition to direct funding mechanisms variety of indirect approaches might be used by the federal government if it chose to support additional nanotechnology research and development the tax code could be used to increase private investment in nanotechnology companies or to create incentives for companies to expand and accelerate their research development and production activities tax options might include general provisions to induce greater corporate investment such as the current research and experimentation re tax credit62 targeted tax provisions that support particular technology application industry or sector consumer tax deductions or credits designed to induce the purchase of targeted technologies and products such as tax credits currently provided for the purchase of hybrid and flexfuel vehicles or incentives for the formation of capital pools to support rd such as favored tax treatment for research and development limited partnerships rdlps for additional information see crs report rl31181 research and experimentation tax credit current status and selected issues for congress by gary guenther 60 cato handbook on policy 6th edition the cato institute 2005 61 nist website httpwwwnistgovpublic_affairstiphtm 62 the re tax credit is often referred to as the rd tax credit though its provisions do not extend to development activities crs23 infrastructure development another option for federal support proposed by some in industry is increased investments in infrastructure and supporting technologies to reduce the cost of and to accelerate applied research and development candidate activities for such support include modeling prototyping testing and materials characterization facilities measurement tools and sensors standards reference materials and nomenclature development in addition state and local governments in the united states as well as foreign governments have established science technology and innovation parks both specialized and general to foster innovation some nanotechnology advocates believe the federal government should provide funding for the planning and development of nanotechnologyfocused parks that offer land facilities equipment and services to new emerging and established companies and that bring together variety of stakeholders with unique capabilities and interests some in the private sector have also sought increased federal efforts to protect the intellectual property rights of inventors and companies including increasing the speed and quality of the patent process and protecting the rights of us patent holders against infringement and abuse by actors in other nations the uspto an nniparticipating agency has undertaken efforts to educate its patent examiners on nanotechnology established separate class for nanotechnology class 977 and created over 250 crossreference subclasses to improve the ability to search and examine nanotechnologyrelated patent documents63 addressing regulatory concerns environmental health and safety ehs concerns also present potential barriers to nanotechnology commercialization and us competitiveness in nanotechnology the properties of nanoscale materials eg small size high surface areatovolume ratio unique chemical electric optical and biological characteristics that have given rise to great hopes for beneficial applications have also given rise to concerns about their potential implications for health safety and the environment ehs issues have become specific concern of the national nanotechnology initiative in fy2008 the nni will spend 586 million on ehs research accounting for about 39 of nni funding president bush has requested 764 million for nni ehs research in fy2009 or 50 of nni funding some believe that these funding levels are too low and should amount to 10 or more of nni funding the potential for adverse effects on health safety and the environment may discourage investment in and development of nanotechnology resulting from the possibility of regulations that bar products from the market or impose excessive regulatory compliance costs and the potential for costly product liability claims and cleanup costs if us regulations are restrictive and expensive companies may move nanotechnology research development and production to nations that do not impose or enforce regulations or take less stringent approach to regulation many 63 uspto website httpwww1usptogovwebpatentsbiochempharmcrossrefhtm crs24 advocates in industry academia and environmental nongovernmental organizations believe the federal government should increase its ehs rd investments to reduce uncertainty inform the development of regulations and protect the public regulation of nanotechnology products may fall under the authorities of several federal agencies including the environmental protection agency food and drug administration occupational safety and health administration and consumer product safety commission for additional information see crs report rl34332 engineered nanoscale materials and derivative products regulatory challenges and crs report rl34118 the toxic substances control act tsca implementation and new challenges both by lindajo schierow beyond support for research and development the federal role in variety of other policy and programmatic activities might be strengthened for example some argue for the use of specialized extension centers both universitybased and independent centers to provide technical and ehs best practices information to small and mediumsize manufacturers that lack the inhouse expertise and resources of larger enterprises usdas agricultural extension service and nists manufacturing extension partnership mep may serve as possible models for such efforts in addition some experts advocate efforts to create regulatory processes that can keep pace with rapid technological change and help create more predictable environment for those investing in nanotechnology development and commercialization another potential regulatory barrier to nanotechnology development and commercialization is overregulation of the export of nanotechnology and nanotechnologyrelated products due to their potential military applications such restrictions or even the anticipation of them might impede investment in and development of nanotechnology since global revenues may account for significant share of expected return on investment in this regard the department of commerce asked the presidents export council pec presidential advisory committee to undertake efforts to ensure that nanotechnology products were not unnecessarily restricted from sale to other nations under export control regulations in december 2005 the pec sent letter to president bush recommending principles for the federal governments approach to export controls to maximize us companies access to global markets consistent with the protection of national and homeland security64 in february 2008 the commerce departments bureau of industry and security announced its intent to establish an emerging technologies and research advisory committee etrac comprised of representatives of research universities government laboratories and industry to make recommendations regarding emerging technologies including nanotechnology65 64 transcript of presidents export council meeting dirksen senate office building washington dc december 6 2005 httpwwwitadocgovtdpec12605transcripthtml 65 private communication between crs and the bureau of industry and security us department of commerce may 9 2008 crs25 workforce development ensuring the united states has cadre of worldclass scientists engineers and technicians an asset deemed critical to us innovation and competitiveness has been an enduring concern of congress generally66 and now specifically with respect to nanotechnology advocates for this position assert the need for federal support for curricula development as well as scholarships and expanded efforts to encourage students to pursue associate bachelors and advanced degrees in nanotechnologyrelated disciplines international coordination and cooperation some nanotechnology advocates want the federal government to work with other nations to ensure level playing field for nanotechnology development and commercialization ie to ensure they are not put at disadvantage by government subsidization of their foreign competitors less stringent regulatory standards fewer worker protections andor imposition of tariffs and nontariff trade barriers to develop common international standards and nomenclature to harmonize regulations and to open markets for nanotechnology products reassessing and realigning resources as discussed above the federal government is engaged in fostering the advancement of nanotechnology across broad range of activities including conducting and supporting nanotechnology rd seeking to address environmental health and safety issues preparing students and workers for nanotechnology job opportunities through investments in education and training fostering public understanding and engagement coordinating and cooperating with other nations and promoting the development of standards nomenclature and reference materials these activities involve substantial investments of capital personnel facilities equipment and other resources many nni activities have developed over time to address new challenges and opportunities as the nni advanced resource allocation decisions have been made piecemeal generally without consideration for alternative uses of the resources over time such an approach may produce portfolio of activities that is out of balance with current needs more than seven years into the nni some observers believe that reassessing and realigning resources with opportunities and challenges would improve the efficiency and effectiveness of federal investments and activities however there are substantial barriers to such an effort first the nni is not funded centrally but rather is an aggregation of the resources provided to agencies to meet their mission requirements moving funds from one program or agency to another might meet with resistance within agencies between agencies or from the congressional appropriations subcommittees with jurisdiction for these programs and agencies second agencies participate in the nni on voluntary basis if it appears 66 for additional information see crs report rl34328 america competes act programs funding and selected issues by deborah d stine crs26 that participation in the nni might reduce funding an agency may choose to longer participate or may not classify its activities as nanotechnology third the nni seeks to meet multiple goals including scientific leadership meeting agency mission requirements and national needs and fostering us commercial leadership relative values have been explicitly set for these and other goals making comparative resource allocation choices subjective the national research council nrc67 and the national nanotechnology advisory panel nnap68 have each conducted assessments of the nni at the direction of congress as specified in the 21st century nanotechnology research and development act the act requires assessments to be performed triennially by the nrc and biennially by the nnap past assessments have addressed us competitiveness in nanotechnology as part of wider reviews to clarify the us competitive position congress could opt to direct the nrc nnap or the us government accountability office to conduct focused assessment of the effectiveness of the nni in achieving the global technological leadership commercialization and national competitiveness goals established under the act whether the current portfolio of nni resources and activities are appropriately balanced and whether additional resources activities may be required to achieve these objectives concluding observations nanotechnology is expected by many to deliver significant economic and societal benefits the united states launched the first national nanotechnology initiative in 2000 but has since been joined by more than 60 other nations tens of billions of dollars have been invested in nanotechnology research and development over the past eight years by governments companies and investors while it has been estimated that there are more than 600 nanotechnology products on the market today most involve incremental improvements to existing products much of the investment has been focused on fundamental research to gain scientific understanding of nanoscale phenomena and processes and to learn how to manipulate matter at the nanoscale these investments are expected by many to deliver revolutionary changes in products and industries with implications for global technological economic and military leadership the potential implications of nanotechnology coupled with the substantial sustained investments have raised concerns and interest in the us competitive position in nanotechnology the data typically used to assess technological competitiveness in mature industries eg revenues market share trade is not available to assess the us 67 the national research council functions under the auspices of the national academy of sciences the national academy of engineering and the institute of medicine 68 in july 2004 president bush designated the presidents council of advisors on science and technology to serve as the nnap by issuing executive order 13349 amending executive order 13226 to designate the presidents council of advisors on science and technology to serve as the national nanotechnology advisory panel crs27 position in nanotechnology because it is new technology commercial products are just beginning to enter the market in significant manner and it is incorporated in wide array of products across many industries accordingly the federal government currently does not collect this data on nanotechnology nor do other nations the number of nanotechnology products in the marketplace is increasing quickly though congress may elect to ask federal agencies to assess what data eg economic labor force students would be useful in formulating federal policies and making resource allocation decisions and direct federal statistical agencies to collect analyze and make public such data the federal government may also seek to foster data collection efforts in other nations in the absence of such data assessments of nanotechnology depend largely on alternative indicators such as inputs eg public and private investments and non economic outputs eg scientific papers patents by these measures the united states appears to lead all other nations in nanotechnology though the us lead in this field may not be as large as it has been in previous emerging technology areas this is due to increased investments and capabilities of many nations based on recognition that technological leadership and commercialization are primary paths to increased economic growth improved standards of living and job creation nevertheless these alternative indicators may not present an accurate view of technological leadership and economic competitiveness for many reasons nor does national technological leadership alone guarantee that the economic value produced by nanotechnology innovations will be captured within nations borders in todays global economy companies have the option of locating work eg research development design engineering manufacturing product support where it can be done most effectively variety of federal policy issues may affect the development and commercialization of nanotechnology in the united states including the magnitude and focus of research and development efforts the regulatory environment and science and engineering workforce development some support an active federal approach others believe that more limited federal involvement is likely to be more successful and equitable in addition to these factors us competitiveness in nanotechnology will depend not just on the efforts of the united states but also on the speed and efficacy of foreign nanotechnology development efforts congress established legislative foundation for some of the activities of the national nanotechnology initiative and to address key issues associated with nanotechnology thorough enactment of the 21st century nanotechnology research and development act 2003 the act provided funding authorizations for five nni agencies through fy2008 action is being considered in both the house and senate on possible amendments to and reauthorization of the program congress may opt to address some or many of the issues identified in this paper in the course of deliberation on the reauthorization of this act or alternatively in separate legislation for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34493
