assistance program updated may 21 2002 jonathan sanford specialist in international political economy foreign affairs defense and trade divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31418world bank funding idas assistance program summary during the past decade the world banks concessional loan facility the international development associati on ida has relied increasingly on loan repayments reflows to fund its assist ance program by co mmitting future reflows to fund current projects as they are disbursed the world bank and its member countries have raised to nearly 40 the share of idas current loan program funded with reflows in future years as the stock of future anticipated reflows becomes increasingly obligated to pay for projects approved earlier ida will be relying more on its reserves to fund its future lending program under current policies idas cash balance will decline from 1178 billion 2001 to about 14 billion 2013 and then will roughly stabilize for several decades the world bank and its member countries anticipate that loan repaymen ts will account for 70 of the resources needed to fund idas loan program between 2032 and 2041 this effort is complicated by the parallel effort of the world bank and its member countries to provide debt forgiveness to heavily indebted poor countries hipcs to date the world bank has forgiven over 9 billion in ida debt owed by hipc countries it has booked most of this debt but because most of the repayments are not due for many years it s not yet realized most of the loss the world banks plan to make ida mostly selfsustaining in the future assumes that donor countries will reimburse its hipc debt forgiveness in full if the forgiven loan reflows are not restored ida will deplete its cash balance in 2009 and need to start shrinking its aid program the cost of funding the lost reflows will be roughly 500 million to 600 million year for the next 20 years the united states typically has provided about 20 of the money to fund hi pc multilateral debt relief thus making this an important issue for congress likewise the administration and others have proposed that ida adopt major grant program for poor countries the scope and details of the plan are currently under negotiation by donor countries grant program will need to be funded by contributions from donor countries or ida w ill need to start reducing the size of its future program in anticipation of lost reflow income estimates of the size of the cost of the administrations proposed grant progra m differ much of the difference in the estimates is due to the methods used for pr esenting the estimates rather than to major differences in the size of the expected costs crs and gao both estimate that the cost of the administrations grant pr ogram could be funded in full if donors contributed between 16 and 18 more each year compound interest as such they would need to contribute between 64 billion and 71 billion more during the next 40 years this would be 40 to 45 increase in the donors overall contributions to fund the ida program based on prior practice the united states would likely be asked to pr ovide 20 of that total basically the goal of making ida more selffunding through reflows and the goal of reducing recipient countries repa yment obligations are incompatible the united states and other donor countries may need to decide which goal to favor whether to fund ida debt forgiveness and gr ants with increased contributions or to allow the overall size of idas assistance program diminish in future

bank funding idas assistance program introduction the international development associa tion ida is the component of the world bank that makes concessional loans to the worlds poorest countries ida gets most of the new money it uses to f und its assistance programs from contributions by donor countries such as the united stat european countries and japan ida lends on easy repayment terms with intere st charge and repaym ents stretched over 35 to 40 years including ten year grace pe riod it levies 34 of 1 service charge on the disbursed balance for its loans to help offset ida administrative expenses this paper analyzes the way idas ssistance program is funded and at the effort by donor countries and the world ba nk to have loan repa yments reflows carry an increased share of ida costs it also explores the potential longterm effects that debt forgiveness and major grant pr ogram might have on idas finances ida has forgiven substantial amounts of debt owed to it by heavily indebted poor countries hipcs the question whether th costs of that debt relief will be borne by ida or by donor countries has not yet been resolved likewise president bush has proposed that ida institute major program of grants to poor countries currently ida makes only loans the costs of this initiative and the way it would be funded have likewise not yet b een determined in its ex amination of the two issues debt forgiveness and grants the paper discusses the likely cost the united states and other donors would need to bear if th ey chose to support the costs of ida debt forgiveness or ida grants themselves for fiscal 2003 the administration has requested appropriations of 874 million for contribution to ida contribution levels will likely remain at this level or perhaps increase in future years in recent years congress has also appropriated about 775 million to fund multila teral debt forgiveness to hipc countries proposals for further hipc debt relief and new ida grant program are currently under consideration and will lik ely require additional us contributions in future years future us contributions or changes in ida or the hipc program will need the consent of congress shifts in the way these programs ar funded could have substantial impact on prospec tive levels of support funding idas current program every three years as idas stock of uncommitted resources declines donors meet to negotiate terms for replenishment of idas resources since ida was created in 1960 there have been twelve such replenishments new replenishment plan ida 13 to fund ida operations during the next three year period ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31418crs2 1throughout this paper one sdr is valued at 1253 this makes easier the comparison of numbers from one replenishment to the other the world bank has used this procedure in its consultations with member countri about longterm ida funding planscurrently being negotiated legislation to authorize us participation and us contributions to the plan likely will be submitted to congress in june 2002 in the past most of the money ida had available to lend during each replenishment period the three years funde d by replenishment plan typically came from donors funds from loan repayments we re also used to support new loans but the amount received annually from this sour ce was relatively small during the past decade however the volume of reflows has increased substantially in 1992 the ida donor countries adopted new plan i n ida 10 to enhance through advanced commitment the role that reflows will play in idas operations ida previously waited until reflows were in hand before adding them to the stock of resources available to finance future loans under the advanced commitment plan reflows received during the next decade are counted as support for an ida replenishment plan if they are used to pay for di sbursements on projects approved during that replenishment period because ida only releases funds as implementation goes forward the disbursements for an ida pr oject may be stretched out over six to eight year period even though the amount being receive d as reflows during threeyear replenishment period is relatively small the share of ida disbursements funded by reflows has increased substantially in ida 10 ida loan commitments made during the period 1994 to 1996 were funded with 163 billion in new contributions from donors and 31 billion in advan ced commitments of reflows1 in other words reflows accounted for about 16 of the res ources used to fund ida 10 in ida 11 1997 to 1999 idas loan program recei ved 986 billion in new contributions from donors and 65 billion in advanced commitment of reflows another 163 billion in ida 11 projects was funded with money carried over from earlier replenishments on this basis mitting the carryover to avoid double counting reflows accounted for 40 of ida di sbursements during the ida 11 period however since actual reflows received dur ing those three years amounted to only 239 billion ida needed to use 31 billion in future reflows to fund disbursements on ida 11 projects in ida 12 2000 to 2002 new contributions amounted to 1244 billion while reflows covered 64 billion in future ida 12 disbursements in effect reflows provided about 34 of the funds needed to pay for ida 12 loans as ida was scheduled to receive 446 billion in refl ows during that three year period ida would need 194 billion in future reflows to pay ida 12 costs in ida 13 currently under negotiation donors including the ib rd would provide 137 billion in new money and internal resources reflows plus reserves poi nt to be discussed later would comprise 89 billion on this ba sis reflows and other internal ida resources would account for over 47 of ida 12s total cost httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31418crs3 idas ability to commit future reflows to fund its current loan program is facilitated by the nature of ida reflows on average 95 of the amount due from borrowers is repaid on time and in full mo st of the countries not paying have in effect national government or their g overnment is seriously estranged from the world system table 1

2001 unpublished source created by crs using data supplie d by world bank as discussed in text at the beginning of july 2001 ida had uncommitted financ ial resources on hand totaling 1178 billion it also had 924 billion in donor pledges in non negotiable noninterest bearing notes whic h had not yet been encashed ida cannot require that its donors turn their contribu tion pledges into actual money right away rather the donors notes must be drawn down over 9 year period according to specified schedule idas cash balance uncommited financial resources has grown gradually over the years because contributions have come in at the scheduled rate reflows have increased and disbursements seem to have been somewhat less than originally expected the latter appears to be due partly to difficulties the bank has had implementing complex projects in di fficult contexts ida had over 20 billion in undisbursed loans commitments in 2002 some 19 of all loan commitments to date and partly to the dip in ida loan commitments which occurred in the late 1990s table 1 seeks to present picture of i das financial situation for the next 40 years as with all projections the data are strongly dependant on the accuracy of the original numbers and the strength of th underlying assumptions the calculations here are based on data or assumptions provided by the world bank2 contributions include planned future transf ers from ibrd net income as well as contributions from governments operations and administra tive costs would increase by 23 annually per the expected rate of inflation cont ributions from donors would remain the same in nominal terms investment held in the cash balance are assumed to earn 5 annually income from the ida service charge would continue to be 34 of 1 of the disbursed balance disburse ment figures were the only da ta not specifically defined by world bank data or assumptions th us general accounting office gao provided estimates for annual disbursements from future replenishments based on standard world bank procedures the author adjusted disbursement levels for years 2002 to 2021 funded with new and old money in order to keep idas cash balance each year at the level projected by the bank future disbursement data reflows for 2022 to 2041 were generated by the assumptions built into the model estimates for future reflows were calculated using the disbursement data for the first two decades and standard disbursement and repayment formulas according to the world bank ida will fund much of its future loan program through substantial reductions in its cash balance over the next 12 years ida plans to reduce its cash balance from 1178 billi on 2001 to 14 billion 2013 during those years ida will disburse 1 billion or more annually than it receives in incomehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31418crs5 idas cash balance will remain favorable through most of the 2020s but will begin sinking in the last years of the decade according to the model disbursements will need to be constrained in the 2030s if ida is not to run out of money idas cash balance is its protection against continge ncies its margin of error against unexpected events whether idas future assistance program will be funded substantially by reflows in the next two decades is matter of semantics given the many sources of funds that have contribut ed to the current cash balance major share of idas reflows during the next decade have already been committed to fund earlier replenishments the world bank assumes that ida resources in real terms will remain the same size they are now for the next 40 years loan disbursements and administrative costs will grow by 23 nnually per expected inflation while donor contributions would remain flat in nominal terms the bank presumes that all else being equal loan disbursements and other non donor sources of revenue w ill provide 70 of the money ida will need to fund its loan pr ogram during the last decade 2032 to 2041 of this period funding idas program hipc this is the point in the present discu ssion where the issue of debt forgiveness to poor countries through the hipc program and possible ida grants becomes important both initiatives would reduce th amount of reflows that ida receives in future years shifting the burden ither to donors need for increased contributions or to recipien ts smaller ida assistance program the data provided by the world bank shown in table 1 assume that there will be significant idahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31418crs6 3 world bank ida funding scheme p 9 among the specific assumptions for the banks funding plan is statement that costs of hipc debt service forgiveness are covered by ibrd net income pledge and s ubsequently by additional donor contributions future ibrd contributions to ida are in cluded in the model but not future ibrd contributions to hipc the bank assumes that coverage of past and future hipc forgiveness by the ibrd and by new donor cont ributions is prerequisite not included in the data to the arrangements specified in its new 40 year plan 4 table 2 shows the key changes that would ccur in table 1 if the reduction in reflows caused by hipc debt forgiveness were added to ida costs if that additional cost were added to table 1 the cash balance bottom line figure would change to reflect the data shown in table 2 grant program and that ida is reimburse d in full by donor c ountries for all the debts it has forgiven the hipc countries3 through december 31 2001 the world bank has forgiven or is forgiving 102 billion in debt owed to ida through the hipc program to offset some of these costs it received 778 million in reimbursements from the hipc trust f und the cost to ida for debt forgiveness occurs not in the year when the forgiveness is announced but in the year when ida would have otherwise received the loan repayment ida has booked net loss of 86 billion in hipc forgiveness more will be booked in the future but to date it s only realized small portion of the loss table 2 projected ida cash balance 20022021 without hipc reimbursement billions of us dollars 2002200320042005200620072008200920102011 hipc lost reflows 032 036 044 048 052 055 058

the lost reflows from hipc are not reimbursed and ida has to absorb the cost from its own resources for simplicity only the results of the calculation are presented4 idas cash balance will become negative in 2009 in that situation the difference between th annual balances in table 2 and those in table 1 represent the cumulative amount ida would need to receive from some other source if it were to hold the size of its aid program unchanged despite the shortfall in reflows the world bank was unable to provide data on the impact that hipc would have on ida reflows beyond 2021 the world bank says that it plans to contribute between 200 million and 220 million to hipc in the next four yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31418crs7 5 the world bank promised its member c ountries that it would contribute 215 billion in net present value npv terms over time to th hipc trust fund to date the world bank has transferred 14 billion from ibrd net income not reserves to the hipc trust fund the remainder would be contributed by 2005 see world bank heavily indebted poor countries hipc initiative status of implementation march 22 2002 idasecm2002 0155 prepared for the development committee meeting april 21 2002 see paragraph 23 also available from the bank web site the bank says that this will permit the ida component of the hipc trust fund to reimburse ida for ida debt through the end of ida 13 the bank says that it expects that ida donors will consider the future needs for funding idas hipc costs in the ida 14 negotiations during ida 13 upcoming the ida donors also reportedly plan to contribute 627 milli on to cover such costs during the ida 13 replenishment period this amount is not included in the income data for table 2 the donor countries reportedly plan to cover s ubsequent shortfalls in hipc funding on payasyougo basis though final agreem ent on this point has been postponed until the negotiations on ida 14 in 2005 6 the total reduction in ida reflows due to hipc for the years 2002 to 2021 is 1024 billion with net present value npv of 56 billion not all of this cost has yet been booked the world bank has identified sources of funding for some of this however its unfunded hipc liability is 86 billion in nominal terms about 45 billion in npv termsthrough 2005 completing its pledge to pr ovide substantial ib rd contributions to that program5 this amount is included in th income calculation for table 2 there appear to be three ways ida can deal with that situation first it can shrink the size of its annual ida aid program by an amount equivalent to the lost hipc reflows second the lost refl ows can be reimbursed to ida by donor countries third ida can seek funds from some other source in the world bank or in another international financial institution to cover the shortfall reducing the size of the ida program c ould save money but it could also have negative effects on recent hipc graduates and other poor countries if donors wish to offset the lost hipc reflows they would need to contribute 864 billion over 20 years6 if they fund the loss each year as it ccurs they would need to contribute the amounts shown in table 2 alternatively if they chose to fund the lost revenues up front they could make onetime payment of 56 billi on invested at 63 this would generate enough revenue principal and interest to offset the lost revenues in each future year based on recent precedents the likely cost to the united states in either case would be about 20 of the total the world bank has substantial assets in its reserves however these are assets of its nearmarket loan facility the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd transferring them to ida may be difficult from legal and political perspective it would require supermajority vote of the membership it may engender lawsuits by bank bondholders it would likely drive up interest rates the bank would need to pay to borrow funds and if distribution of assets is triggered it would require an appropriation by congress to transfer the us share of those assets several billion dollars to the ida funding idas program grantshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31418crs8 7us general accounting office developing countries switching some multilateral loans to grants lessens p oor country debt burdens april 2002 gao02593 the present author thanks gao analysts for several helpful suggestions received during his preparation of this crs report 8 the methodology for table 3 is the same as th at for table 2 it shows the changes which would occur in idas bottom line cash balance if the lost reflows attributable to grant program comparable to that proposed by the administration were added to idas costs 9 not shown in table 3 are the likely consequen ces according to the model if ida tried to do hipc debt relief and major grant program simultaneously without offsetting contributions by donors in that case ida s cash balance would become negative in 2009 and the total would reach minus 10 billion by 2021 without data on hipc losses beyond that point it is impossible to determine what the balance would be in 2041 it would likely be more substantial though than that shown in table 3 in july 2001 president george w bush proposed that up to half the aid the world bank provided to poor countries in futu re years should be in the form of grants rather than lowcost concessional loans the president said that such change in ida procedures would help lessen the bt burden on poor countries provide means for greater effectiveness and accountability and put increased emphasis on assistance for education health and sanitation critics of the proposal say it could lead to conflict and competition with other international programs divert attention from povertyalleviation and other concerns and require substa ntial new contributions by donors if the proposed grant program is not funded they add it would substantially undercut the financial basis of ida and force substantial cu ts or termination of its aid program in future years the british and other european governments have been particularly critical of the proposed plan negotiations to seek compromise and resolution of the issue are currently underway for further discussion see crs report rl31136 world bank ida loans or ida grants many analysts have sought to determine the likely cost and financial feasibility of the presidents proposal for ida grants the world bank says the cost would be about 100 billion in nominal dollars of th is 59 billion was actual lost repayments and 41 billion was foregone interest inco ida would have received if those reflows had been invested until used th rough idas cash balance gao says the cost would be 156 billion in net presen t value npv terms for the whole 100 billion and 97 billion in npv terms for the actual lost reflows7 it is important to note that the gao and world bank estimates are basically the same the banks approach counts the cost as it occurs over the 40 year period the gao concept accounts for the time value of money in ffect it presumes that the costs identified by the bank could be covered if 97 b illion fund were estab lished today and the proceeds in that fund were used to offset future losses in reflows as they occur table 3 below provides another estimate based on the analysis in table 1 of the likely cost in nominal dollars of lost reflows due to grants8 according to table 3 the actual reflows lost if ida instituted grant program comparable to that proposed by the administration would be about 64 billion this is comparable in concept to the world banks figure of 59 billi on costs are counted only in the year in which they are incurred table 3 does not include any estimate for the imputed cost of lost income which might be generated by those lost reflows9 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31418crs9 10 the world bank estimated that idas cash balance would become negative absent any funding for grant program comparable to that proposed by the administration in 2015 world bank ida funding scheme p 14 the bank also estimated that if ida instituted an unfunded 10 grant program the total cost in lost reflows would be about 2 billion and idas cash balance though small would remain positive through 2021 it made estimate for the cost or impact on idas cash balance for later years when by most estimates the bulk of the losses would be incurred the important thing is not the diffe rences among the numbers which are relatively small given the fact that they are all projections over 40 years the important thing is the fact that grant pr ogram will have costs either to the donors more contributions or to idas beneficiaries smaller program

sbursementreflow formulas gao proposed that instead of making cont ributions to defray the cost of grants as they occur donors might make advanced contributions to special fund the principal and interest in that fund could be used to defray the future cost of lost reflows due to grants gao said that the cost of grants could be offset if d onor countries increased their contribution to ida by 16 annually over the next 40 years this is compound interest over th course of 40 years using the financial model presented in table 1 donors would contribute 64 billion 40 increase over planned contri bution levels table 3 shows that unless ida grants are funded with increased contributions from donors idas cash balance will dip into the negative in the first year in which repayments would have been othe rwise due for grants made in 200310 the growing negative balance reflects the cumulative amount ida would need to receive in donations to keep its aid program at planned levels despite the drop in reflowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31418crs10 11 in table 3 idas cash balance is somewhat hi gher in the first decade than that shown in table 1 because ida would receive an upfr ont commitment fee from grants made during that period correspondingly the ida cash balance in table 3 is smaller in later years than that shown in table 3 because in addition to lost reflows ida would not be receiving the normal 34 of 1 service charge during that period on the disbursed balance for aid released as grants rather than loans the commitment fee used for the calculations embodied in table 3 is worth considerably less in npv terms than the usual service fee income11 the table assumes that ida will levy small commitment fee here charged as 15 of the total in the year the grant is made to cover administrative costs this approximates on an npv basis the ida commitment fee for grants which the world bank reportedly has under considera tion over time as the size of idas outstanding loan balance grows more slowly because more of its aid takes the form of grants ida will likewise receive less income annually from the service charge it levies on those loans using data that was not available or iginally to gao crs did separate analysis of the amount that w ould be needed in additional contributions to offset the likely costs of an ida grant program this found that the donor countries would need to increase their contributions to ida at an annual rate of 1776 during the next four decades to offset the cost of major grant program again as with the gao calculation this would be compound interest on this basis using the financial model presented in table 1 donors would c ontribute an additional 72 billion to ida 45 increase over current plans during th next 40 years this is somewhat more than gao calculated however the diffe rences between the two estimates are not significant due to differences in methodol ogy and the difficulty of estimating costs over such long period of time were the ida donors to agree on contribution plan of this sort to offset the future costs of grants the world bank having more complete data on ida finances should be able to determine an annual contribution rate sufficient to accomplish that goal the united states currently contributes about 20 of the new money provided to ida during each replenishment period given the relative size of the us economy it seems unlikely that other c ountries will agree to increase their contribution levels in order that the unite d states may decrease its should the us contribution share remain at that level for the next four decades it is likely that the united states will be asked to contribute an extra 13 billion to 14 billion over and above the 32 b illion it would give if donor contribution levels remained flat in nominal terms during that period to cover the cost of ida grants balancing multiple goals idas capacity to fund major program of assistance to developing countries in the coming decades is heavily dependant on the way the world bank and the ida donor countries handle its finances under current plans loan repayments reflows would provide much of th money ida needs to fund its operations during the next 40 years contributions from donors would bear declining share of the load in nominal terms donors would be asked to contribute the same amounts annually during each of those years even though the ida program would be growing in nominal terms to compensate for anticipat ed inflation in real terms given thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31418crs11 effects of inflation the actual cost of the ida program to donors would decline by 23 annually during the entire period in addition to the goal of reducing the cost of the ida program to donors many people also hope that the cost to the recipi ent countries may be reduced as well the program of hipc debt forgiveness for poor countries seeks to reduce the amount that poor countries must pay to ida each ear as consequence of earlier loans likewise the proposal for major ida grant program would reduce if not eliminate much of the cost that recipien t countries must bear as consequence of ida aid ultimately the goal of making ida more selffinancing thr ough reflows and the goal of reducing the recipi ent countries debt repaymen t burdens are incompatible any debt repayments that are forgiven through hipc or eliminated through grants will reduce the amount that ida receives in fu ture years as reflows to fund its future aid program without additional contribu tions from donor countries either to offset the cost of idas regular assistance program or to offset the cost of hipc debt forgiveness or grants the resources ava ilable to fund idas assistance program will gradually decline in that case ida will have real alternative but to shrink the size of its new assistance program in proportion to the amount it is providing its beneficiary countries through bt relief and grant assistance in either context the donor countries will need to decide whether they wish to reduce the size of the ida program in future years or to increase in real terms the size of their annual contributions
