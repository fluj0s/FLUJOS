formula program commonl referred to as the rural formula program state and metropolitan planning research and fta operations in addition to federal funding for trans it from the transit programs themselves federal funding is also available from veral surface transportation programs that allow highway money to be spent on tran sit projects and vice versa most funds flexed to the transit programs come from the surface transportation program stp and the congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program cmaq flexing funds is largely the d ecision of state decisi onmakers hence the amount transferred can vary widely from ear to year in 15 years from fy1992 through fy2006 total of 131 billion has been flexed from highways to transit ranging from 03 billion in fy1992 to 16 billion in fy20008 very little transit funding has been flexed from transit to highways paratransit is another area in which funding is available from the federal government outside the transit

usc 5307 the urbanized area formula grants pr ogram provides funding to urbanized areas places designated by the census bureau to have population of 50000 or more apportionments are determined by number of different formulas known as formula tiers most of the tiers appl to urbanized areas with population of 200000 or more these formulas are based on several factors in cluding bus revenue vehicle miles bus passenger miles fixedguideway revenue vehicle miles fixed guideway route miles operating cost s population and population density in urbanized areas with population of less than 200000 funds are generally distributed according to population and population density in tea21 there were six formula tiers to which safetea added seventh tier and two new programs that function as an eighth tier11 the seventh tier added by safetea is the small transit in tensive cities formula program which beginning in fy2006 distributes 1 of urbanized area funds to urbanized areas with population of less than 200000 that provi high level of service in relation to population size 49 usc 5336j th two new programs added by safetea that function as an eighth tier are the growing states and high density states formula programs 49 usc 5340 both of these were also enacted to begin in fy2006 the growing states apportionment is based on forecasted state population growth and the high density apportionmen t is to states with population density greater than 370 persons per square mile most of the funds from the growing states and high density states programs are di stributed as part of the urbanized area apportionment but some funds are distri buted through the rural formula program discussed below capital investment program 49 usc 5309 the capital investment prog ram is designed to help transit agencies fund large projects that cannot be met through the regular formula programs the capital investment program has three main elements 1 fixedguideway new starts and extensions typically known as new star ts 2 fixedguideway modernization and 3 bus and bus facility capital in tea21 the ratio of funding in the overall capital investment pr ogram was 40 new starts 40

primarily on competitive basis for new fixedguideway systems and extensi ons while the majority of funding from this program over the years has gone to transit rail projects the new starts program has funded projects for busways and bus ra pid transit ferries automated guideway systems and vintage trolleys12 congress enacted new small starts program in safetea to fund projects with total cost of 250 million or less in which the federal share is 75 million or less sma ll starts projects are funded with 200 million annually from the new starts author ization beginning in fy2007 in carving out small starts from the new starts program congress also intended for these less costly projects to be subject to less cumbersome approval process fixedguideway rail modernization often referred to as rail modernization or rail mod these funds are for modernizing and rehabilitating infrastructure in all types of transit ra il systems and exclusive busways funds are made available by formula to two

program was funded at 21 billi on over the six years of safetea significant boost in funding over tea21 some of the growing states formula funding is also apportioned through the rural formula program

reaut horization of the transit programs will be the overall level of trans it funding large increases in funding as some are calling for might allow congress to continue th programs without substantial changes however growth in the overall funding or even funding decline might sharpen calls for program restructuring in order to focus on federal transit priorities this section begins with

groups contend that the physical condition and ope rational performance of public transit are suffering and will continue to suffer unless there is an increase in funding levels in their view federal infrastruct ure investment should be sign ificantly increased to deal with the existing backlog of projects and future needs this view is bolstered to some degree by the most recent highway and transit needs assessment by dot which suggests that the capital cost to maintain the current condition and operationa l performance of transit systems in the united states from 2005 through 2024 is 25 more annually th an is currently being spent by all levels of government15 dot makes recommendation about the shares of capital spending made by different levels of government in its estimates of capital needs in the current ratio of capital spending however 62 billion nnually of federal spending would be needed to maintain the system in 2004 the federal government provided 49 billion for capital expenses the remaining 2 billion in federal spending went for operating expenses it should be pointed out however as w ith any attempt to estimate current and future system conditions and perform ance there are host of simplifying assumptions omissions and da ta problems that influence the results nevertheless this analysis suggests that if total govern ment spending is not increased above current levels the physical conditi on and operational performance of system elements may decline the congressionally created national surface transportation policy and revenue study commission

ansportation spending in general and transit spending in particular is that it has not been dramatically deficient in terms of the nations transit systems the dot needs analysis shows that total government spending on capital and operations excluding farebox and other revenue grew by approxima tely 80 between 1980 and 2004 in real terms much faster than passenger trips and passenger miles which grew by 12 and 24 respectively18 however it is true that federal spending grew relatively slowly over this period particularly compared with state and local spending 4 and 129 respectively in real terms consequen tly the federal share of total spending declined from 42 to 25 the federal shar of capital spending has also declined from approximately 50 in the mid 1990s to 39 in 2004 since 1995 federal spending has slightly outpaced state and local spending growing by 43 and 39 respectively19 as result of this increase in overall government spending transit service has grown and the condition and performance of transit systems have generally improved over the past decade transit system capacity measured in capacityequivalent revenue miles increased 30 between 1995 and 2004 with the opening of several new systems and extensions light rail cap acity more than doubled over this period bus capacity grew by more modest 15 the growth in ridership on average has generally lagged

ashgate 1999 29 testimony of david lewis consultant in us congress house subcommittee on highways and transit implementation of ne w starts and small starts program may 10 2007benefits it provides22 it is often pointed out that while transit spending amounts to about 16 of all government highway and transit spending and about 14 of federal highway and transit capital expenditure in 200423 only about 2 of all trips are made by this mode24 even for commuting trips for which transit is better suited transit accounts for only 5 nationwide share that has changed little over the past two decades only in two cities new rk and chicago does the transit share rise above 1025 the effect according to transit critics is to shortchange highway spending thereby causing highway conditi ons and performance including highway congestion to be worse than they would be otherwise26 corollary to this view is that sign ificant proportion of transit funding comes from taxes paid by highway users curren tly about 80 of fede ral transit spending is derived from the htf with the rest co ming from the general fund at the state and local levels combined fuels taxes account for only 3 of transit funding excluding systemgenerated revenue with the biggest shares coming from sales taxes general funds and other public funds such as vehi cle licensing and registration fees and lottery and casino proceeds27 counterargument to these critics nd one in favor of increased transit spending is that transits worth must be analyzed in terms of economic value not just transportation value28 the economic value argument includes economic development as well as mobility such as mobility for nondrivers and congestion management by this measure according to proponents transit investment is highly productive and often more pr oductive than an alternativ highway investment the implication for transits detractors is that the reality that transit cannot as rule make it financially seems to have created belief in some quarters that it cannot make it economically either29httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34171crs10 30 for more information see crs report rl34183 public transit program funding issues in surface transportation reauthorization by william j mallettfederal transit priorities and program restructuring if federal funding for transit remains flat or possibly even declines over the next decade congress may want to cut programs across the board alternatively congress may want to restructure the pr ograms based on reexamination of its priorities of course transit funding may grow if the federal fuels tax is raised and some of this new revenue is dedicated to transit if othe r types of dedicated revenues are created or if congress decides to fund tr ansit programs at higher level from the general fund30 moreover funding growth doe s not preclude congress from making changes in the way the federal government supports public transit provision three broad ways of restructuring federal transit programs ar suggested here followed by brief discussion of the administrati ons proposal for changes during the last reauthorization that were predicated on modest nominal increase in federal transit funding one way to reorder federal priorities would be to focus more resources on major capital expenses for the rehabilitation and ex pansion of transit service in places that are best served by this m ode primarily the densely populat ed parts of large and often heavily congested cities this would require expansion of the programs that make up the capital investment program the new starts program the rail modernization program and the bus capital program and cutting back on the grants that are spread more broadly and go for smaller and more routine types of expenses under the urbanized and nonurba nized formula programs this change would likely result in concentration of resources in few large cities where transit usage is already relatively high alternatively congress may decide that the era of retrofitting large and mediumsized cities with new transit rail systems is largely over and that resources should now go to supporting nd rehabilitating existing serv ices this could entail reduction in spending on the new starts program currently about 18 of the federal transit program and more suppor t for the other capital programs and the formula grants programs the effect of these changes on the distribution of funds is likely to be more mixed nd would depend on the share of funds dedicated to the rail modernization program program that includes relatively few cities and the share dedicated to buses and formula programs that incl ude much larger number of places third alternative would be to eliminate the capital programs altogether to be replaced with simple block grant that could be distributed based on transit ridership or population this would allow state and local governments to decide how best to allocate transit funding s upport am ong existing and new services funds distributed according to transit ridership would reward areas that commit their own resources successfully to providing transit rvice the distribution of funding in this way would again depend on how this new pr ogram is structured but it might also depend on how states and loca lities react to the changes in terms of how aggressively they promote transit

s proposal included folding the fixed guideway modernization program into the urbanized area formula program eliminating the bus and bus facility capital program and distributing some of these funds by formula and using the remainin g funds to expand the new starts program whose criteria would be expanded to include all transit modes the administration argued that this would simplify the trans it program make the flow of federal funds more equitable and reliable and their use more flexible none of these major changes was undertaken except for some broadening of the eligibility of the new starts criteria relatively minor change that was enacted was the distribution of funds in the much smaller jarc program by formula rather than by the discretion of fta this too may be reexamined given recen t statements by the house appropriations committee with fixed guideway modernization funds already distributed by formula the main argument for distributing these f unds through the urbanized area formula program is that it would give transit agencies more flexibility in how to use them although urbanized area formula funds are apportioned on the basis of modal characteristics such as miles of fixedguideway infrastructure among other things these funds can be used for any transit mode the main argument against this change position advocated by apta is that maki ng rail modernization funds more flexible might divert funding from rail transit syst ems where the unmet funding needs are the greatest due to the age of the infrastructure and the number of passengers carried distributing some of the bus and bus facility capita l program funds by formula the administration argued would make their distribution more equitable and allow communities to rely on some funds every year instead of at irregular intervals through earmarking in the appropria tions process regu lar and predictable apportionments they argued would allow transit providers to be able to

ought to increase ne w starts funding to deal with highway congestion environmental probl ems and growing transit demand in its most recent policy statement on national transportation infrastructure aashto argues that the current growth in highway travel is fina ncially unsustainable and thus national policy goal should be to double trans it ridership over the next 20 years by aashtos estimate this would require increasing overall federal transit assistance from 103 billion in fy2009 the amount authorized in the final year of safetea to 173 billion by fy2015 possibly the last year of the next authorizing legislation38 one way to boost ridership according to aashto is to provide more funding for the new starts program39 by aashtos estimate 35 billion is needed to fund the 36 projects that have moved be yond the initial planning stages gao in survey of transit project sponsors found that there are another 141 projects planned of which threequarters are likely to request federal ne w starts funding40 under safetea the new starts program is authorized at 18 billion in fy2009 by contrast number of analysts cont end that federal funds should longer support the building of new transit rail systems41 some have argued that most cities without rail systems are either too small or have residential nd employment densities that are too low to make rail viable op tion moreover proposals to extend existing rail systems often into the lowerden sity suburbs may also suffer from such problems in this view the new starts program ought to dramatically shrink or be redirected to smaller mostly nonrail proj ects as partly begun under the small starts program instituted in safetea another po ssibility is that new starts funding be redirected to rehabilitating the existing transit rail systems those who advocate shrinking the transit program often suggest that resources be redirected to elements of the highway program that hold more promise for congestion

federal transit program and the new starts progra m in particular has been between those who favor support for rail transit and thos who favor bus and bus rapid transit brt several rationales ve been advanced by supporters for building new fixed guideway transit systems with substantia l federal support first fixedguideway transit particularly rail transit provides th higherquality service in terms of comfort and speed that is needed to attract discretionary transit users travelers who have the option of driving attracting discretionary transit users is important because it is only by having travelers switch modes that transit can have an effect on highway congestion parking problems air pollution and energy use second advocates argue that fixedguideway transit has the greatest potential for desirable land use effects and economic development rail transit supporters argue that over the long term rail stations encourage compact mixeduse velopment thereby counteracting urban sprawl and reducing motor vehicle travel third supporters argue that where transit demand is high the operating costs of rail ar lower than those of bus transit and with higher capital costs taken into account the total cost of rail per passengermile is favorable fourth rail advocates argue th at it is easier to gain local public support for rail transit projects than comparable improvements in bus service43 critics of federal s upport for new rail transit system s contend that such systems are expensive to build and maintain less flexible compared with regular bus transit and illsuited to todays low density dispersed tropolitan areas rail transit these critics contend may be worth the cost only in highdensity corridors and that few of these remain without rail service44 moreover critics contend that the building of new rail systems in search of discretiona ry riders primarily suburban commuters have been implemented to the detriment of busdepende nt populations in the central city overall these critics argue the effect has been to switch those riding buses to riding rail with little net gain in transit patronage45 even the environmental benefits of new rail lines have been called into question because many new rail riders must drive to station to access the system c onsequently the reduction in emissions from building new rail lines has been found to be negligible in many cases46 in the view of some federal support for new transit capacity would be better spent on buses and in some cases brt in which express buses run over roads with some sort of priority system ranging from signal preemption to an exclusive busway the main argument for brt is its costeffectiveness compared with new rail systems gao for instance found that although cap ital costs varied

it is more flexible as starting stopping and modifying brt service is lot easier than with fixedinplace rail system detractors argue that this flexibility is the main reason why the economic development benefits around brt stations and stops will be lower than those around transit rail stations because of the limited experience with brt firm conc lusion about its economic development benefits in comparison with transit rail can be drawn at this time some have suggested that with similar service characteristics and proper planning there is reason why the economic development benefits could not be similar to those of transit rail48 congress and fta have made number of efforts over the past decade to stimulate proposals for brt including demonstration project that began in 1999 however in 2001 the gao found that for number of reasons new starts funding for brt had been limited49 first many communities had already built and operated rail systems that provided wealth of ex perience with them and generated number of proposals for expansion second the ne w starts program at that time tended to favor larger more capitalintensive projects that could garner for community significant capital funding from the federa l government third at that time under tea21 the program required that to be ligible brt projects had to operate on separate rightofway for the use of tr ansit and highoccupanc vehicles safetea initiated several changes in the new starts program that seem to have improved the environment for brt including setting asid funding for small starts and expanding the definition of fixedguideway to incl ude more brt projects consequently in fy2008 brt projects became the most num erous in the new starts funding pipeline projects in preliminary

projects while cheaper than rail systems are still more expensive and less effective than c onventional bus service for instance one analyst contended that mode st improvements to basic bus services combined with an attractive fares policy have shown they can secure subs tantially greater ridership increases than capitalintensive project s involving either light rail or busway construction53 others note that brt projects favor suburban commuters over more centrally located transit such as streetcars which are lighter cheaper but slower type of light rail54 this may be an issue in reauthorization in terms of the evaluation criteria by which new starts projects are selected project evaluation criteria in safetea congress directed fta to add both supportive land use policies and econo mic development effects as specific criteria in the project evaluation process mobility improvements environmental benefits operating efficiencies and costeffectiveness are some of the other main criteria the main rationale for these additional criteria is that the benefits of transit service go beyond mobility and the minimiz ation of environm ental damage and include the economic benefits of development around trans it stations moreover the benefits of transit are ma ximized if supported by appr opriate land use policies that allow for high density around transit stations55 to date land use has been added in the evaluation process but economic deve lopment has not as fta considers the most appropriate way to measure this variable56 in hearing on implementing changes in the

in the small st arts process as justificati ons for federal funding support however is not universal in the 109th congress the house appropriations committee expressed concern that these positive secondary bene fits often provide justification for projects that are not costeffective in transportation terms alone in the view of the committee the most importa nt criteria for new st arts projects should be the potential of new transit option to transport the most travelers at lower cost in comparison with other transportation alternatives and to reduce highway congestion as the committee noted in evalua ting projects the direct transportation benefits need to be the most significant measurements60 additionally the appropriations committee expressed concern that the small starts program will divert resources toward small economic development type projects and away from those that will have greater impact on congestion mitigation environmental quality and travel time61 concern has also been expressed about the complexity of the new starts evaluation process that transit agencies must follow to gain federal support62 the new starts process requires the preparation of large number of detailed reports and other documents that are reviewed extensively by fta these requirements have been developed over the years to ensure that federal funding supports the best projects that are judged fairly taking in to consideration the differences in project location type and scope ho wever some argue that th rules have become so onerous that many communities are willin g to forego

conceived as providing support to programs run by state and local government consequently most federal aid must be matched with state or local money in ratio determined by federal law these matching shares vary from program to prog ram and have occasionally been adjusted according to the goals of federal policy the oversubscription to federal funding in the new starts program has led some to argue for lowering the cap on the federal share for such projects currently the maximum federal share is 80 equivalent to the federal matching share for most highway projects supporters of this view argue that lowering the cap would allow federal funding to be shared among more worthwhile projects moreover supporters argue that lower cap would encourage states and localities with more of their own money at stake to advance only the strongest projects gao found that more economic analysis of the cost s and benefits of project is typically done when more local funding is required66 in addition supporters point out that although the maximum share prior to sa fetea was 80 it was fta po licy to rate project as low if it sought federal share of more than 60 this policy was response to appropriations committee reports that wer share was warranted because demand for funding help was outstrippi ng the available resources67 provisions in safetea now prohibit the secretary of transporta

opponents of lowering the maximum fede ral share argue that lowering the cap might bias state and local decisionmakers to favor highway projects that have an 80 match71 others contend that lowering the match will result in wider distribution of federal transit new starts investment which will have the effect of diluting its effectiveness some also advocate reducing the federal share for both highways and transit say to 50 to encourage states and localities to focus on the most productive projects72 funding distribution number of changes in the new starts program particularly the creation of the small starts program and more favorable climate for brt projects are viewed as being likely to lead to the wider distribution of smaller grants some may view this as an appropriate transition away from the creation of new rail systems in large cities to the consolidation and enhancement of existing transit systems in wider variety of settings73 others may argue that this will dilute the effectiveness of the new starts program at time when many of the policy problems to which the transit program is di rected mobility for the poor and infirm highway congestion air quality and othe r environmental problems are highly concentrated geographically for example the 10 largest urban areas by population account for nearly onehalf of total highwa congestion delay though only about one quarter of the us population and the 20 largest urban areas account for about two thirds of total delay and onethird of the population74 however fta has announced that it plans to give preference to

apportioned to the older areas has declined from 92 in fy1996 although this represented approximately 600 million in that year76 this declining share of available funds may continue with time as the rehabilitation needs of the newer systems grow and as currently structured more of the syst ems built recently become eligible for fixed guideway modernization funding if program funding does not grow in th next reauthorization then the amount of funds going to the older systems as well as the share may decline over time congress could decide to leave the cu rrent apportionment formula unchanged congress has several options on the other hand if it decides that funding for the older systems through this program should not shrink first it could decide to change the eligibility criteria or the program formul to restore funding to the older systems second it could decide to expand program f unds in an expansion of overall transit funding third congress may decide to di vert funds from the

advocates for small cities places that us ually have transit service focused on the fact that some small urbanized areas provide relatively hi gh level of transit service but are not rewarded appropriately for their efforts as are large urbanized areas this resulted in the creation of the small intensive cities program that shifted approximately 1 of urba nized area formula funding from urbanized areas over 200000 to urbanized areas under 20000079 despite the perceived need for public transit in small cities and rural areas providing service in those places is relativel costly when measured per trip or per passengermile in 2006 for instance fe deral capital and opera ting assistance per trip in large urbanized areas 1 milli on or more was 081 compared with 115 in mediumsized urbanized areas 200000 to 1 million and 166 in small urbanized areas less than 20000080 comparative data for rural areas is not available but would most likely show federal opera ting subsidy greater than 166 per trip consequently some argue that transit funding needs to be concentrated in large urban areas where ridership is concentrated and where transit provides relatively cost effective mode of transportati on in addition they argue that these also tend to be the places where highway congestion and air quality issues predominate and the economic development be nefits of transit i

service will grow partly as result of the general aging of the population advocates for paratransit funding argue that good transportation provides the opportunity for people to engage in full range of economic and social activities including work and for many chance to live at home this advocates believe pr ovides higher qual ity of life and less reliance on government funding because of reduced
