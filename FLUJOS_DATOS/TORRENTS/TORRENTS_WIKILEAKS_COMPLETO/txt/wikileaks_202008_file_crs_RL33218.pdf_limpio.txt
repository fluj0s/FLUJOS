on th supreme court has been judge on the us court of appeals for the third circ uit since 1990 during his tenure judge alito has authored several majority and dissenting opinions concerning immigration matters governed by the immigration and nationality act ina1 particularly as they concern the deportation of liens and asylum claims background immigration matters primarily come before federal appellate courts through petitions to review final orders of removal by the board of immigration appeals bia the highest administrative body re sponsible for interpreting and applying immigration laws2 among other things the bia hears administrative appeals of rulings made by immigration judges ijs ordering aliens removed or denying applications for relief from removal if th bia upholds an order of removal against an alien the alien may petition the court of appeals in the appropriate federal circuit to review the bias decision3 though in some cases such review may be very limited in scope4 pursuant to statute and court juri sprudence judicial review of bia decisions is typically deferential and the scope of such review is limited by statute to the administrative record upon which the order is based5 perhaps accordingly substantial majority of bia rulings reviewed by federal appellate cour ts are upheld6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33218crs2 6 continued seventh circuit

decisions have been unanimously upheld by the court however when the court has split when deciding cases outcome judge alito has typically been on the dissenting side voting to uphold bia decision that the majority votes to overturn7 typically judge alito dissents in such cases because he believes the ma jority has not been sufficiently deferential to the decisions of administrative authorities on the other hand judge alito has voted to remand some bia decisions where potentially important documentation corr oborating an aliens claims has been excluded without sufficient explanation review of discretionary judgments judge alito has differed with some of his third circuit colleagues when evaluating certain bia denials of discretionary relief one such instance was tipu v ins8 1994 case where the bia denied depor tation relief to an alien ordered removed because of decadeold drug conviction9 in prior decision the bia had announced that in deciding whether to gr ant an alien relief fro m deportation it would balance the adverse fact ors evidencing an aliens undesirability as permanent resident with the social and humane c onsiderations presente d in his behalf10 the bias decision to deny discretionary relief to petitioner tipu was evaluated by the threejudge circuit panel under an abuse of discretion standard meaning that the panel would not disturb the bias deci sion unless it was found to be arbitrary irrational or contrary to law11 applying this standard the majority vacated the bias decision after finding that the bia d failed to adequately consider factors which weighed in tipus favor including 1 the hardship such deportation would have upon tipus seriously ill dependent brother and his brothers family 2 tipus relatively minor role in the crime for whic

ownership and operation of taxi cab in his dissent judge alito criticized the majoritys decision to vacate the bias decision arguing that it went well beyond the limited scope of ppellate review that we are permitted to exercise in case like this12 concluding that the aliens drug conviction could be properly considered by the bia as serious adverse factor against the aliens application for relief from deportation13 judge alito went on to argue that merely stating what the majority finds that the bia put too much emphasis on one factor failed to evaluate anothe r factor as outstanding rather than merely favorable and did not give proper weight to third factor seems to to demonstrate that the majority in deed if not in word has applied the wrong standard of review in this government of separated powers it is not for the judiciary to usurp congress grant of authority to the attorney general by applying what approximates novo appellate review14 review of adverse credibility findings the ina provides that administrative fi ndings of fact which may include among other things findings regarding the credibility of witness in an immigration hearing are conclusive unless any reas onable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary15 while judge alito has generally been in the majority in upholding adverse credibility findings affi rmed by the bia in the case of dia v ashcroft 16 judge alito dissented from an banc opinion which he believed accorded too little deference to an ijs credibility finding in dia the third circuit reviewed bia decision upholding an ijs denial of petitioner dias asylum application the ij had rejected dias application based on an adverse credibility finding the ij did not find credible dias claim that guinean military men destroyed his home and beat and raped his wife because of his refusal to join the military the majority found th at the ijs adverse credibility finding was based on conclusions that were arb itrary and conjectural in nature17 among other things the majority criticized the ijs reliance on background knowledge and personal experiences to reach conclusions about dias credibility finding that the inferences made by the ij were in so instances non sequiturs and in others counterintuitive18 for example the majority questioned the ijs disbelief of dias claim that his wife had told him to flee

in such situ ation or that husband would willingly do so the majority characterized this conc lusion by the ij as lacking foundation in any logical reasoning or any support in the record19 in dissent joined by two other judges judge alito disputed several aspects of the majority opinion including its skepticism about the inferences the ij made on the basis of personal experience and background knowledge judge alito argued that it was entirely proper even in light of the admitted imperfections of such an approach for fact finder to take into account background knowledge about human behavior in assessing the plausibility of testimony20 more broadly judge alito argued that the majority had misapplied the inas reasonable adjudicator standard for judicial review of administr ative findings of fact according to judge alito the majority had turned this standard on its head by finding that aspects of dias testimony should have been f ound to be credible because reasonable person might have f ound them believable21 for its part the majority disputed this characterization and argued that judge alitos reading of the reasonable adjudicator standard not only guts the statutory standard but ignores our precedent22 the majority alleged that judge alitos disse nt disregarded precedent interpreting the inas reasonable adjudicator standard as requiring adverse credibility findings to be supported by substantial evidence in th record requirement that the majority argued permitted the reversal of adverse credibility findings when they appeared to be based on speculation conjecture or minor incons istencies alone23 review of adverse credibilit findings when corroborating documents have been xcluded from the record judge alitos jurisprudence generally shows him to be deferential to factual conclusions reached by immigration tribuna ls however he reversed adverse credibility findings made after documents potentially corroboratin g an aliens claims were excluded from consideration w ithout sufficient explanation in the 2004 case of liu v ashcroft 24 third circuit panel reviewed bia decision denying the asylum and withholdi ng of deportation claims of married chinese couple who

conceded that the authentication procedures scribed in the pertinent regulation were not mandatory and that documents could be authenticated in ways other than those described in the regulation26 writing for unanimous panel judge alito stated that although significant deference is owed to factual terminations made by the ij and upheld by the bia remand is appropriate where we have made legal determination eg regarding admissibility of evidence that f undamentally upsets the balancing of facts and evidence upon which an agencys decision is based27 because the regulation cited by the ij did not provide an absolute rule of exclusion and was not the exclusive means of authenticating records in an immigration hearing judge alito concluded that it was legal error for the ij to reject the abortion certificates on that ground alone accordingly the case was remanded back to the bia for determination of whether the documents presented by the lius we re genuine and should have been admitted into evidence28 in similar case in 2005 zhang v gonzales 29 judge alito wrote an opinion for unanimous circuit panel30 remanding an asylum case when it was unclear whether the ij had excluded documents that may have supported the pe titioners claim that she had been forced by the chinese gove rnment to have an abortion the opinion claimed that the ij obviously did not take the documents at face value because if he did the documents would powerfu lly corroborate the petitioners claims31 judge alitos opinion also cited the courts prior holding in liu that corroborating documents could not be excluded solely because of failure to comply with the relevant authentication regulation32 accordingly the circuit panel vacated the bias decision and remanded the case to either determine the reasons the corroborating documents were excluded by the ij or if documents were admitted to explain the finding that the petitioners claim of persecution nonetheless lacked credibility33httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33218crs6 34 8 usc 1101a42 1158 35 8 usc 1101a42b section 601 of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 pl 104208 division c

involving asylum claims have been discussed in other sections of this re port this section discusses some notable opinions by judge alito that have focused primarily on issues relating to the substantive grounds for asylum eligibility at least two of the cases discussed below concern the bias interpretation of the inas asylum eligibility provisions in cases where congressional intent is unclear or ambiguous federa l courts give significant deference to the bias interpretation of the immigration laws it administers so long as such interpretations are based on permissible construction of the ina 36 this standard is commonly referred to as chevron deference in reference to the supreme court case where the standard was formulated37 genderbased persecution one of judge alitos most publicized asylum opinions was in the 1993 case of fatin v ins 38 where unanimous third circuit panel upheld bia decision to deny asylum and other forms of relief from depor tation to an iranian woman who claimed wellfounded fear of persecution if she returned to iran on account of her westernized views on the rights of women the circuit panel considered fatins argument that her status as westernized iranian woman opposed to her countrys tr eatment of women constituted membership in particular social group for asylum purposes in addressing this

particular social group was broad enough to include women who we re profoundly opposed to their countrys genderspecific rest rictions upon them40 despite finding that fatin could qualify as member of particular social group the circuit panel ne vertheless upheld the bias conclusion that fatin had not presen ted sufficient evidence demonstrating that she had wellfounded fear of ill treatment rising to the level of persecution41 judge alitos opinion has been cited in numerous asylum claims involving persecution on account of gender42 and his interpretation of particular social group has been considered expansive by some commentators distinction between asylum claims made by married and unmarried partners number of judge alitos opinions have involved the review of asylum claims related to coercive population control practices employed by the chinese government one such opinion was in the case of chen v ashcroft43 concerning chinese nationals claim for asylum on acc ount of his fiancees forced abortion in an earlier opinion the bia had held that the spouse of person subjected to forced sterilization or abortion coul d be eligible for asylum on account of past persecution44 however

prosecuted for violating chinas security laws by remaining in the us for an unauthorized period of time and failing to report suspicions that other delegates would not return to china the ij deni ed changs application for asylum and the bia affirmed reasoning that because chinas security laws were laws of general applicability changs prosecution under such laws would not be persecution based on his political opinion the panel majority overturned the bias ruling finding that the chinese security laws were aimed at preventing political dissent and that chinas prosecution of chang would be on account of his political opinion judge alito disagreed stating that while the case facts aroused considerable sympathy chang had failed to demonstrat that his prosecution for violating the chinese security law would be politically motivated as he had never specified any political opinion that he holds that is at odds with the chinese government49 the majority in contrast argued that evidence in the administrative record made it reasonable to conclude that chang wa s defying the orders of the chinese government because he disagreed with the government policy behind them and that such defiance

constituted an aggravated felony id at 228 n13 alito j dissentinginterpretation of immigration statutes and regulations occasionally when reviewing an immigra tion claim federal court will have to examine the meaning of an immigration st atute or regulation rather than simply reviewing their application to particular set of facts judge alito has generally read immigration statutes broadly and in few cases his statutory readings have been broader than those of some of his thir d circuit colleagues on one occasion position he took regarding the scope of an ina provision limiting federal judicial review was subsequently rejected by the supreme court in deciding case from another circuit while judge alito has generally upheld immigration authorities interpretation of applicab regulations in limited cases he has found these interpretations impermissible tax offenses as aggravated felonies in the 2004 case of lee v ashcroft 51 third circuit panel that included judge alito reviewed the deportation orders of married couple convicted of filing false tax return which caused tax deficiency of over 50000 the bia found that the aliens convictions fell under the inas definition of an aggravated felony and therefore constituted deportabl offenses although the ina lists several crimes as aggravated felonies for deportation purpos including an offense that involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds 10000 the only tax offense specifically listed as an aggravated felony is the separate crime of tax evasion52 the majority overturned the bias orde rs of removal finding that when congress specified tax evasion as an aggr avated felony it clearly and unambiguously intended to designate it as the only tax crime that is removable offense53 accordingly the aliens convictions for tax crime other than tax evasion did not make them deportable judge alito dissented arguing that the aliens tax offenses plainly constituted offenses i nvolving fraud or deceit and were therefore aggravated felonies making the aliens deportable judge alito continued that congresss decision to specify tax evasi on as an aggravated felony may have been simply to make certain even at the risk of re dundancy that tax evasion qualifies as an aggravated felony while good statutory dr aftsmanship seeks to avoid surplusage other goals such as certainty and th avoidance of litiga tion are sometimes more important54 responding to judge alitos dissent the majority suggested that while congress may indeed have wished for all tax offenses to potentially

in 1996 congress made substantial modifi cations to the ina via the enactment of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa57 and the illegal immigrant reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira58 including by restricting the availability of judicial review of removal orders among other things former ina 106ag which stated that any alien held in custody pursuant to an order of deportation may obtain judici review thereof by habeas corpus proceedings59 was eliminated and new provision was added stating that final orders of deportation against certain categor ies of aliens would not be subject to review by any court60 in the 1999 case of sandoval v reno 61 threejudge third circuit panel was required to determine whether aedpa and iirira had eliminated court review of immigration decisions via habeas proceedings under 28 usc 2241 the majority held that habeas review could not be st ripped from federal courts absent the clear intent of congress and that aedpa and iirira did not express sufficiently clear intent to strip the courts of habeas ju risdiction over immigration matters in reaching this decision the majority noted that th supreme court had historically drawn sharp distinction between j udicial review and the c ourts power to entertain petitions for writs of habeas corpus62 the majority also noted that several circuit courts had previously reached the same conclusion that the 1996 amendments to the ina did not eliminate federal habeas review of immigration decisions63 dissenting from the majoritys conclusion that habeas jurisdiction remained over immigration claims judge alito argued that congressional intent to eliminate federal habeas review was clear noting for example that pertinent section of aedpa was entitled

should be provided by mean s of petition for review filed in the appropriate federal appellate court66 he further suggested that prior third circuit opinion might need to be overruled so that the court could review certain non constitutional legal claims raised by an lien even if review was eliminated under the federal habeas statute67 in the 2001 opinion of ins v st cyr 68 the supreme court

formal and informal agency interpretations of an ambiguous regulation unless such interpretations are plain ly erroneous or inconsis tent with the regulation71 such deference is warranted when the

immigration authorities had denied the organizations visa petition in part because the sponsored aliens proposed position as houseparent was deemed not to be religious ccupation or vocation as that term was defined under regulation75 among other things immigration authorities characterized the proposed pos itions houseparent duties as having wholly secular function even if the facility is operated by ch aritable organization founded on religious principles76 in unanimous panel opinion written by judge alito the court held that the denial of the visa petition wa s not supported by the record because this denial was based on 1 an impermissible reading of th pertinent regulation defining religious occupation as excluding religious occupati ons with secular component andor 2 factual determination of the secular na ture of the houseparent position which was not supported by substantial evidence in the record the circuit panel held that job could qualify as religious occupation under the regulato ry definition of that term so long as it had some religious significance and noted that the pertinent regulation listed number of occupations with s ecular components such as religious translator and religious c ounselor as examples of j obs falling under the definition of religious occupation77 the panel also charged these immigration authorities with describing the aliens job duties in manner that excluded any mention of the religious component of her duties found in the administr ative record including her responsibilities to teach and lecture menta lly disabled young adults on religious values78 accordingly the circuit panel vacated and remanded the lower courts decision upholding immigration authoritie s denial of the visa petition
