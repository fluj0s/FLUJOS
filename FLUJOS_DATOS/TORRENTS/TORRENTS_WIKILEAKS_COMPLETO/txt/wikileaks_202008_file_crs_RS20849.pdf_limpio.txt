finance reform constitutional issues raised by disclosure requirements l paige whitaker legislative attorney american law division summary current federal election law contains reporting and disclosure requirements related to campaign financing1 the supreme court has generally upheld such provisions although imposing disclosure requirements on spending for communications that do not meet the strict standard of express advocacy may be held unconstitutional campaign finance reform legislation often contains provisions that would impose additional reporting and disclosure requirements under the federal election campaign act feca for example s 27 mccainfeingold would require disclosure of disbursements of expenditures over 10000 for electioneering communications which are defined to include broadcast ads that refer to federal office candidates with identification of donors of 500 or more s 22 hagellandrieu would increase and expedite current disclosure requirements under feca hr 380 shaysmeehan would lower the current feca threshold for contribution reporting from 200 to 50 and impose reporting requirements for soft money disbursements by persons other than political parties this report will discuss some of the constitutional issues relating to these and other such disclosure requirements reporting of contributions and candidateparty expenditures in its landmark decision buckley v valeo2 the supreme court upheld the reporting and disclosure requirements of the federal election campaign act feca applicable to contributions and expenditures by candidates and political parties in buckley the court determined that disclosure requirements can serve three governmental interests that werehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20849crs2 3 id at 66 4 id at 79 5 id at 84 6 id 7 4 f3d 26

deterring the reality and appearance of corruption by exposing large contributions and candidate expenditures and 3 providing the government with the data necessary to detect violations of law3 however with regard to independent expenditures the court found that reporting requirements can only apply to those independent expenditures that expressly advocate the election or defeat of clearly identified candidate4 in noteworthy portion of the decision the court expres sly deferred to legislative judgment in upholding the reporting and disclosure requirements in buckley the plaintiffs argued that feca provisions which require political committees to maintain records with the name and address of contributors donating over 10 and to report the name address occupation and employer of contributors who donate in the aggregate over 100 were unconstitutional while the court agreed that these thresholds were indeed low it neverth eless found that we cannot require congress to establish that it has chosen the highest reasonable threshold5 indeed the court concluded such determinations are best left in the context of this complex legislation to congressional discretion6 court deference to legislative determinations may be limited however when court finds that the legislature has established series of differing disclosure thresholds without sufficiently demonstrating its reasoning for such disparities for example in vote choice inc v distefano7 the us court of appeals for the first circuit struck down rhode island law requiring political action committees pacs to disclose the identity of every contributor even contributors donating as little as 1 practice sometimes referred to as first dollar disclosure while only requiring candidates to disclose contributors donating more than 100 the first circuit did not express concern with first dollar disclosure per but with the disparity between disclosure requirements applicable to pacs versus the requi rements applicable to candidates according to the vote choice court the governments interest in disclosure is generally constant that is the interest is the same regardless of whether the disclosure requirement applies to individuals or to an association of individuals the subject rhode island law however was not only inconsistent the court found but imposed particularl virulent strain of unevenness into its statutory scheme without serving any cognizable government interest8 disclosure requirements can also raise constitutional questions concerning the right of contributors to organizations subject to disclosure requirements to enjoy freedom of association9 according to the supreme court in its 1958 decision naacp v alabama 10httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20849crs3 9 continued organization 10 357 us 449 1958 11 id at 460 12 id at 462 13 id at 46364 14 buckley 424 us at 70 15 id at 71 16 id at 74 17 459 us 87 1982it is well established that freedom to engage in association for the advancement of beliefs and ideas is an inseparable aspect of the liberty rights guaranteed by the due process clause of the 14th amendment11 and that there is an important relationshi p between freedom to associate and privacy in ones associations12 accordingly the naacp court held that compelled disclosure of an associations membership lists is unconstitutional if it can be shown that disclosure is likely to constitute an effective restraint on members freedom of association rights the court found that disclosure of the naacps members had exposed those members to economic reprisal loss of employment threat of physical coercion and other manifestations of public hostility therefore the court held compelled disclosure of members would detrime ntally affect the associations ability to exercise its rights to advocate its beliefs and further it might induce members to quit the association and dissuade others from joining13 drawi ng from its reasoning in naacp in buckley v valeo the supreme court upheld the current feca disclosure requirements as applied to minor as well as major parties in buckley the plaintiffs argued that the first amendment rights of minor parties were significantly burdened by contributor disclosure requirements since they were more susceptible to harassment and that the government had little interest in information regarding minor parties having only small chance of winning elections the court determined however that unlike the evidence prese nted in naacp any serious infring ement on first amendment rights brought about by compelled disclosure of contributors is highly speculative14 that is according to the court absent case being made that the threat to constitutionally protected rights is so great and the governmental interest furthered by compelled disclosure is so insubstantial that the law cannot be constitutionally applied disclosure laws will pass constitutional muster15 nevertheless the buckley court did recognize that in the future specific minor party might be able to demonstrate with reasonable probability that disclosure requirements would subject its party contributor s to threats harassment or reprisals and accordingly such party could qualify for an exemption16 the supreme court applied this principle again in brown v sociali st workers 74 campaign committee ohio 17 that disclosure rules generally will be upheld as applied to minor political parties unless the minor political party can demonstrate as the party in this case did that such disclosure will subject the identified parties to reasonable probabilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20849crs4 18 id at 92 19 buckley 424 us at 8081 20 feca defines independent expenditure as an expenditure by person expressly advocating the election or defeat of clearly identified candidate which is made without cooperation or consultation with any candidate or any authorized committee or agent of such candidate and which is not made in concert with or at the request or suggestion of any candidate or any authorized committee or agent of such candidate 2 usc 43117 21 2 usc 434c 22 for discussion of the constitutional issues relating to the regulation of issue advocacy versus express advocacy see crs report 98282 campaign finance reform legal analysis of issue and express advocacy by l paige whitakerof threats harassment or reprisals from either government officials or private parties18 in view of these supreme court holdings if case could be made that disclosure requirement would seriously infringe on the first amendment rights of contributors to organizations subject to the requirements then as applied to those cases the regulations might be overturned reporting of express advocacy independent expenditures versus issue advocacy expenditures in buckley v valeo the supreme court upheld feca disclosure requirements for independent expenditures19 under feca when an organization or individual other than political committee makes an independent expenditure20 aggregating over 250 in year expressly advocating the election or defeat of clearly identified candidate it is subject to disclosure requirements21 on the other hand the current prevailing view of the courts is that disclosure requirements for noncandidate expenditures which do not expressly advocate the election or defeat of clearly identified candidate are unconstitutional that is according to most courts expenditures for communications that merely relate to political issues without meeting the express advocacy standard are constitutionally prote cted issue advocacy communications which canno t be subject to disclosure requirements or any other regulation22 repo rting of issue advocacy expenditures by taxexempt groups even if disclosure requirement is found to result in an unconstitutional regulation of first amendment protected issue advocacy some have argued that conditioning receipt of taxexempt status under the internal revenue code irc on compliance with disclosure requirement might provide basis for regulating beyond the express advocacy standard to permit disclosure regulation of first amendment

restrictions on abortion counseling under federal program were upheld because the restriction applied to the program or service and did not place condition on the recipient of the subsidy and buckley v valeo 424 us 1 9596 1976 where although party directly challenged the constitutionali ty of the current feca provision providing federal funds to qualifying presidential candidate in exchange for voluntary compliance with spending limitations the supreme court appeared favorably disposed to the voluntary limitation since it believed that providing federal funds to private parties for campaigning enhanced rather than restricted opportunities to communicate and advocate to the public 24 357 us 513 1958 25 461 us 540 1991 26 id at 545 27 26 usc 501c3 28 461 us 540 545 1991 29 id it may be constitutionally significant to note that in the case of the presidential public financing system the government is actually paying for the campaign advocacy activities in question that is unlike the partial taxexempt benefits that an internal revenue code irc section 527organization 501c4 c5 or c6 organization may realize or the fully tax exempt benefits that section 501c3 may realize as result of their irc taxdesignated status the benefit or money involved is an actual payment or direct subsidy from federal funds for the specific purpose of financing the campaign advocacy in questionfirst amendment rights23 in other words the government may not accomplish indirectly what it would not be permitted to do directly for example in speiser v randall the supreme court held that state could not condition veterans tax exemption upon the recipients execution of loyalty oath which the court found to be in violation of recipients first amendment rights24 on the other hand regan v taxation with representation of washington25 is sometimes cited in support of the governments ability to limit the exercise of first amendment right as condition of receiving the public benefit of taxexempt status26 in regan the supreme court upheld the restrictions on lobbying by irc section 501c327 organizations to which contributions are tax deductible because they operate as government subsidy directly supporting the activities in which the charity engages28 that is if charity engages in lobbying activities then the government subsidy would be paying for those lobbying activities as noted by the court congress has merely refused to pay for lobbying out of public moneys29 disclosure requirement of issue advocacy expenditures by taxexempt groups however does not involve situation where the government is subsidizing the exercise of first amendment right instead such requirement might be held to infringe on first amendment right ie the right not to disclose or speak concerning constitutionally protected issue advocacy communications by requiring disclosure as condition of receiving the benefit of taxexempt status although the matter is not free from doubt it seems likely that court could find this type of disclosure requirement to be less in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20849crs6 nature of permissible provision that merely denies federal funds for particular first amendmen t activity and more in the nature of an impermissible provision that denies federal benefits to those who engage in protected activities
