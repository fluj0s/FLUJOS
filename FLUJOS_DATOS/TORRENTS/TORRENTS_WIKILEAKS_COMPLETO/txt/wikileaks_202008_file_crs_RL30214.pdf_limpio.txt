experienced declining economic conditions while accumulat ing higher levels of debt largely owed to multilateral public lending agencies such as the world bank and the imf and to foreign governments including the united states for the 41 nations that have been identified as the most heavily indebted poor countries hipc external longterm debt rose rapidly from less than 7 billion in 1970 to 47 billion decade later to 158 billion by 1990 and to 169 billion today the largest portion 85 is owed to public lenders governments and institutions like the world bank although roughly half of the hipc longterm debt is owed to bilateral lenders only 37 is owed to the united states since 1989 the us japan and major european governments recognizing that the mounting debt burden for some borrowers has undermined efforts to stimulate economic growth and to finance basic social programs have extended series of increasingly broad debt relief arrangements the most recent initiative hipc aims to reduce the debt burden of poor countries that have demonstrated sound economic and social policy reforms to manageable or sustainable levels that can be serviced comfortably by export revenues and capital inflows when it was launched poor country debt relief proponents hailed the initiative for its comprehensive and integrated approach especially the inclusion of world bank and imf participation and for its objective to provide lasting debt solutions but after three years only four countries fully qualified for hipc debt reduction terms and strong international pressure built to expand and deepen hipc terms critics argued that it takes countries too long to qualify that the conditions for eligibility are inappropriate and that the poverty reduction focus is insufficient us and other g7 leaders forged an agreement for expanding hipc at the june 1820 2000 summit in germany the contents of which were adopted by the world bank and the imf at their annual meetings in september several legislative initiatives were introduced in 1999 hr 1095 representative leach would reform hipc by providing debt relief more quickly to more countries and in greater amounts with an emphasis on poverty reduction senator mack introduced similar legislation s 1690 recommending that debt relief savings finance both poverty and economic reform activities other legislation includes hr 2232

most heavily indebted poor countries for the past several decades the united states other industrialized nations and international financial institutions have extended considerable financial assistance provided as both loans and grants to developing countries with mixed results1 many developing nations have experienced declining economic conditions while at the same time accumulating higher levels of debt largely owed to multilateral public lending agencies such as the world bank and the imf and to foreign governments known as bilateral lenders including the united states germany france great britain and others since 1989 the united states japan and major european governments recognizing that for some borrowers the mounting debt burden undermined efforts to stimulate economic growth and to finance basic social programs have extended series of increasingly broad debt relief arrangements despite these efforts economic difficulties for the worlds most heavily indebted poor nations persist in subsaharan africa home to most of these heavily indebted countries after several years of improving economic performance economic growth slowed to 21 in 1998 and per capita income fell by 1 debt is not the sole cause of this slowdown but it is noteworthy that in 1998 total debt stock for african nations grew to about 226 billion up from 219 billion the year before net foreign aid and other official transfers remained stagnant at about 12 billion in 1998 but have declined overall by more than 50 in real terms during the 1990s2 broad consensus emerged among creditor governments and public institutions poor debtor countries and nongovernmental organizations ngos that more aggressive debt relief measures centered around the world bankimf heavily indebted poor country hipc initiative should be pursued at their september 1999 annual meetings the world bank and imf endorsed substantial expansion of hipc including steps that will increase the number of qualifying countries provide larger amounts of debt relief potentially shorten the time required for receiving debt reduction and strengthen the programs impact on poverty reduction nevertheless questions remain on how these measures will be implemented and how donor organizations and governments will pay for the costs of more expansive hipc many issues related to an expanded hipc are raised in an array of executive and legislative debt reduction proposals enacted and pending in the 106th congress president clinton initially proposed 120 million for fy2000 debt relief funding figure that was subsequently increased to 970 million over four years in ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30214crs2 3 congress passed both hr 3422 and hr 3425 as part of the consolidated appropriations act fy2000 pl

its costs of canceling debt owed to it by hipc countries the legislation however allows the imf to use only part of the profit generated by the gold transaction for hipc relief congressional leaders

including how much debt is owed to the united states one of the most striking characteristics of the debt burden of the hipc countries is the large proportion that is owed to public lenders rather than the private sector as illustrated in figure 1 the world bank estimates that creditor governments and institutions account for more than 85 of hipc debt obligations by comparison only 28 of latin american longterm debt is owed to public lenders for all developing nations the amount is 42 although roughly half of the hipc longterm debt is owed to bilateral lenders as shown in table 4 page 10

initiatives is drawn from africas debt burden proposals for further forgiveness by jonathan sanford csis africa notes number 189 october 1996 7 in evaluating countrys debt burden analysts generally examine the debts net present value npv rather than its face value the npv of debt takes into account the degree of concessionality that is the extent to which loans carry interest rates below market levels if loan has an interest rate below the market rate the npv of debt will be smaller than the face value with the difference reflecting the concessional element of the loanevolution of debt reduction programs for poor nations for the past decade members of the g7 have taken the lead for initiating plans to reduce or cancel public debt owed to them by severely indebted developing nations6 through the paris club an informal forum of creditor governments that review negotiate and adopt debt relief programs for poor countries the united states germany japan france and others have implemented series of debt measures prior to 1988 the paris club generally engaged only in rescheduling but not reducing debt this solved immediate debt servicing crises but offered permanent relief in some cases reschedulings fueled mounting debt stocks of developing nations ultimately setting the stage for subsequent financial emergency paris club arrangements following the 1988 g7 meeting in toronto the paris club endorsed menu of debt relief options through which heavily indebted countries could receive forgiveness for as much as onethird of the net present value npv7 of their public bilateral nonconcessional debt that was eligible for rescheduling eligible debt included portions that were in arrears or due in the next 18 to 24 months but not amounts previously rescheduled these socalled toronto terms were broadened three years later at the g7 conference in london where creditor countries agreed to implement enhanced toronto terms and reduce up to 50 percent of npv of eligible poor country public nonconcessional debt between 1988 and 1995 paris club members rescheduled under toronto and enhanced toronto terms about 148 billion of debt owed primarily by african nations the paris club further expanded debt reduction options following the 1994 g7 summit in naples under what became known as naples terms developing countries could receive forgiveness for up to twothirds of their total npv of non concessional debt not just the portion eligible for rescheduling paris club members continue to use naples terms today although for those countries which qualify even more generous hipc terms are applied see below for discussion of hipc us debt reduction programs the united states did not participate in paris club debt reduction initiatives until 1994 although independently the us forgave about 358 billion in poor country debt in the late 1980s and early 1990s and an additional 102 billion in debt owed by egypt poland and jordan 19901995 each of these arrangements were implemented under special authorities legislated and in some cases initiated by congress sec 572 debt relief section 572 of the foreign operations appropriations for fy1989 pl 100461

result of this initiative and because the united states had shifted in the early 1980s to grant rather than loan aid relativel small amount of concessional debt is still owed to the united states by heavily indebted nations in africa and elsewhere sec 411 debt section 411 of the agricultura l trade development and assistance act more commonly referred to as pl 480 authorizes the forgiveness of

reduction programs under provisions of the federal credit reform act of 1990 congress must also appropriate in advance the anticipated costs to the us government of canceling such debt the appropriated amount which is usually included in the annual foreign operations spending measure equals the estimated loss to the us treasury of implementing the debt reduction agreement each years federal budget assumes that certain amount of loan reflows or offsetting receipts will be received over time the appropriation offsets the loss of these reflows the calculation of how much money must be appropriated to reduce or cancel certain amount of debt is complicated and depends on number of factors including the value of debt whether it is concessional or nonconcessional and the likelihood of repayment by the debtor for loans that bear interest rates at or above current levels that were made to countries with good repayment history the amount of appropriations will be much higher than for concessional loans to countries that pay late or default for example during the 1990s congress appropriated 386 million to cancel roughly 700 million of debt owed by jordan since jordan had good debt service record and held loans bearing above market interest rates jordans debt forgiveness was more expensive initiative in budget terms on the other hand for the poorest countries that have less capacity to service their debt which consists mainly of highly concessional loans the cost and the appropriation is much smaller in fy1999 the treasury department estimated that it would use 43 million appropriated the previous two years to cancel 376 million face value of debt owed by 11 hipc countries in other words jordans debt was more valuable to the us government in terms of anticipated repayment than loans made to poorer countriescalculating the cost of debt reduction initiatives and the role of congress heavily indebted poor country hipc initiative the series of incremental and sometimes uncoordinated debt rescheduling and relief plans during the late 1980s and early 1990s did not produce the degree of sustainable debt reduction that international aid agencies and debtor governments had envisioned the stock of longterm debt owed by the severely indebted lowincome countries actually grew from 61 billion in 1980 to 245 billion in 1995 while their debt as percent of exports had risen from 102 to 421 during the same period further the share of debt owed to international financial institutions ifis such as the world bank increased sharply in the early 1990s from 21 in 1990 to 27 in 19959 one of the major criticisms of earlier debt relief initiatives was the absence of participation by the ifis world bank and other ifi officials asserted that to engage in debt reduction they would have to pass the costs on to their middleincome country borrowers instead the ifis increased lending on highly concessional terms to the poorest countries

bank and imf sponsored the initiation in september 1996 of the heavily indebted poor countries debt hipc initiative hipc remains the centerpiece international debt workout plan of today overview of the hipc initiative the intent of the hipc initiative is to reduce the debt burden of poor countries that have demonstrated sound economic and social policy reforms to manageable or sustainable levels that can be serviced comfortably by export revenues and capital inflows when it was launched poor country debt relief proponents hailed the initiative for its comprehensive and integrated approach especially the inclusion of ifi participation and for its objective to provide lasting debt solutions hipc eligibility criteria to be selected for possible hipc status countries must meet specific criteria receive only concessional financing from the world bank and imf that is borrowing only from the world banks international development association ida and from the imfs enhanced structural adjustment facility esaf establish track record of economic reforms under imf and world banksponsored programs hold debt burden that is unsustainable under existing naples terms relief arrangements through an initial analysis in 1996 the world bank and imf identified 41 heavily indebted countries the 41 hipc countries10 hipc timing and terms the hipc process is divided into two phases during an initial threeyear period beginning at what is called the entry point countries must successfully follow world bank and imf adjustment programs at the conclusion of this phase the bank and fund conduct debt analysis to determine whether country still requires extraordinary debt relief beyond naples terms it was presumed that during this threeyear period some countries might improve their economic position to the extent that they could manage their debt burden without the need for hipc terms the analysis is intended to determine whether the country can service its debt based on mediumterm balance of paymen ts projection the economic indicators used in the bankfund analysis are the relationship between the present value of external debt and the export of goods and services for the first three years of hipc if countrys debttoexport ratio fell above range of 200 250 and debt servicetoexports exceeded 2025 its debt burden was categorized as unsustainable making the country eligible for hipc terms as discussed below critics charged that these thresholds were too high and prevented the cancellation of sufficient debt to make longlasting difference consequently the world bank and imf have lowered the debttoexport target to 150httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30214crs15 11 g7 leaders further adopted us proposal that they forgive 100 of concessional or foreign aid debt owed by poor debtor countries more recently on september 29 president clinton announced that the united states was prepared to cancel 100 of all concessional and nonconcessional debt debt owed by hipc countries and urged others to follow britain has endorsed the same policy while others have the issue under review 12 very open economies are those where the exporttogdp ratio is higher than 40 and the fiscal revenuetogdp ratio exceeds 20 13 most countries have or are expected to have their debt reduced based on the debttoexports ratio the world bank estimates that three countries may receive assistance under the fiscal criteriaat this stage of the process known as the decision point country with unsustainable debt may begin to receive from bilateral creditors reduction of non concessional debt through paris club arrangements during the first three years of hipc creditor governments would cancel up to 80 of eligible debt as opposed to 67 under naples terms g7 leaders agreed however during their june 1999 summit to increase the ceiling to 9011 at the decision point countries begin second period originally three years but modified in september 1999 to an unspecified amount of time that may result in more rapid qualification during which they must continue to display good performance under bankfund program at the end of the second phase referred to as the completion point country becomes fully eligible for hipc debt relief in addition to the 90 reduction from paris club debt the world bank imf and other ifis adjust debt levels to sustainable amount so that countrys present value of total debt as percent of exports does not exceed 150 special treatment may be given to nations with very open economies12 where the debttoexport ratio falls below 150 but still face heavy debt burden in relation to its fiscal revenues in these cases creditors will reduce debt so that the present value of debt equals 250 of fiscal revenues13 for the first three years of hipc this target had been 280 although debtor countries become fully eligible only at the completion point world bank and imf modifications in september 1999 will result in interim relief by ifis during the second stage with reduction in annual debt service payments through what the ifis are calling frontloaded assistance financing hipc key enhancement to previous debt reduction arrangements introduced in the hipc process is more systematic method of burdensharing of the costs of implementing debt relief programs bilateral creditors largely through the paris club meet the costs according to the budget rules that apply to their respective national governments in the case of the united states congress must appropriate funds in advance of debt cancellation providing an amount equal to the present value of loans to be reduced for poor countries this can be very small portion of the loans face value perhaps 10 or less the reduction of multilateral debt is financed through the idamanaged hipc

country about to make large payment on an imf loan after buying the gold the country will immediately make its loan payment to the imf but in gold that it just purchased rather than hard currency the imf will invest the profits of its gold transaction in security instrument and use the earned interest to pay for the costs of canceling hipc debt over 20 year period while many imf members have endorsed this approach it requires the agreement of 85 of the funds voting shares congress must authorize us support for the proposal and since the united states holds more than 15 of the votes the gold revaluation plan cannot be implemented without us and congressional approval 15 congress in hr 2606 the fy2000 foreign operations appropraitions denied all hipc trust fund requests president

enormous preventable suffering on african people hr 772 essentially rejects the hipc initiative substituting policy of immediate unconditional debt forgiveness of the entire 68 billion of african debt owed to the united states government23 as well as all debt owed to american private lenders and advocating the implementation of similar policies by other creditor governments and ifis hr 772 is the most expansive of the congressional bills promoting 100 immediate debt forgiveness without conditions for all subsaharan african nations if fully implemented the hope for africa bill would result in the forgiveness of about 226 billion for all 48 african nations plus potentially up to about 1 billion of debt owed to us persons to cover the costs of us debt forgiveness hr 772 authorizes for

of the house hope for africa act like hr 772 it would apply to all 48 subsaharan african countries and result in 100 cancellation of all debt owed the united states by these countries it would not require however the forgiveness of private debt held by us persons as in hr 772 but instead call for report by january 1 2000 from the treasury department setting out plan for the us government to acquire this private debt specific amount of money is authorized for implementation of s 1636 debt relief and development in africa act of 1999 hr 2232 like hr 1095 and s 1690 is focused directly on debt reduction issues and promotes improvements to the hipc process not its abolishment while similar in scope to the leach and mack bills legislation offered by representative waters on june 15 1999 would extend deeper debt reduction to smaller group of nations add additional eligibility requirements for debtor countries and explicitly reject the need for nations to comply with an imf structural adjustment program portions of the bill that required hipc countries to implement plans to protect their natural resources were incorporated into the markedup text of hr 1095 like the hope for africa

economic reforms arguing instead for immediate cancellation this position is generally based on the premise that much of the past debt was acquired illegitimately for reasons unrelated to the development needs of the poor that it was accumulated with the encouragement of international financial institutions at time when they had capital surplus that it was thrust upon us and soviet cold

savings from debt forgiveness for poverty reduction purposes debt forgivenes s act of 1999 hr 1305 introduced by representative campbell on march 25 1999 has far more limited scope than the other bills under the campbell legislation the president must first cancel 100 of concessional and nonconcessional debt owed to the united states by all 41 hipc countries before the us can transfer funds to the imf last year in pl 105277 congress appropriated 179 billion to fund us participation in an imf quota increase and for the funds new arrangements to borrow facility critics views of hipc proposals for change and the response while debt relief proponents have found fault with many aspects of the hipc initiatives the most significant concerns over which there is wide agreement center on three issues the speed of debt relief how much relief is provided and eligibility requirements for hipc participation the discussion below explains each of these criticisms and identifies reform proposals adopted by the g7 and the world bankimf and those included in congressional legislation hipc debt relief comes too slowly most agreed that qualifying period that can take up to six years was too long critics asserted that such delays were actually counterproductive to the success of economic reforms undertaken by hipc countries that debt relief provided during rather than after completion of structural adjustment program can accelerate and strengthen the reform efforts moreover they argued that countries emerging from conflict or have been victimized by natural disaster such as hurricane mitch should be provided with special accommodation so that their debt obligations do not complicate reconstruction efforts while most support the requirement for some qualifying period the issue becomes how long track record of good economic performance is sufficient to ensure that debt relief is not wasted and that it will have lasting benefit24 the world bank and imf have maintained in the past that second threeyear period after country reaches its decision point may be necessary to guarantee that the full range of complex structural reforms have time to take hold but the institutions also pointed out that the six year requirement was applied flexibly for the seven countries at or near the end of the hipc process that uganda and bolivia for example had their second stage shortened to one year one implication of shortening the qualifying period is the possibility of additional costs by reducing the time countries would receive debt relief earlier before the

debt canceled general accounting office status of the heavily indebted poor country debt relief initiative september 1998 p 38impact of reforms had chance to strengthen their economic position as result the debttoexport ratios on which the amount of debt relief is calculated would likely be higher at an earlier point and would require more assistance to lower the debt stock to the sustainable target of around 200 an analysis by the world bank estimates that shortening the second threeyear qualifying stage by one year would add 2 billion while the elimination of the second stage would raise hipc costs by 66 billion25 from the perspective of the debtor country the advantage under an accelerated qualification scenario would be the receipt of earlier and higher amounts of debt relief26 world bankimf modifications at their annual meetings the bank and fund endorsed g7 proposals for multilaterals to extend interim relief and to establish floating completion points that could shorten the time it takes country to receive hipc debt relief instead of fixed threeyear second stage nations could reach the completion point once they had successfully met agreedupon economic policy targets this according to bank and fund officials would offer strong incentives for governments to implement reform programs more quickly and to assume more direct control over how rapidly they become fully eligible for hipc relief terms congressional recommendations except for hr 3425 each of the broadly focused debt reduction bills propose to shorten the interim period by not stating timing preference hr 3425 would allow the president to implement debt reduction programs at an accelerated pace as recommended by the g7 the leach and mack bills hr 1095 and s 1690 propose to shorten the eligibility period to more than three years with special accommodation for countries emerging from conflict of natural disasters the hope for africa measures hr 772 and s 1636 include few specific dates for initiating debt relief actions but through series of required reports by the president to congress the legislation implies that rapid movemen t should occur beginning on december 31 1999 the president must report annually on unilateral debt relief for african nations within nine months of enactment the secretary of state must report on how other creditor governments have responded to us appeals for

debttoexport ratio above 100 and has created human development fund and natural resource development plan debt sustainability definitions and targets are limited or inappropriate many hipc critics believed that the debttoexport and debt servicetoexport thresholds were set too high excluding some heavily indebted countries from qualifying for hipc terms or from being included among the hipc countries bangladesh haiti comoros among other poor countries were not part of the hipc process even though their debttoexport ratios fell between 150300 setting targets too high according to these critics further restricted the amount of debt relief provided undermining the prospect that hipc would provide permanent exit from an unsustainable debt burden downturn in global commodity prices or other negative external factors they argued can shift country from sustainable to unsustainable debt position debtor nations would be far less vulnerable to such factors if hipc provided deeper debt relief some of these same critics also believed that hipc places too much emphasis on reducing debt stock and not enough on cutting the amounts of debt service targets based on the relationship between debt and exports they believed are less important than indicators focused on debt service and government revenues reducing debt service obligations frees up resources immediately that can be used to finance social and other poverty reduction programs many observers were dismayed by world bank and imf admissions that debt service payments for the early qualifiers of hipc relief would not be much different than before indeed debt service for mali and burkina faso was expected to rise27 critics believed that indicators drawing on the relationship between debt service and government revenue s were more appropriate for poor countries and would help achieve the duel goals of debt reduction and increased spending on education health and other social programs the world bank and imf did not necessarily disagree with these concerns and acknowledged that hipc targets were judgmental rules of thumb that should not represent discrete cutoffs they cautioned however that changes made to the targets or the introduction of different indicators also raised serious implications establishing an appropriate debt service target that would achieve debt sustainability they asserted would be more difficult and lack strong analytic basis bank and fund officials further said that countrys capacity to service debt involves more than just the collection of revenues and needs to be examined in full budgetary context they have also expressed concern that substantial expansion and deepening of hipc relief would not necessarily lead to increased amounts of external aid that because of

estimate of 29 potentially qualifying nations would grow to 36 under ratio reductions recommended by the g7 the g7 further endorsed plan also backed earlier by the united states for bilateral lenders to forgive all concessional foreign aid loans and to extend future concessional financing mostly in the form of grant aid since the united states has extended nearly all foreign aid as grants for over decade this latter proposal would have impact on current us policy this would also be the case for most other donors but for country such as japan which in 1997 offered about 17 of its aid as loans this policy would require adjustments world bankimf modifications bankfund proposals follow closely those endorsed by the g7 they recommend that the npv debttoexports ratio decline form the current

its completion point29 under the 10 ceiling mozambique would have paid 45 million in 1997 while the relief provided may be dramatic the costs to creditor governments and institutions might be as well the waters bill hr 2232 would extend deeper and broader debt relief than other pending initiatives except for the hope for africa legislation the debttoexport ratio eligibility threshold would fall to 100 making about 38 african nations eligible30 the amount of debt relief received would deepen due to requirem ent that countrys debt burden be reduced so that the npv of debttoexports does not exceed 100 and that annual debt service payments are not larger than 5 of annual government revenues generated from internal sources as noted above the latter target especially would deepen the debt relief and accelerate its impact for financing poverty programs the costs to creditor governments and institutions also would grow perhaps significantly performance requirements are flawed for years ngos and many developing countries especially have argued that imfsponsored structural adjustment programs have in most cases not achieved their goals of expanding economic growth while inflicting substantial negative impact on poverty reduction efforts in poor countries as such the hipc requirement to maintain such reform arrangement through the imfs enhance structural adjustment facility esaf these critics asserted was not appropriate for hipc eligibility they believed that esaf programs should be replaced with alternative performance links with poverty focus emphasis debtor countries would be required to establish social development plans that would result in increased spending on education health care environmental protection and other basic services31httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30214crs29

have had positive effects on growth and income distribution in poor countries32 bank and fund staff further stress that the hipc initiative has always pursued dual objectives of achieving economic growth and alleviating poverty requiring countries to develop comprehensive plans for poverty reduction and social development they caution may be beyond their current capacity because of financial considerations sufficient time would be required to design such initiatives they say factor that might be counter productive to efforts to accelerate the pace of debt relief according to other observers given the evidence that hipc will not provide much in the way of early debt service relief for some countries requirement that debtor governments increase spending on basic social programs derived from debt reduction savings may be asking countries to spend funds that will not have been generated g7 proposal although g7 leaders continue to support imf and world bank policy reform programs for hipc countries they issued strong recommendation for the bank and fund to build an enhanced poverty reduction framework especially within the imfs esaf programs g7 finance ministers called on the bank and fund to help hipc countries design and implement poverty reduction plans through transparent and participatory process that will ensure that debt relief savings would be invested in health education and other social programs world bankimf modifications the bank and fund now agree that an enhanced hipc initiative should include stronger framework for poverty reduction although the details on how this might affect esaf policy reform programs or requirements for debtor countries to establish social development plans remain to be worked out imf board directors have noted that proposals for interim assistance and frontloaded relief on the part of the multilaterals could be means to help hipc nations to find additional resources for social and other povertyrelated activities moreover the imf will require in the future that countries receiving debt relief must develop and implement poverty reduction strategy paper that has the full participation of civil society fund officials have further implied that successful implementation of these strategy papers may become factor in imf decisions whether to proceed with esaf loan transfers the imf has subsequently renamed esaf as the poverty reduction and growth facility prgf congressional recommendations of the bills introduced and considered in the 106th congress hr 3425 as enacted is the only initiative that expressly requires country to adhere to social and economic reform program none of the other broadly focused debt reduction bills would continue esaf reform program compliance as requirement for hipc eligibility on the other hand each including hr 3425 either requires or recommends additional standards connected with strengthened poverty reduction spending on the part of debtor governments the issue of esaf policy reforms linked with debt reduction eligibility was extensively debated during the house banking committee markup of hr 1095 on november 3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30214crs30 33 the 2020 initiative calls on foreign aid donors to focus 20 of their assistance on poverty reduction programs and aid recipient governments to commit 20 of their revenues to basic social programshr 3425 as enacted requires that qualified debtor nation maintain social and economic reform program that among other things is designed through transparent and participatory processes integrates povertyoriented development strategies and ensures that the debt savings are used to reduce poverty and environmental degradation and expands the private sector the legislation further requires the us to work through the imf to modify the funds esaf programs incorporating provisions with poverty reduction focus hr 1095 would directly strengthen the poverty reduction requirements of hipc the bill as reported requires that any economic and social conditions placed on country eligibility include measures for poverty reduction and environmental protection the bill further adds an additional requirement that in order to receive relief debtor nation must establish human development fund into which funds saved from debt relief measures be deposited and spent on basic social services through this proponents intend to ensure that debtor governments invest more of the countrys resources in education health clean water and other poverty focused programs during the markup session the committee adopted an amendment by representative frank aimed at assuring that debtor nations eligibility for us debt relief would be determined not by the terms of an imf structural adjustment program but by conditions established by the united states including those required by hr 1095 another amendment by representative sanders urges the president to seek changes in the hipc process that would eliminate the need for an imf reform program as condition of eligibility other amendments intended to bar the requirement for imf structural adjustment programs or to cancel debt unconditionally were either withdrawn or defeated s 1690 includes similar poverty spending requirements as in hr 1095 plus an additional condition that governments use the debt relief savings for economic reform programs that promote sustainable development with benefits shared widely throughout the population the hope for africa act hr 772 authorizes unconditional debt relief for african nations thereby eliminating any preconditions regarding esaf or other policy reform requirements the jackson bill however includes requirement for the secretary of state to encourage african governments to allocate 20 of their national budgets to support the uns 2020 initiative33httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30214crs31 the companion hope for africa act s 1636 includes standard legislative eligibility requirements that countries not violate human rights promote terrorism engage in drug production or trafficking or spend excessive amounts on their militaries like hr 772 the bill endorses that african governments support the 2020 initiative the debt relief and development in africa act of 1999 hr 2232 explicitly prohibits the use of structural adjustment programs as condition for hipc eligibility the waters bill like hr 1095 also requires debtor nations to establish human development fund which will be used to expand government financia l allocations for basic social programs in addition hr 2232 further mandates that countries create natural resource development plan that will clearly identify among other things which natural resources are being developed to what extent companies involved in their development will profit the quantity of revenues that will be generated through such development and how the government plans to use the money and government conservation and environmental protection proposals the bill authorizes the us agency for international development and directs international financial institutions to assist debtor countries in creating the plan and negotiating the terms of contracts with foreign investors involved in the development of natural resources further hr 2232 bans us exportimport bank support for any private american business involved in natural resource development in

of enhanced hipc debt relief measures while approval for altering hipc policy terms and conditions has occurred there is less certainty whether sufficient funds will be committed to implementing the

debt writedowns under the original hipc structure the world bank and imf agreed to draw from their own resources while other regional mdbs would require some assistance from bilateral donors and their

international development association ida resources to implement debt relief this would reduce ida lending to these same poor countries at least in the short term raise concern among international development proponents who oppose extending debt relief at the expense of development aid for the imf the situation is more complicated the fund had planned to finance part of its participation under the earlier framework from the sale of gold after gaining the support of g7 governments including the united states for the gold sale the original plan was abandoned in the face of significant opposition from gold mining business interests and goldproducing countries in africa who believe the sale would force the price of gold down the imf modified its gold proposal so that through complicated process some of the funds gold assets would be revalued from the book price of about 48 an ounce to the current world market price of more than 260 per ounce in short the profit from the revaluation of gold could be used for writing off poor country debt owed the imf34 as noted above congress approved legislation hr 3425 that allow the us to support the proposed mechanism although with certain limitations us costs for the united states full implementation of the enhanced hipc modifications requires additional appropriations of 970 million provided over several years president clinton had earlier asked congress to provide 120 million for debt relief including 50 million for the hipc trust fund in fy2000 after g7 agreement to expand the terms of hipc the white house on september 21 1999 amended its pending request adding 850 million for total of 970 million of this 370 million was sought for fy2000 with the balance provided in increments of 200 million in each the following three years of the total 650 million would pay for us contributions to the hipc trust fund these estimates however are highly tentative and could fluctuate widely for example if conditions in sudan somalia and liberia would change so that it became possible for their participation within hipc us expenses especially for bilateral debt reduction would grow considerably since these three countries account for roughly 2 billion of the 6 billion owed the us by the 41 hipc nations the costs of bilateral debt reduction for the united states might grow by as much as onethird moreover at the world bankimf meetings president clinton announced that the united states was prepared to cancel 100 of all bilateral debt going beyond the 90 level endorsed by the g7 for nonconcessional loans this will push us costs up although the white house says the initiative can be accommodated within thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30214crs33 recent budget amendment main reason why us costs for an expanded hipc would fall heavily on financing the multilatera l dimensions rather than the bilateral portion of debt owed directly to the united states is because the us has previously written off large portion of concessional debt and has not extended foreign aid on loan basis for over 15 years thus far congress has supported only very small portion of the presidents funding request for debt relief as cleared for the white house on october 6 hr 2606 the fy2000 foreign operations appropriations bill provided only 33 million for debt relief programs none of which could be transferred to the hipc trust fund president clinton vetoed hr 2606 on october 18 largely because of spending reductions including those for debt relief measures more recently on november 18 and 19 the house and senate respectively approved another foreign operations appropriations hr 3422 that increases debt reduction spending to 123 million for fy2000 but still bars the use of funds for multilateral debt relief
