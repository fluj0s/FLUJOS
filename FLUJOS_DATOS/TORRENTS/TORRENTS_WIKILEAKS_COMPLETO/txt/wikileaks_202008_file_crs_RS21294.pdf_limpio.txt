defenses to conduct surveillance and reconnaissance operations or suppress enemy air defenses sead the navy plans to demons trate the aircrafts suitability for carrierbased operations in 2013 and have it enter service in 2021 as penetrating surveillance and reconnaissance system the nucas program was initiated as the ucavn program in conjunction with the defense advanced research projects agency darpa in december 2 002 the department of defense dod decided to merge the air force and navy ucav programs into joint unmanned combat air system jucas program in october 2005 management of juc as was transferred from darpa which had managed it since oct ober 2003 to joint air forcenavy office led by the air force in february 2006 dod announced that it was restructuring the j ucas program into

of naval ships and manned aircraft and naval c oncepts of operations ce the current navy ucav and gladiator ugv programs will likely fall far short of meeting the goals established by section 220 of pl 106398 should the these programs be accelerated so as to come closer to meeting the goals or should the go als in section 220 be amended how will the restructuring of the jucas program into the
