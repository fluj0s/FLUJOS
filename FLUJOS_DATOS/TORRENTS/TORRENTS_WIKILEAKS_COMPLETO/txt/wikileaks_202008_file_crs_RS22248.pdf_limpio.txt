conservation service nrcs of the usda administers several authorities for measures to prevent erosion and flood damages and to conserve develop and utilize land and water resources one of these is the emergency watershed protection ewp program which is used to restore the natural functions of watershed after natura l disaster has occurred this program is designed to help people and conserve natural resources by relieving imminent hazards to life and pr operty caused by floods fires windstorms and other natural occurrences it is an emergency recovery program ewp work is not limited to any one set of prescribed measures and can include removing debris from stream channels ro ad culverts and bridges reshaping and protecting eroded banks correcting damaged drainage facilities repairing levees and structures and purchasing fl oodplain easements all ewp work must reduce threats to life and property and must be economically environmentally nd socially defensible and sound from technical standpoint nrcs ma kes casebycase investigations of the completed work ewp funds have number of significant restrictions for example ewp cannot solve problems that existed before the disast er or improve the vel of protection above that which existed before disaster it cannot fund operation nd maintenance work or repair private or public tran sportation facilities or utilities the work cannot be used to install measures not essentia l to the reduction of hazards in addition funds cannot be used to perform work on structures installed by another federal agency appropriations vary widely from year to year and activity levels can vary widely from year to year and place to place spending is dependent upon s upplemental congressional appropr iations and is usually made ava ilable in
