radio system jtrs and the armys future combat system fcs issues for congress background the jtrs program originated in the mid1990s and was intended to replace the 25 to 30 families of radio systems used by the military many of which could not communicate with each other with softwarebased radios that could operate across the entire radio frequency spectrum1 jtrs is intended to permit the services to operate together in seamless manner via wireless voice video and data communications through all levels of command including direct access to near real time information from airborne and battlefield sensors2 described as software defined radio jtrs is envisioned to function more like computer than conventional radio and is to be upgraded and modified to operate with other communications systems by the addition of software as opposed to redesigning hardware more costly and timeconsuming process dod also asserts that in many cases single jtrs radio with multiple waveforms3 can replace many separate radios simplifying maintenance and that because jtrs is software programmable they will also provide longer functional life4 with both features offering potential longterm cost savings it is also planned that jtrs will be interoperable with current dod radio systems the pentagons global information grid5 and the communications systems of selected allied nations6 jtrs has been characterized by the army as key complementary enabler of the fcs network that would enable fcs sensors and combat systems to acquire and 1 peter buxbaum jitters over jtrs armed

merged clusters three and four into single program the airborne maritime and fixed station program amf jtrs jointly managed by the navy and the air force because studies suggested that developing the clusters together would result in more efficient procurement process and better overall product8 all jtrs clusters are being developed concurrently and there is requirement that one cluster is completed before another cluster can be developed because the fcs program is heavily dependent on clusters one and five this report will address only issues involving these two clusters being

maryland crs3 current issues developmental jtrs has experienced number of developmental difficulties to date some of the more notable difficulties are discussed in the following sections size and weight constraints and limited range according to government accountability office gao report to realize the full capabilities of the wideband networking waveform10 including transmission range the cluster one radio requires significant amounts of memory and processing power which add to the size weight and power consumption of the radio the added size and weight are the results of efforts to ensure the electronic parts in the radio are not overheated by the electricity needed to power the additional memory and processing thus far the program has not been able to develop radios that meet size weight and power requirements and the current projected transmission range is only three kilometers well short of the 10kilometer range required for the wideband networking waveform the cluster one radios size weight and peak power consumption exceeds helicopter platform requirements by as much as 80 percent11 the inability to meet these fundamental design and performance standards has raised concerns that cluster one may not be able to accommodate additional waveforms current plan is for cluster one to have four to eight stored waveforms as intended and that it may be too bulky or heavy to fit into the stringently weight and sizeconstrained fcs manned ground vehicles mgvs12 as well as the armys helicopter fleet some are concerned that to meet these physical requirements the army may significantly dumb down cluster one performance specifications13 according to the army however it continues to make progress in terms of reducing cluster ones weight and size and in increasing its transmission range however incorporating all of the desired waveforms into cluster one is proving to be 10 the wideband networking waveform is described as the core of the jtrs networking capability and is intended to operate across wide range of the radio frequency spectrum from 2 megahertz mhz to 2 gigahertz ghz and would provide increased routing and networking capability as much as hundred times more than existing communications systems 11 united states government accountability office gao report to the chairman committee on appropriations house of representatives

aircraft and deployed straight into combat with little or postflight reconfiguration they would be equipped with variety of passive and active protection systems and sensors that the army hopes will offer them the same survivability as the current heavy armor force 13 sandra i erwin military sets less ambitious goals for new tactical radio national defense national defense industrial association ndia washington dc august 2005 crs4 difficult14 cluster five radios were also reportedly experiencing similar size weight and power difficulties difficulties more pronounced as some cluster five versions are supposed to weigh more than one pound 15 current reports on cluster five progress appear to be more optimistic than cluster one general dynamics reports that they have been able to achieve systems compatibility between cluster five units and three other key fcs components the nonline of sight launch system the unattended ground sensor and the intelligent munitions system16 dod convened minidefense acquisition board17 dab for the cluster one program on october 11 2005 and according to one report plans to hold another review on november 21 200518 information concerning the october 11 review was not publically released and there is some renewed concern that the cluster one program is in trouble another report suggests that the airborne version of cluster one despite significant reengineering still exceeds weight limitations19 the issue appears to be that boeing has had difficulty reducing the radios weight below 66 kilograms with 52 kilograms being the maximum allowable weight for the airborne version of cluster one20 according to boeing officials it would be possible to achieve the 52 kilogram weight limit but it would require significant design changes to design that is already well established and not easily changed21 despite this difficulty certain aspects of the cluster one program have shown improvement according to boeing officials with the first version of the wideband networking waveform apparently operational on some versions of cluster one22 security security for jtrs has emerged as significant developmental difficulty according to one expert one of the programs biggest problems is security namely encryption as jtrs encryption is softwarebased and is therefore 14 meeting between crs and the army staffs g8 force development sections

absolute security or information assurance according to gao jtrs will be required to operate applications at multiple levels of security and in order to meet this requirement developers will have to not only account for traditional radio security measures but also computer and network security measures24 in addition national security agency nsa25 security concerns about jtrs interface with radio systems of us allies and the requirement for jtrs to be interoperable with dods global information grid gig are also expected to pose developmental challenges26 one such securityrelated challenge is that dods global information grid will also interface with the internet which brings with it whole additional set of security concerns for jtrs27 interoperability with legacy radio systems some have expressed concerns that the goal of making jtrs backward compatible with legacy radios may be technologically infeasible28 reportedly early program attempts at cross banding29 to synchronize incompatible legacy radio signals proved to be too complex and current army efforts are focusing on using the wideband networking waveform to link with legacy radio frequencies30 one report suggests that while the wideband networking waveform can receive signals from legacy radios legacy radios cannot receive signals from jtrs and to rectify this situation the army is looking at using 19 different waveforms to facilitate jtrs transmissions to legacy systems31 incorporating up to 19 different waveforms into jtrs radio has the potential to significantly increase memory and processing power requirements which in turn could drive up jtrs size weight and power requirements recently the joint staff asked the services to prioritize jtrs waveforms and the army reportedly identified four waveforms as initial priorities for fcs and other complementary programs32 23 buxbaum p 32 24 ibid 25 the national security agency is the us governments cryptologic organization it coordinates directs

cause letter to boeing the lead contractor for jtrs cluster one stating that it was considering cancelling the contract for the first phase of cluster one due to boeings anticipated failure to meet cost schedule and performance requirements shortly after this decision work on cluster five was also partially suspended due in part to developmental problems changing technical requirements and contract award protest and also because progress in cluster five was heavily leveraged against progress on cluster one33 as result of the work stoppage dod lifted its requirement for services to obtain dod waiver before purchasing nonjtrs radios and the services were authorized to purchase legacy radios such as the single channel ground and airborne radio system sincgars which has been in service since the 1980s34 jtrs alternatives some analysts suggest that there are alternatives to jtrs that are already commercially available companies such as harris corporation cluster one team member produces softwaredefined radio falcon ii anprc 117fc and thales cluster five team member and the lead contractor for socoms cluster two radio both produce softwaredefined radios that are already in use in the field35 it should be noted however that these softwaredefined radios currently in use only run subset of the current force waveforms and the wideband networking waveform and soldier radio waveform both fcs program requirements would not be available on these radios36 another possible solution could be to use existing softwaredefined radios and to acquire commercial wideband system such as wimax37 nonlineofsight commercial broadband networking technology that could be modified for military use38 experts suggest that system such as wimax could provide the military with more bandwidth and enhanced overthehorizon mobile communications39 the army asserts however that if system such as wimax was adopted for use that it would require nsa 33 united states government

would continue to assess the programs progress41 details were publically released as to why the army decided to keep boeing as the lead contractor but some suggest that it was not because boeing demonstrated progress in correcting noted design deficiencies but instead because boeing had strong legal case against the army if the army had decided to terminate its contract with boeing work on cluster five radios which unlike boeing was never formally suspended by dod has continued in areas that were not dependent on cluster one technologies and general dynamics has reportedly made progress

of the armys modular force brigade combat teams bcts47 gain knowledge to support further development of fcs capabilities provide information that could lead to program improvements and perhaps more rapid development and to show the progress and maturity of the fcs program and the fcs network in an operational environment48 given these objectives it is not unreasonable to assume that the early development models of jtrs cluster one will undergo considerable experimentation and testing if this is the case the experiments results could potentially have significant ramifications for the future of the cluster one program particularly if cluster ones performance fails to meet the armys expectations spin out one the armys fcs program consists of four spin outs formerly known as spirals that will introduce fcs technologies and systems to the current force these fielding spin outs are slated to occur in 2008 2010 2012 and 2014 to an experimental brigade and then two years later to the rest of the army the first spin out of fcs technology in 2008 is to emphasize improved munitions and sensors connected in an initial version of network capabilities49 these network capabilities are thought

that this restructuring might help to focus jtrs development efforts and provide definitive design guidance to jtrs developers critics say that this is just another in series of program restructurings the army added two years of additional effort and 458 million to cluster one in december 2004 to address developmental problems57 for program that started in 1999 and has long ways to go before it can be used in military operations58 program budget issues according to gao59 the cluster one program is expected to cost 156 billion to develop and acquire over 100000 cluster one radios and 85 billion to develop and acquire over 300000 cluster five radios and the army has reportedly requested 1567 million in fy2006 for jtrs60 cost growth for cluster one has been of significant concern as noted by gao since the program entered systems development in 2002 the contractor has overrun cost estimates by 93 million nearly 28 percent above what was planned although the program attempted to stabilize costs by adding approximately 200 million to the contract in january 2004 costs continued to grow steadily thereafter in addition the contractor has increasingly fallen behind schedule and has had to devote more resources than originally planned in january 2005 the prime contractor estimated that the total costs for the cluster one radio and waveform development would be 531 million more than what was originally budgeted reaching 898 million at completion however according to program officials since contract award the prime contractor has not demonstrated strong cost estimating and cost management techniques and it is difficult to estimate with any confidence what the overall program is likely to cost61 55 adam baddeley going forward with jtrs military information technology october

yettobedetermined program cuts would impact not only the cluster one and five programs but also how they would impact the overall fcs program following housesenate conference report the army would likely issue an assessment on how the cuts impact both the jtrs and fcs programs issues for congress the viability of the cluster one program while both clusters one and five have experienced number of developmental difficulties it appears that the cluster five program has divorced itself from cluster one through technological workarounds and has achieved degree of program success reportedly having achieved compatibility with number of fcs systems cluster one however seems to be progressing to lesser extent with its first test likely to be in experiment 11 later on in 2005 the performance of cluster one in this experiment might prove to 64 hrept 109119 to accompany hr 2863 department of defense appropriations bill 2006 june 10 2005 crs13 be useful metric to help decision makers determine if the cluster one program is viable one or if another course of action should be pursued although not believed to be included in experiment 11 the airborne version of cluster one might warrant further examination it appears that in order for the airborne version to meet the weight limit of 52 kilograms that significant capability trade offs may be required to this system that is already in the advanced phases of development likely resulting in additional delays and significantly increased costs given this situation congress might review the armys performance expectations for cluster one during experiment 11 testing will cluster ones performance impact on the armys decision to continue with what some call troubled program or will the army opt to stick with cluster ones developers matter what the outcome and attempt to rectify identified deficiencies through additional funds and further program delays another issue that might be considered for congressional review is the state of the airborne version of cluster one some suggest that the program has reached an impasse due to aircraft weight and size constraints and that the only way to meet these requirements is to redesign the system into significantly lesscapable version course of action that could further delay the program and carry with it significant cost implications security congress may decide to examine the issue of security in greater detail according to gao in addition to requirement to change jtrs hardware to accommodate processing and memory capacity upgrades for enhanced security the current design of jtrs has been judged by the national security agency as not sufficient to meet security requirements to operate in an open networked environment specifically particular versions of jtrs radios will be used by allied and coalition forces requiring the army to release specific source code of the software architecture to these forces to address the release the national security agency has required changes to the security architecture65 although gao expresses security concerns about jtrs use by allied and coalition forces it is not readily apparent how pervasive problem security is for jtrs and other components of the fcs network given the stated security challenges of softwaredefined radios it is conceivable that even if cluster one and five can meet the armys communications and data transmission requirements that security deficiencies might preclude the operational employment of clusters one and five it can be argued that network security would take on an even more significant role in fcs than compared to the armys current force fcs manned ground vehicles lighter and less heavily armored than the m1 abrams and m2 bradleys that they are intended to replace would rely extensively on situational awareness provided through the fcs network for their survivability furthermore this network provided situational awareness would have significant impact on fcss ability to engage enemy forces beyond lineofsight given this significant reliance on the fcs 65 united states government accountability office gao report to the chairman committee on appropriations house of

survivability and for target acquisition and engagement potential adversaries might seek to identify and exploit security weaknesses in the fcs network including jtrs as means to attack fcs units one potential adversary china has likely established information warfare units to deploy viruses to attack enemy computer systems and networks and chinas recent exercises have incorporated offensive computer operations primarily as first strike against enemy networks66 potential scenario for consideration is that if an adversary obtained fcsrelated source code they could engineer virus that could be introduced into the fcs network and computers while some may consider this an improbable scenario the reported recent discovery by russian security experts of the first known computer virus spread by cell phone networks suggests otherwise67 the army is not unaware of these security challenges and notes that network security and information assurance are an ever growing priority regardless of fcs development68 as part of this recognition the army fcs program conducts bi monthly information assurance architecture development reviews with the army staff sections responsible for intelligence g2 and information and communications g 6 and the national security agency and office of the secretary of defense69 jtrs alternatives with its history of developmental difficulties program delays and additional costs some suggest that the jtrs cluster one program might be candidate for cancellation in this view congress might opt to explore alternatives to cluster one with the army and dod possible starting point for such review might be an examination of softwaredefined radios already in service within the us military or commercially available through other manufacturers some critics argue that the military should adopt commercially available and emerging telecommunications technology one example of such technology is third generation cellular technologies that encompass streaming
