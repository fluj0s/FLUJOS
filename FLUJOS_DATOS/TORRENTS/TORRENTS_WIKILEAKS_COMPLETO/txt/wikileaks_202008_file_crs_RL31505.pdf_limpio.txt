pproaches for ewaste summary rapid growth in the use of computer s and the incorporation of electronic features in wide array of consumer pr oducts have been among the most important driving forces of the nations economy in recent years but they also pose potential environmental problems in addition to producing better produc ts the improvements in technology have created growing volumes of obsolete products to be managed as waste according to the national safe ty council which undertook the first major effort to gather quantitative informati on on ewaste 500 million personal computers will become obsolete in the united states between 1997 and 2007 at an average weight of 60 pounds obsolete pcs weighing 15 million tons will become waste needing management in that period epa using broader definition estimates that 28 million tons of consumer electronics were generated as waste in 2003 management of these products as waste is of concern in part because of their volume but more importantly because th ey contain large amounts of heavy metals and other toxic substances computer monitor or television set for example generally contains 48 pounds of lead mercury cadmium and other heavy metals are also commonly used in such equipment in an incinerator or landfill these metals can be released to the environment cont aminating air ash and ground water as result many argue that electronic equipm ent should be managed separately from the municipal waste stream and recycled whenever possible the united states has done little to addr ess this problem unless disposed in large quantities used computers and othe r electronic products are allowed to be managed as municipal solid waste ie the same as ordinary hous ehold trash in most states in some locations used comput ers have been collected for recycling on special voluntary collection days but few ju risdictions offer frequent comprehensive recycling opportunities for electronic waste the exceptions are thr ee states in which disposal of cathode ray tube s ie television sets and computer monitors has been banned essentially re quiring their separate collection for recycling collection for recycling does not guarantee environmen tally responsible ma nagement however reports suggest that large volumes of ectronic waste separated for recycling have been shipped to china and other devel oping countries where primitive recycling methods threaten human health and the environment numerous interested par ties including environmental groups solid waste management officials electronics manufactur ers and retailers ve begun to develop alternative approaches on voluntary ba sis in japan the european union california maine and mary land regulations are being imp lemented that will force manufacturers and importers to take back end of life produc ts for recycling and waste management separate from the municipal waste stream or provide funds to cover the cost of recycling programs this report provides

ewaste the nature of the problem rapid improvements in technology nd software have made the use of computers and other electroni c products nearly ubiquitous in the united states and other developed countries but disposal of these products when they become waste at the end of their useful lives poses potential environmental problems the improvements in technology nd software have stimulated new applications simplified computer use nd lowered cost bringing computers within reach of more and more consumers in addition electronic controls have been incorporated in growing list of pr oducts from autos to audio equipment to microwave ovens on balan ce particularly in the 1990s the effect of these developments has been to stimulate pr oductivity and contribute to what was the nations longest sustained period of economic growth as computers and electronic equipment have improved however there has been more rapid turnover of such equipment with growing volumes of obsolete products to be managed as waste the nationa l safety council which undertook the first major effort to gather quantitative in formation on electronic product recycling estimated the average lifespan of pers onal computers to be 32 year s in 1998 declining to 20 years in 2005 the council projected that 4998 million pcs will become obsolete in the period 199720071 at an average weight of 60 pounds obsolete pcs weighing 15 million tons will be added to the supply of waste needing to be managed the environmental protection agency epa using broader definition of selected consumer electronics estimates that 279 million tons of such waste was generated in 2003 32 increase since 20002 not all of the obsolete products will actually be disposed however in fact the amount disposed may be substantially sm aller

feature of the replacement mode l additional speed or memory for example or in some cases the failure of single component of larger system obsolete computers that are still in working order are often consigned to spare offices or basements where they may occasionally be used but more likely will sit unused for months or years computers needing repair of component may suffer similar fate often piled in storage rooms or basements until the owner decides what to do with them in part this storage is motivat ed by lack of information on how endof life computers should be disposed uncerta in what to do the owners let them sit waste analysts refer to this method of managing used computers as hoarding there is little hard information regarding the number of computers being hoarded but it is widely assumed that hoarding is common practice pcs are only one part of the electronics waste stream mainframe computers printers and other periphera l equipment laptops video gaming systems televisions vcrs and telecommunications equipment are also changing and being replaced at rapid rate this equipment and the rechargeable batteries that power increasing numbers of computers telephones nd other portable devices pose challenges to the waste management system at the end of their useful life many of these devices are disposed in municipal waste systems poorly designed to handle them electronic equipment can be bulky and not easily compact ed it is largely composed of glass and metals materials that dont burn or decompose and that in some cases are hazardous computer monitor or televisi on set with cathode ray tube crt for example generally contains 48 pounds of lead mercury cadmium and other heavy metals are also commonly used in such equipment in an incinerator or landfill these metals can be released to the environmen t contaminating air ash and ground water the presence of such materials suggests to many that electronic equipment should be managed separately from the municipal waste stream and recycled whenever possible regulatory structure for ewaste the united states has done little to address this problem under epa regulations much of the waste could qua lify as hazardous when disposed in sufficient quantities it would be subject to regulations requiring generators and transporters to ship wastes to per mitted hazardous waste management facilities these facilities must comply with stringent standards governing treatment storage and disposal of the waste3 but federal law exempts households nd other smallquantitygenerators from hazardous waste management requirements generato rs of up to 220 pounds per month of electronic waste may dispose of it with ordinary trash or at municipal waste management facilities in most states without any special requirements larger generators often escape regulation too by donating used equipment to educational or charitable groups for reuse such dona tions are not considered disposal from regulatory perspective httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31505crs3 4 in an earlier version of this report minneso ta was reported to have banned disposal also the minnesota ban scheduled to go into effect july 1 2005 was postponed until july 1 2006 apparently out of concern that sufficient recycling alternatives were not in place 5 more complete description of california s new ewaste law sb 20 is provided below in the

electronic goods are ready for disposal recyc ling can keep them out of the waste management regulatory scheme often the equipment is shipped outside the united states where us regulatory authorities may have little information concerning the environmental performance of the recycling facility under the federal waste management laws states remain free to establish more stringent requirements at least three stat california maine and massachusetts have done so banning disposal of cathode ray tubes ie most television sets and computer monitors in municipal landfills and incinerators4 california and maine have established recyclin g requirements for tvs and computer monitors and in californias case for cell phone s california will also ban the use of certain heavy metals in video devi ces after january 1 20075 disposal of othe r electronic waste is not regulated in any state however even the materials collect ed for recycling about 14 of total discards according to the national safety council6 or 104 according to epa7 pose environmental and regulatory questions according to one report currently the cheapest ewaste recycling option in the us is to send ewaste overseas how it is used or disposed of there is largely unknown8 although there is little current regulati on governing disposal of ewaste growing movement among environmental gr oups regulatory officials manufacturers and retailers both in the unite d states and abroad has be gun to develop alternative approaches this report di scusses some of the initiatives undertaken by these groups and identifies approaches that congress might consider if it were to address this issue voluntary initiatives local waste management officials manufacturers and retailers in the united states have developed number of voluntar programs to collect electronic products for reuse or recycling these initiatives are motivated by mix of reasons including the desire to protect the environment from the effects of disposal an interest in demonstrating the feasibility of separate collection and recycling sense that it is good business and good public relations to do so the wish to provide stimulus for companies pioneering demanufacturing and recycling technologies and in responsehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31505crs4 9 for comprehensive statebystate information on these programs and on national reuse and recycling opportunities see the website of the electronic industries alliance at httpwwweiaeorg 10 ibid click on view national programsto the increasing discussion of regulatory approaches under development in europe and japan state and local government collection efforts over the past several years many local governments have unde rtaken recycling collection events for computer equipment according to the ectronic industr ies alliance there were 990 local collection programs for ewaste mostly computers and monitors in the united states as of july 20059 while the number is substantial these programs are not evenly distributed across the country near ly half the programs are found in two states massachusetts 266 pr ograms and california 214 eight states have collection programs at all many of the programs follow the model of household hazardous waste collection since the early 1980s hundreds of local governments have organized occasional collection of hazar dous waste paints used oil batteries pesticides etc generally by establishing oneday event or series of such events at central locations these events are geared towa rd households rather than businesses allowing citizens of the jurisdiction to bring such wastes to collection point where the wastes are separated by type for recy cling or hazardous waste disposal the objective is to keep hazardous wastes out of the ordinary muni cipal waste stream protecting sanitation workers and the environment in the past several years number of jurisdictions have added computer equipment to the list of items that they will accept at such events other jurisdicti ons have staged similar events focused on computers alone the respons has indicated that many consumers will participate in separate coll ection programs manufacturers take back programs number of computer manufacturers including dell hewlettpack ard and ibm have also begun programs in which they take back old equipment for recycling some charge fee others provide free recycling to purchasers of ne w products or coupons that can be used on equipment purchases most require th consumer to box and mail the used equipment to company location list of these programs is also available at the electronic industries alliance website10 retailer programs retailers have also become interested in promoting recycling of electronic equipm ent although thus far their

rough reverse distribution staples transported the materials from multiple collection points to its distribution centers and on to recycler12 data concerning the results of vo luntary programs whether run by municipalities manufacturers or retailers indicate that there is substantial interest in electronics recycling in addition th programs have demonstrated number of models for how larger possibly mandatory programs might be organized overall however the availability and use of such programs has only scratched the surface of what is available to be recycled with little impact on overall recycling rates state regulations several states have enacted laws or adopted regulations to address some of the issues posed by growing ewaste volumes in general the state approaches have fallen into seven categories 1 the creati on of task forces to study the issue or develop state program 2 bans on the disposal of crts in landfills and incinerators 3 funding for recycling co llection and infrastru cture 4 consumer education campaigns 5 advanced recycling f ees imposed at point of sale to finance recycling programs 6 manufacturer take back requirements and 7 phaseout of hazardous materials13 while more than dozen states have taken some legislative or regulatory action three of them ma ssachusetts californi and maine have developed the most ex tensive requirements massachusetts massachusetts banned the di sposal of cathode ray tubes crts in landfills and incinerators as of april 1 2000 and established grant program that helped develop an infrast ructure for recycling them

nonprofits s uch as the salvation army and goodwill industries forprofit companies and municipalities established an infrastructure to collect repair reuse and recycle crts as massac husetts implemented its ban on disposal the state encouraged the development of the collection and recycling infrastructure through grants measured by the number of collection programs this effort appears to have been wildly successful of the nationwide total of 330 electronics collection programs identified by the electronic industries alliance in early 2002 255 77 were in massachusetts in july 2005 ma

dep offici are still useable or repairable and can be resold in other cases the face plate of the picture tube is removed from the crt for reuse in still others the crt is crushed and the glass is sent to smelter for recycling one problem massachusetts had in imp lementing its program was obtaining approval from epa under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra epa is given authority to re gulate hazardous waste but may authorize states to run the program if the state can demonstrate that its regulations are equivalent to and consistent with epas as discussed ear lier crts are considered hazardous waste under epa regulations because of the high amount of lead they contain massachusetts wanted to exempt crts from hazardous waste management regulations in order to avoi d regulatory requirements that would increase the cost of its program to entities handling the crts after prolonged negotiations with epa massachusetts rewrote its hazardous waste regulations to provide conditional exemption from the hazardous waste prog ram provided that the crts are managed according to specific regulations that among other things prohibit disposal epa granted the state only an interim threey ear authorization to run the crt program but the state received an additional three years from epa in october 2002 in part because of the experience with massachusetts and in part because of desire to stimulate recyc ling throughout the united states epa later proposed set of special exemptions from the hazardous wa ste rules for computer recycling the proposed changes were published in the federal register on june 12 2002 but have not been finalized14 california in california the disposal of waste crts in municipal landfills has always been prohibited according to peggy

including crts to household hazardous waste collection facility for disposal16 in september 2003 california became the fi rst state to pass legislation designed to provide free and convenient recycling of crts phase out the use of hazardous materials and restrict exports of ewast to developing countries as subsequently amended the legislation sb 20sb 50 imposes fees of 6 to 10 per unit depending on screen size on the sale of computer monitors televisions and other video devices containing to xic materials beginning january 1 2005 the fees are to be used to reimburse recyclers for

implementation of european union regulations occurs later sb 20 will prohibit the sale of video devices to the extent that the european union prohibits their sale due to the presence of heavy metals the law also prohibits the export of covered ewaste to foreign destinations unless the exporter notifie s the california depa rtment of toxic substances control at least 60 days prior to export demonstrates that the import of the waste is not prohibited by the receivi ng country forwards required import and operating licenses to the department and demonstrates that the exported waste will be managed within the count ry of destination only at facilities whose operations meet or exceed the binding decisions and implementing guidelines of the organization for economic cooperation and development california has also enacted legislati on to require retaile rs of cell phones to collect used products for reuse recycling or proper disposal beginning july 1 2006 under the legislation the cell phone recycling act of 2004 retailers must take back at cost to consumers cell phones that they previously sold retailers must also accept at charge used cell phone from consumer who is purchasing new cell phone regardless of whether the used phone was purchased from that retailer maine maines law enacted in april 2004 is different from californias in that it makes manufacturers of televisi ons and computer monitors individually responsible for recycling their products the law envisions but does not mandate municipal collection of televisions and m onitors the collected items are to be delivered to consolidation facilities for counting and for transport to certified recycling and dismantling facilities the state is to provide guidelines for environmentally sound management manufacturers will play key roles in ma ines system effective january 1 2006 they will be responsible for paying the costs of the handling transportation and recycling of their own products plus pro ra ta share of the costs for orphan waste they must also ensure that consolidation facilities are geographically located to conveniently serve all areas of the state like the california law maines is

governments websitescreens but as in california excludes vi deo displays contained in motor vehicles industrial commercial or medical equipm ent and household appliances maine also requires that vendors of covere d devices sold to the stat provide takeback services for their products at the end of their useful life maryland maryland has also enacted computer recycling legislation in may 2005 while it has received considerable attention in the press the law is substantially less stringent than those in ca lifornia and maine it would require that manufacturers of more than 1000 computers pe r year register with the state paying fee of 5000 beginning january 1 2006 these manufacturers must either implement computer takeback program or pay an annual fee of 5000 to the state recycling trust fund the term computer ta keback program is not defined in the law but the requirements of such program may be specified in regulations it could include the type of program currently be ing run by dell ibm hp and others in which consumers mail computers to the manufacturer for recycling more importantly however it would appear th at manufacturers who wish to avoid operating such program need only pay an annual fee of 500017 international regulatory developments computers and consumer electronics have long been among the most international of indus tries japanese ko rean taiwanese european and american companies sell products worldwide with production fac ilities and component manufacturing plants in many different c ountries as result developments in europe and the pacific rim where numerous countries ar developing legislation and regulations that would reduce the volum of electronic waste shift the burden for its management from the public sector to industry and reduce the toxicity of materials used in production are being closely watched by executives in this country this section disc usses developments in seve ral major countries including switzerland the netherlands ja pan and the european union switzerland switzerland was the first country to enact broad legislation on january 14 1998 the swiss enacted an or dinance on separate collection and recycling of electronic waste18 the ordinance which went into effect on july 1 1998 requires separate collec tion and recycling of ectronic waste including electronic equipment used at home as well as office equipment computer equipment communications equipment and household ppliances according to the ordinance consumers are required to ta ke used equipment back to manufacturer an importer or retailer retailers are required to take back old equipment if they offer the same sort of product for sale wholesalers and intermediaries likewise have an obligationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31505crs9 19 fact

equipment to be delivered directly to wastehandling facility manufacturers and importers are only required to take back equipment of their own brand or in the case of importers of brands that they import this reinforces one of the ordinances primary objectives which is to serve as an incentive to manufacturers to consider th question of waste manageme nt during the design of product manufacturers who produce equipm ent that is easily disassembled and made of materials easily recycled and causing little pollution can thus reduce their costs visavis their competitors the ordinance leaves most details of th recycling and management of returned items to industry or to statelevel can ton governments regulations on the recycling and management of the returned items and permitting or authorizing the necessary facilities for example are left to the cantons the ordinance contains requirements on financing determining how to finance and structure the return system is left to industry and the market s to decide the sw iss federal government does have one other role howev er the regulation of exports in order to insure that disposal in other countries is in accord with those countries regulations and is respectful of the environment in many respects such as the required takeback provisions and the flexibility given industry to devise its own collecti on and recycling scheme s the swiss system is similar to regulations established elsewhere in europe to encourage recovery and recycling of packaging waste these regulatory systems have the same general objective by imposing responsibility fo r waste management on producers and importers they aim to affect manufacturer decisions regarding product or packaging design reuse and recyclability netherlands shortly after the swiss enacted their ordinance the dutch government issued decree on the removal of electric and electronic appliances also referred to as the disposal of white and brown goods decree april 21 199819 the decree requires retailers manufact urers and importers of electric and electronic appliances to finance the collection and to take back endoflife equipment including computers from consumers it prohibits incineration and landfilling of the products the decree applied to large appliances televisions video and sound equipment computers printers and lecommunications equipment as well as refrigerators freezers washers dryers and stoves as of january 1 1999 smaller appliances were covered as of january 1 2000 the d ecree requires retailers to accept used appliances in trade and requires local authorities to provide separate collection of such appliances from households as well as place to which retailers may take equipment traded in manufacturers and impor ters must take back products of their brand from retailers and local authorities and must reimburse retailers repair companies and local authorities for th cost of collecting their

after two years of operation according to dutch source it has recycling rates higher than anticipated and costs lower than anticipated20 the system captured 76 of endof life televisions in its first

products are sorted and processed by an industryfunded recycling organization known by its dutch initials nvmp rather than being taken back by individual ma nufacturers and importe rs nvmp is funded by fixed recycling fees imposed on the sale of new products these range as high as 15 for refrigerators freezers and air conditioners sma ll items like radios and cd players initially had fees of 200 but as of july 2001 are not subject to fees dutch computers are collected through separate system not through nvmp there are recycling fees paid directly by consumers in this system rather producers and importers are paying the cost s of computer recycling in proportion to each companys share of the products return ed about 25 of the products returned are orphans ie the manufacturer is l onger doing business in the netherlands the cost for managing these products is split among companies still in business according to each companys share of the recycled products one potential inequity of this system is that it places heavier burden on companies that had large market share in the past irrespective of their current sales new entrants to the market by contrast do not pay for the ma nagement of historic or orphan waste even if they have significant share of current sales22 another criticism of the dutch system is that as currently structured it provides little incentive for companies to design thei r products for recycling since all products of given type are charged the same recycling fee japan in japan law for recycling specified kinds of home appliance also referred

household waste from products put on the mark et before the directives entry into force historical waste is to be shared by all existing producers based on their market share producers will be able to recoup this cost through visible fee on new products for 8 10 years users other th an private households may be made partly or totally responsible for financing the cost s of management of their historic waste the directive provides for labeling and consumer information and for submission of annual reports on quantities placed on the market as well as collection and recycling the eu also has addressed the issue of hazardous substances in electronic waste in annex ii of the weee draft th directive requires that certain hazardous substances including pcbs mercury batteries printed ci rcuit boards toner cartridges plastic containing brominated flame retardants asbestos crts cfcs liquid crystal displays and components containing radioactive substances be removed from waste electrical and electronic equipment and treated separately there is also separate directive on the regulation of hazardous substances rohs25 under which the eu will require th at 6 hazardous substances lead mercury cadmium hexavalent chromium polybrominated biphenyls pbbs and polybrominated diphenyl ether pbde be replaced by other substances in electrical and electronic equipment by july 1 2006 the directive provides list of exemptions however including use of lead in the glass of cathode ray tubes and in solder mercury in fluorescent lighting and lead as radiation protection in addition the prohibited substances may continue to be used in spare parts for equipment that was placed on the market before july 1 2006 as noted previously the eu directives are broad in scope setting aggressive collection reuse and recycling targets for dozens of products and industries but the basic principles producer responsibility fo r takeback and for financing collection and recovery systems fees on new products to cover the co st of managing historical waste recycling targets and controls on hazardous substances appear common to many european and japane recycling programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31505crs13 26 as of july 2005 several b ills have been intr oduced on the subject and the first congressional hearing has been scheduled by house energy and commerce subcommittee for july 20 in addition the senate version of comprehensive energy legislation hr 6 in section 1545 would provide tax credit for the purchase or lease of equipment that is used for sorting or processing certain co mmercial or residential qualified recyclable materials electronic waste in cluding any crt flat panel sc reen or video display device with screen size greater than 4 inches meas ured diagonally or cpu is included in the definition of qualified recyclable materials 27 for example the 2001 epa study estimated th life of pcs at three to six years and pc continuedlegislative approaches with any environmental issue growing interest among indi viduals and interest groups in what appears to be national or international problem frequent attention to the issue in the press and considera tion of diverse array of legislative and regulatory options among the states are often precursors of c ongressional interest thus although there has been little activity in congress to date26 many assume congress is likely to take up this issue given the increasing interest by other stakeholders when congress decides to address the subject there are at least nine options that might arise during discussions 1 report to congress on ewaste issues 2 grants or tax credits for the development of recycling infrastructure 3 legislation establishing exemptions from the hazardous waste program to f acilitate recycling of computers or other ewaste 4 labe ling to encourage recycling or provide environmental information to consumers 5 bans on disposal andor export of waste 6 regulation of the use of hazar dous substances in computer equipment 7 requiring reuse or recycled content in computer manufacture 8 an extended producer responsibility system requiring ma nufacturers and importers to take back computers for recycling either as indi vidual companies responsible for their own brands or collectively through an indus try consortium and 9 feebased system for the management of historic waste an additional question that presents itself is what to include in the definition of computers or electronic wast that might be the subject of legislation this question is addressed in separate section at the conclusion of this report 1 report to congress at present there is dearth of information on the us electronics wast stream such basic facts as current and projected amounts of electronic waste the amounts and types of heavy metals and other toxic substances contained in such products how such waste is managed and the impact of its disposal on the environment are all ssentially unknown many including the authors of this report have relied on baseline study published by the national safety council in 1999 data that ar now seven years old epa produced estimates of consumer electronic waste broader category encompassing audio video and information products in its 2001 and 2003 municipal solid waste facts and figures reports its estimates were substantially different from those of the safety council27 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31505crs14 27 continued monitors at six to seven years about double the estimates of the safety council as result of longer estimated life information produc t computer phone and fax waste generation was estimated at 1076300 tons in 2001 substantially less than the safety council estimate an additional 806 200 tons of video products including tvs were generated according to epa see us epa office of solid waste and emergency response municipal solid waste in the united states 2001 facts and figures appendix c available at httpwwwepagovepaoswernonhwmuncplpubsmsw2001pdf epa produced estimates of selected consumer electroni cs waste for 2002 and 2003 in its 2003 report but did not provide the detailed information that it had in 2001few states regulate such waste separately from the municipal waste stream which means that it can be disposed in municipal landfills or incinerators under epas hazardous waste regulations dis posal of more than 100 kilograms 220 pounds of such waste per month is likely to qualify as hazardous waste disposal subject to strict regulatory requirements it is not clear how stringently this requirement is enforced report to congress defining ewast providing basic information on the quantities and types of such waste describing how it is currently managed and outlining options for management of electr onic products at the end of their useful lives could be useful starting point t or around the time of the house hearing on ewaste scheduled for july 20 2005 the u s commerce departments technology administration is expected to release report to the administration and congress outlining national roadmap for addressing ewaste the report may provide some of the basic information that has been lacking 2 grants or tax credits for recycling infrastructure if one wanted to establish universal requirements for r ecycling electronic waste implementation of such requirements would likely be thwarted initially by the absence of national infrastructure to collect and manage the pr oducts being returned ewaste recycling is in its infancy most local governme nts have separate collection program for computers or other electroni c products and few facilities ar equipped to process the materials that are collected much of th processingrecycling that is done occurs overseas thus the development of recycling infrastructure through grant or loan program or through tax cred its may merit consideration model for this effort could be the program in massachuse tts as noted earlier massachusetts implemented ban on the disposal of com puter monitors and televisions containing cathode ray tubes crts in april 2000 prior to implementation of the ban the university of massachusetts variety of nonprofits such as the salvation army and goodwill industries forprofit companie s and municipalities established an infrastructure to collect repair reuse and recycle crts the state encouraged the development of the collecti on and recycling infrastructure through municipal grant program the program was not large according to the massachusetts department of environmental protection dep th state spent 800000 combined in fy1999 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31505crs15 28 personal communications peggy harlowe massachusetts dep june 12 and october 17 2002 29 rcra refers to the title of comprehensive set of amendments to the solid waste disposal act these amendments the res ource conservation and recovery act pl 94 580 were enacted in 1976 the statute has since been amended seven more times however including comprehensive amendments in 1984 fy200228 the grants covered the cost of processing collected materials for each of the states 351 cities and towns for the firs t year in which they collected ewaste during that year the local governments developed programs fo r collection and were able to determine the amounts they would need to budget to continue the programs in succeeding years extrapolating th amounts on the basis of population comparable program for all 50 states might cost about 10 million annually another means of stimulating the development of ewaste recycling infrastructure might be the provision of tax credits for recycling equipment as noted earlier section 1545 of the nate version of the compre hensive energy bill hr 6 passed june 28 2005 would provide tax credit for the purchase or lease of equipment that is used for sorting or proce ssing electronic waste ewaste is defined to include any crt flat panel screen or video display device with screen size greater than 4 inches measured diagonally or cpu 3 exemptions from rcra third approach used by congress and epa to encourage recycling of batteries in 1996 would be to amend the solid waste disposal act generally referred to as rcra29 to exempt ewaste from portions of the hazardous waste management rules provided that the material is reused or recycled one model for this is epas unive rsal waste rule which exempts waste batteries pesticides and thermostats from portions of the hazardous waste management regulations in order to encourage their recycling when waste is listed as universal waste handler s can accumulate greater quantity of the waste and hold it for longer time without requiring zardous waste storage permit universal wastes are also exempt from the requirement that transporters carry manifest with detailed information when handling hazardous waste thus permitting transport by common carriers in many cases adding co mputers andor other electronics to the universal waste stream would provide clarification as to what type of waste these items are considered to be one drawback of the universal waste approach is that states are not required to adopt the universal waste designations under the hazardous waste program states are allowed to have regulations that are more stringent than the federal requirements if not all states adopt the designation of ewaste as universal wa ste transporting end oflife computers and other waste electroni c products through states with differing regulations may become burdensome for handler s to address this issue as regards rechargeable batteries congress enacted the mercury containing and rechargeable battery management act in 1996 pl 104142 this act established the universal waste rule for rechargeable batteries as w in all 50 states and preempted state and local laws that conflicted with or were more stringent than its requirementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31505crs16 30 proposed rule to streamline requirements for handling crts signed by whitman daily environment report may 28 2002 p a10 31 basel action network and silicon valley toxics coalition exporting harm february 25 2002 p 2without new legislation epa has move d slowly on proposals to exempt crts from hazardous waste requirements on june 12 2002 the agency proposed rule that would exempt cathode ray tubes an d glass removed from them from being considered solid or hazardous waste when nt for recycling while the intention of this exemption was to streamline the reus and recycling pro cess for crts critics fear that less than ethical business owners will collect the computers for fees store them in large warehouses and disappear30 as of early july 2005 three years after proposal the agency had not yet finalized these regulations 4 labeling fourth option would be to require labeling of computers to encourage recycling or to provide envir onmental information to consumers the content of such labels w ould be determined by th other components of the legislation for example the european ion intends to require labels that will identify electronic equipment subject to its requirements that manufacturers and importers take equipment back for reuse or recycling similarly maine will require labeling to facilitate the id entification of the party responsible for the cost of collection transportation and r ecycling of computer monito rs other types of labels might identify the percentage of recycled materials used in the product indicate compliance with prohibitions on the use of hazardous substances identify materials used in order to facilitate their recycling or communicate to consumers if disposal of certain components is to be prohibited 5 bans on disposal andor export of ewaste as noted earlier because of the increasing volume of crts and the toxicity of some crt components california mass achusetts and maine have pr ohibited disposal of these products in landfills and in cinerators although we have little information concerning the overall effectiveness of these disposal bans the prohibitions combined with other policies have apparently served as stimulus to the development of recycling and reuse options in these states similarly federal prohibition might serve as stimulus at the national level provided it gave the waste management and recycling industries sufficient time to develop alternatives to disposal an important issue related to this opti on would be whether to regulate exports of crts and other ewaste as well as prohibiting their disposal in the united states exporting harm 2002 report by the basel acti on network and th silicon valley toxics coalition concluded that such expor ts often identified as being for the purpose of recycling have served as means of escaping from us regulation and in many cases pose serious health and environmental threats in the receiving countries accordin g to the report informed recycling industry sources estimate that between 50 to 80 percent of the wastes collected for recycling are not recycled domestically at all but very quickly pl aced on container ships bound for destinations like china31 thus restrictions on disposal without accompanying controls onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31505crs17 32 the international association of electroni cs recyclers began certification program early in 2002 for informa tion see http wwwiaerorg 33 article 2 paragraph 3 of the rohs direc tive available at http registerconsiliumeu intpdfen02st03st03662re02en02pdfexports might simply transfer greater share of the problems associated with management of the waste overseas on the other hand prohibition on the export of materials collected for recycling would cut recyclers off from many of the markets able to reuse the materials significant portion of th manufacture and assembly of crts and computers occurs in asian countries if r ecovered materials cannot be shipped there recycling and reuse will be difficult to achieve possible solution might involve regulati on rather than prohibition of exports with specific recordkeeping and reporting requirements and sh ipment allowed only to facilities that have been certified to meet high standards for recycling worker protection and waste manageme nt this option might require further development to identify the exact nature of feasible controls or prohibitions and to identify certifying authority before legislati on along these lines could be drafted32 as noted above california adopted regu latory approach to ewaste exports in sb 20 which was enacted in september 2003 6 regulating the use of haza rdous substances in computers sixth option is suggested by the european union eu directive on the regulation of hazardous substances rohs this directive will w ith some important exceptions ban lead mercury cadmiu m hexavalent chromium polybrominated biphenyls pbb and polybrominated diphenyl ether pbde from electrical and electronic equipment put on the market af ter specific date number of items including lead in crt glass will be exempt from the ban b ecause of the lack of substitutes such ban it is argued will limit hazardous substan ces in electronics and therefore reduce the hazards of exposure to employees recyclers and waste managers risks of exposure to users are thought to be negligible cons ultation with industry and recyclers would be helpful to deter mine what nonhazardous substitutes exist for the substances to be regulated and whether the benefits of such substitution outweigh the costs one possible problem with this approach is that banning hazardous substances could depress the market for reuse if hazardous materials ar banned then spare parts from older computers would longer be able to be reused to make new computers the european union directiv gets around this problem by exempting reused equipment and spare parts from the ban33 7 recycled content seventh option would be to stimulate the markets for reuse and recycling of computer compone nts by requiring recycled content in new computer equipment most recycling nd waste management experts would agree that collecting material for recycling is an incomplete exercise unless markets forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31505crs18 34 handy and harmon electronic ma terials corp as cited in exporting harm p 44reuse of the material are assured but ma ndating the reuse of such material poses number of logistical problems computer components are manufactured in numerous locations and often assembled in locations far from the places of manufacture the parts are made of at least 36 different materials according to one recent analysis34 many of them combined in ways that may be difficult to separate for recycling orreuse on the other hand according to the same analysis six components silica much of it used in glass plastics ir on aluminum copper and lead account for 958 of the weight of typical desktop computer many of the parts containing these materials can be recycled the key might be to set recycled content or reuse requirements for some or all of the specifi c computer components such as the crt plastic casing or specific metals 8 extended producer responsibility under extended producer responsibility epr which is at the hear t of the asian and european proposals for regulation of ewaste manuf acturers and importers of electronic products would be held responsible for the mana gement of those products at the end of their useful life epr can be imposed on producers individually or collectively in the individual approach producer or importer would be responsible for the takeback and management of its own produc ts by placing responsibility on individual companies this approach creates incentives to design and manufacture the products in ways that simplify recycling and reuse and by llowing reuse of component parts this approach could provide potentially larg cost savings in the manufacture or remanufacture of products while it has potential advantages indi vidual producer responsibility also has potential drawbacks the collection and sorting of ewaste in such system could be costly and cumbersome given that each manufacturers products would need to be collected or sorted separately one way to implement such program would be by requiring retailers to accept returns of the brands of equipment that they offer for sale and then simply to reverse the di stribution process to get the products from retailers to manufacturers retailers might oppose ch requirement however because of the burden involved in storing the used equipment in addition many computers are sold directly by manufacturer s or distributors to consumers without the use of retail locations an alternative to individual epr is the use of collective responsibility system under collective producer responsibility ma nufacturers and importers create third party organization which ssumes responsibility for collection recycling and disposal of all the regu lated products the third party organization would be financed by producers and importers in pr oportion to the market share of each or in proportion to the cost of recycling the produc ts each contributes to the total collected while foreign governments ve taken the leadership role in developing epr legislation legislation has b een introduced in number of states that would establishhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31505crs19 35 ncels website is at httpwwwncelne tbasecgimtemplatebulletins_archive click on april 20 2004 bulletin

version of epr legislation other states with epr bills introduced include massachusetts minnesota and vermont summaries of state legislation on ewaste can be found on the website of th national caucus of environmental legislators35 9 management of historic waste electronic products that were sold prior to the date of enactment of any new regulatory scheme could contribute substantial am ount of waste accord ing to the national safety council study 303 million personal computers are likely to become obsolete in the united states between 2002 and 200636 while some of these will be disposed or recycled large number will simply be placed in longterm storage in basements or storerooms until the owners decide what to do with them millions of old television sets have accumulated in the hands of consumers for similar reasons these historic products may have been manufactured by companies longer in business or where the company is still in business the amount of waste attributable to its brand may bear little correlation to the companys current market share37 thus many argue that separate collection and recycling scheme needs to be adopted for historic waste under sb 20 the california legislati on enacted in september 2003 fee of 6 10 is imposed on the sale of all crt devices televisions video and computer monitors and other devices and on other video display devices that the states department of toxic substances control termines contain toxic materials the fees are to be used to reimburse recyclers for the cost of collecting and recycling the covered devices38 under the maine ewaste law the cost of managing historic waste will be borne by the producer with th cost of orphan waste to be shared by all current producers defining ewaste what types of electronic products to incl ude in any legislative consideration of ewaste is key issue there is wide range of options the most restrictive option would include only products containing cathode ray tubes crts crts are thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31505crs20 picture tubes used in most computer mon itors and television sets they are easily identified they contain substantial amount s of lead and some other heavy metals that are considered hazardous when dispos ed in regulated quantities they comprise significant portion of the electronic waste stream accounting for as much as half of the weight of standard personal com puter and as noted earlier their disposal is already banned in four states they also are costly to collect and recycle most voluntary programs charge fee of 5 15 to accept television or monitor for recycling given this cost it is unlikely that voluntary programs will ever handle significant portion of the crt waste stream somewhat broader option would be to include flat panel displays and televisions as well as crts in additi on one might include the other components of personal computer such as the cpu the central processing unit that contains systems memory hard drive disk drives cd unit etc keyboards printers speakers scanners modems and any other peripheral equipment sold for use with computer at the other end of the spectrum the eu and other countries are taking far broader approach the weee directive cont ains 10 categories of equipment covered by its proposed requirements large household appliances small household appliances it and telecommunications equipment consumer equipment lighting equipment electrical and electronic tools with the exception of largescale stationary industrial tools toys leis ure and sports equipment medical devices with the exception of all implanted and infected products monitoring and control instruments and automatic dispensers th directive includes fiveandahalf page list of specific items that fall under these categories those states that are considering legi slation have focuse d primarily on crts and computers the legislation enacted in california and maine addresses primarily crts and lcd or other flat screen di splays or products containing them legislation introduced in minnesota would address tvs computer monitors laptop computers cpus and printers new york bill would direct the states environmental agency to identify electronic equipment the bill defines electronic equipment as appliances that contain complex circuitry circuit boards or signal processing as well as one or more hazardous component s an oregon bill would regulate personal computers defined as central proce ssing unit that may or may not be combined with peripheral equipment such as hard drives floppy drives cd rom drives internal or external m odems fans keyboards and monitors given the rapidly changing nature of the computer and consumer electronics industries new concerns may arise flat screen tvs and monitors for example which are rapidly gaining market share do not use crts nor do laptop and handheld devices requiring only the ol der technology to be subject to regulatory requirements could provide an additional incentive for i ndustry to phase out the technologys use in contrast covering wide array of technologies including new technologies as they are introduced could encourage adva nce consideration of the environmental consequences of new technologies nd the design of products for minimal environmental impact
