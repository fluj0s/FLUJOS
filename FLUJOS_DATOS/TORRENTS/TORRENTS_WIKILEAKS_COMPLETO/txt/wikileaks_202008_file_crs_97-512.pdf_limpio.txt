to latin america it focuses on the development of us policy toward arms sales and transfers to latin america and the debate over modifying existing policy and practices regarding such sales nd transfers to countries in this region united states policy on arms transfers to latin america as implemented has gone through various modifications over the last forty years however there has always been some reluctance to provide large quan tities of arms to this region and there has been fundamental intere st in not making sales or transfers of highly advanced weapons systems such as combat fighte r aircraft that could undermine regional military balances or s timulate an arms race while there has been generic ban on arms transfers to latin american nations there have been specific legislative controls and executive branch practices applied to this region that have restrict ed the flow of american weaponry into it recently united states arms transfer practices regarding latin america were clarified by the clinton admin istration although they rema in the subject of debate over what approach the united states shoul d follow review of the development of us policy and practices toward arms transfers to this region follows to provide context for understanding recent actions some in congress have expressed concern that the united states might stimulate an avoidable arms race in latin america should it permit american defense firms to sell highly advanced weapons syst ems to this region they have expressed particular concern with the prospect that the united states might sell very sophisticated combat fighter aircraft and the prospect that this would divert scarce financial resources that could be better spen t in other ways others argue that it is appropriate for the united states to assist in the modernization of latin american military forces especially in light of the gr owth of democratic institutions there and the practical need some nations have to replace obsolescent military equipment chile is the most likely candidate for sale that would give tangible effect to the clinton administrations approach to us arms sales to latin america chile is considering the purchase of modern combat fighter to upgrade its air force in late march 1997 the clinton administration gave the us companies who build the f16 and f18 fighters permission to provide technical data rega rding these aircraft to the chilean government while noting that just because it has perm itted us defense companies to compete for the chilean aircraft sale does not necessarily mean that it would approve sale request from chiles government if and when chile should choose to request the sale of an american fighter aircraft the clinton administration would at that point have to agree to make such sale or issue an export license for commercial sale and then justify that sale to congress in accordance with the terms of the arms export control act congre ss in turn would have the opportunity to disapprove that sale by actment of joint resolution should it choose to do sohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97512contents background 1 co n g r ssio n l re str ic tio

transfers to latin american nations there have been specific legislative controls and executive branch practices applied to this region that have restricted the flow of am erican weaponry into it currently united states arms transfer practices regarding latin ameri ca are again under review and have become the subject of debate over what course th united states should follow in the future review of the development of us polic and practices toward arms transfers to this region follows to provide cont ext for understanding these most recent deliberations congressional restrictions on arms transfers to latin america in the 1960s congress determined that arms sales and military assistance to latin america should be constrained gene rally during period when emphasis was being placed on us aid to that regi on for economic and social development purposes this was also period when congress was concerned about providing advanced weaponry to underd eveloped nations globally not just to latin america these concerns led congress in 1967 to pa ss an amendment by representative conte to fy1968 foreign assistance funding bill that specifically forbade us financing of the purchase or acquisition of sophisti cated weapons systems such as missile systems and jet aircraft for military purpos by or for any underdeveloped country unless the president determines that such purchase or

sales was important to the us national security and reported this finding to congress within thirty days section 4 of the arms export control act aeca the successor statute to the fmsa currently contains the same restrictions on credit or guarantee sales of sophisticated weapons systems to underdeveloped c ountries as did the 1968 foreign military sales act2 section 33 of the foreign military

permitted to waive these limitati ons should he determine that doing so is important to the security of the united states and promptly report this to the speaker of the house and the senate committee on foreign relations this overall dollar ceiling on latin american arms sales was ra ised to 150 million by 1973 in 1974 it was repealed in its entirety by the foreign assistance act of 19743 although the overall dollar ceilings on arms sales levels to latin america were eliminated in 1974 congress did enact prohib itions on the sale or transfer of military equipment to specific latin american na tions notably chile and argentina due to concerns over actions taken by their gove rnments in particular human rights abuse of their citizens the ban on military aid and arms sales to chile was first enacted in 1974 while the one for argentina was enacted in 19784httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97512crs3 4continued by pl 101513 conditioned on presidential cer tification specifying certain things the

limitations on the sale or transfer of advanced military equipment to latin america especially on combat ai rcraft noted above led to friction with prospective latin american customers and resulted in other supp liers making sales that the united states refused to make on policy grounds in the midtolate 1960s the united states refused to sell combat aircraft more advanced than the a4b light attack aircraft and the korean war era f86 fighter some latin american nations sought the f5 light jet fighter but the united states was not prepared to sell it until 1969 peru responded to us rejection of its request to buy f5s by purchasing mirage 5 fighters from france thereby becoming in 1969 the first latin american nation to acquire supersoni c fighter aircraft subse quently argentina brazil colombia and venezuela also obtained mirage iii and mirage 5 fighters from france in the early 1970s the us f5 fighter became available for sale to latin america on cash basis in 1973 president nixon

available for sale to latin america in the 1960s and early 1970s so west europe israel and australia became primary sources for these weapons because the united states during this period did not have

president carters conv entional arms transfer policy and latin america by the time of president carters ection in 1976 congress had already passed legislation that placed restrictions on sa or transfers of weapons to countries determined to be engaged in systematic violations of human rights the carter conventional arms transfer policy directive pdd13 publicly announced on may 19 1977 noted that it would seek to advan ce respect for human rights in countries that received us military aid and woul d assess the economic impact of arms transfers to less deve loped nations receiving us ec onomic assistance the carter policy directive reflected the view that conventional arms transfers in general except for those to major allies needed to be restrained the carter policy stated that arms transfers would be viewed as an excepti onal foreign policy implement to be used only where it can be clearly demonstrated that the transfer contributes to our national security interests it also noted that the burden of persuasion will be on those who favor particular arms sale rather than those who oppose it it stated that the united states would not be the first supplier to introduce into region newlydeveloped advanced weapons systems which could creat new or significantly higher combat capability further the policy directive set in motion revision of us arms sales regulations that required aut horization by the state depar tment before agents of the us or private manufacturers could take actions to promote the sale of us armaments abroad and us embassies and military representatives abroad were forbidden from promoting the sale of us weapons7 it is the language of the carter arms transfer policy dir ective on conventional arms transfers that has given the impression th at strong restrictions on us transfers to latin america originated with his admin istration yet as noted above congress had already taken direct legislative action to limit us sales to this region for at least decade once in office carter did follow through with the key elements of his policy directive by refusing to sell any combat fighter aircraft to latin america more advanced than the a4 and the f5 he so denied permission for israel to sell its kfir fighter aircraft to ec uador in july 1977 an action he was able to take becausehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97512crs5 8under us law

america from the united states during fy1977fy19809 president reagans conventional arms transfer policy and latin america president ronald reagans administr ation took different position from president carter on arms transfer policy generally as well as on arms transfers to latin america on july 9 1981 president reagan publicly announced his presidential directive on conventiona l arms transfer policy which explicitly superseded the may 1977 carter policy directive on the subject10 the reagan policy directive stated that the transfer of conventional arms nd defense articles was an essential element of its global defense posture and an indispensable component of its foreign policy it noted that the united states would evaluate arms transfer requests primarily in terms of their ne t contribution to enhanced deterrence and defense in making decisions to transfer arms broad range of factors would be taken into account including whether the transfer is consiste nt with united states interests in maintaining stability within regions where friends of the united states may have differing objectives whether the proposed equipment transfer can be absorbed by the recipient without ove rburdening its military support system or financial resources and whether any detrimental effects of the transfer are more than counterbalanced by positive contributions to united states interests and objectives the reagan directive stipulated that all arms transfer requests would be considered on casebycase basis and that those involving coproduction or the transfer of sensitive or adva nced technology would receiv special scrutiny at the same time the reagan directive removed the carter prohibition on us government representatives overseas providing assistance to us firms that had obtained licenses to market us defense items abroad during the reagan administration the united states made its first sale to latin america of highly advanced supersonic comb at fighter aircraft

update its air force venezuelas important role as force for stability in th region and the fact that its oil revenues gave it the requisite funds to pay for the f16 fighters11 the f16 sale to venezuela was the single largest sale of any majo r us weapons system to latin america during the reagan administration and was larg er than any single arms sale to that region made subsequently by the bush administration from fy1981 through fy1992 the total of us government arms sales to latin american was 332 billion or an average of about 2768 million year most of the weapons sold in the region were of less advanced character and the rgest sales totals were to nations such as salvador considered strong anticommunist ally facing an internal insurgency the highest arms sales total for any year to the region was in fy1982 5239 million of this fy1982 total 456 million were for sales to venezuela the largest part of this figure was for the f16 aircraft12 president clintons co nventional arms transfer policy and latin america the reagan conventional arms transf er policy directive was not modified during the administration of president george bush thus the july 1981 reagan directive was the basis for us polic until it was replaced on february 17 1995 when after months of internal debate pr esident clinton released details of his directive on conventional ar ms transfer policy pdd34 as outlined the clinton directive codified an approach toward arms transfers that had guided the clinton administrations decisions since the presid ent took office under the clinton policy directive the united states continues to view transfers of conventional arms as legitimate instrument of us foreign policy when they enable the united states to help friends and allies ter aggression promote regi onal security and increase interoperability of us forces and allied forces13 president clintons conventional arms transfer policy represents public articulation of policy approach that has governed united states arms transfers at least since the reagan administration gi ven what the adminis tration believes are the multiple us interests involved in each arms transfer determination decisions will continue to be made on casebycase basis the guidelines set out in the policy are sufficiently broad so as to permit most us sa on the grounds of advancing the national interest the policy guidelines do not reflect more tightly drawn criteria for us arms transfers such as strict code of conduct test that potential arms recipients would have to meet under proposal by

explicitly single out any region of the world for special policy treatment although the administration has emphasized that its decisions on arms transfers will not be driven by commercial considerations but primarily by national security the clinton conventional arms transfer policy holds that supporting strong sustainable american defens eindustrial base is key national security concern rather than simply commercial matter in so doing the clinton policy directive has publicly elevated the significance of domestic economic considerations in the arms transfer decisionmaking process to higher degree than has been formally the case in previous administrations current debate over us ar ms sales policy and latin america although media accounts suggest otherwise there has been explicit statutory or policy ban on arms sales to latin amer ican nations with the exception of cuba from fy1993 through fy1996 the united stat government sold total of 7898 million in arms to latin america averag ing about 197 million in sales year it is true as outlined above that since the 1960s there has been reluctance on the part of the us government to make sales of highly sophisticat ed combat weapons systems to latin american countries and it has been general practice by the united states government not to seek to sell highly advanced weapons particularly advanced combat aircraft to this region14 the current debate over prospective latin american arms sales is debate over whether or not the united states or us companies should sell specific sophisticated weapons to specific nations in latin america it is debate over whether or not the united states should for example be willing to sell advanced combat fighter aircraft to nations in th region for the first time since 1982 when the us sold f16 fighters to venezuela the practice of the executive branch since the venezuelan sale has been ither to discourage or turn down requests to sell highly advanced combat weapons systems to latin american nations especially fighter aircraft it is this practice in the implementation of us arms transfer policy guidelines that has been challenged by us defense industry representatives it is this practice that was under review by the clinton administration for about two years15 on august 1 1997 president clinton made public his decision to place us

statement announcing this approach regarding arms transactions with latin america is consistent in its focus and emphasis with president clintons conventional arms transfer policy directive of 1995 the presidents august announcement while clarifying the policy approach the administration will follow in evaluating latin american arms transfers has not reso lved the debate between proponents and opponents of advanced weapons transfers to this region by the united states16 many us exporters of weapons systems argue that past restrictions on sale of advanced weapons sales to latin ameri ca are longer appropriate considering among other things the positive changes in the nature of governments in latin america toward greater democracy in the st decade their better ability to pay for more costly weapons and th eir practical requirement to upgrade key weapons that are at or near obsolescence these exporters also argue that past history has demonstrated the likelihood that once latin american nation has decided to purchase particular type of weapon it will do so whether the united states is willing to sell it to them the sales in 1996 of mig29 and 25 fighter aircraft to peru by belarus has increased the inte rest of some latin american countries in obtaining new combat fighte r aircraft for themselves and prompted calls by us defense companies for the administration to permit us combat fighter sales to such countries17 conventional arms control advocates ar gue that the united states would foster an expensive and destabilizing arms race in latin america if it sold comparable or better fighter aircraft than the peruvian g29s to other nations in the region they argue that the peruvian aircraft do not in themselves upset military balance in the region it is not certain the planes can be operated effectively or maintained and thus there is point in encouraging unnecessary new purchases of expensive fighters by other nations in latin america merely b ecause of perus acquisition instead the united states could attempt to secure the support of all major states in the region to engage in collective selfrestraint in the purchases of costly advanced weapons and place more emphasis on confidencebuilding measures that could avert wasteful military expenditures these arms control advocates believe the restraint the united states has displayed in arms sales to the region has served the interests of all nations in the region and should not be changed just because new market opportunities for american contractors might exist chile is the most likely candidate for sale that would give tangible effect to the clinton approach to us arms sales to latin america chile is considering the purchase of modern combat fighter to upgrade its air force in late march
