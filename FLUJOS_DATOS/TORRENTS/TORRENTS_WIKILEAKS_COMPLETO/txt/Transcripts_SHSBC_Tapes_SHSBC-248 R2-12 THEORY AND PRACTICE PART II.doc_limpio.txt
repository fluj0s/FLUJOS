r212 theory and practice part ii lecture given on 29 november 1962 okay this is lecture two saint hill special briefing course 29 nov ad 12 and going now into some more of the theory and discussion of routine 212 routine 212 bridges over into 3ga criss cross step 4 of routine 321 very easily but the purpose of finding items in routine 212 is to cure the present time problems which might be impinged upon the gpm where you have an individual with great big gorgeous fixation on the national insurance company and how it must be destroyed before the end of the world can take place he will continue to be fixated on the national insurance company now what you dont recognize that he is looking at something which represents to him onehalf of dumbbell package of the gpm and he will never look at the other side he will never say who am it he will only continue to say damn the national insurance company well this appears very reasonable to everybody because everybody knows that the national insurance company has been doing all kinds of frauds and swindles and so forth and everybody gets so reasonable about this that unless you really bear down on the new auditor he makes very fundamental error in doing 212makes very fundamental error he does an of course and ignores that thing reading on an assessment lets take somebody who is having an awful lot of trouble with her husband being audited by somebody who has an awful lot of trouble with her husband and we will get one of these reasonable of course situations and the funny part of it is that this auditor who has the duplicate problem of the pc will say of course and not pay any attention to it because it doesnt seem aberrative to her and will ignore it this is most manifest when you cant findyou get rock slammers that cant find rock slams on rock slammers see this is the mechanism behind it its an of course of course everybody would be mad at scientology organization you see they both slam on the same thing you see naturally so thatwe neednt pay any attention to that and this oddly enough aside from all the mechanics of it will be your most fruitful source of error is this of course not this reasonableness were only interested in the mechanics of the thing the ethnic difficulties so we have this fellow mad at the national insurance company audited by somebody who knows that the national insurance company is good and theyre going to assess everything in the world but the national insurance company and theyre going to miss youll find this will happen and when youre using this in academies and so forthit will happen all too oftenthe reasonableness of it now what the actual mechanic of the situation is thats all were interested in if this fellow has his attention his overtness fixated on any present time thing then we assume that that present time thing represents piece of the gpm and that hidden and out of sight is its opposing piece this person never asks himself who or what would oppose the national insurance company that he never asks because in the first place he is joe jones and he is opposing the national insurance company and hes keyed in the terminal arsonist and the oppterm is insurers see its nice game and its buried right there in the gpm but this thing is so keyed in to present time that this individual is being audited continuously with present time problem in session he always some part of some session his thinkingness will fixate on the national insurance company hell compare all this as to how it relates to the national insurance company he will want to get well so that he can be powerful enough to blow the top of the building off all of his auditing is being coned in toward this in other words his fixation on present time is such that he never goes backtrack hes trying to audit himself up to something or other in other words hes dramatizing the companion dumbbell see the other ball there that is opposing that thing insurers now the national insurance company is not part of the bank it is keyin it is substitute for lock on this gpm thing that keeps it in continuous restimulation therefore because one side of its in restimulation hidden and out of sight we have the pcs terminal and theres the pcs terminal pc never recognizes it every time he strikes box of matches he always holds the match too long or drops it on your favorite carpet or hes always in trouble one way or the other you see him with burned fingers and he strikes match and it ignites the matchbox and he drops that on your carpet and he lights gas stove by turning on the oven full blast and then he looks around the kitchen for while for some matches you see this bird day after day month in and month out without his eyebrows but in spite of this occurring all the time all the time all the time he will never dream think of assume nothing about this terminal arsonist and yet there it is in full restimulation now your little tab that shows up is his dislike of the national insurance company and as youre running who or what would bilk people or some question he puts down the national insurance company and as you go down the line with an assessment you suddenly find yourself looking at an itemnational insurance company and this thing rock slams which means fixation overts against withholds from games condition thats what that rock slam means it means the pc has terrific reality on this thing and it means the pc will shell out items on this thing like vegas blackjack dealer so there he is that item national insurance company well we test it out and we find out when we say to him national insurance company that he turns on sen we say national insurance company he sort of gets gritty toothed you know and he sort of at the same time feels little dizzy feels little tipped over anchor points seem to be kind of out of balance things begin to go into motion in his vicinitysen so this thing still slamming nicely we say who or what would oppose the national insurance company man we get beauty this list goes bangetybangetybangety bangetybang and finally item number 289or something like thathe puts on the list his arsonist we go ahead the list is obviously complete reacts to it because its nullable and we go down and we null the thing out and there were staring in the face arsonist and its rock slamming like mad all right now if national insurance company was reliable item you would just go directly at it but supposing national insurance company is just ticktickticktick on the assessment when we finally find it doing represent or an assessment of represent list and we do represent and it gets down to insurers see then that will slam all right the final end of it is is regardless of whether we had to represent it to get the rock slam or whether it was just rock slamming in the first place weve got package and this package means that we have found the two ends of the dumbbell and this thing will discharge now it wont necessarily evaporate totally but usually if its that close to present time we can count on it going absolutely numbnothing itll wash right out as he begins to think this over there are other things we could do with these if they kept on slamming and so forth why we could represent the slamming items and theyd lead us deeper into the gpm we can do other things with these we could even list goals against anyeither of these reliable items you see weve got other uses for these were not interested in those uses in r221r212 rather only in 321 are we interested in that which is step 4a 3ga criss cross so our main concern in doing 221 2121 is that there are two pieces of the gpm now why is it called gpm its called goals problem mass it is mass which is composed of identities which oppose identities and they are so delicately faced against each other on the track that they dont slip theyre right there and they finally compose great big gaudy black mass and you are going to have pcs tell you oh these black masses that ron talks about and so forth probably he has an oppterm religion or something like that and he probablyblack masses so on or something or other then nobodys ever seen one of these things after while all of sudden thisall this phenomena will start showing up for the pc i had somebody tell that well i sort of parted company with your work back in 1952 when you started talking about ridges and things and i had reality on that years later all of sudden collide with ridge they are black they are round they do oppose each other in other words these are not allegorical or metaphorical actions they do have mass and the anatomy of problem is item versus item postulate versus postulate its game in other words where you have two sides equally opposed problem does not become problem as longuntil one is unable to overwhelm and wont be overwhelmed in other words problem is matter of balance you dont find people having problems with the government of russia in russia you have problems with the government you are simply completely overwhelmed all the time problem you talk to russian do you have any problems with your government never have any problems with the government fine government fine government fine government what other government is there you mean youre free how do you stand it you know you find all kinds of weird arguments now in that case you find some girl who has won in marriage marriage is problem to her got her husband completely overwhelmed he cooks dinner he earns the money takes care of the children everything and she never lifts foot sits in the dining room sits in the living room eating bonbons shes got that licked marriage is problem to her you see heres your case of overwhelm or be overwhelmed well that doesnt make problem her husband works and makes money and she works and makes money and the husband doesnt like housework but thinks the other party should do it and she doesnt like housework and thinks the other party should do it she likes to go to movies and the husband likes to sit home and read books they are more or less of equal strength saturdays she wins the fisticuffs sundays he does this thing is never resolvednever resolved nobody ever overwhelms anybody it goes on and on and on if you spoke to either one of them and you said problem they would say wives or husbands or marriage something like that see its got to be an equally balanced affair thats the point im making here well now dont underestimate the age of pair of items in ain the goals problem mass this thingthis whole thing is built up basically on the alterisness of goals so you say at once well why dont we just find the pcs goal and then everything will resolve well unfortunately that is not the case because even if you found the pcs goal on the bulk of the pcs he has still got two items which are present time problems and the goal doesnt instantly and immediately resolve those items and so youre trying to audit somebody with screaming present time problem even though you have this persons goal and youll find out this goal just doesnt ever list to free needle and he just doesnt ever go clear so thats why now these bypassed items and so forth are pinned into pt one way or the other and theyre beyond the pcs reach or confront so herehere is what we get we get this equally balanced pair one against the other and being an equally balanced pair theres slip neither one of them has ever overwhelmed the other one but the age of this how long has this been going on well it may have been going on for trillions and trillions of years on single pair and the game just before thatall based on the same goalis another pair and it has gone on for trillions and theres another pair before that and how long has that game gone on trillions and theres see some pc who tells you that he has totally accumulated his aberration in this lifetime because youve been mean to himnever been done and it never will be done it takes long time to get in that kind of condition takes long time now lets take this one thats right up at the top arsonist and insurers as package take this one right up to the top of the bag of walnuts this thing is billion years old see or trillion and boy is it massive and boy is it beefy and boy has he lived lot of lives in that pair lots of types of lives why this guy has even sunk so low as to become an employee of insurers had the most seniest life of all hes been anything and everything you see but these items are cumulative so you have two principal valences perfectly balanced one against the other one is thrusting just as hard as the other is thrusting neither one of them are overwhelming the other and to those are accumulated thousands of additional little ones and those things also oppose those things and you can justits just almost endless numerically you get staggering figures out of this sort of thing now this composition of the gpm would be very nice if it just consisted of dumbbell and then below that slightly bigger dumbbell and below that slightly bigger dumbbell and below that slightly bigger dumbbell and there were sixty dumbbells in numberssixty pairsand that was the whole lot of it and then we went into the second goal below that and then there were fortytwo pairs that went into the second goal you see and so on and this was all laid out and perfectly plotted against the time track and so on theyd be very easy to find but they arent plotted that way if it was all straightened out it would be plotted that way but this pc is case of scrunch the characteristic of the reactive mind is instantaneousness there is time in the reactive mind this happens to be one of the highest characteristics of thetan actually thetan has time and the lower scale mockery of that particular characteristic is time everything in this instant now youve got the whole of this goals problem mass to the pc is dated this instant it could be sixty trillion years worth of this instant there is time differential in this thing therefore when you null you say one of these things to the pc it reacts on the meter as this instant one of the reasons we call them instant reads soon as the thought gets across it reacts how could it possibly react well thats the marvelous thing about it its just the instantaneousness of the reactive bank the analytical mind would require lot of time so youll find out that your latent reads are analytical reads the more time is connected to read or the more time is apparent in readsand this is only rough approximation not hard and fast rulewhy the more analytical it would be but you dont find slow reads on the reactive bank now the motto of the reactive bank is book one and according to the dianetic axiom time is the single source of human aberrationand it is you have this aprime thing that is the most aberrative about it is the time so that time equals time equals time equals time 1870 equals 1920 equals 1736 equals the year zero theyre all the same instant not the same year the pc isnt confused about these things on this level of reactivity they are all the same instant and hundred trillion years ago is this instant and everything is this instant its the most gorgeous instantaneous current reaction that you ever wanted to have anything to do with well if time is all the same what differentiation can we find that we can work on the differentiation we can find is in reality on actually in theory every time you say boo to the pc the whole reactive bank reacts every item in the reactive bank reacts but this is one of these absolutes are unobtainable and its nonsensical statement you see its like you stamp against the earth the earth stamps against you you know its this type of statement in actual fact the situation as we look at the meter is only saved by the reality of the pcsaved by the reality of the pcbecause the meter reads on what the pc has reality on not what the pc is momentarily in as far as the gpm is concernedyou see theres free track running alongside of the gpm and the pc can move up and down that trackand dianetics is the study of that free track were now studying the gpm were not studying engrams what were studying is covered in book one under valences and circuits and all that talk about circuits in one chapter there those are all items right out of the gpm they are right there in book one i was aware of this thing but not to the extent that it pervaded the mind and not to the extent that the free track can be neglected you can do lot for somebody running free track but its this instantaneous track see free track is timed the reality of the pc is governed by the pcs tolerance of force so your pc is not recognizing that which is closest to him in the moment of time or any of these other things its not that one thing reads because it is later than the other or earlier than the other its thing reads because it most closely approximates the pcs limit of reality on force and you can always run against the ceiling of that limit just the ceiling against that reality on force and that ceiling is marked by the rock slam thats how much force can this pc bear to confront youll find out person is as sane not as he uses force but he is as sane as he can tolerate force direct relationship between force and sanity you start running around banning bombs you run into very interesting proposition youre not going to get very much support because the bulk of the population of earth doesnt believe in them theres too much force contained in an atomic bomb and they just cant confront it so it just isnt real actually if the population were capable of tolerating force they would have long since have torn both the governments of the united states and russia to pieces limb from limb the reason wars can occur is because people cant tolerate force so they have reality on what theyre doing they dont know how much force theyre going to turn loose its an irresponsible action so sanity is very far from measurable on the degree that an individual can throw out forcenot handle force but throw out force see the amount of force that an individual will let loose is index of his sanity but the amount of force that the individual can confront or tolerate is direct measurement of his sanity and as the individual has come down the track through the gpm he has been less and less capable of tolerating force and so the pt terminals and oppterms that are stuck right in present time are usually quite insurmountable to the pc until youve audited him with 212 why well all preclears suffer from some sort of reaction like this they think there is more to it than there is it is inevitable thats one of theone of the guiding idiocies of thetan thetan has several nuttinesses he was born that way and one of the things he was born with is just the he thinks there is more to it than there is hes always trying to make more of it than he can make out of it now youll have many pcyouve had this experience youve had some pc sitting therethis pc is saying oh well lets see now im trying to get off this withhold and it must be pretty bad hes saying to himself and if i just get off this big withhold and so forth id smooth out the needle and im just always having to have mid ruds put in on and i must have done something very very bad and i must have some big dramatic withhold of some kind or another he goes on and on and on and on and on with this nonsense and then eventually says well i noticed your tie was crooked and the needle straightens out you get what imwhat im driving at here now thisauditors do this sometimes they will hound the pc trying to pick up the missed withhold because the pcs got dirty needle and they this girl why heavens she must have had all sorts of clandestine second dynamic withholds of various kinds and considerations which are catastrophic and fantastic and so forth and the auditor is in there trying to straighten out with magnitude of dramatic effect what in essence would straighten out simply with confrontation of something rather minor youve sat there sometimes im sure and had been certain that this pc must have done something gigantic and if you were lucky you eventually got what the pc did and it was very often neither gigantic nor not gigantic and sometimes the pc upset you by giving you something gigantic but the pointbut the point im making here is it boreactually the amount of dramatic content had little or nothing to do with the aberrative effect apparently on the needle it just didnt have that relationship well similarly the only thing that will react on the needle is what the pc can get reality on it isnt whats there or what isnt there in this lifetime this pc has got very little drama that i can assure you but now we go into the gpm im afraid that life was not quite as represented this person is putting on marvelous show they go down and they always inevitably are the first volunteer on the scene to sell poppies on poppy day and theyre nice to stray cats and they do this and theyre all subscribing to this and that and crutches for aged policemen and all kinds of fun and theyre always around working joining the united nations you know going to straighten out katanga and all kinds of wild incredible things these birds are up to see and you look it over and youve got this pc in the auditing chair see and this pc is good this pc is kind this pc is sweet this pc is that well your ideas of this are rather excited you say well it cant be this true and if you try to pick it up as straight withholds youre going to lay an egg because boy theyve been good for long time hundreds of years see theyve been good and underlying all this will be the exact reverse of something or other you see they werethey were the personthey were the person who solicited the bribes for the axman from the relatives of the about to be deceased you know gold piece for good clean stroke you know this kind of thing and then that was the deteriorated end of somebody who made profession out of getting nobility murdered so they could have their estates given to them see you find out on the whole track theyve been pretty pretty interesting now you do find dramatic stuff in the gpm the overts are with magnitude but you dont pull them bit by bit dont you see they turn up as whole package there you got it and weve been disappointed for so longbeen disappointed for so long in looking for something gargantuan out of the pc on security check or something like that that we may have gone into apathy about this point and we shouldnt because your reliable items as you pair them up and keep going why the blood starts flicking out of both sides of the emeter after while you know because they inherited the gpm quite honestly and the reason theyre trying to make much out of it or more out of it theyre trying to match up with whats in the gpm dont you see the gpm restimulates them to believe that they have done something but they cant put their finger on it well its in the gpm theres drama in that mess but frankly it isnt drama which happened over the last two or three hundred years its been going on for long long time and its accumulated an awful lot of identities and to be able to cut into this thing at all and release it as far as it exists in present time as present time problem is utterly fantastic and to think that somebody wasknowing the existence of thisto think that somebody was going to go clear by sitting and reverently regarding his own navel for long enough period of time becomes utter asininity it does some of the technologies or techniques which have existed on this planet that were supposed to free people you begin to wonder who the hell was swindling who because just try and represent some of these lists some day know how much skill it takes to actually strip one of the things down look at the resulting items put the thing together recognize what the mechanics of the thing are and you become stonied and you say somebody was going to get well by sitting in chair and saying the number of times he was interfered with as little boy couldnt possibly have happened and for us to get an inroad on this to even get sight of the gpm you realize we would have done enough just to have description of the gpm say this is whats wrong with much less tackle it so actually were really doing something here which is quite fantastic because when the pc starts getting mixed up with this an auditor has to go steady on sometimes pcs actually get pretty upset sometimes in handling this because its very upsetting very so it requires an auditor who will complete the job hes got to go as far as he can go honestly before he goes and goes as far as he can go and there is room here for an auditor who quits because the pc twitters or because the pcs got somatic there is room here for an auditor who wont complete cycle of action hes got to complete cycle of action to the degree that he can complete it or recognize arriving at point where you realize that its nonnullable listyou did complete the cycle of action particularly if you nulled it out long enough to take most of the sen off the pc youve completed the action that was in progress to the degree that it could be completed and you should always do that now r212 tries to unpin these great big ptps out of present time and people are going to say this very interesting thing to you countless times youre going to get sick of this ive gotten sick of it already theyre going to say but look the pcs gives the list that goes backtrack when youre trying to solve present time problem one of the reasons ive been giving you this much anatomy of the gpm is simply this where the hell else is there to go somebody must be operating on the basis that this person has had enough crime and overts since he was born in this lifetime to aberrate himself i assure you that isnt the case couldnt be the case some fellows i know have put in some good licks and some of them find this lifetime as little black ball theyve got track they cant go back earlier than this they will have done something there sometime or another that already have started or put wart on one of the main dumbbells see youll find this youll find this every once in while not rare but for one to have formed whole sphere whole black mass in one lifetime oh not possible had somebody say on old 3d criss cross one time i dont think that i have thought up or found out new idea for the last million years he suddenly collided with what was his thinkingness and all the ideas he had in this lifetime were in that lifetime well if hed kept on going hed have found them earlier than that he hadnt thought of any original ideas for lot longer than that it isnt that its impossible to think of original ideas but to have original aberrations is pretty far flung now what we want to take look at here in the gpm is not only that we could clear somebody by continuing to find item versus item because we couldif we found reliable item versus reliable item and then found another reliable item and got its oppterm and kept going and going and going and goingslow job but we could clear somebody that way point you mustnt overlook youre walking down the rock slam road person eventually you get aboutoh i dont knowyou get twenty thirty pairs and this person is saying well heres my goal you couldnt go any further than that without him giving your goal i mean hed just say well thats my goal well of course you can use the goal to find reliable items easier than you can use arbitrary lines and you just go on with the same thing i mean you just could go on using his goal as the source of lines in all cases but now you would be into 321 youd have shifted gears over to 321 bypassing 321 step 4 see thats where youd be so 212 cuts into routine 321 at place which is determined by the extent that 212 is run the more 212 is run the lower it cuts into 321 1 mean if you just undid the present time problems of the pc snapsnap and got couple of reliable items and they paired up and so forth and you find the pcs tone arm now moves and lot of other things occur thats highly beneficial then you would cut into prepcheck and then you would cut into goals list and you could go right on with 321 see in other words we straighten it out so the case would get rapid gain just got rid of the present time problem and so forth we move right over into top of 321 all right or lets supposing now that we went ahead with problem 212 and we got six items thats three packages one kind or another these are all pretty surface packages well weve already done at least one package that could be used in step 4a 3ga criss cross of routine 321 so we take one of those oppterms the one of those advanced oppterms and we just list goals 1 tolist goals list 1 to 10 usually it would simply be 1 and 6 of the old goals list of 3ga criss cross we list it against that beefiest oppterm and we turn up with the pcs goal and then we would carry on from there but if case were even rougher and harder and we didnt succeed at that well actually you would go into 3ga criss cross from that point there on just getting more items quite similar operation but you would be using the prehav scale with which to do that and little more succinctly supposing we did 212 and boy we really had this case flying we had found dozen items six pairs and they were nice reliable items and the case was really flying and everything was swell and here we go that would be about the earliest you could expect the pc to be laying his goal on the desk theresyouve bypassed assessment youve arrived at step 5 without ever finding the pcs goal because he gave it to you you go very much further with 212 and youre going to start getting the goal whether you would it or not it pc will tell you what it is well now some pcs are so stacked up and identified and so much into the bank and so forth that it might take many more pairs than that before the pc gives you his or her goal but averagely along somewhere around dozen items reliable items and so forth why pcs speculating even raw meat will start speculatingand very often just hand you his goal and checks out bang bang now this then could be carried to ne plus ultra lets supposing we completely neglected the pcs goal lets supposing we never gave the pc break every time the pc has hazarded on the goal we acknowledged him very politely and we didnt do anything with the goal at all and we kept on finding items that paired with items and so on and we just kept on finding well eventually get the rock and opprock on the first goal and the pc then would blow the rest of the bank and go free just by the recognition that is his goal with total reality dont you see now which is the best one of those things to do well you just do what you do there is best one of those things you dont necessarily you wouldnt see eye to eye with sitting there on your hands while the pc gave you his goal and you certainly wouldnt drive pc halfway round the bendbut he says my goal is to catch catfish and you say well fine now were going to list another prehav scale here were going to see if we cant get couple more items i think youve got problem in present time and weve only found twentytwo pairs and so forth and butbut this is justjustmy goal is to catch catfish see he wont 90 clear then either because hes now got protest on his goal and that would effectively stop the whole operation on the same basis that any assessment or anything else would be stopped the mid ruds are wildly out and theyll be out from then on and you just wouldnt advance because the pc is out of session so sooner or later the practicality of 2 12 ceases because the goal is being laid in your lap now that give you some kind of an idea of its uses audience yes all right your next point of examination here that might be of considerable interest to you is that 212 is usable as an assist now theres one process which is senior to and superior to 212 or 321 although it is part of 321 theres one process that is superior to it and outranks it when these conditions exist when the pc has had found or been run on wrong goal or you suspect that the condition of the pc evolves from wrong goal that has been found or run on the pc you get rid of that wrong goal that is senior to any action of 212 even if you suspect ityou understand because the pc may still be in some kind of fog on the subject of is it his goal and isnt it his goal and does it or doesnt it or something like this and try to bend 212 over into trying to do something with his goal and hes worried about it well whats your present time problem there see the present time problem is the pcs goal youre not going to find that with 212 because goal is senior to items so you suspect wrong goal you run wrong goal you dont run 212 now how do you run wrong goal well the rule is that you run it with big tiger and you run wrong goal with big tiger if its just been found and you run it with prepcheck if it has been found and listed those are very easy things to remember in the handling of wrong goal if goal has just been found and nothing much has been done with it and yet the pc thought it was his goal for while and so forth why just big tiger slam bang at it for while get rid of it and slick it up but in actual fact if its been listed youve got to do prepcheck now thatif goal has been listed it is senseless to do big tiger against it it isnt just relatively ineffective it is senseless it wont move anyplace so now when you got pc who has bad auditing as his historythis isnt question of goals nowwhen hes got bad auditing it must be so because he says so and when the pc is all fouled up ever since that session in which he was run on an engram or ever since that session etc etc or ever since the first foundation when etc etcr212 we dont care how much bad auditing hes had r212 will handle it this is one of the things that gives this an importance is despite the fact that it wont handle wrong goal which it wont itll handle every other breed of auditing there is and the reason for that wasbecause i dont care if the auditing was good auditing or bad auditing or any other kind of auditing and the fellow felt loused up about itan item was loused up not the pc an item was loused up it was the item that arc broke not the pc you understand it was the item which was getting its engrams run not the pc see you see why this is then goals are senior to items and items are senior to every other kind of auditing weve ever had so that gives you your seniorities of use now because everything is aaaa this can be used as an assist as its lightest action as goofily as what illness of yours have you been interested in this is just crazy see my lumbosis all right who or what does lumbosis represent to you unwritten list unnulled anything else see thats meterless assist using the principles of 212 1 want you to recognize that 212 has certain principles connected with it dont you see thats why i gave you that assist not so you will use that assist but so you will get the idea of what youre doing on it well how come well the pc must have been interested in it so it must be identified like mad he must have an aaa if hes got psychosomatic illness he must have the past in present time therefore an instantaneousness is in connection with it see the present time is the past time therefore it must have some impingement on the gpm because it has an instantaneousness isnt in proper position on the time track must be held there by some instantaneousness whats he doing making mistake like this whats he doing with scar thats an interesting question isnt it aaa and the first identification of is where you put time instead of in other words time equals time equals time whats he doing with an engram in restimulation well if hes got an engram in restimulation and it stays in restimulationit doesnt go out of restimulation then one tag end of that engram must be headed into the gpm otherwise it couldnt be in restimulation forever those engrams which dont fade out in from three to ten days after being contacted run butchered bad session anything else you want to call it didnt key out because of the gpm somebody got ahold of piece of the gpm and tried to erase it any other engram would have disappeared supposing you have an automobile accident and this brings you back and all of sudden youve got mysterious backache well from three to ten days if youve still got mysterious backache and it doesnt disappear then that automobile accident must have keyed in the gpm if you easily got well and dont have backache three to ten days later of course it wasnt part of the gpm you see how you separate the sheeps from the goats so all right now lets get more practical assist lets look over the chronic somatics of this individual chronic chronic man that have been going on and on and on and on and on it is timelessness we are looking for ever since i was little boy ive had this tic see its an indicator see must be hooked into the gpm must be otherwise it would havewhatever happened to himwould have disappeared in from three to ten days hes still got it some kind of psychosomatic something or other therefore it must be hooked into the gpm little kid contracts some sort of habit this habit has been going on for years spits at everybody nobody can cure him of spitting at anybody part of the gpm man im not kidding about that i mean it is it just is part of the gpm and the gpm can never be educated out of anybody cant be done what society has been able to cure anybody of is part of the gpm that you can make up your mind about all right this fellow stole bag of groceries and went to jail for eighteen months and hes come out and hes been straight ever since well it happens to people nothing to do with the gpm this fellow stole bag of groceries went to jail for year came out of jail stole bag of groceries went to jail for eighteen months got out of jail stole bag of groceries and we have the common order of action which occurs in our modern societies which is considerably interesting the repetitive character of criminality the twotimers and that sort of thing these birds didnt become criminals in this lifetime theyve been like that for long time and let tell you the state cops hobbyists prisons psychologists none of these things are going to cure any part of it and let tell you that youll wind up just as much criminals in this lifetime next lifetime next lifetime next lifetime as you ever want this is what breaks the heart of the dogooder this repetitive action of course they have some wins they have the guy thats had bad break and the identity which he seems to have because of this bad break isnt part of the gpm it passes away and it keys out and thats it so theyve had break they actually helped this guy out see so they know they helped him out and it straightened him out and everything is fine so theyre led on theyre given win they get stuck with win next guy they picked up is straight in the middle of the identity of the gpm man he knows what stores are for to put in trucks at night and you could help this guy out and you could help this guy out and you could help this guy out and its just the same cycles would happen again and again and again you cannot educate the gpm out of anybody now some of the processes we have when properly used oddly enough are capable of keying it out which is fantastic attestation to the power of dianetic and scientology techniques as theyve existed in the last dozen years im overawed we actually have been able to key out this confounded thing without direct attack at all the interesting thing is is our firstgoal clears mest clears that have sprung up from time to time along the track that these people can be made at all is fantastic because we had process that could take apart the gpm which i think is quite interesting some of these characters are still having marvelous run of it but because aaa both in timewe should look at the other three factors of the gpm matter energy and space now those three things are also in the gpm and probably the gpm has mass simply because time becomes nothing and the energy and so forth isnt yet nothing this adds up in very interesting mathematical proposition itd take einstein to wrap his wits around how exactly this would occur you see if time were actually zero if time were actually zero then there would be matter thered be energy and possibly space so its an apparency of zero that we are handling in the so although theres an apparency of matter there is mass although theres apparency of energy there is energy although theres apparency of space there is space and theres apparency of time there is yet time so you find matter energy space and time are in this gpm now the moment that you restore any differentiation matter if its just from identity to slight similarity or you know it isnt quite exact anymore apple doesnt equal apple b person vaguely sees there might be little bit of difference between apple and apple b and if thats the case heh its interesting but you get more matter more energy and more space because youve got more time so this fellows sitting there saying there are black masses and the second that you establish similarity they seem to materialize from nowhere and theres many dubin case is going to be very upset with 2 12 and its true what auditors over in england used to observe that case very often goes black before it goes back to pictures again well heres this case with all kinds of dubin pictures like crazy and everything is fine and they dub dub dub dub and all of sudden it all goes black and then all goes white and then all goes this and all goes that you see whats happening here as you add differentiation you get more mass apparent greater apparency of mass then takes place stuff ceases to read exactly and instantly on the emeter youll see goal do this the goal is the thing which actually drifts on the track harder than an item and youll see the goal as its being threequarters run out will all of sudden begin to read early and late and on and then very early and then very late and then on and you wont quite know what the devil this goal is all about now smooth auditing is absolutely required in the handling of the gpm otherwise the individuals ability to confront the matter energy space and time which is increasing in his bank is not invited but repressed and so the individual would tend to hang fire if he were being beat up at the same time he was being audited in other words auditing could take the place of present time problem therell be some cases that will hang up theyll see things willall of sudden are going to become tougher for them theyre being asked to confront more pain than they care to confront theyre being asked this theyre being asked that and they all of sudden try to turn off the reality that has been turning on and all cases go over sort of rolly coaster it keeps getting better and better their confront keeps getting better and better but it sometimes will get worser momentarily get worser theyll come into session and they would rather be whipped than list another single goddamn line on that blanketyblank plot why its getting tough the more they list the more matter energy space and time is materializing of course time permits them to escape from the pressure of it it was probably the only thing that makes the process work at all its because time becomes less identified and therefore the pc isnt being subjected to all the matter all the energy and all the space that is there incipiently in the bank ready to tear him apart but sometimes your pc will be sitting there with blinding ball of fire heading straight for him and the next thing you know hes sitting there very calmly hes just slid himself down scale hard hes ducked hes done bunk you can still dig it out but every once in ait requires special action thats just the kind of rolly coaster action he takes he just didnt feel like having his head knocked off with meteor that day see because there is meteor it is only the mental image picture of meteor which burned out trillion years ago its just because this bank was opening up and its what this valence was knocked off by youve gotten to the death moment of valence or something like that and he dramatizes the valence and does bunk youve still moved on the time track but he still made it less visible hes still gone less confront on it dont you see so if we use this on any kind of an assist we are increasing the pcs ability to differentiate and our bacon is served because hes also differentiating moments of time and this gives him more time to go into than he had before and so he is now capable of being there or not being there as the case may be there is still this factor of increasing ability to confront which must be handled in 212 and the only way that it is handled is just give the pc good sessions and dont hit him over the head every time he has win and his confront will keep coming on up there are many pcs will have to go on and on and on and on and on before they get win because they open that eye just little bit and they decide theyd better not look today you can do half dozen ten lists from list one without rock slam on any one of them the list getting more and more alive before you finally have rock slam thats very extreme but that can happen right now you have some statistics sixteen out of twentyfive people on this r212 are successful with either items found or listing on lists which are producing rock slams error one auditor had three items in with rock slams after nulling list and didnt put the package or anything together as the rs went and disappeared well of course the package slithered together somehow or another he simply should have put it together we have four out of five cases listing on items who have been listing on 212 who have found rs as yet thats four of the five cases mentioned here but that is actually four out of twentyfive or oneeighth in the first few hours of doing 212 have yet to turn on rock slam those cases are benefiting however and two cases have such dirty needle or stuck needle that assessment has occurred since dead horse was listed on each well naturally thats mid ruds situation on that particular list that could be cleaned up like bomb or the list could be further run or you listed little bit further something like that could happen so as to take the charge of the thing off the summary on it is r212 is great success as even those who have had rs are making gains with the exception of one pc who is making gains in session but out of session is not now thein other words with minimal checkout with minimal action in trainingand disallowing for the fact that the auditors here are pretty good auditorsyou havent got bunch of loses on your hands you havent even had all the gen you havent been checked out on the gen and that sort of thing youre still winning on the thing with little bit of experience you find out how to really fly with this thing because most of your time is wasted on dead horses the auditing the amount of time the auditing takes in relationship to the amount of time wasted by dead horses and so on youll find quite disproportionate but all of sudden you will be able to get these things into better focus now from where i sit why weve got some cases cracking right now on r212 that have been on everything else in the shop even 3ga criss cross and you say well how can case benefit from r212 that was notwhen it wasnt benefiting on 3ga criss cross well r212 has this listing is auditing its listing directly from something which is giving the pc an awful present time problem and its actually easing up the pcs present time problem and the pc is starting to make gain for the first time in other words its attacking the present time environment of the pc which of course 3ga criss cross doesnt even pretend to do so there is where we sit with this particular technology and i wish you very well with it thank you very much
