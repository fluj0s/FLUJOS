arbitration for statutory claims by having their employees sign mandatory arbitration agreements these agreements provide generally that all claims arising out of ones employment will be heard by an arbitrator or panel of arb itrators rather than by judge or jury arbitration is often perceive d by employers as faster and less expensive alternative to litigation arbitration agreements also ppear in the context of organized labor as unions and employers negotiate for mandatory arbitration in collective bargaining agreements the us supreme courts decision in wright v universal maritime service corp is the courts most recent attempt to explain when mandatory arbitration agreement will be enforced to require arbitr ation of statutory claim although the court found that an arbitration agreemen t will not be enforced when it does not explicitly require arbitration for statutory claims and when there has not been clear and unmistakable waiver of judicial forum for such claims the court resisted any further discussion about unions ability to waive judicial forum for employees while the court recognized the tension between two lines of case law that have developed since two previous supreme court cases were decided it chose to decide wright solely on the basis of its facts thus the question remaining after wright is likely to go unanswered until the court agrees to review case with more appropriate facts or congress chooses to legislate in this area because the civil rights act of 1964 the age discrimination in employment act and the americans with disabilities ac t each provide for judicial relief some contend that mandatory arbitr ation agreements undermine the intent of congress in addition others argue that mandatory arb itration agreements support an employers superior bargaining position as employees are forced to sign such agreements in order to obtain employment for these reasons the enforceability of mandatory arbitration agreements is likely to be of interest to congresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30008contents background 2 cir c u it co u r t ca s 3 wright v universal maritime service corp 7 l g isla tiv c tio n 1 0httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30008142

51 11idbackground the supreme courts decisions in gardnerdenver and gilmer have produced two approaches toward mandatory arbitr ation agreements the first approach typified by gardnerdenver recognizes an unwaivable right to judicial forum for statutory claims in gardnerdenver black employee sought relief under title vii after he was terminated alt hough the plaintiff mr alexander was told that he was discharged for his poor job performance he alleged that his ter mination was racially motivated alexander filed grievance in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement between his union and the company the agreement contained broad arbitration clause covering any trouble arising in the plant6 after receiving an adverse judgement in arbitration alexander sought relief in fede ral court however the district court dismissed the action and found that alexander was bound by the arbitral decision7 the court stated that because alexander elected voluntarily to pursue his grievance to fina l arbitration under the agreem ent he was precluded from suing his employer under title vii the tenth circuit affirmed the ruling of the district court but the suprem court reversed that decision after reviewing the purpose and procedures of title vii the court concluded that an individual does not forfeit his privat cause of action even if he first pursues his grievance to final arbitration under collectiv bargaining agreement8 the court recognized that legislative enactments in this area have evinced general interest in providing parallel or overlapping remedies against discrimination9 thus it was not inappropriate for alexander to seek relief through arbitration and then in court in addition the court distinguis hed contractual rights under collective bargaining agreement from statutory rights that are created by title vii and other federal statutes while the court acknowledged that some statutory rights like the right to strike can be waived by union other statutory rights like those granted under title vii cannot be waiv ed prospectively title vii stands on plainly different ground it concerns not majoritarian processes but an individuals right to equal employment opportunities10 the court further stated that the rights conferred by title vii cannot form any part of the collective bargaining process because waiver of those rights would defeat the congressional purpose behind title vii11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30008crs3 12500 us at 23 13500 us at 29 14500 us at 35 159 usc 1 et seq 1994the second approach toward mandatory ar bitration agreements has its origin in gilmer this approach recognizes arbitrati on as suitable method of obtaining relief for statutory claims even when the language in mandatory arbitration agreement is broad and does not specify arbitration for such claims in gilmer an employer sought to compel arbitration of ter minated employees claim under the adea as securities representative gilmer was required to register with several stock exchanges including the new york stock exchange nyse consequently gilmer became bound by the rules of the nyse one nyse rule requires securities employees to arbitrate any controversy arising out of registered representatives employment or termin ation of employment12 the rule makes specific reference to the adea or any other federal antidiscrimination statute nevertheless the court concluded that gilmers claim could be subject to compulsory arbitration where the court previously recognized congressional interest in providing parallel remedies against discrimination in gardnerdenver the court in gilmer contended that such remedies evinced merely flexible approach to resolution of claims13 rather than providing for both arbitr ation and judicial relief this flexible approach permitted arbitration to be suitable remedy on its own the court reasoned that congress would have explicitly precluded arbitration in the adea had it not wanted arbitration to be an appropriate method of ttaining relief in addition the court offered three distinctions between gilmer and gardnerdenver first the court stated that the two cases presented different issues while gardnerdenver was concerned with whether the arbitr ation of contractua l claims precluded subsequent judicial revi ew of statutory claims gilmer offered situation where contractual and statutory cl aims could both be subject to arbitration under the nyse rule second gilmer did not involve collective ba rgaining agreement that was enforced by union thus there was tension between collective representation and individual statutory rights14 presumably gilmer understood that he was agreeing to arbitrate all of his claims when he completed the registration application third the agreement in gilmer was subject to the federal arbitration act of 1947 faa15 the court noted that the faa reflects federal policy favoring arbitration agreements in contrast the court found previously that the collective bargaining agreement in gardnerdenver was not subject to the faa circuit court cases despite the two supreme court cases th courts of appeals have differed in their recognition of mandatory arbitration ag reements in general they have chosen to follow either gardnerdenver or gilmer further the courts of appeals have considered the issue in reference to th ada as well as title vii and the adea in pryner v tractor supply co the seventh circuit held that mandatory arbitration clause in collective bargaining agreement was not enforceable

violations of title vii the ada and the adea16 although the court contended that workers statutor rights could be arbitrable if the worker consented to having such rights arbitrat ed it found that union could not consent for the employee by signing collective bargaining agreement that left the enforcement of statutory rights to the unioncontrolle d grievance and arbitration system created by the agreement the court feared that union may not pursue an employees claim as vigorously as the employee in privat action in addition the court believed that the union may decline to prosecute claim for strategic reasons that is the union may avoid pursuing claim because it wanted to maintain cordial relationship with the employer17 although the court was re luctant to favor either gardnerdenver or gilmer it did find pryners case to be closer to gardnerdenver further the court expressed its belief in maintaining plaintiffs right to sue18 in varner v national super markets inc the eighth circuit held that an employee did not have to exhaust the grieva nce procedures in collective bargaining agreement before filing title vii lawsuit19 although varner did not participate in any part of the grievance and arbitrati on procedures under the collective bargaining agreement the court contended that exhaus tion of these procedures was not necessary to file suit following gardnerdenver the court reasoned that if plaintiff was permitted to file suit after binding arbitration she s hould be permitted to file suit even if she chooses not to par ticipate in the grievance process in harrison v eddy potash inc the tenth circuit found similarly that title vii claimant did not have to exhaust th grievance procedures in collective bargaining agreement20 in rejecting the employers claim of mandatory arbitration the court focused on the context in which th arbitration clause arose the court distinguished arbitration clauses contained in collective bargaining agreements from those in individual contracts while an i ndividual contract cont ains terms that were agreed upon by the employee collective bargaining agreemen t binds an employee to terms negotiated by the union thus an employee governed by an individual contract would have understood that her statutory claims we re subject to arbitration alternatively an employee governed by collective bargaining agreement would probably not have the same understanding further the court recognized that the collective bargaining agreement was not subject to the faa section 1 of the faa excludes employment contracts of seame n railroad employees and other workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce from its reach21 the tenth circuit hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30008crs5 22united food commercial workers local union 7r v safeway stores inc 889 f2d 940 10th cir 1989 23it is still unclear whether all collective bargaining agreements are excluded from the faas purview although the tenth circuit has found th faa not to be applicable to collective bargaining agreements the seventh circuit s recognized such applicability the fourth circuit also does not recognize the faa as being applicable to collective bargaining agreements 24117 f3d 519 11th cir 1997stated that 1s exclusion encompasses collective bargaining agreements22 thus the faa provided support for arbitration23 in brisentine v stone webster engineering corporation the eleventh circuit found that mandatory arbitration clause w ould not bar litigation of statutory claim unless three require ments were met24 first the employee must have agreed to arbitration in an individual c ontract that is the arbitra tion clause cannot be part of collective bargaining agreement s econd the mandatory arbitration agreement must authorize the arbitration of statutory claims as well as contractual claims third the agreement must give the employee the right to insist on arbitration thus arbitration cannot be left to the unions sole discretion brisentine alleged that stone webster denied him employment because he was unable to engage in heavy lifting or repetitive bending brisentine had been previously injured when he fell from s caffold although brisentine had not been hired by stone webster he became probationary employee subject to the collective bargaining agreement between brisentines union and stone webster when he was referred for employment the collective bargaining agreement contained provision that prohi bited discrimination on the ba sis of race sex national origin age and handicap in addition the agreement provided grievance and arbitration procedure for unfavorable re solutions after being told by labor relations manager at stone webster that he was denied employment because of his disabilities brisentine contacted the union to i nquire about filing grievance in accordance with the agreement however the union told brisentine that he should file complaint with the equal employment opportunity co mmission eeoc rather than pursue his claim through the grievance procedures because his dispute centered around his disabilities after receiving righ t to sue letter brisentine filed lawsuit alleging violation of the ada the dist rict court dismissed the case on the basis of brisentines failure to exhaust the agreements grievance procedures after reviewing the agreement the eleventh circuit concluded that the three requirements for barring litigation were not met first the grievance and arbitration clause was part of collective bargai ning agreement second although the agreement included nondiscrimination lang uage it made ex plicit reference to statutory claims further while brisentine did have the option of seeking arbitration he was told by the union to pursue his claim with the eeoc thus the third requirement was met but was not enforced while the seventh eighth tenth and eleventh circuits have followed gardnerdenver other circuits have followed gilmer and construed arbitrationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30008crs6 25146 f3d 175 177 3d cir 1998 26146 f3d at 178 27948 f2d 305 6th cir 1991 2842 f3d 1299 9th cir 1994agreements to require the arbitration of statutory claims among the circuits that have followed gilmer arbitration has been considered in the context of the securities industry in seus v john nuveen co inc the third circuit upheld the validity of an arbitration clause that require d seus former broker to ar bitrate any dispute claim or controversy that may arise between seus and her firm25 the arbitration clause appeared in registration application that seus was required to co mplete as part of her employment the application the iform application for securities industry registration or transfer commonly re ferred to as form u4 was the same application at issue in gilmer following gilmer the court noted that form u4 was among the contracts to be governed by the faa the court stated that the registration application was contract evid encing transaction in commerce rather than one of the contracts excl uded from the scope of the act26 thus the faa on its face authorized the enforcement of form u4 s arbitration clause further the court rejected seuss argument that she did not act knowingly or voluntarily when she completed the application because seus could not s how fraud duress mistake or some other ground for invalidating the agreem ent the court was compelled to require arbitration for her title vii and adea claims in willis v dean witter reynolds inc the sixth circuit upheld similarly the validity of form u4s arbitration clause27 willis an account executive was required to complete form u4 as part of her employment willis alleged that during the last two years of her employment at dean witter she was subject to hostile work environment and was forced to resign because of her sex the court maintained that form u4 was contract evidencin g transaction involving commerce rather than contract of employment that would be excluded from the faas purview thus the faa could require arbitration for williss title vii claim in prudential insurance co of america v lai the ninth circuit held that the arbitration clause in form u4 was not enforceable against two former sales representatives because they were unaware of the clause at the time they signed the registration application28 the former employees argued that at the time they completed form u4 they were told by prudential that they were simply applying to take test that was required for employ ment the former employees were never given an opportunity to read form u4 nd were not given an employment manual that contained the actual arb itration terms although the court found that the former employees title vii claims were not subject to mandatory arbitration it did state that statutory claims could be ar bitrable if an employee knowingly agrees to submit her claims to arbitrationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30008crs7 29144 f3d

discrimination and sexual harassment in violation of title vii robertson stephens contended that duffield was required under form u4 to arbitrate her claim acknowledging its decision in lai the court perceived the issue in duffield to be of greater complexity that is whether mandatory arbitra tion provision that precludes j udicial relief for statutory claims is enforceable when it is c ondition of employment in reaching its conclusion the court consider ed the legislative history of the civil rights act of 1991 cra the cra was enacted almost simultaneously with gilmer and spoke directly to the arbitration of title vii claims30 the cra provides that arbitration and other forms of alternative dispute reso lution are encouraged where appropriate and to the extent authorized by law31 after reviewing numerous congressional reports the court disc overed that congress specifically rejected proposal that would have allowed employers to enforce mandatory arbitration agreements32 further the court interpreted the language of the cra to mean that arbitration and alternative dispute resolution were appropriate only when they afforded victims of discrimination an opportunity to present th eir claims in desirable alternative forum33 the language in the cra was not meant to force an unwanted forum on claimants34 one week before issuing its decision in wright the supreme court denied an appeal by robertson stephens the c ourt made its decision without comment or dissent although duffield had argued ag ainst the appeal on numerous grounds she emphasized changes in the securities industry that would longer require arbitration for statutory claims of di scrimination for example the national association of securities dealers nasd has already amended its rules to eliminate the mandatory arbitration requirement wright v uni versal maritime service corp the supreme courts decision in wright indicated that statutory claims would not be presumed to be arbitrable absent explicit language in an arbitration agreement because the arbitration clause in wright was so vague the court concluded that it could decide against enforcin g the clause without resolving the question of

the fourth circuit affirmed the distri ct courts decision it found that an arbitration agreement does not need to speci fy every possible dispute to be binding40 the court compared wrights agreement to the mandatory arbitration rule in gilmer following gilmer the fourth circuit made similar determination that an employer does not have to provide l aundry list of potential disputes for them to be

statutory claims in this situation it remains unclear whether the union may waive judicial forum for its members while the court did articulate clear and unmistakable waiver standard for determining when statutory claims could be subject to arbitration whether the union can agree to such waiver on behalf of its members is lingering question the court stated simply that because the agreement did not specify arbitration for statutory claims there could not have been clear and unmistakable waiver of the covered employees rights to judicial forum for fede ral claims of employment discrimination43 thus the tension between coll ective representation and individual statutory rights that was discussed in both gardnerdenver and gilmer remains legislative action the enforceability of mandatory arbitra tion agreements could be addressed legislatively thereby resolving the question left unanswered by wright the civil rights procedures protecti on act has been introduced during every congress since the 103rd congress to respond to the concerns raised by mandatory arbitration agreements44 in the 107th congress s 163 was introduced on january 24 2001 by senators feingold leahy

senate banking committ ee conducted an oversight hearing on mandatory arbitrati on agreements in the securities industry47 while the committee was aware of the nasds rule change it heard testimony on the continued need for federal legislation in the securitie s industry representative markey the house sponsor of the act fear ed that the rule change would not deter securities firms from imposing individual ma ndatory arbitration contracts on their employees48 an individual contract that require s arbitration for statutory claims may be permissible under gilmer and wright such contract would be analogous to the registration application in gilmer consequently the agreement could be enforceable pursuant to the faa because the agreement would be executed between the individual employee and the em ployer there would be tension between collective representation and individual rights furt her it is likely that the clear and unmistakable waiver of judicial relief standard required by wright would be satisfied by such an agreement while the oversight hearing focused prima rily on the securities industry there was recognition of mandatory arbitration agreements being considered in other industries49 without federal legislation that gu arantees judicial relief for statutory claims employment agreements that limit an employee to arbitration are likely to be similarly enforceable in gilmer the court based its decision in part on gilmers failure to find legislative intent in the adea to preclude the enforcement of mandatory arbitration agreement without such an indication of congress intent th court concluded that mandatory arbitration agreement should be enforced interpreting gilmer the ninth circuit reviewed the legislative history of the cra and concluded that congress believed simply that arbitration was one method of resolving title vii claim the ninth circuit contended that claimants should not be forced into an unwanted forum while the ada contains language that courages the use of arbitration and other methods of alternativ dispute resolution the legi slative history of the ada indicates that judicial relief was not meant to be limited by mandatory arbitration agreement the house report accompanying the ada states that any agreement to submit disputed issues to arbitrati on whether in the context of collective bargaining agreement or in an employme nt contract does not preclude the affected person from seeking relief under the enfo rcement provisions of this act50 the house report demonstrates that there was legislative intent to preclude thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30008crs12 enforcement of mandatory arbitration agreements in such manner as to exclude resort to judicial relief nevertheless an amendment of the ada and other civil rights statutes could resolve definitively whether such an agreement may be enforced those who support arbitra tion maintain that it is fast and economical alternative to litigation pponents respond that arbitra tion denies claimants the benefits of discovery and written record of the proceedings in addition opponents also contend that arbitrators are often not trained adequately to resolve statutory claims the uncertainty that remains after wright will continue pending further case law development or action by congress
