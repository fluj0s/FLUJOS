access to tv programming background research published in june 2007 by the kaiser family foundation kff indicates that twothirds of parents say they are very concerned that children in this country are being exposed to too much in appropriate content in the media and substantial proportion think sex 55 and violence 43 in the media contribute lot to young peoples be havior thirtytwo percent of parents cite tv as the medium that concerns them the most but the proportion who cite the internet has increased over the past two years from 16 to 21 sixtysix per cent of parents say they favor government regulations to limit the amount of sex and violence on tv during the early evening hours proporti on that is virtually unchanged from 2004 although exposure to inappropr iate material has long b een concern to parents only since the telecommunications act of 19961 has there been nationwide effort to provide parents with tool to contro l their childrens television viewing the v chip2 the vchip which reads an electronic code transmitted with the television signal cable or broadcast3 is used in conjunction with television programming rating system using remote control parents can enter password and then program into the television set which ratings are acceptable and which are unacceptable the chip automatically blocks the display of any programs deemed unacceptable use of the vchip by parents is entirely optional4httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32729crs2 4 continued who themselves do not wish to view conten t they find objectionable to individuals who may be babysitting on an intermittent basis in their homes further the vchip and the television ratings are closely related to anothe r issue that of broadcast indecency and how to define and enforce the appropriate use of the public airwaves by the television media that issue is discussed in greater detail in crs report rl32222 regulation of broadcast indecency background and legal analysis by henry cohen 5 47 usc

offer vices that can work with nonvchip tv sets development of the vchip ratings system the initial ratings system was veloped during 1996 and 1997 but enc ountered criticism from within congress as well as from groups such as the national parent teacher association in response to those concerns an expanded ratings system was adopted on july 10 1997 and went into effect october 1 1997 initial ratings system the first step in implementing the mandate of the law was to create ratings system for television programs analogous to the one developed and adopted for movies by the motion picture associati on of america mpaa in 1968 the law urged the television industry to develop voluntary ratings system acceptable to the fcc and the rules for transmitting the rating within one year of enactment the ratings system is intended to convey inform ation regarding sexual violent or other indecent material about which parents shoul d be informed before it is displayed to children provided that nothing in the law s hould be construed to authorize any rating of video programming on the basis of its political or religious content after initial opposition media and entert ainment industry executives met with thenpresident clinton on february 29 1996 and agreed to develop the ratings system because of political pressure to do so many in the television industry were opposed to the vchip fearing that it woul d reduce viewership and reduce advertising revenues they also questioned whether it violated the first amendment industry executives said they would not challenge the law immediately but left the option open should they deem it necessaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32729crs3 6 the group included the national broadcast networks independent aff iliated and public television

provides strong evidence that exposure to violence in the media can increase aggressive behavior in children at least in the short term noted that although viewerinitiate d blocking and mandatory ratings would impose lesser burdens on protected speech skepticism remains that they will fully serve the governments interests in promoting parental supervision and protecting the wellbeing of minors

on sufficient number of cableconnected television sets to be considered an effective solution at this time stated that further action to enable viewerinitiated blocking ofviolent television content would rve the governments interests in protecting the wellbeing of children and facilitating parental supervision and would be reasonably likely to be upheld as constitutionalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32729crs6 found that studies and surveys monstrate that the voluntary tv ratings system is of limited effectiveness in protecting children from violent television content stated that congress could deve lop an appropriate definition of excessively violent programming but such language needs to be narrowly tailored and in conformance with judicial precedent suggested that industry could on its own initiative commit itself to reducing the amount of excessively violent programming viewed by children eg broadcasters c ould adopt family hour at the beginning of prime time during which they decline to air violent content observed that multichannel video programming providers mvpds could provide consumers greater c hoice in how they purchase their programming so that they could avoid violent programming eg an carte regime would enable viewers to buy their television channels individually or in smaller bundles and found that congress could impleme nt time channeling solution andor mandate some other form of consumer choice in obtaining video programming such as the provision by mvpds of video channels provided on family tiers or on an carte basis eg channel blocking nd reimbursement congressional action since 2003 the television industry and th fcc faced increasing scrutiny for what was perceived by many in congress as well as the public as sharp increase in the amount of indecent programming tw of the most notable events that have taken place with respect to this issue were the fccs determination that the use of the fword by

about four in ten 39 said most are not21 many parents do not understand what the various ratings guidelines mean for example 28 of parents of young children 26 years old knew what the rating tvy7 meant directed to children age 7 and older while 13 thought it meant the opposite directed to children under 7 and only 12 knew that the rating fv fantasy violence is related to violent c ontent while 8 thought it meant family viewing22 in releasing the survey results vicky rideout vice president and director of the kaiser family foundations program for the study of entertainment media and health commented while many parents ve used the ratings or the vchip too many still dont know what the ratings mean or even that their tv includes v chip23 number of groups conducted res earch and published opinion pieces questioning the usefulness andor legality of the vchip and the ratings system after the 1996 telecommunications act was enact ed eg the progress and freedom foundation the american civil liberties ion cato institute morality in media since that time opposition has waned and ev the controversie s over inappropriate content being broadcast live did not renew it further while the vchip and the ratings system can block objectionable or indecent programming when used in tandem since the incidents were broadcast live and did not have ratings that would have blocked them neither the vchip nor the ratings system would have been effective in either case therefore some could claim that the vchip and the ratings system while useful tools in many cases remain unreliable tools for parents because they cannot guarantee all objecti onable content will be blocked httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32729crs10 24 kff study p 7 25 kff study p 4 26 kff study p 6issues for congress congress may wish to consider number of possible options to support parents in monitoring and controlling their child rens access to certain programming some of these options would require only furthe r educational outreach to parents while others would require at least regu latory if not legislative action awareness of the vchip and the ratings system according the 2004 kff study parents also indicated that they would like to see the ratings displayed more prominently to make it easier to notice them such findings are consistent with lack of widespread usage or even awareness of the v chip specifically as noted above the 2004 k ff study indicated that even after years of being available only 42 of parents who have vchip and are aware of it actually use it however of the parent s that had used the vchip 89 found it somewhat to very useful24 those figures would indicate that increased knowledge of the vchip would substantially increase parents perceptions of control over their childrens television viewing one of the easiest approaches to increas ing the use of the vchip may likely be to step up parental awareness programs through for example public service announcements on television educational ma terials on the fcc website and possibly pubic service advertisements in print media additionally such educational materials could be made available on congressional member websites for constituents to download such actions would not require any new legislation or additional work by the ratings board or relate d entities however some in itially may require funding mediaspecific vs uniform ratings one of the ongoing issues related to the use of the vchip is that according to the kff study only about half of parents act ually use the television ratings that is low in comparison with the movie ratings which are used by approximately 78 of parents but in line with the use of ratings for music and video games25 n contributor to the low use of the ratings is likely that so few parents actually understand the ratings for example as st ated earlier only 12 of parents of young children knew that fv is the rating for fantasy violence further 8 believed it to mean family viewing as noted by the researchers in their report the fv rating is the only rating that denotes anything about the violent content of childrens programming one of the impetuses for the development of the ratings system in the first place finally overall 20 of pare nts had never even heard of the ratings system26 in light of those figures it could app ear that parents might prefer single unified ratings system that would be app lied across different dia however whilehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32729crs11 27 kff study p 8 28 the december 31 2006 deadline may be extended under

warrant further investigation by congress independent ratings system s and an open vchip under current legislative and regulatory mandates the vchip is only required to read the tv parental guidelines and the mpaa movie ratings this means that any independent system can only be used to augment parental knowledge not to program the vchip so while range of varied independent ratings systems can serve to provide additional in formation to parents they cannot be used with the current closed vchip technology in order for these ratings to become as useful as possible the vchip would have to be able to read them the opportunity to encourage the further development of private ratings systems exists in the transition to digital televi sion beginning in april 2005 all broadcasters must simulcast 100 percent of thei r national televisi on system committee commonly referred to as ntsc programming on their digital channel by the end of 2006 broadcasters must turn off their analog signal28 through either regulatory ie fcc or legislative ac tion television manufacturers c ould be required to install an open vchip that could be reprogrammed to read altered or even completely new ratings an open
