specialist in macroeconomics government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32274a changing natural rate of unemployment policy issues summary concept that is fundamental to unders tanding the economy is that there is an equilibrium marketclearing rate of unemployment determined by labor market characteristics policy and conditions this rate of unemployment is referred to as the natural rate or fu ll employment rate of unemployment or the nairu non accelerating inflation rate of unemploymen t although expansionary fiscal or monetary policy might be able to temporarily push unemployment below the natural rate in exchange for higher inflation eventually actual unemployment would rise back to the natural rate without inflation fa lling this concept is consistent with the view that monetary policy has longrun effect on real variables such as economic growth or unemployment and affects only pr ices in the long run if unemployment did not return to natural rate it would imply that monetary policy could permanently affect unemployment there are periods of us history when constant natural rate concept cannot explain the behavior of unemployment nd inflation for example in the 1970s inflation rose although unemployment was above estimates of th natural rate and in the 1990s inflation fell although unemployment was belo w estimates of the natural rate more sophisticated theory is needed to explain these periods since the natural rate is determined by the characteristics of the labor market it is possible that changes in the labor market lead to changes in the natural rate over time for example an aging workforce unexpectedly rapid productivity growth policy changes and growing temporary workforce are some of the factors that could have led to decline in the natural rate in th 1990s in this view at any given moment there is some natural rate of unemployment below bove which inflation will rise fall but that rate may be different from the natural rate in the past or future because of labor market changes it is estimate d that the natural rate rose during the 1970s and 1980s and fell back to earlier levels in the 1990s although there is theoretical drawback to the concept of changing natural rate economists have been unsuccessful in empirically predicting when changes would take place this leaves the theo ry open to the criticism that rather than offering meaningful explanation of the empirical record it does little more than offer post hoc rationalization for contradictory results any natural rate estimate must be accompanied by wide range of uncertainty some research suggests natural rate of 59 with 95 confidence interval of 39 to 76 yet alternative theories to the natural rate have done little better at explaining or predicting economic outcomes the unpred ictability of changing natural rate suggests that excessive weight should not be placed on the gap between actual unemployment and natural rate estimates in fiscal and monetary policy decisions the natural rate is probabl most useful to policymak ers as one of many economic indicators that can predict changes in inflation or the business cycle although changes in the natural rate have not been successfully predicte d it would be difficult to make systematic policy decisions w ithout some notion of full

plays an impor tant role in macroeconomic stabilization policy decisions this report discusses problems in estimating the natural rate the natural rate concept in the 1960s economists milton friedm an and edmund phelps independently developed the concept of natural rate of unemployment or full employment rate of unemployment or nairu nonacceleratin g inflation rate of unemployment1 they posited that there was an equilibrium marketclearing rate of unemployment determined by labor market characteristics policy and conditions this natural rate will be greater than zero since at any given point of time there will always be some people in the process of moving from one job to another and some people who are in the wrong place at the wrong time for the jobs available although expansionary

paper 8940 may 2002suffered from money illusion their wage demands were influenced by nominal instead of real price changes2 in recessions or periods of sluggish growth unemployment rises above the

decrease that occurs when the economy has been temporarily pushed be yond full employment changing natural rate cursory look at the us experience ove r the past 55 years seems to belie the existence of natural rate of unemployment as seen in table 1 over long periods of time business cycle effects should cancel out and the average unemployment rate should be close to the natural rate yet the average unemployment rate by decade has varied significantly ranging from low of 45 in the 1950s to high of 73 in the 1980s regre ssions for the period 19602000 yield constant natural rate of

milton friedman acknowledged this view in his original formulation of the theory to avoid misunderstanding let emphasize that by using the term natural rate of unemployment i do not mean to suggest

variance in actual unemployment over time as evidence that the natural rate concept is incorrect but mainstream economy theory suggests more subtle view that there is natural rate but it varies over time the natural rate is determined by labor market conditions economists reason that since labor market conditions change over time so could the natural rate4 if this were the case the unemployment rate would always return to the natural rate as the original theory suggests but at any given point in time unemployment would be reverting to unique natural rate for example natu ral rate concept

perspective the 1970s and 1980s were period of rising natural rate and the 1990s we re period of falling natu ral rate the 1990s decline caught most economists by surprise5 what could have caused the natural rate to fall in the 1990s number of theories have been advanced6 high productivity growth unit labor costs is measurement that compares the value of output to the cost of labor input by definition whenev er productivity increases more rapidly than wages unit labor costs fall lower unit labor costs increase the firms profitability thereby typically increasing the firms dema nd for labor in the late 1990s there was sudden and unexpected rise in the bor productivity growth rate from 14 in 19741995 to 25 in 19962000 it has been hypothesized that because workers cannot easily or instantaneously identify ch anges in their productivity they may have been slow to adjust their wage demands to reflect higher pr oductivity growth rates if this was the case unemployment and the natural rate would have temporarily fallen in the late 1990s as unit labor costs fell similar story can be told about longterm wage contracts under which wages would not adjust to the change in productivity until new contract was negotiated notice that this decline in the nairu would only be temporary once workers became aw are of the increase in their productivity growth rates other things being equal they would adjust their wage demands and unit labor costs would rise back to an equilibrium level removing the incentive for firms to take on more workers7 if this scenario occurred in the late 1990s labor productivity should have grown more rapidly than real worker co mpensation as can be seen in figure 2 this has been the case in only two of the past 13 years 1998 and 2000 has real compensation grown more quickly than productivity suggesting that workers did not fully incorporate actual productivity growth into their compensation demands in the short term compensation has still not cau ght up to more rapid productivity gains that began several years ago also supportive of this theory is the experience of the 1970s and 1980s just as increases in productivity growth ma temporarily reduce the nairu decreases in productivity growth may temporarily increase the nairu and indeed the apparent increase in the natural rate in the 1970s and 1980s coincided with ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32274crs5 8 the jobless recovery is discussed in more detail in section belowslowdown in productivity growth from 1949 to 1973 labor productivity grew at an average of 29 year it then slowed to an average of 14 from 1974 to 1995 the unemployment rate at the trough of the 19731975 recession was higher than the past and it remained higher relative to comparable points in past business cycles during the next two expansions and recoveries this theory does not seem consiste nt with the experience during the 2001 recession and subsequent j obless recovery however8 in this period productivity growth also rose unexpectedly rapidly ye t employment fell for 20 months after the recession had ended and fe ll 26 million from peak to trough this occurred even though productivity has continue d to grow more rapidly than real compensation since 2001 it seems that several years after th productivity spurt had first begun workers had still not completely adjusted their wa ge demands to take the productivity spurt into account the comparison is not stra ightforward however because weakness in the labor market since 2001 has held dow n compensation growth since mid2003 employment has begun to rise again but real compensation growth is still relatively modest despite continued rapid gains in productivity source bureau of labor statistics note data are for

individuals who are not working are classified as not in the labor force welf are reform may have largely affected individuals who were officially classified as not in the labor force leaving the

to have smaller effect continuedlabor market policy changes some policymakers point to changes in labor market policy in the 1990s as potential cause of the decline in the nairu for example if welfare reform increased the incentives to seek work it could have expanded the pool of labor available to employers and lowered the une mployment rate consistent with stable inflation9 whether or not policy changes have ffected the nairu it would be difficult to measure the relationship empirically policy changes cannot be easily quantified and are not conducive to econometric analysis time series analysis is problematic because onetime policy change gives th statistician only one data observation while crosssection analysis is difficult because the individuals affected by the policy change are likely to be systematically different from the rest of the population in ways that cannot be easily controlled for therefore it is difficult to say with any degree of confidence that evidence exists proving or denying the hypothesis that policy changes have had signifi cant influence on the natural rate10 demographic changes it has been noted that younger workers consistently have higher unemployment rates than older workers this could be because older workers have more experience more human capital and different preferences for employment stability this suggests that demographic shifts toward an older workforce could lower the overall unemployment rate since the proportion of older lowunemployment workers in the labor force is greater there is some evidence of this as the baby boomers were young workers in the high natural rate decades of the 1970s and 1980s but have now reached low unemployment age the percentage of workers 1624 years of age the group with the highest unemployment ra had fallen from 25 in 1978 to about 16 in 200011 economist robert murphy recal culated the 1998 unemployment rate based on population demogr aphically similar to the 1979 population this raised the unemployment rate by 06 percentage points not likely enough to account for the entire change in the natural rate wh ich may have fallen 05 20 percentage points over those years12 katz and krueger estimate th at demographic change can account for one quarter of the decline in the nairu13httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32274crs7 13 continued edmund phelps and gylfi zoega the rise and

murphy accounting for the recent decline in the nairu business economics april 1999 p33higher incarceration rates are another demographic factor that could affect the natural rate katz and kr ueger have also suggested that many young lowskill individuals who would have been unemploye d in the past are now in prison instead and not counted as part of the labor force between 1990 and 1999 the incarcerated population grew at an average rate of 57 annually resulting in doubling of the prison population over that time14 as result they estimate the nairu fell by 017 percentage points since the mid1980s rising disability claimant rates offer another explanation for why the natural rate has fallen if the disabled are more likely to be unemployed than the rest of the population more workers claiming disability could push the natural rate down the percentage of the nonelderly population claiming disability rose from 31 in 1984 to 53 in 2000 autor and duggan found that this change explained 064 percentage points of the recent fall in unemployment15 unlike some other factors driving the natural rate demographics are easily quantified and empirical correlation can be easily measured murphy points out that the timing of these explanations does not quite correspond to the fall in unemployment the demographic shift and the rising incarceration rate were both well underway in the late 1980s before ther was noticeable decline in the nairu changes in labor market matching economists often think of unemployment as part of matching process where unemployment lasts until the right worker finds the right job in this view the duration of unemployment pends on how quickly work ers can be matched with jobs that well suit their skills and desire s it has been suggested that recent developments in the labor market could ve improved the matching process thereby reducing the duration of unemployment and in turn the natural rate of unemployment these factors include th expansion of temporary employment greater regional mobility the expanding role of the internet in job seeking and generally more flexible attitude toward job switching16 while these factors may play an important role in determining the natural rate they are to varying degrees unquantifiable and therefore difficult to properly take into account in empirical estimates of the natural rate the most quantifiable factor temporary employment has been estimated to have modest effect on the natural rate federal reserve study found that temporary unemployment could explain 028 percentage points

greenspan made this point in 2004 hearing well full employment varied over time remember in the early part of the postworld war ii period the general view was that indeed 4 was the unemployment rate which was consistent w ith price stability it then altered very significantly during the 1970s and the 1980s and it has since come probably almost all the way back down to where it was in the early part of the postworld war ii period18 is this coincidence or do these eras share something in common an older population and high productivity growth rates suggest some commonality the proportion of workers age 1624 was 17 in 1960 compared with 16 in 2000 some would argue that welfare reform was reversal of the expansion of the social safety net that began with the great societ programs of the late 1960s on the other hand other factors such as the growing role of temporary employment and the internet in our labor market or rising incarceration and disability rates suggest that any similarity to the 1950s and 1960s is merely coincidental the jobless recovery could the natural rate be responsible employment fell for an unprecedented 20 months after the 2001 recession had ended one possible reason why is that the natural rate was rising during this time during period when the natural rate was rising prolonged sluggish labor market could result regardless of the state of the business cycle but because the natural rate is longrun concept it is difficult to be lieve the natural rate could have changed significantly over the past 2½ years there has not been any major change in labor market policy during that time and demographic changes are incremental if the natural rate has changed it would be part of longer trend that will not be identifiable in the near term there is another reason why the unemplo yment rate might have continued to rise for so long recently related to the natural rate concept even if the natural ratehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32274crs9 had not changed over the past 2½ years it is possible that when unemployment reached 39 in december 2000 it was further below the natural rate than suspected just as the unemployment rate can tempor arily rise above its natural rate when growth is too slow unemployment can temporarily fall below the natural rate when growth is unsustainably fast in these ci rcumstances one would expect to see rising inflation rate as wages are pushed above productivity because too many jobs are chasing too few workers few economists believed the natural rate had reached as low as 39 in 2000 but many assumed that 39 was not too far from the natural rate because there was significant upwar d pressure on inflation at that time in hindsight if the natural rate has been high er than suspected in recent years say 60 vs 50 then the prolonged increase in the unemployment rate over the 2½ years could partly be attributable to the longterm adjustment back towards the natural rate from an unsustainably low level in this case one would expect the unemployment rate to fall once the recovery became more robust but it would fall less than expected those who argue that the natu ral rate was underestima ted in the late 1990s point to the fact that the natural rate averaged 665 in the 1970s and 1980s to put that figure in perspective consider that the unemployment rate following the 2001 recession would have been considered to be full employment only attainable near the peak of the business cycle 20 years ago because the natural rate is longrun c oncept it is too soon to determine which portion if any of the recent increase in th unemployment rate is supplyside driven and which portion is demanddriven but the inflation rate is one piece of evidence to determine whether inadequate demand or change in the natural rate is currently driving the rise in unemployment if the economy was suffering from insufficient demand the inflation rate should have been falling if the unemployment rate was being driven by changes in the labor mark et inflation should be unaffected the core inflation rate which strips out volatile food and energy prices fell from 26 in 2001 to 24 in 2002 to 14 in 2003 this indicates that insufficient demand was likely to be at least part of the story be hind the rise in the unemployment rate since 2003 the unemployment rate has fallen to 51 in 2005 and below 5 in 2006 it still has not reached the lowe st point of the 1990s expansion however over the same period inflation rose to 34 in 2005 while core inflation rose to 22 this suggests that actual unemploym ent may be lower than the nairu again alternative theories although the natural rate which changes over time hypothesis is the mainstream view in economics the hypothesis is not without its critics at least four alternative explanations have been offered phillips curve can be exploited indefinitely the mainstream position that monetary policy has longterm effects on real variables such as unemployment does not specify how long it takes to get to the long term one view which esse ntially harkens back to prenairu macroeconomics argues that the effects of monetary policy are long enough lastinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32274crs10 19 see james galbraith time to ditch the nairu journal of economic perspectives vol 11 1 winter 1997 p 93 20 see robert lucas and thomas sargent eds rational expectations minneapolis university of minnesota press 1981that policymakers can essentially exploit the unemploymentinflation tradeoff known as the phillips curve indefinitely19 this view has number of shortcomings first while it may be true that higher and higher inflation rate could be traded off with lower unemployment rate for long periods of time it is not clear why this would be desirable policy outcome since people dislike high inflation particularly since larger and larger increases in inflation would be needed to achieve given reduction in unemployment as unemployment fell second it has trouble ex plaining the 1970s when inflation and unemployment rose simultaneously third the phillips curve can only be exploited indefinitely if the inflationary expectations of individuals do not change over time that is it assumes that increases in th money supply can continually pump up the economy without individuals ev er learning to predict it experience from abroad suggests that monetary stimulus ceases to have any effect on the real economy during hyperinflation because expectations do adjust monetary policy changes cannot affect unemployment if it is expected another challenge to the natural rate hypothesis comes from the opposite perspective that any change in monetary policy that is expected or predicted will have effect on the economy or the unemp loyment rate part of the rational expectations movement in the economics profession in the 1970s this conclusion is reached by assuming that individuals are always rational and well informed so that changes in the money supply instantly lead to changes in the inflation rate in this view rising inflation would not be associ ated with an unemployment rate below the nairu since the monetary change had real effect and falling inflation would not be associated with an unemploymen t rate above the nairu however the concept that the unemployment rate would always be at the natural rate unless unexpected monetary changes occurred w ould be consistent with this view20 while this view had revolutionary ffect on academic economics its empirical relevance in its purest form has been limited there is overwhelming evidence that monetary changes always have aff ected and still do affect real economic variables in the short run in direct diction to the rational expectations theory deviations from natural rate caused by inflation not labor market the natural rate is defined in terms of relationship between unemployment and inflation some economists defending th natural rate concept have argued that recent

more recent example is lauren ce ball aggregate demand and longrun unemployment brookings papers on economic activity 2 washington 1999 p191example robert gordon has argued that series of temporary factors held the inflation rate down in the mid1990s incl uding low energy medical computer and commodity prices despite the fall in unemployment below the natural rate21 however most of these prices have risen since besides the shortcoming of this argument is that there will always be some price increases below the increase in the general price level nd some above it is unlikely that the prices of goods that are falling will not be offset by those that are rising as the unemployment rate stayed below the estimated nairu for at least four years in the late 1990s the temporary factors argument became less and less convincing there was slight increase in inflation toward the end of the last expa nsion but not nearly as much as models based on constant natural rate would ve predicted others have argued that low inflation can be explained by new unwillingness by workers to demand compensation increases because of globalization eg greater foreign competition and other factors that have made markets more competitive this argument is hard to prove or dispr ove empirically since there is conclusive way to measure the competitiveness of markets over time globalizations influence on wages is thought to be limited since im ports are still small relative to gdp and have increased only gradually22 if globalization did reduce the relative wages of affected workers it would only reduce overall inflation if it were accommodated by the federal reserve which is unlikely give n that one of the feds primary goals is price stability in any case the data do not support the argument throughout the period figure 2 shows that compensation increases were small in the early 1990s but healthy from 1998 to 2000 suggesting this factor was not impor tant in the later stages of the expansion hysteresis the natural rate hypothesis suggests that because unemployment always returns to the natural rate recessi ons should have permanent effect on unemployment or the natural rate this vi ew was challenged by group of economists in the 1980s who argued that serious recessions could raise the natural rate meaning that the business cycle could have perm anent effects on unemployment23

for demographic factors by using the rate of unemployment for married males in its equations 26 note that productivity is also one of the fa ctors that has been posited as an influence on the natural rate in which case the regressions do not meet the requirement that the explanatory variables be statistically i ndependent because the variables are jointly determinedrecessions of the 1970s and 1980s24 number of explanations was devised to give it theoretical underpinnings such as the theory that sustained periods of unemployment which increased in deep recessions led to deterioration in workers skills that made them less employable the empirical evidence in the united states is not as strong as western europe nonetheless it is striking that the rise in the nairu coincided with the two deepes t recessions 19731975 and 19801982 of the postwar period the hysteresis view can be seen more as complement to the natural rate theory than an alternative with hysteresis there is still natural rate at any given time and inflation will rise fall if unemployment is below above it hysteresis stipulates that the business cycle is another factor that can change the natural rate in the purest sense however hysteresis does contradict th natural rate view that monetary policy through its effect on the business cy cle has permanent effect on the unemployment rate measuring the natural rate in practice how the natural rate is theoretically conceptualized and how it is empirically estimated are quite different most empirical estimates do not use the conceptual approach discussed in this report they do not define the natural rate in terms of labor market conditions and then try to estima how much each condition contributes to changes in the natural rate over time as discussed bove one reason why this approach would not be fruitful is that many of the factors cannot be easily quantified one approach to estimating the natural rate taken by cbo for example is based on the approach descri bed above of explaining ch anges in the inflation rate econometrically and ignoring th labor market factors that would change the natural rate25 besides unemployment cbo lets the inflation rate be influenced by past inflation productivity growth food and ener gy prices and price controls for the early 1970s26 the notion is that the unemploymentinflation relationship will not hold in the presence of supply shock but if shocks are controlled for stable unemploymentinflation relationship can be identified unfortunately supply shocks are not always readily identifiable but

for married men it then estimates an overall nairu which varies over time because of demographic changes although cbos estimate has high goodness of fit by measures like the rsquared and tstatistic constant nairu will diverge from actual experience over short periods of time for example it does poor job explaining why inflation did not rise when unemployment was percentage point below the cbo nairu estimate in the late 1990s27 gordon uses similar estimation method nd similar control variables to cbo but allows his estimate of the nairu to vary from year to year unlike cbos nairu for married men28 after estimating the causes of inflation natural rate can be backed out of the equation in any give n year by holding other factors constant the estimate of the natural rate varies from year to year because it includes the equations error term gordon then limits how much the natural rate can vary to smooth the annual fluctuations out it should be stressed that gordons nairu varies only because the actual data vary in ways that gordon does not attempt to explain the smoothness of the changes in the nairu is imposed by gordons model it is not derived from the data critic of the nairu concept could argue that rather than proving that there is varying nairu gordon has demonstrated that actual unemployment changes unexpectedly to such an extent that the nairu concept is not useful29 barnes and olivei hypothesize that unemployment is only an important determinant of inflation when unemployment is unusually high or low they use an approach similar to cbo with the modification that observations where unemployment is outside of their inte rval of 475 are separated from observations within the interval their results show that the effect of unemployment on inflation is much larger and statistically significant when unemployment is outside the interval the drawback to this method is that the observations outside the interval are not randomly distributed across the sample they are mostly limited to the mid 1960s mid 1970s and early 1980s thus th eir method still leaves unanswered the question of why the unemploymentinfla tion tradeoff only broke down

within the interval notably the 1970s and late 1990s narrower band would have reduced this problem30 grants estimate of the natu ral rate is funda mentally different than the other three models discussed here because his natural rate estimate is not based on the empirical relationship between unemploym ent and inflation this avoids the problem of controlling for inflation induced by supply shocks but somewhat changes the meaning of the natural rate he first estimates output gaps by calculating the difference between actual gdp and trend gdp which he constructs using various statistical techniques he then calculates natural rate of unemployment by regressing unemployment on his output gap m easure and allows the natural rate to vary over time like gordon this approach can be criticized on the grounds that it does not offer any theoretical explanation fo r why the natural rate would be changing over time it only changes because of variati on in the actual data some of his results are questionable because they show the nairu lowest in the 1970s and highest in the 1990s31 useful concept for policymaking the natural rate concept is often acco mpanied with enough qualifiers that on the one hand it becomes difficult to refute empirically and on the other hand may arguably limit its practical value the qualif iers include 1 because of business cycle fluctuations actual unemployment will rarely if ever equal the natural rate 2 the natural rate can change unpredictably over time and 3 the relationship between the natural rate and inflation will not hold when other factors that also influence inflation are present the third qualifier is more problematic than it may first appear when one considers that the natural rate is defined in terms of its relationship to inflation empirically these qualifiers mean that there is straightforward test to compare the merits of the argument natural rate of unemployment does not exist to the argument natural rate of unemployment exists but because it changes unpredictably it cannot be id entified until after the fact the methods for estimating the nairu described above are essentially backwardlooking because they by and large do not identify the fundamental labor market sources of changes in the natural rate they cannot predict how the nairu will change in the future this was the case with the apparent fall in the natural rate in the late 1990s which took most economists by surprise this is problematic for policymakers it implies that at any given point they cannot distinguish whether movement in unemployment is caused by the business cycle and should be counteracted with stabilization policy or by change in the natural rate and should not be counteracted with policy if th fed had

time it could have unnecessarily tightened monetary policy in the 1990s cutting short an expansion that never resulted in significantly rising inflation likewise orphanides and w illiams blame much of the stagflation of the 1970s on the feds failure to recognize the natural rate had risen which led it to keep policy too loose32 on the other hand attempts to systema tically identify changing labor market characteristics in order to predict changes in the natural rate beforehand are likely to prove frustrating since as di scussed above many of the characteristics thought to be important change infrequently resulting in dearth of observations for statistical analysis and are difficult to quantify for that reason explanations based on this approach are open to the criticism of post hoc ergo propter hoc rationalization deducing causation by identifying correlation after the fact and may therefore also fail to forecast changes in the nairu accurately staiger stock and watson argue that while statistically significant nairu can be estimated the margin of error is too broad for the concept to be of much practical use to policymakers33 for example in the first quarter of 1994 they estimate nairu of 59 using the cons umer price index cpi with 95 confidence interval of 39 to 7634 for policymaking their findings suggest that the fed for example could be certain that policy should tightened only when unemployment was below 39 controlling fo r the other factors in the estimation and eased when unemployment was above 7635 by way of comparison unemployment never exceeded 63 in the r ecent recession if the fed had based its policy decisions on the criteria of statistical significance monetary easing would have been undertaken to counteract the recession assuming the nairu had not greatly changed since 1994 if the core cp i is used the confidence interval narrows little to range of 45 to 69 but the interval is arguably still too wide for meaningful policymaking despite its shortcomings the natural rate of unemployment is arguably concept so deeply ingrained in economic policymaking that it would be difficult to imagine how to formulate policymaking wit hout it decisions

are fundament ally based on the notion th at the economy is above or below full employment respectively full employment in turn is primarily determined by comparing the actual unemployment rate to an estimate of the natural rate as mankiw and ball argue few economists would deny that shifts in aggregate demand such as those driven by monetary policy push inflation and unemployment in opposite directions at least in the short run that is all one needs to believe to accept the nairu concept36 the alternative to giving preeminence to the natural rate in policymaking decisions would be to demote the natural rate to one among ma ny economic variables in attempting to predict the present and future course of economic activity37 rather than target the unknown natural rate of unemployment policymakers can target sustainable economic growth using an estimate of the natural rate as one variable to help determine sustainability even for st rict inflation targeters who subordinate economic stabilization to price stability natural rate would be useful if it as one of many variables can help predic t the future course of inflation38 based on past experience it can be argued that other indicators such as the capacity utilization rate do better job predicting future economic activity than the natural rate particularly since changes in the natural rate are not easily identified39 nevertheless some of these better predictors are not as co mprehensively or well grounded in economic theory as the natural rate increasing the likelihood that their past predictive capabilities were simply coincidental even if the natural rate is relegated to one of many indicators of fully employed ec onomy without the concept of the economy moving above or below full employment it does not seem clear how decisions to change macroeconomic stabilization policy could be made
