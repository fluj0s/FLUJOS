summarizes its legislative history discusses some key policy issues it raises and describes legislation in the 110th congress to modify or extend it the report will be updated as needed the research tax credit which has ne ver been permanent provision of the federal tax code is due to expire at th end of 2009 since its enactment in mid 1981 the credit has been extended 13 times and significantly modified five times while the credit is often thought of as si ngle unified credit it actually consists of five discrete credits for the 2008 tax year 1 regular credit 2 an alternative incremental credit airc 3 an alternative simplified credit asic 4 basic research credit and 5 an energy research credit the research tax credit seeks to boost bus iness rd investment by reducing the aftertax cost to firms of undertaking qua lified research beyond base amount key factor shaping the efficacy of the cred it is the sensitivity of firms to changes in the cost of rd although most analysts and lawmakers support the use of research tax credits to generate more business rd investment the design of the current credit has been target of some criticism critics contend that the credit is not as effective as it should be because of certain flaws in its design at least 12 bills to extend the credit permanently have been introduced in the 110th congress s 14 s 41 s 592 s 833 s 2209 s 2884 hr 1712 hr 2138 hr 2734 and hr 5105 hr 5681 and hr 5917 five of the measures s 41 s 2209 s 2884 hr 1712 and hr 5681 would also replace the regular credit airc and asic with new simplified credit on may 21 2008 the house approved b ill hr 6049 that would extend the research tax credit along with variety of other expired or expiring tax benefits through the end of 2008 and offset the cost of the extensions consideration of the measure in the senate was hampered by disagreement between republicans and democrats over whether and how to offset the revenue cost of the measure the senate passed an am ended version of hr 6049 on ptember 23 that would extend the same set of tax benefits it would retroactively extend the research tax credit through 2009 as well as raise the rate for the asic from 12 to 14 and repeal the airc for 2009 only only part of the cost of the extensions would be offset the credit ended up being extended retr oactively through 2009 as part of massive bill hr 1424 pl 110343 aimed at stabilizing and reviving financial markets in addition the new law increas the rate for the asic from 12 to 14 and abolishes the airc for the 2009 tax year only

72research and experimentation tax credit current status and selected issues for congress introduction economists may be notorious for their disagreements on variety of important policy issues notable examples include the longterm economic effects of large permanent tax cuts the impact of illegal immigration on domestic wages and the best way to achieve price stability full employment and greater income equality but on the issues of the impact of tec hnological innovation on economic growth in the long run and the proper role of public policy in the development of new technologies there is rela tively little discord among prac titioners of what some call the dismal science most economists would agree that t echnological innovation has accounted for major share of longterm growth in real percapita income in the united states1 it is fair to ask what economists mean by technological innovation after all such complex idea can have different m eanings among different professions economists who study the dynamics of ec onomic growth generally see innovation as convoluted and uncertain process that embraces the acquisition of new scientific and technical knowledge and its application to the development of new goods and services or methods of pr oduction through research and experimentation learning bydoing and learningbyusing often play crucial roles in this process in economies dominated by competitive markets technological innovation is driven by the unrelenting efforts of compe ting firms to gain sustain or reinforce decisive competitive advantage by being the first to introduce or use new or improved products or services more efficien t production processes or more effective strategies for management marketing nd promotion and customer service and support private investment in research and development rd serves as the lifeblood of innovation most economists would also agree that private rd investment is likely to be less than would be warranted by its economic benefits the reason for this shortfall lies in the nature of these benefits firm s generally cannot capture all the returns to their rd investments even in the pres ence of patents trademarks and other instruments of intellectua l property protection and th eir strict enforcement numerous studies have found that the av erage social returns to private rdhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31181crs2 2 see for example edwin mansfield mic roeconomics of technological innovation in the positive sum strategy ralph landau and nathan ro senberg eds washington national academy press 1986 pp 307325 and john c williams and charles i jones measuring the social return to rd quarterly journal of economics vol 113 4 november 1998 pp 11191135 3 for brief discussion of these channels s ee bronwyn h hall the private and social returns to research and development in technology rd and the economy bruce l r smith and claude barfield eds washington brookings institution and american enterprise institute 1996 pp 140141 investments greatly exceed the average private returns2 this finding holds true whether firm invests in research projects narrowly focused on its existing lines of business or in research projects aimed at extending the boundaries of knowledge in particular scientif ic disciplines in ways that have obvious or immediate commercial applications economists refer to any excess of social over private returns as the spillover effects or external benefits of rd th ere are several channe ls through which the returns from innovation may elude full captu re by the innovating firms and spill over to society at large among the most common channels are reverse engineering by competing firms migration of senior research scientists and engineers from one firm to another and the availa bility of new or newly impr oved goods and services at prices lower than those most consumers would be willing to pay3 when filtered through the lens of conve ntional economic theory th external benefits of technological innovation take on the appearan ce of market failure in which too few resources are allocated to the activities leading to the discovery and commercial development of new technical knowledge nd knowhow to remedy this failure most economists advocate the adoption of public policies aimed at boosting or supplementing private investment in rd especially those investments likely to generate relatively large external benefits such as basic research partly in an effort to stimulate increased private rd investment the federal government supports rd in variety of di rect and indirect wa ys direct support comes mainly in the form of research pe rformed by federal agencies and federal grants for basic and applied research nd development intende d to support concrete policy goals such as protecting the natural environment exploring outer space advancing the treatment of deadly diseas and strengthening the national defense indirect support is more diffuse the ch ief sources are federal funding of higher education in engineering and the natural sciences legal protection of intellectual property rights special allowances under antitr ust law for joint research ventures and tax incentives for business rd investment federal tax law offers two such in centives 1 deduction for qualified research spending under section 174 of the internal revenue code irc and 2 nonrefundable tax credit for qualified research spending above base amount under irc section 41 known as the research nd experimentation re tax credit the research tax credit the rd tax credit or the credit for increasing research activities the deduction has been permanent provisi on of the irc since it was first enacted in 1954 its main advantages are that the deduction simplifies

rate of 0 similar policy objective undergirds the research tax credit which has been temporary provision of the irc since it went into effect in july 1981 the credit is intended to s timulate more business rd investment than would occur in the absence of the credit by lowering the aftertax cost of qualified research4 but unlike the deduction it complicates tax compliance for firms claiming the credit in fy2007 the combined budgetary cost of these incentives totaled an estimated 155 billion or 111 of the estimated 1391 billion spent on federal defense and nondefense rd that year5 this report examines the current status of the re tax credit describes its legislative history discusses some important policy issues raised by it and identifies legislative proposals in the 110th congress to extend the credit or enhance its incentive effect it will be updated to reflect significant legisla tive activity and other developments affecting the status of the credit design of the current re tax credit although the research tax credit often is t hought of as single unified credit it has five discrete components regular research credit an alternative incremental research credit or airc an alternative simplified incremental credit or asic basic research credit and credit for ener gy research each is nonrefundable and with the exception of the airc each is due to expire at the end of 20096 in any tax year business taxpayers may claim more than the basic and energy research credits plus one of the following the regular credit the airc or the asic to prevent business taxpayers from receiving two tax benefits for the same expenditures any research tax credit claimed must be subtracted from the amount of qualified research expenses deduc ted under irc section 174 qualified research expenditures ultimately claims for the regular credit as well as the airc and asic rest on the definition of qualified resear ch expenditures qres there are two critical aspects to this definition one aspect deals with the nature of qualif ied research itself under irc section 41d research must satisfy four criteria in order to qualify for the regular airc and asic credits first it must involve activities that qualify for the deduction under irc section 174 which is to say that th activities must be experimental in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31181crs4 7 see the discussion of concerns raised by the current definition of qualified research in the unsettled and ambiguous definition of qua lified research section of this reportlaboratory sense and aimed at the development of new or improved product or process second the research must be intended to discover information that is technological in nature third it should seek to gain new technical knowledge that is useful in the development of new or improved business component which is defined as product process computer so ftware technique formula or invention to be sold leased licensed or used by the firm performing the research and fourth the research must entail process of ex perimentation aimed at the development of product or process with new or impr oved function performan ce or reliability or quality the third and four th tests were added by the tax reform act of 1986 according to irc section 41d3 resear ch meets the four criteria if it seeks to develop new or improved function for business component or to improve the performance reliability or quality of bus iness component by contrast research fails to meet these criteria if its main purpose is to modify business component according to style taste cosmetic or seasonal design factors business taxpayers the courts and the irs have clashed repeatedly over the application of the four crite ria for qualified research lthough the irs issued final regulations clarifying the definition of qualified research in december 2003 td 9104 further disputes between business ta xpayers and the irs over what activities qualify for the credit appear unavoidable7 irc section 41d4 identifies activities for which the credit may not be claimed specifically the credit does not pply to research conducted after the start of commercial producti on of business component research done to adapt an existing business component to specific cu stomers needs or requirements research related to the duplication of an existin g business component surveys and studies related to data coll ection market research production efficiency quality control and managerial techniques resear ch to develop computer soft ware for firms internal use except as allowed in any regulations issued by the irs research conducted outside the united states puerto rico or any other us possession research in the social sciences arts or humanities and research funded by another entity the second critical aspect of the defi nition of qres concerns the expenses eligible for the credit under irc section 41b1 qualified expenses arise from both inhouse research and cont ract research in the case of inhouse research the regular airc and asic credits apply to the wages and salaries of employees and supervisors engaged in qualified research as well as the cost of materials supplies and leased computer time used in this research in the case of contract research the three credits apply to the full amount paid for qualified research conducted by certain small firms colleges and universities and federal laboratories 75 of payments for qualified research performed by certain res earch consortia and 65 of payments for qualified research performed by other nonprofit entities dedicat ed to scientific researchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31181crs5 8 us office of technology assessment the effectiveness of research and experimentation tax credits washington 1995 p 29 9 for variety of reasons which will be discussed in later section of the report the actual or effective rate of the credit is much lower than 20 10 available studies indicate that the price elasticity of demand for rd ranges from 02 to 20 which means that 1 reduction in th cost of rd woul d raise rd spending between 02 and 2 11 in other words the expenses against which the regular research credit may be claimed can equal more than 50 of total qres in given tax year 12 the definition of startup firm has changed few times since the research credit was enacted presently it denotes firm that record ed gross receipts and qres in tax year for the first time after 1993it is useful to understand which expe nses related to r d investments are ineligible for the credits specifically th ey do not apply to spending on depreciable assets used in qualified research such as buildings and equipment overhead expenses for such research eg heating electricity rents leasing fees in surance and property taxes and the fringe benefits of research personnel the exclus ion of these expenses can have important implications for the incentive effect of the credit more on this later excluded expenses may account fo r 27 to 50 of business rd spending8 regular research credit the regular research tax credit has been extended 13 times and significantly modified five times under irc section 41a1 it is equal to 20 of firms qres beyond base amount such an incrementa l design is intended to encourage firms to spend more on rd than they otherwise would by lowering the aftertax cost to business taxpayers of inves ting in qualified research above some normal amount by as much as 209 given that business rd investment appears sensitive to its cost decline in the aftertax cost of rd should spur rise in business rd investment all other things being equal10 the base amount for the regular credit seems designed to approximate the amount firm would spend on qualified resear ch in the absence of the credit as such the base amount can be viewed as firms normal or pref erred level of rd investment two rules govern the calcula tion of the base amount under irc section 41c first it must be equa l to 50 or more of firms qres in tax year rule that some refer to as the 50percent rule11 second the base amount depends on whether the business taxpayer is considered an established firm or startup firm established firms are defined as firms with gross receipts and qres in three or more of the tax years from 1984 through 1988 star tup firms by contrast are defined as firms whose first tax year with both gr oss receipts and qres occurred after 1983 or firms that had fewer than three tax ears from 1984 to 1988 with both gross receipts and qres12 the base amount for all firms tablished or start up is the product of fixedbase percentage and average annual gross receipts in the previous four tax years an established firms fixedbase percentage is the ratio of its total qres to total gross receipts in 1984 to 1988 capped at 16 by contrast startup firms fixedbase percentage is set at 3 during the firms first five tax years with spendinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31181crs6 on qualified research and gross receipts th ereafter the percentage gradually adjusts to reflect firms actual experience so that by its eleventh tax year the percentage equals the firms total qres relative to its total receipts in the fifth through tenth tax years in general the lower firms fixedbase percentage the better its chances of claiming the regular credit and firm can expect to benefit from the regular credit if its ratio of qres in the current tax ear to average annual gross receipts in the previous four tax years is greater than its fixedbase percentage see table 1 for calculation

firms investing in qualified research that are unable to claim the regular credit have the option of claiming the alternative incremental re tax credit or airc under irc section 41c4 however decision to claim the airc does have consequences for future tax years and it will not be available in the 2009 tax year when firm elects the airc in particular tax year it must continue to do so in future tax years unless the firm receives permission from the irs to switch to another research credit there is some c oncern that such rule deters firms from claiming the airc even though they may be better off doing so the definition of qres for the airc is th same as the definition of qres for the regular credit but that is where the similarity between the two credits ends unlike the regular credit which is equal to 20 of qres in excess of base amount the airc is equal to 3 of firms qres above 1 but less than 15 of its average annual gross receipts in the previous four tax years plus 4 of its qres above 15 but less than 20 of its average annual gro ss receipts in the previous four tax years plus 5 of its qres greater than 20 of its average annual gross receipts in the previous four tax years in general firms can benefit from the airc if their qres in the current tax year exceed 1 of their average annual gross recei pts during the past four tax years in addition the airc is likely to be of greater benefit than the regular credit to business taxpayers with relatively high fixedbase pe rcentages or whose research spending is declining or whose sales are growing much faster than their research spending see table 1 for calculation of the airc for hypothetical established firm and table 2 for calculation of the airc fo r hypothetical startup firm httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31181crs8

research credit firms base period is the three tax years preceding the firs t year in which it had gross receipts after 1983 the base amount is equal to the sum of firms minimum basic research amount and its maintenanceofeffort amount in the base period the former is the greater of 1 of the firms average annual inhouse and contract re search expenses during the base period or 1 of its total contract research expenses during the base period for firm claiming the basic research credit its minimum basic research amount cannot be less than 50 of the firms basic research payments in the

above 50 of its average qr in the three previous tax years this rate will rise to 14 for the 2009 tax year onl if taxpayer has qres in any of those years then the credit is equal to 6 of its qres in the current tax year as with the airc decision to claim the asic remains in effect for succeeding tax years unless taxpayer gains the consent of the irs to claim another research credit basic research credit firms that enter into contracts with certain nonprofit organizations to perform basic research may be able to claim tax credit for some of their expenditures for this purpose under irc section 41e prima ry aim of the credit is to foster collaborative research between us firms and colleges and universities the credit is equal to 20 of total payments for qua lified basic research above base amount which is known as the qualif ied organization base period amount this amount has little in common with the base amount for the regular re tax credit except that both amounts seem intended to approximate what firms would spend on qualified research in the absence of such credits13 for the purpose of the credit basic research is defined as any original investigation for the advancement of sc ientific knowledge not having specific commercial objective httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31181crs10 the credit does not apply to qualified ba sic research done outside the united states or to basic research in the social sciences arts or the humanities in addition the basic research credit app lies only to payments for qualified basic research performed under written contr act by the following organizations educational institutions nonprofit scientific research organizations excluding private foundations and certain gran tgiving organizations firms conducting their own basic research may not claim the credit for their expenditures for this purpose but the spendi ng can be included in their qres for the regular credit airc or asic in addition basic research payments eligible for the credit that fall below the base amount are tr eated as contract re search expenses and may be included in the qres for any of those credits energy research credit under irc section 41a3 business taxpayers may claim tax credit equal to 20 of payments to certain entities for energy research to qualify for the credit the payments must be made to nonprofit organization exempt from taxation under irc section 501a and organized and operated prima rily to conduct energy research in the public interest in addition at leas t five discrete entitie s must contribute funds to the organization for energy research in calendar year none of these entities may account for more than half of total paymen ts to the organization for such research the credit also applies to the full amount ie 100 of payments to colleges and universities federal laboratories and certain small firms for energy research performed under contract in the case of small firms performing this research business taxpayer may claim credit fo r the full amount of payments under two conditions only first the taxpayer canno t own 50 or more of the stock of the small firm performing the res earch if the firm is cor poration or 50 or more of the small firms capital and profits if the firm is noncorporate entity such as partnership second the firm performing th research must have an average of 500 or fewer employees in one of th two previous calendar years because the credit is flat rather than incremental it is more generous than the other four components of the research tax credit legislative history of the research tax credit the research tax credit entered the tax code as temporary provision through the economic recovery tax ac t of 1981 pl 9734 in adopting the credit the 97th congress was looking for ways to stem decadelong decline in spending on rd by the private sector as share of us gross domestic product that commenced in the late 1960s around the time the credit was acted more than few analysts thought the decline contributed to slowdown in us productivity growth and surprising loss of competitiveness by variety of u s industries in the 1970s majority in congress concluded that substantial tax credit for incremental research and experimental expenditures was needed to overcome the reluctance of many ongoinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31181crs11 14 us congress joint

average spending on such research in the three previous tax years or 50 of currentyear spending whichever was greater it is not clear from the historical record why statutory rate of 25 was chos but there is evidence that the rate was chosen on the basis of rigorous assessment of the gap between private and social returns to business rd investment or the sensitivity of rd expenditures to declines

december 31 1988 and folded it into the general business credit under irc section 38 thereby subjecting it to yearly cap in addition the act lowered the credits statutory rate to 20 modified the

in the regular credit through the omnibus budget r econciliation act of 1989 obra89 pl 101 239 much of the disappointment stemme d from the formula for determining the base amount of the credit critics rightly pointed out that under the formula which was based on threeyear moving average of firms annual spending on qualified research an increase in firms research spending in one year would increase its base amount in each of the following three years by onethird of that increase in research spending making it more difficult to claim the credit in those three years some argued that such design would be less costeffective in boosting business rd investment than one in which firms base amount was indepe ndent of its current spending on qualified research17 to address this concern obra89 change d the formula for the base amount so that it was equal to the greater of 50 of firms currentyear qres or the product of the firms average annual gross r eceipts in the previous four tax years and fixedbase percentage the act set this percentage equal to the ratio of firms total qres to total gross receipts in the four tax years from 1984 to 1988 capped at 16 obra89 also made the credit available on more favorable terms to startup firms which it defined as firms without gr oss receipts and qres in three of the four years from 1984 to 1988 these firms were assi gned fixedbase percentage of 3 in addition the act effectively extended the credits to d ecember 31 1990 by requiring that qres incurred before ja nuary 1 1991 be prorated permitted firms to apply the regular credit to qres related both to current lines of business and possible future lines of business and required firms claiming the regular and basic research credits to reduce any deduction they claim under irc

credits were about to expire the cycle comme nces when congressional and business supporters of the credit issue public statements calling for permanent extension of the credits and denouncing what they see as the folly of repeated temporary extensions18 then the president in office when the cycle begins expresses backing for such an extension in the next stage of the cycle lead ers in both houses of congress enter into negotiations on tax legislation that includes permanent extension of the credit but in the end congress and the president can agree only on relatively short extension of the credit stymied by the difficulty of reconciling the revenue cost of permanent extension with their other budget priorities effectiveness of the research tax credit for analysts and lawmakers alike the most important policy issue raised by the research tax credit concerns how effective it has been in the more than 25 years of its existence there are two basic approaches to assessing the credits effectiveness among economists the preferred approach is to compare the social benefit from any added rd stimulated by the credit with the social cost of that rd such an ambitious undertaking involves comparing th returns to society of the additional rd spending spurred by the credit with the opportunity costs to society of the resources represented by this added rd the social cost of the credit can be thought of as the net loss of tax revenue because of the credit and the public and private costs of administering the credit unfortunately this approach to assessing the effectiveness of the research tax credit is of limited usefulness in policymaking largely because it is exceedingly difficult to measure accurately the social returns to rd19 as result economists ve tended to rely on less sweeping and rigorous approach estimating the additional rd if any stimulated by the regular credit and comparing the value of that rd with the tax revenue lost because of the credithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31181crs15 20 this argument assumes that government res earch grants to the private sector do not lead firms receiving the grants to reduce th eir own rd spending by similar amounts 21 see bronwyn h hall effectiveness of research and experimentation tax credits critical literature review and research design report prepared for the office of technology assessment june 15 1995 pp 1113 available at httpelsaberkeleyedu bhhallpapersbhh9520otartaxpdf 22 ibid p 18such an approach examines the direct benefits ie added rd investment and costs revenue loss of the regular credit it presupposes that the social returns to rd far exceed the private returns and that the optimal size of any tax subsidy for rd can be estimated the approach also sheds light on another policy issue raised by research tax credits namely whether they are more costeffective than direct research subsidies such as government grants or subsidized loans if the added rd stimulated by the regular credit were to ex ceed its revenue cost then case could be made that research tax credit is mo re costeffective wa to boost overall rd investment than direct research subsidies but if the revenue cost of the regular credit were greater than the added rd it engenders then one can argue that direct research subsidies are more costeffectiv than tax subsidies in boosting overall rd investment20 what do existing studies of the regular cr edits effectiveness say about its direct benefits and costs for the most part thes studies are an exerci in counterfactual analysis they attempt to answer the following question how much more rd did firms claiming the credit perform as result of the credit researchers use variety of methods to estimate the amount of rd that can be attributed to the regular credit these methods were examined in 1995 study by economist bronwyn hall21 she found that studies based on data from 1981 to 1983 differed markedly from those based on data from 1984 and afte r more specifically she found that the earlier set of studies produced lower estimates of th additional rd undertaken per dollar of the credit than the estimates produced by the later set of studies in light of the strengths and weaknesses of both sets of studies hall concluded that the credit contributed to dollarfordollar incr ease in reported rd spending on the margin22 this meant that each dollar of th credit stimulated an additional dollar of business rd investment in theory the credit stimulates increased business rd investment by lowering the aftertax cost of undertaking anothe r dollar of rd beyond some normal or base amount it is reasonable to expect firms investing in rd to respond to this reduction in cost by spending more on rd all other things being equal so the critical considerations in estimating the am ount of business rd investment that is due to the credit are the responsiveness of business rd investment to decreases in its aftertax cost and the extent to which the credit lowers the aftertax cost of business rd relatively little research has been done on how responsive business rd investment is to changes in its aftertax cost the standard measure of this sensitivity is known as the price elasticity of rd mand existing studies have come up with estimates of the longrun price elasticity ranging from 02 to 20 these resultshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31181crs16 23 us congress joint committee on taxation description of revenue provisions contained in the presidents fiscal year 2004 budget proposal joint committee

of the president bushs fy2004 budget proposal the joint tax committee noted that the general consensus when assumptions are made with respect to research expenditures is that the price elasticity of research is less than 10 and may be less than 0523 as the main findings of bronwyn lls 1995 study cited above suggest less uncertainty surrounds the extent to which th regular credit shrinks the aftertax cost of qualified research basi cally one dollar of the credit reduces this cost by one dollar by making such credit available the federal government or us taxpayers effectively shares the cost of qualified research with the private firms financing it thus measure of the overall reduction in the aftertax cost of domestic business rd investment as result of the credit is the credits average effective rate which is measured as the ratio of the total amount of claims for the credit in year to some measure of domestic business rd spending such as qres this rate can be computed for both qr and total business rd spending as table 3 shows the average effective rate of the credit from 1997 to 2005 was 33 for industrial rd spending and 53 for qr these rates indi cate that the credit has lowered the aftertax cost of domestic business rd by about 3 and the after tax cost of qualified research by slightly more than 5 the gap between the rates largely reflects the differences between qres and industry rd spending as estimated by the national scie nce foundation nsf aggregate qres amounted to 63 of ggregate business rd spending from 1997 to 2005 the nsf estimate pertains to all domestic rd performed by firms and funded by industry and other nonfederal tities it is based on annual surveys of rd in industry and covers the wages sa laries and fringe benefits of research personnel and the cost of materials and supplies overhead expenses and depreciation related to research activities the estimate excludes expenditures on plant and equipment used in research24 by contrast qres represent total spending on qualified research that is eligible for the credit they are reported on the tax returns business taxpayers claiming the credit and cover wages and salaries materials and supplies leased computer time and 65 to 75 of contract research funded by these entities given the differences between the two sources one would expect industry rd spending to be greater than qres as it covers broader segment of rd expenses than qres what can be said about the impact of the regular credit on domestic rd the figures in table 3 indicate that the credit delivered more than modest stimulus to domestic business rd investment fro m 1997 to 2005 sp ecifically assuminghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31181crs17 that the price elasticity of demand for rd falls between 05 and 10

most policy analysts and lawmakers endor the use of tax incentives to spur increased domestic business rd investment yet the current research tax credit seems to attract more criticism than praise major concern of critics is that the credit is not as effective as it should be because of what they say are flaws in its design in their view the credit will have its intended benefits only if these flaws are corrected critics blame what they claim is the credits relatively weak incentive effect on five shortcomings in particular 1 the credit is not permanent provision of the irc 2 it still has

period5 the credit is not targeted at rd investments that generate greater social returns than private returns each problem is examined below lack of permanence the research tax credit is due to expire on december 31 2009 several proposals to extend it permanently are bein g considered in the current congress step that the bush administration supports the credit has never been permanent provision of the irc despite repeated attempts in congress to extend it permanently in the past decade25 in fact the credit has been extended 13 times most recently by the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 this lack of permanence is matter of concern to many because it is thought to weaken the credits incentive effect many rd projects have planning horizons extending beyond few years if busine ss managers cannot count on receiving the credit over the expected life of an rd project then they are unlikely to take it into account when setting the size of annual rd budgets in such situation the credit would have little or influence over rd investment decisions defeating its purpose instead of boosting rd inves tment temporary rd tax credit might end up restraining it by compounding the uncertainty that characterizes projected aftertax returns on planned rd investments this heightened uncertainty may deter managers from pursuing rd projects th ey would be likely to undertake if the credit were permanent however there are reasons to think that not all firms investing in rd may be affected in the same way by temporary research tax credit firms with relatively long rd planning horizons and relativel high fixed costs for rd investment might show more sensitivity to uncertainty in the availability of research tax credit than firms with shorter horizons and more flexible investment costs for example it is conceivable though hard to prove that string of temporary credits could cause pharmaceutical firms to expand their research budgets at slower rate than software firms for the simple reason that pharmaceutical rd projects on average have longer planning horizons and require greater initial investments in plant and equipment than do software rd projects weak and uneven incentive effects critics maintain that anot her major flaw in the credit can be found in its incentive effect in their view this ffect varies among fi rms conducting qualified research in ways that are not supporte d by economic theory and undermines the credits purpose the credits incentive effect is also thought to be too weak to induce the increases in business rd investment warranted by its social returns critics attribute these shortcomings to the design of the regular airc asic and basic research components of the credithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31181crs19

marginal effective rate of the credit on rd spending above the base amount by 50uneven incentive effect the regular credits incentive effect appears to vary widely among firms investing in qualified research including those that gradually increase their rd investment over an extended period evidence for such variation can be found in 1996 study by economist william cox of firms that examined which of large group of domes tic corporations with sizable research budgets in 1994 should have be able to claim the regular research tax credit the study is based on sample of 900 public ly traded usbased firms with the largest rd budgets culled from database ma intained by compustat inc on the plausible assumption that qr for these firms in 1994 were equal to 70 of their reported rd spending cox estimated that 625 of the firms could be considered established firms for the purpose of claimin g the regular research tax credit because they had both business revenue and qres in three of the years from 1984 to 1988 the remainder were treated as startup fi rms cox found that 78 of the 900 firms in the sample 444 of the established fi rms and 335 of the startup firms could have claimed the credit in 1994 while 22 could have claimed credit 18 of established firms and 4 of startup firms26 he also found that 34 of all firms 323 of established firms nd 17 of startup firms d qres greater than their base amounts but less than twice those amount s allowing them to claim credits with marginal effective rate of 13 and that 438 of all firms had qres greater than double their base amounts allowing them to claim credits with marginal effective rate of 6527 these rates measure the reduction in the aftertax cost of qualified research as result of the regular credit in addition cox determined that some of the most researchintensive firms could claim either credit or they could claim credits with marginal effective rate half as large as the rate of the credits that could be claimed by firms with much lower research intensities the results seemed to confirm concern raised by the current regular credit that it was most beneficial to firms whose research intensities had grown since their base periods and least beneficial to firms whose research intensities had changed little not at all or shrunk since their ba periods most firms whose research intensities had declined found themselves in that position for two reasons 1 their rd spending was lower in 1994 than in thei r base period or 2 their sales revenue had grown faster than their rd expenditures over the same period critics of the regular cred it say that the pattern of rd subsidization found in the cox study is unfair and arbitrary s justification in economic theory and undercuts the intended purpose of the credit which is to encourage firms to spend more on rd than they otherwise would cox concluded that th wide variation in the marginal effective rates of the research tax credit that firms in his study could claim suggested that society places higher value on adding rd at certain firmshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31181crs20 28 cox research and experimentation tax credits p 10 29 two

qres and 2 the rule requiring established firms to use fixedbase period of 1984 to 1988 in compu ting their fixedbase percentages in combination the two rules can produce strikingly disparate outcomes in the use of the regular credit among firms sp ending substantial amounts on rd of particular concern to critics are firms whose researchintensity as measured by spending on rd as share of revenue s shrunk over time the structure of the us economy can and does change markedly in period of 20 or so years so it is very likely that economic and competitive conditions in rdintensive industries today bear little resemblance to the conditions that preva iled in the same industries in the midtolate 1980s most of the firm s that have stayed intact since the early 1980s and inve sted heavily in rd as share of revenue at that time presumably face much different competitive landscap and climate for rd investment and growth in some cases these changed circumstances have led established firms to invest less in rd as share of revenues firms in this position may not be able to claim the regular research credit even if they spend relatively large sums on rd29 weak or inadequate incentive effect in claiming that the regular credits incentive effect is inadequate critics are referring both to the credit rate deemed essential to raise busine ss rd investment to soci ally optimal amounts and to differences between the regular credits statutory rate and its average marginal effective rate both aspects of the regular credits incentive effect are examined here current rd tax incentives are inadequate critics maintain that the average effective rate of the regular credit is too low to boost business rd investment to amounts commensurate with its overall economic be nefits to lend empirical support to this contention they point to another study by cox one that focused on the efficacy of the research tax credit30 cox built his analysis around the premise that tax incentives can overcome the private sectors inclination to invest too little in the creation of new technical knowledge and knowhow for tax incentives to have this effect they must be designed so they subsidize rd spending above and beyond what firms would undertake on their own and they must be large enough to raise private aftertax returns on rd investments to the levels that would

qualify for expensing onlyfrom applying the same rate of taxation to the social rate of return from rd31 variety of studies have conc luded that the median private rate of return on rd investment is roughly 50 of the median social rate of return32 thus assuming that the average social pretax rate of return is two times the average private pretax rate of return the optimal rd tax subsidy w ould double the private aftertax rate of return to rd investment for example given corporate tax rate of 35 aftertax returns would equal 65 of pretax returns for corporations in this case the optimal rd tax subsidy would double the private af tertax returns to rd investment by increasing them to 130 of pretax returns 2 x 1 035 coxs analysis implied that the optimal average effective rate for an rd tax subsidy or combination of such subsidies eg research tax credit combined with the treatment of research expenditures as current business expense was 30 in discussing the policy implications of this finding cox noted that such rate is an average and thus would not address th considerable variation among rd investments in the difference between priv ate and social returns so using tax incentives to boost pretax returns on rd investment by 30 across all industries would provide excessive subsidies for proj ects with belowaverage spillover benefits and insufficient subsidies for projects with aboveaverage spillover benefits according to cox lawmakers should be aw are that this impr ecision is unavoidable and its consequences are hard to assess33 how do existing federal tax subsidies for rd investment compare with coxs assessment of the optimal rd tax subsidy to determine the incentive effect of current federal subsidies he estimated the pretax and afte rtax rates of return under 1995 federal tax law for variety of hy pothetical rd project s the projects differed in the share of rd expenditure s devoted to depreciable assets like structures and equipment the share of r d expenditures eligible for both expensing under irc section 174 and the regular resear ch tax credit and the economic lives of the intangible assets created by the investments cox compared the combined effect of expensing and the credit on aftertax returns to investment in capitalintensive intermediate and laborint ensive rd projects producin g intangible assets with economic lives of 3 5 10 and 20 years34 expensing equalizes the pre tax and aftertax rates of return on an investment since it taxes the income earned by affected assets at marginal effective rate

174 as tangible depr eciable assets like structures and equipment do not qualify for such treatment therefore how expensing affects an rd investments af tertax rate of return depends on two factors 1 the percentage of the tota l cost that may be expensed and 2 the marginal effective tax rate on income earned by the assets including labor eligible for expensing the regular research tax credit raises the aftertax rate of return only on qres above base amount so its effect on the aftertax returns to an rd investment depends on both the percentage of the inves tments total cost that qualifies for the credit and the effective tax rate on income earned by assets eligible for the credit taking into account thes limitations on the benefits of expensing and the regular credit cox estimated that expens ing and the credit together produce median aftertax rates of return ranging from 1010 of pretax returns for hypothetical capitalintensive project yielding intangible assets with an economic life of 20 years to 1247 for hypothetical laborintensive project yielding intangible assets with an economic life of three years36 as these percentages are less than 130 he inferred that the rd tax subsidies in existence in 1995 did not increase private aftertax returns to rd investments to the levels warranted by the spillover benefits that are thought to be typical for these investments37 significant gap between the credit s average effective rate and its statutory rate some critics of the current research tax credit see the credits incentive effect in somewhat different lig ht for them what counts most is any difference between the regular credits average effective rate and its statutory rate of 20 as noted earlier whatever difference exists is due to three of the rules governing the use of the credit one of the rules is the basis adjus tment under irc section 280cc1 which requires business taxpayers investing in qualified research to reduce whatever deduction for research expenditures unde r irc section 174 they claim by any research tax credit they claim this adjus tment effectively taxes the credit at firms marginal income tax rate consequently for business taxpayers subject to the maximum corporate and indivi dual tax rates of 35 the basis adjustment decreases the marginal effective rate of the credit from 20 to 13 business taxpayers have the option of computing the regular research credit at rate of 13 and not adjusting any deduction taken under section 174 by the amount of the credit second rule is the 50 rule which requires that the base amount

credit less attractive to start up firms whose currentyear ratio of qres to gross income exceeds 6 during their first five tax years or whose currentyear ratio is more than double their fixedbase percentages in the next six tax years for both sets of firms th rule further reduces the marginal effective ra of the credit to 65 third rule affecting this rate is the exclusion of expenditures for equipment and structures and overhead costs from expenses eligible for the regular credit even though many business rd investme nts involve the purchase of elaborate buildings and sophisticated equipment and all rd projects entail overhead costs the effect of the exclusion on the marginal effective rate of the credit depends on the overall share of an rd investment that is ineligible for the credit as this share rises the rate drops all othe r things being equal for example if expenditures for physical capital account for half of the cost of an rd investment then the marginal effective rate of the credit for the entire inve stment is half of what it would be if the entire cost were eligible for the credit for firms subject to the 50 rule that invest in rd projects where physical capital represents 50 of the total cost the marginal effective rate of the credit could fall to 325 as these considerations suggest the key to bolstering the regular credits incentive effect is to increase its average effective rate in essence there are two ways to do so one is to keep its current st atutory rate and modify one or more of the three rules driving wedge between the credits marginal effective rate and its statutory rate the second approach is to retain these rules but increase the credits statutory rate cox analyzed the effect of both options on aftertax rates of return for the same set of hypothetical rd inve stments discussed above in the case of laborintensive rd projects he estimated that 1995 res earch tax preferences produced median aftertax returns that were 1247 of preta x returns for projects yielding intangible assets with an economic life of thr ee years and 1155 for projects yielding intangible assets with an economic life of 20 years repealing the basis adjustment for the credit caused median aftertax return s to increase to 1460 of pretax returns for assets with threeyear economic life and 1301 for assets with 20year economic life38 increasing the statutory rate of the credit to 25 but retaining existing rules including the basis adjustment led to similar results median aftertax returns for assets with threeyear ec onomic life were an estimated 1339 of pre tax returns and an estimated 1219 for assets with 20year economic life39 as one might expect increasing the rate to 25 and removing the basis adjustment led to the biggest boost in the ratio of aftertax returns to pretax returns 1658 for assets with threeyear economic life and 1434 for assets with 20year economic life assuming that the optimal rd tax subsidy would raise aftertax returns to 130 of pretax returns coxs analysis ggested that keeping the regular creditshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31181crs24 40 for further discussion of the possible benefits to small firms of

its regular in come tax liability above 25000 unused gbcs may be carried forward 20 year s or back one year although there are some advantages to having an inventory of tax credits to apply against future or past tax liabilities the advantages do not necessarily outweigh the disadvantages for all firms investing in rd in the case of firms with sizable net operating losses there is certainty that stored credits can be us ed before they expire in addition the time value of money means that business taxp ayer is better off using the full amount of tax credit today rather th an five or 10 years from now critics of the credits design contend that its nonrefundabl status poses special problem for small fl edgling researchintensive firms in recent d ecades numerous commercially successf ul technological innovations have originated with such firms many of these firms spend substantial sums on rd during their first few years despite experiencing large financial losses in the view of critics the credits lack of refundability diminishes the typical small startup firms chances of survival or growth as the firm cannot count on the credit to reduce its cost of capital for rd investments some critics advocat making the credit wholly or partially refundable for firms under certain asset employment size or age as means of both solving this problem and improving the domestic climate for technological innovation40 unsettled and ambiguous definition of qualified research another important policy issue raised by the current research tax credit relates to the activities that qualify for it at its core the issue concerns the definition of qualified research and how th irs and business taxpayers apply it in the real world of business rd critics argue that the statutory defi nition in irc section 41d and irs regulations implementing it are vague and incomplete this lack of clarity and finality in their view often paves the way for protracted and costly disputes between business taxpayers and the irs over the validity of claims for the credit critics sayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31181crs25 41 see pl 99514 section 231 42 us congress joint committee on taxation general explanation of the tax reform act of 1986 jcs1087 washington gpo 1987 pp 132134that these disputes can curtail the stimulative effect of the credit by denying the full benefit of credits claimed by some firms investing in rd and by deterring some other firms investing in rd from claiming the credit on the grounds that its potential benefits are dwarfed by the costs associated with irs scrutiny of claims for the credit under the original credit which was in effect from 1981 through 1985 research expenditures qualified for the credit if they were also eligible for expensing under irc section 174 there were three exceptions to this general rule credit could be claimed for research conducted outside the united states research in the social sciences or humanities and any portion of re search funded by another entity section 174 allows business taxpayers to deduct all research or experimental expenditures incurred in connection with their trade or business but it does not define these expenditures the irs filled this gap by issuing re gulation 11742a whic h defined research or experimental expenditures according to the regulation these expenditures refer to research and development costs in the laboratory sense and generally include all such costs incident to the deve lopment or improveme nt of product expenditures can be considered rd costs in the experimental or laboratory sense if they fund activities inte nded to discover informa tion that would eliminate uncertainty concerning the development or improvement of product uncertainty exists in the rd process when the information available to researchers does not indicate how to proceed in developing new product or improving an existing one according to the regulation the proper focus in determining whether research expenditures qualify for expensing under sec tion 174 is the nature of the activity to which the expenditures relate not the nature of the pr oduct or improvement being developed responding to concern that business taxpayers were claiming the credit for activities that had more to do with produc t development than genuine technological innovation congress tightened the definition by adding three tests through the tax reform act of 1986 tra8641 under the act qualified re search still had to involve activities eligible for expensing under sec tion 174 but such activities also had to satisfy the following criteria they were directed at discovering information that technological in nature and useful in the deve lopment of new or improved business component of the taxpayer they constituted elements of process of experimentation and they were intended to imp rove the function performance quality or reliability of business component42httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31181crs26 43

qualify for the credit only if it met the general requirements for the credit was intended to develop soft ware that was innovative and not commercially availabl and involved significant economic risk in light of the significant changes made by the act there was pressing need for the irs to issue final regulations clarifying the meaning and limits of the three new tests for qualified research but for reasons that are not entirely clear in hindsight the irs did not issue proposed regula tions reg10517097 on the tests until december 1998 among other things they set forth guide lines for determining whether or not business taxpayer investing in rd has discovered information that is technological in nature and useful in developing new or improved busine ss component of the taxpayer through process of experimentation that relates to new or improved function performance reliability or quality the irs proposed that research would meet what became known as the discovery test if it were intended to obtain knowledge that exceeds expands or refines the common knowledge of skilled professionals in the particular field of technology or scie nce at the same time the agency noted that such standard did not necessarily mean the credit would be denied in the case of business taxpayers who made technological advances in an evolutionary manner or business taxpay ers who failed to achieve the desired result or business taxpayers who were not the first to ach ieve certain technological advance in addition the irs proposed that research would meet the experimentation test if it were to draw upon the princip of physical or biological sciences engineering or computer science as ppropriate to evaluate more than one alternative designed to achieve result where the means of achieving the result are uncertain at the outset such an evalua tion should involve developing testing and refining or discarding hypot heses related to the design of new or improved business components the release of the proposed regulations unleashed wave of criticism from the business community much of the dissent focused on the proposed guidelines for discovering technological information widely voiced complaint was that the common knowledge test violated the intent of congress and would prove burdensome and unworkable for tax prac titioners because it was too subjective most tax practitioners and business taxpayers who commented on the proposal urged the irs to scrap the test43 after reviewing the many critical comments it received along with recent case law and the legislative history of the research tax credit the irs issued what it described as final set of regulations td 8930 on the definition of qualified research in late december 2000 while differing

whether or not the inform ation gained through research was technological in nature and useful in th development of new or improved business component but they further clarified the pplication of the test by noting that the common knowledge of skilled pr ofessionals in particul ar field of science or engineering referred to information that would be known by such professionals if they were to investigate the state of knowle dge in field of science or engineering before undertaking research project th final regulations also carved out safe harbor for patents by affirming that bus iness taxpayer would be presumed to have passed the common knowledge test if the ta xpayer could prove it had been awarded patent for new or improved business component moreover they set down new standards for determining wh the development of com puter software for internal use qualified for the credit specifically research on internaluse software was eligible for the regular credit or airc only if it satisfied the general requirements for the credits entailed significant economic risk and led to the development of innovative software that was not commercially available the final regulations seemed to arous as much opposition within the business community as the proposed regulations that preceded them principal bone of contention was the irss insistence on reta ining the controversial discovery test many tax practitioners also complained that number of the provisions in the final regulations were not included in th proposed regulati ons precluding public comment on those provisions44 these criticisms spurred the irs to take an unusual procedural step about one month after the release of the regulati ons the treasury department published notice notice 200119 retracting them th notice also requested further comment on all aspects of the susp ended regulations promised that the irs would carefully review all questions and c oncerns raised about them and committed the irs to issue any changes to the final regulations in proposed form for additional comment45 in december 2001 the irs delivered on this promise by releasing more proposed regulations reg11299101 they departed in some important ways from previous guidance among other things the regulations jettisoned the requirement set forth in td 8930 that qualified research seek to discover knowledge that exceeds expands or refines the common knowledge of skilled professionals in par ticular field of science or engineering they also revised the definition of process of ex perimentation so that it was seen as process designed to evaluate one or more alternatives to achieve result where the capability or the method of achieving that result or the appr opriate design of th at result is uncertain as of the beginning of the taxpayers research activities the determination of whether taxpayer engaged in such pro cess should be made on the basis of relevant facts and circumstances in addition the proposed regulations

analysts viewed them as an attempt by the irs to follow strictly congressional intent in alte ring the definition of qualif ied research in tra86 the regulations specified that informati on is technological in nature if the process of experimentation us ed to discover it relies on the principles of the physical or biological sciences engineering or co mputer science they did not retain the discovery test included in td 8930 but ffirmed that taxpayers can be deemed to have discovered information that is tec hnological in nature by using existing technologies and principles of the physical or biological sciences engineering or computer science such discovery would not hinge on whether taxpayer succeeds in its quest to develop new or improved business component at the same time having patent for business com ponent would be considered conclusive evidence that taxpayer has discovered info rmation that is technological in nature that is intended to eliminate uncertainty concerning the development or improvement of such component in addition td 9104 sheds additional light on what constituted process of experimentation basically the regulations noted that such process had three critical elements first th actual outcome must be uncer tain at the outset second the process must allow researchers to identify more than one approach to achieving desired outcome and third researchers must use certain sc ientific methods to evaluate the efficacy of these alternatives eg modeling simulation and systematic trialanderror investigation the regulations stressed that process of experimentation is evaluative in nature and therefore often involves refining throughout much of the process the taxpay ers understanding of the uncertainty the taxpayer is trying to address taxpay ers relevant facts nd circumstances should be considered in determining whether it has engaged in such process although the regulations clarified numbe r of important issues regarding the definition of qualified researc h they did not address seve ral other issues that are important to many firms one such issue concerns the circum stances under which spending on the development of internaluse

and inventive in way that imposes the same requirements on the development of internaluse software as the discovery test that the regulations eliminated48 another unresolved issue is the eligibility of research aimed at achieving significant cost reductions cost reduction is not identified in the statute as purpose of qualified research but the research required to lower costs can be as challenging as research done to improve business components reliability or performance some have pointed out that research that allows product or pr ocess to deliver the same performance at reduced cost repr esents an improvement in performance49 yet another unresolved issue with widesp read reach is the definition of gross receipts for an affiliated group of companie s how these recei pts are

corporations with majorityowned foreign subsidiaries50 lack of focus on rd projects with relatively large social returns in the minds of some critics another key policy issue raised by the credit relates to its efficacy in spurring increased business investment in rd projects yielding relatively large spillover benefits or the credits bang for the buck they question whether an additional dollar of the credit leads to more investment in rd with relatively high social returns than does an additional dollar of direct government spending on basic or applied research for many analysts and lawmakers an advantage of the credit over direct research spending is that private compan ies and not the fede ral government decide which rd projects are subsidized under current federal tax w firms claim the credit for projects they decide to fund and the federal government bears some of the cost51 the credit used in combination with the expensing of research spending enables market forces to

believe that such an approach is more likely to promote greater diversity in the sear ch for new technical knowledge and knowhow with profitable commercial applications than direct subsidy such as

it seems plausible in general business managers and owners seek the highest possible return on their investments consequently in selecting rd projects to pursue it makes sense that they would assign higher priority to projects likely to earn substantial profits for their firms in the short run than to projects likely to expand the frontie rs of knowledge in scientific field but to yield relatively meager returns in the s hort run such predisposition is more than matter of speculation it is reflected in domestic industrial rd spending in 2001 according to data published by the nationa l science foundation us industry spent total of 1849 billion on rd of which 5 went to basic research 22 to applied research and 73 to development52 this allocation reinforces the impression that the credit is mainly subsidizing rd projects with relatively modest social returns some would modify the credit to give firms stronger incentive to invest in basic research than in applied research or development among the options are redefining qualified research so that it applies to what is regarded as basic research only and altering the basic research credit so that it offers higher statutory rate than the regular re tax credit to basic res earch undertaken by business taxpayer in considering whether to modify the credit to make it more effective tool for stimulating business investment in
