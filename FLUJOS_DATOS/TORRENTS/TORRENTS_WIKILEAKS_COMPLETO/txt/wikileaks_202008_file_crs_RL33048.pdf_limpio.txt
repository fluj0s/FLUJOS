hazardous chemi cals transportation marine shipments of hazardous chemical cargo may be attractive terrorist targets because of their large volume and inherent toxicity or flammability anecdotal evidence and international events suggest that terrorists may have both the desire and capability to attack such shipments in us waters building on exis ting legislation congress is analyzing the security of hazardous chemical marine sh ipments and deciding whether to strengthen related federal security effo rts hr 2651 for example would increase penalties for criminal or terrorist activities around ports and marine vessels s 1052 includes provisions to increase general port secu rity including foreign port security drawing on marine commerce data from the army corps of engineers ace crs has analyzed marine shipments of acutely toxic or combustible chemicals as defined under environmental protection ag ency epa regulations according to this analysis over 100000 marine ship ments 54 million tons of chemicals potentially capable of causing mass casualties injuries or deaths among the general public passed through us waters in 2003 these chemical shipments accounted for 2 of us marine cargo tonnage and were shipped through 113 us ports the top 30 ports handled 95 of this hazardous ch emical tonnage most marine shipments of hazardous chemicals are much larger th an such shipments on land they would be of sufficient volume on averag to require an offsite risk management plan under epa rules if the same quantity of chemical was stored at chemical plant the maritime transportation security act mtsa pl 107295 and the international ship and port facility security code give the coast guard farranging authority over the security of hazardous ma rine shipping the agency has developed port security plans addressing how to depl oy federal state and local resources to prevent terrorist attacks under the mt sa the coast guard s assessed the overall vulnerability of marine vessels their potential to transport terrorists or terror materials and their use as potential wea pons the coast guard has employed these assessments to augment marine assets security and develop new maritime security standards as federal oversight of haza rdous chemical marine secu rity continues to evolve congress may raise questions concerning rrorism risk uncertainty and efforts by federal agencies and the private sector to rigorously evaluate that risk congress may assess whether responsible fe deral agencies and private sector entities have in place sufficient resources and eff ective measures to secure hazardous chemical marine cargo from terrorist attack congress ma also evaluate the emergency response capabilities of coastal communities exposed to chemical shipping hazards determining how hazardous ch emical marine security f its together with other homeland security priorities to achieve common security goals could be an oversight challenge for the 109th

waters oceans rivers lakes canals or other waterways marine security of hazardous chemical cargo introduction the federal government has statutory obligations to regulate interstate commerce and secure the united states agai nst terrorism therefore congress has strong interest in federa l regulations and programs re lated to hazardous chemicals security since september 11 2001 legislat ors government agencies and industry have been working to prevent terrorist att acks involving hazardous chemicals their goal is to ensure the continued availability of such chemicals for commercial use while reducing the risk of their exploitation by terrorists large quantities of hazardous chemi cals are found in co mmercial facilities marine transportation rail trans portation and highway trucking1 t d t congressional attention has fo cused largely on the security of hazardous chemicals transported by rail or tanke r trucks or stored at co mmercial facilitie s near populated areas as the nations rail truck and chemical facility policies mature congress is reviewing federal policies re lated to marine transporta tion of hazardous chemical cargo2 in the 109th congress for example hr 2651 would establish or increase penalties for criminal or terro rist activities around ports nd marine vessels s 1052 includes provisions to increase general t security including ports in foreign countries in response to the overall secur ity environment congress is likely to seek broader understanding of hazardous che mical marine shipments and efforts to secure them this report provides an ove rview of hazardous chemi cals marine transportation in the united states the report discusses the general risks from such marine transportation in the homeland security cont ext it focuses on many

hazardous chemical cargoes that if re leased could potentially pose catastrophic hazard to the general public the specific cargoes are defi ned in subsequent sections the report does not examine other potential maritime security hazards such as petroleum products biological agents or container bombs which ma also be of interest to policymakers3 it focuses on threats to the general public from chemical release during marine transport it does not address marine attacks targeting economic activity or the environment due to the sensitive nature of the topic and legal limitations on the publication of certain propr ietary shipping da ta the report does not provide detailed st atistics for the specific hazardous chemicals or ports of interest maritime terrorism and hazardous chemical cargo marine shipments of hazardous che mical cargo are potentially attractive terrorist targets because these chemicals are acutely toxic or highly combustible and are shipped in large volumes they may represent serious threat to human life and physical infrastructure if intentionally released near populated areas hazardous chemical marine vessels are also part of two critical infrastructures identified by the bush administrationthe che micals and transportation sectors4 f r t h s reasons the protection of hazardous ch emical shipments passing through us waterways and ports is an important compone nt of us homeland security strategy although security experts widely ack nowledge that marine shipments of hazardous chemicals may be attractive terrorist targets marine vessel carrying hazardous chemicals has been used by terrorists in an attack on civilians nonetheless marine accidents involving such shipments in the us and abroad have demonstrated their potential to impact nearby communities foreign terrorists also have successfully attacked ot her types of marine vessels overseas as discussed later in the report intelligence suggests that terrorists may have both the interest and capability to execute hazardous chemical shipping attacks in the united states hazardous marine cargo accidents major accidents involving the marine tran sportation of hazardous chemicals are

terrorist or other criminal continuedindustrial accidents ever recorded in 1917 for example the explosion of the mont blanc carrying cargo of explosives in the port of halifax killed over 1900 people and seriously injured over 4000 others6 the 1947 explosion of two cargo ships carrying ammonium nitrate and sulfur in texas city texas destroyed the port killing nearly 600 people and injuring another 35007 due to improved safety practices and vessel construction marine accident as destructive as the texas city disaster has not occurred in the ensuing 60 years however serious incidents involving che mical marine shipments have forced the evacuation of threatened coastal populati ons these incidents include 1985 fire aboard the ariadne carrying 100 containers of toxic chemicals in the port of mogadishu somalia 8 1987 accident aboard the cason carrying 1200 tons of flammable toxic and corrosive chemicals near cape finisterre spain 9 and 1999 fire aboard the multitank ascania carrying cargo of vinyl acetate off the coast of scotland10 these incidents did not result in serious casualties among neighboring communities but emergency responders d high degree of concern for public safety as indicated by the associated evacuations likelihood of terrorist attacks on ships although terrorists have never used ma rine cargo vessel to launch chemical attack on the general public both international combatants and domestic terrorists tried to use explosives to release ch emicals from land base d manufacturing and storage facilities during the 1990s most of th attempts were in foreign war zones such as croatia they included attack s on plant producing fertilizer carbon black and light fraction petroleum products ot her plants producing pesticides and pharmaceutical factory using mmonia chlorine and other hazardous chemicals all of these facilities were clos to population centers in the united states there were at least two instances during the late 1990s when criminals attempted to release chemicals from similar facilities one inci dent involved large propane storage facility in california and the other gas refinery in texas11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33048crs4 11

security presidential directive 7 hspd7 directs federal homeland security activities to focus on terrorist ttacks that could cause catastrophic health effects or mass casualties co mparable to those from the use of weapon of mass destruction22 for purposes of this report haza rdous chemical cargo is chemicals carried aboard commercial marine vessel that if accidentally released or combusted could under certain circumstan ces pose catastrophic hazard to the general public typically such hazard s could include poisoning asphyxiation chemical burns or thermal burns in some cases single chemical could present combination of these hazards numerous federal standards identify potentially hazardous chemicals with respect to public security relevant standards are promulgated by the departme nt of transportation dot the coast guard and the environmental protection agency epa dot hazardous materials the dot regulates the transportation of all hazardous materials under the hazardous materials transportation ac t of 1975 pl 93633 and subsequent amendments the act empowers the secretary of transportation to designate as hazardous any particular quantity or form of material that may pose an unreasonable risk to health safety and property when transported in commerce the dot defines and classifies hazardous materials in 49 cfr 172101 the dots list includes thousands of materials including toxic radioactive corrosive explosive and flammable materialswhic h could potentially be shipped the dot groups individual materials by type of hazard eg inhalation poisoning but not necessarily by relative degree of hazard the dot does pr ovide ranking of relative hazard by general class or division in 49 cfr 1732a this ranking is summarized in appendix 1 in addition to its general hazardous material safety regulations the dot requires shippers of certain highly hazar dous cargo to develop security plans in 49 cfr 172823 under these provisions subject to various conditions the dot defines highly hazardous cargo to include radioactive material class 7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33048crs6 over 55 pounds of explosives division 11 12 or 13 over 106 quarts per package of ma terial poisonous by inhalation 3500 gallons or more of bulk hazardous liquids or gases 468 cubic feet or more of bulk hazardous solids 5000 pounds or more of packaged hazardous material agents regulated by the centers for disease control and prevention certain hazardous materials that require placarding under other provisions in 49 cfr 172 note that the dots definition of highl hazardous materials extends to most of the materials in 49 cfr 172101 wh they are present above the prescribed quantities coast guard hazardous cargoes the coast guard regulates the safety and security of marine vessels and is responsible for enforcing all applicable federal hazardous mate rial laws in us waters coast guard regulations identify hazardous cargo in several sections of the federal code under the po rt and waterways safety act of 1972 pl 92340 the coast guard defines certain dangerous cargoes in 33 cfr 160204 the definition of certain dangerous cargoes refers to the dot list mentioned above and specifically names certain liquefied ga s and bulk liquid cargoes in 46 cfr the coast guard prescribes special requirements for vessels carrying certain hazardous materials identified as follows bulk solid hazardous mate rials 46 cfr 148 bulk liquid hazardous materials carri ed in barges 46 cfr 151 bulk liquid liquified gas or co mpressed gas hazardous materials carried by ship 46 cfr 153 incompatible chemicals where multiple chemicals may be carriedtogether in parcel tankers or on container ships 46 cfr 150 the coast guard also identifies hazardous marine cargoes through regulation of waterfront facilities handling these cargoes in 33 cfr parts 126 127 and 154 collectively hundreds of different hazar dous materials are included on the coast guards lists while coast guard regulations identify particular hazardous materials potentially carried in marine vessels they do not necessarily identify the relative degree of hazard among these materials epa hazardous substances the epa regulates stationary f acilities handling pot entially hazardous substances under the clean air act c aa section 112r7 in 1990 congress passed pl 101549 which amended the caa section 112 to require fac ilities possessing more than specified threshold quantities of certain hazardous substances to file risk management plans rmps these rmps summarize the potential threat from sudden large releases of those substan ces these plans must also include the results of offsite consequence analysis for worst case accident and plans to prevent releases and mitigate any damagehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33048crs7 24 the list may be viewed electronically at the following link visited may 9 2003 http wwwaccessgpogovnar acfrcfrhtml_00title_4040cfr68_00html 25 see page nine for discussion of the source of this statisticthe clean air act amendments defined hazardous substances to include 14 listed substances including chlorine nd ammonia and at least 100 additional chemicals to be designated by the epa the amendments directed epa to designate chemicals posing the greatest risks to human health or to the environment based on three criteria the severity of potential acu adverse health effects the likelihood of accidental releases and the potential magnitude of human exposure the epa promulgated list of 77 acutely toxic substances 63 flammable gases and volatile flammable liquids and high explosive s ubstances found in 40 cfr 68 as result of legal settlement the epa deleted high explosives from the list in 1998 the list was further amended in 2000 to ex clude flammable subs tances when used as fuel or held for sale as fuel at retail facility the current eparmp list is shown in appendix 2 24 the vast majority of hazardous ma terials on the dot lists do not likely represent catastrophic health hazard to the general public because the materials involved are not shipped or stored in fficient quantity or because their physical properties limit their potential offsite imp acts likewise most of the hazar dous materials listed by the coast guard in 33 cfr and 46 cfr do not represent catastrophic health hazards accordingl the epa list may more appropriately identify those chemicals considered to have the greatest potential consequences to the general public since the chemicals in epas list are considered among the most hazardous on land it follows that many of them may be s imilarly hazardous if transported on water this report uses the eparmp chemicals as the basis for marine cargo hazard analysis nearly all of the epas listed hazardous substances under the caa section 112r are found in the dot and coast guard hazardous materials lists so the findings in this report should be applicable to the dot or coast guards lists as well the eparmp chemicals are crossreferenced to the dot categories in appendix 2 two notable classes of hazardous material identified by dot not on the eparmp list are radioactive materials and explosives army corps of engineers marine commerce statistics for 2003 discu ssed later in this report show that explosives and radioactive materials would account for less than 03 of us hazardous marine cargo if added to the eparm p hazardous materials list25 excluding these two classes is unlikely to affect the policy conclusions in this report health effects of hazardous chemicals as noted above the eparmp chemicals ar broadly classified as acutely toxic or flammable or both the degree of toxicity or flammability of specific chemicals within the eparmp list varies with their chemical properties the following example chemicals illustrate such variations httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33048crs8 26 rm technologies uses of ammonia company website mt laurel nj aug 15 2005 http wwwrmtec

ammonia is an acutely toxic potentially explosive liquefied gas primarily used in the manufact ure of fertilizers and as fertilizer itself it has many other uses as well for exam ple as chemical produc tion component as source of protein in livestock feeds and in metal treatment operations26 ammonia can reach harmful concentrations in the air very quick ly on loss of containment it can causing severe skin irritation and if inhaled can cause respir atory irritation eye corrosion and fatal fluid buildup in the lungs27 methane methane natural gas is used as heating fuel and industrial feedstock for range of chemical processes methane is not inherently toxic although high vapor concentrations may cau asphyxiation by displacing breathable air cryogenic methane liquefied natura l gas or lng may freeze body parts with which it comes into contact methane is extremely flammable when mixed with air and may be explosive when such mixtures are in confined spaces28 methyloxirane methyloxirane is used to manufacture polyurethane foam for furniture and cars solvents in paints cleaners and waxes polyster resins and other industrial products thyloxirane is toxic liquid and fire hazard human exposure may irritate the eyes skin and respiratory tract methyloxirane vapor is extremely flammable when mixed with air and reacts explosively with chlorine ammonia strong oxidants and acids29 as the examples above monstrate an uncontrolled release of specific chemical on the eparmp list could have varying effects on an exposed population evaluating the particular effects of such re leases material by material is beyond the scope of this report nor is it necessary for general di scussion of hazardous marine cargo policy the important point is that the epa considers all the rmp chemicals when present above their individual thres hold quantities to be sufficiently hazardous to the general public to warrant speci regulatory treatment ie offsite consequence analysis recognizing that certain shipments of specific cargoes may be more hazardous than othe rs this report assume that they are all hazardous enough to warrant public concern as potential terrorist targets hazardous chemical releases over water the eparmp list of hazardous chemi cals was developed for facilities on land due to their chemical properties the health hazard associated with these chemicalshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33048crs9 30 helcom vol 2 annex 4 dec 1 2002 pa44may be significantly different if released over water certain eparmp chemicals dissolve in water eg propylene oxide or sink in water eg tetramethyllead potentially reducing the hazard they pose to the general public in marine incident other chemicals eg ammonia dissolve in water but evaporate quickly as well still others eg cryogenic methane float and evaporate faster on water than on land creating larger hazard zone more quickly in marine release than land release for the same quantity of chemical30 because land release and water release characteristics of specific eparmp chemicals may differ only limited conclusions may be drawn from study of eparmp zards in marine shipments further research and analysis are required for better understanding of the relative marine hazards of specific chemicals hazardous marine cargo statistics the army corps of engineers ace maintains statistics of marine commerce in us waters these statistics may be used to estimate the marine shipping volumes of eparmp chemicals see appendix 3 for description of the ace database and its limitations according to the ace statistics subset of the eparmp chemicals are transported through us waters in significant quantities table 1 summarizes the total us waterborne shipments of these chemicals by the dots general hazard category as the table shows over 48 million tons of eparmp chemicals passed through us waters in 2003 the most recent ear for which data are available these hazardous chemicals accounted for 2

note that dot divisions are subcategories within class hazardous cargo shipment frequency and volumes it may be appropriate to consider both size and number of shipments in an analysis of marine cargo terrorism zards the hazardous materials on the eparmp list are included primarily because their chemical properties make themhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33048crs10 31 one lowvolume chemical is excluded because its shipments data are not available 32 ace tons represent short tons 2000 poundshazardous to human health to be pot entially catastrophic threat to the general public however these materials must be present in large enough volumes to impact nearby populations in the event of mar itime release accordingly the overall volume of hazardous material in marine shipment becomes an important consideration when evaluating potential public impacts of terrorist attack additionally larger number of shipment s could potentially equate to larger overall terrorist risk because terrorists c ould have more opportunities for successful attack among other reasons over 100000 marine shipments of eparmp hazardous cargo passed through us waterways in 2003 figure 1 summarizes the total number of shipments and average cargo tons per sh ipment in 2003 for the eparmp hazardous chemicals as estimated by the ace31 because cargo vessels may load or unload partial cargoes at multiple cations over the course of single shipment the tonnage of cargo actually carried aboard vessel at any time may vary note that the data in figure 1 are plotted on logarithmic scale for clarity of presentation the epa regulations specify minimum threshold quantities for risk planning between 500 nd 200 00 pounds for the eparmp chemicals the dashed line in figure 1 represents the 20000 pound 10 ton upper threshold above which offsite consequence plans are require d for facilities on land accord ing to the ace data the average shipment volume for the hazardous chemicals in figure 1 generally exceed the

interesting to note that each category of chemicals in figure 1 was typically shi pped between several hundred and several thousa nd times in 2003 low freque ncy and high frequency hazardous cargoes are not easily distinguished hazardous cargo vessel characteristics many types of marine ve ssels may transport hazar dous cargo in bulk these vessels have distinct c onstruction and operating char acteristics depending upon the quantities and physical properties of the cargoes they are designed to carry cargo vessel characteristics are an important secu rity consideration they determine in part the physical vulnerability of such vessels to accident or deliberate attack as well as the potential consequences of an accident or attack as figure 2 shows over 67 of eparmp hazardous marine cargo in 2003 was shipped in tankers liquefied gas or chemical parcel or lfpropelled liquid chemical ba rges an additional 29 was shipped in nonselfpropelled liquid chemical barges container ships dry cargo

used to re spond to accidental cargo releases55 compliance with these safety regulations could help mitigate the damage from terrorist attack for instance by minimizing the amount of car go released and might also help deter an attack prior to 911 however th coast guard had only limited regulations directed specifically at terrorism existing marine antiterrorism law was primarily concerned with

parallels the mtsa requirements the isps code requires that every ship and certain port facilities around the world draw up security plan to be approved by their national g overnment these security plans must indicate the operational and physical security measures to be taken under three tiered threat levels normal medium and high every ship and port must also designate security officer to ensure that the isps code is implemented must deploy required security equipment eg vessel tracking devices must monitor and control access of people and cargo at the port and aboard the vessel and

product of threat vulnerability and consequence significant uncertainties exist across all three of these factors as they relate to hazardous marine cargo the potential threat posed by terrorists targeting ships in us waters for example has been the subject of debate since 911 although experts acknowledge the genera l threat information put forth by government agencies some believe that public concern about specific threats to hazardous chemicals shipping is oversta ted and should not impede maritime trade73 others assert that terrorists have demonstrated both the desire and capability to attack such shipping with the intenti on of harming the general population74 the basis of such conclusions is open to question howev er due to the inherent uncertainty of threat intelligence and the shifting goals and methods of potential attackers as the federal energy regulatory commission has remarked unlike accidental causes historical experience provides little guidance in estimating the probability of terrorist attack75 vulnerability and consequence analysis of marine chemical hazards also may face important uncertainties the coast guard reports having approved mandatory security vulnerability assessments and secu rity plans for thousands of vessels as required under the mtsa nd isps codes noaa reports having established partnership with the coast guard to conduc t hazardous chemical risk assessments at us ports notwithstanding these coast guard activities some analysts suggest that the potential vulnerabilities and consequences of terrorist attack on or with hazardous marine cargo vessel are not well understood recent public controversy about terrorist risks to lng shipping fo r example has been largely driven by conflicting vulnerability and consequence studies from variety of government and private sector groups76 the security sensitivity of such assessments and plans complicates efforts to evaluate them l ittle public information is available for example on the physical vulnerabilities of different types of marine vessels to terrorist attacks with weapons or improvised explosives although the cole and limburg attacks suggest that such vulnerabilities exist furthermore while there is body of public marine research related to accidental release of hazardous chemicals little appears directly related to intentional release which may have substantially different characteristics vessel vulnerability assessments and security plans are central to us maritime security strategy but their value and effectiveness for hazardous chemicals carri ers may be

such security analysis to help ensure methodological consistency across che micals vessel types locations and agencies maritime security resources the costs associated with hazardous ma rine cargo security and the potential diversion of coast guard and other g overnment agency resources from other activities have been concern to policy makers78 according to coast guard officials the services maritime security expenditures are not all incremental since they are part of the coast guards genera l mission to protect the nations waters and coasts nonetheless coast guard staff have acknowledged

implement nationw ide vessel monitoring system and 874 million to increase surveillance of vessels by aircraft state and local agencies ar also seeking more funding to offset the costs of hazardous marine cargo security thes funding cerns are most clearly illustrated in the case of lng tankers which may cost the public up to 80000 to secure each time they deliver shipment82 state and local police and emergency services agencies pay significant share of these co sts they believe lng security costs may force them to divert limited local resour ces from other important public services83 acknowledging such concerns federal officials have recommended that new lng terminal operators pay the costs of any additional maritime security or safety needed for their facilities84 the energy policy act of 2005 requires private and public sector costsharing for lng tanker security sec 311d nonetheless because the accounting of security costs is ambiguous and tied to uncertain sources of federal funding such as dhs port security grants some government officials continue to voice concern over lng security costs85 furthermore some lng companies have resisted suggestions that they pay more for public security reasoning that the federal state and local taxes they pay should c over public law enforcement and emergency services86 others have expressed willingness to pay for excess security only if it exceeds the level of security service ordinarily commensurate with corporate tax payments87 the security costs associated with lng shipments may not be indicative of the costs to secure other eparmp zardous marine cargo new security technology more specific threat intelligen ce and changing threat assessments may all help to lower hazardous marine cargo security costs in the future nonetheless the costs to public agencies to secure hazardous marine cargo from terrorist attack appears significant and may warrant review of associated costsharing

as this report notes the coast guard has in place range of security measures to protect hazardous chemicals sh ipping nonetheless the effectiveness of these measures is regarded as an ope n issue given the current understanding of general marine threats so question whether the coas t guard efficiently deploys the security resources it has88 others question whether adequate measures are in place to evaluate the coast guards secur ity activities for example the gao has concluded although there is widespread agreement that actions taken so far have led to heightened awareness of the need for maritime security and an enhanced ability to identify and respond to many security threats assessing the degree of progress in making the nation more secure is difficult thus far seaport security actions lack performance measures to define what these activities are intended to achieve and measure progress toward these goals89 addressing hazardous cargo some specifically question whether coast guard security activities adequately address relative terrorism risks within and across ports based on quantitative risk analysis within given port for example there may be greater or lesser risk from terrorist ttacks on ammonia tankers than from dirty bombs hidden aboard container ships th coast guard states that its internal maritime security plan id entifies high risk cargos and conducts operations to address those risks90 nonetheless given the terrorism risk uncertainties associated with hazardous chemical vessels and the competing demands for coast guard resources some question whether the leve l of coast guard security for hazardous chemicals vessels appropriately reflects their relative risk91 because coast guard port captains have considerab discretion in the deploy ment of security resources within their ports some observers also question whether similar chemical shipments posing similar terrorism hazards receive diffe rent levels of pr otection from one port to another while differences in protec tion may be appropriate in some instances such situation could lead to excessive s ecurity of hazardous marine cargoes in some ports and inadequate security in others in its oversight of the coast guards security activities congress may take steps to assess the effectiveness of the agencys hazardous marine cargo activ ities in the context of its larger

involving chemical cargo ships assu mes 350 deaths and 1000 hospitalizations resulting from an attack92 others have suggested higher casualties for specific types of chemical tanker attacks in shipping ch annels near densely populated areas if terrorist attack succeeded in injuring or killing such large numbers of people it might overwhelm federal and local emergency agencies and medical facilities an attack involving one or more toxic chemicals mig ht further complicat emergency response by imposing special demands on emergency response teams and requiring specialized medical treatment for poisoning and burns salvage of vessel damaged or sunk in such an attack could be an additional probl em due to the chemical hazard and other limitations among us marine salvage companies93 because of the hazardous cargo terrorism risk it may be judged to be prudent for emergency and medical authorities near potentially affected waterways to develop specific prospective measures to deal releas of chemical cargoes most relevant to their region federal or private sector assi stance in the form of funding or expertise might be utilized to support such efforts especially for communities with insufficient capabilities to develop emergency response pl ans the dots hazardous materials emergency preparedness fund created in the transportation equity ac t of 2005 sec 7114d and the dhss homeland secu rity grant program are two potential source of funding for marine chemicals em ergency response plans but congress may opt to consider others94 the emergency response plan and costsharing provisions for coastal lng terminals and tankers in the energy policy act of 2005 sec 311d may be an alternative legislative model for such planning conclusions this report shows that marine shipme nts of eparmp hazardous chemicals are comparable in volume to quantities stored at large chemical plants and are typically many times larger than shipments in individual rail or highway tankers marine vessels carrying zardous chemicals often pa ss near populated areas along us waterways and through the largest and most commercially important us ports available studies and anecdotal evidence suggest that these shipments may be attractive terrorist targets nd if successfully attacked or used as weapon could cause catastrophic injuries among the general publichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33048crs30 both government and indus try have taken numerous steps to try to improve maritime security of hazardous chemical cargo the mtsa gives the coast guard clear and farranging authority over the secur ity of hazardous marine shipping in its efforts to fulfill this legislative mandate the coast guard is continuing to evolve its security activities as oversight of the federal role in marine chemicals security continues congress may rais questions concerning terrori sm risk uncertainty and efforts by federal agencies and the private sector to rigorously evaluate that risk congressional policy makers may also analyze whether the coast guard other government agencies and the private sect or have sufficient resources to secure hazardous chemical cargo commensurate with that risk and whether current security measures will be effective against terrorist attack since marine attack is possible even under tight security evaluating the emergency response capabilities of coastal communities exposed to chemical shipping hazards may be of interest as well in addition to these specific issues congress may assess how the various elements of us hazardous chemicals mari ne security fit together in the nations overall strategy to protect the public fro m hazardous chemicals and cargo bulk quantities of haza rdous chemicals are found in mari ne vessels in rail and highway tankers and in chemical f acilities on land as noted earlie r in this report the same physical shipment of chemical may pa ss sequentially through all these sectors balancing the nations chemicals security resources across these sectors is policy challenge because marine tr ansportation land transporta tion and chemical facilities fall under different homeland security authorities and regu lations limited vulnerability and cons equence information especially for marine transportation complicates this problem by making it difficult to compare terrorism risk scenarios across sectors even for the same chemical hazard without such comprehensive perspective on hazardous chemical risks security analysts may have difficulty identifying which chemicals assets to protect and how well to protect them with the limited security resources available likewise diverting marine resources away from safety to enhance security might further reduce terror risk but increase overall risk if safety programs become less effective as result reviewing how these security priorities and activities fit together to achieve common goals could be an oversight challenge for
