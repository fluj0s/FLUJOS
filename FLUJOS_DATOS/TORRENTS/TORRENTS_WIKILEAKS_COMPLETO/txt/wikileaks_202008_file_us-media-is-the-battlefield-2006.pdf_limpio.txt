the result was the book certain victory the us army in the gulf war one of the greatest challenges in writing the book was finding photographs from any source on us army ground operations in the conflict it was the day of the tightly controlled media pool method that virtually excluded media access to the battlefield once the war particularly ground operations commenced center for army

thoughtprovoking article for call titled producing change in army public affairs ideas for refocusing operations news from the front septemberoctober 2001 maj huttons article serves as chapter 1 of this 2006 newsletter much of what maj hutton called for was soon to happen accelerated by the events of 911 with the collapse of the world trade center towers and the simultaneous strike on the pentagon both seen virtually live around the globe media relations and pa became the fourth dimension of modern warfare as practiced in the 21st century rather than combat multiplier for lethal warfighting functions pa especially as component of io became integral to decisive operations it was longer question of considering the medias role on the battlefield more properly stated the media

change in army public affairs ideas for refocusing operations ltc james hutton public affairs officer pao iii corps and fort hood analysts note in this article the author suggests refocusing of army public affairs pa the ideas expressed in this article represent only the views of the author and are not to be construed as representing either current or emerging doctrine or policy the purpose for publication here is to provoke thought engender discussion and explore possibilities for improving methods for practicing pa view any tactics techniques or procedures presented in this article as points of discussion and not as approved replacements for current operational methods prologue the article below was written in 2001 prior to the events of 911 but more importantly it was written before the numerous operations that have come since although the need to adapt to the exponentially expanding marketplace of ideas and media outlets was clear before 911 such adaptation has proven critical in the last five years our soldiers the american public the publics of our allies and publics of our enemies have changed the way they receive and deliver information gone are the days when local news release stays local word uttered at fort sill iraq or afghanistan can rocket across the planet instantly on the other hand the overwhelming flow of available information makes getting heard and understood daunting task when i wrote producing change in army public affairs ideas for refocusing operations for the center for army lessons learned call in 2001 telling the army story often meant pushing stories to reporters today media encounters are nearly constant particularly in iraq and afghanistan therefore we must go beyond quantity of contacts as measure of effectiveness maintaining pressure on reporters to cover operations comprehensively is the key to the success of pa operations in 2006 one factor that skews coverage in iraq is that reporters are not as able to move about as they may wish consequently many organizations are satisfied to collect daily casualty statistics and other items that are easily packaged in fact some organizations rely heavily on stringers that is nonprofessional local nationals who are sent to the streets to capture quotes photos and video which are then brought to news bureaus the actual reporters then use the material obviously the materials gained through this method are of questionable validity this is something news organizations are not eager to talk about publicly one constant remains telling the truth is the only acceptable mode of conduct for paos although we need to be innovative in getting information out we cannot dilute the product by allowing the use of false or misleading items one way to get information out is the continued use of superreporting as described below in addition to the many possibilities listed we need to include the use of web logsotherwise known simply as blogs bloggers are becoming more prominent some of them are our very own soldiers instead of cowering from the possible ill effects of blogging such as operations security violations it is important that we embrace this new use of technology to tell our story commanders at all levels are making tremendous strides in working with reporters for stories operation iraqi freedom i and subsequent rotations have all included embedded reporters from the several hundred reporters that followed troop units as they moved from kuwait into iraq to the several dozen that remain throughout the country today long and shortterm embedding hasmedia is the battlefield 2006 newsletter for official use only 3provided some of the best most comprehensive reporting of the war commanders now fully understand that one substantial duty of command is to meet the press the army news services growth has been dramatic the army homepage and its multiple functions in support of viewers make it the most impressive web page in the us governments inventory as installation and forwardbased web pages continue to follow suit we can expect more strides in functionality finally the most impressive development from the combat theater is the use of the digital video and imagery distribution system the system first used from iraq by the 1st cavalry division in 2004 allows units from virtually anywhere in the battlespace to link with satellite for live and taped interviews with any commercial media outlet worldwide the system provides for direct news feed for example to local television affiliates in way that simply was not possible with any prior technology it is important that pa practitioners make use of all means at their disposal to tell the army story it is clear that if left to chance the story that is told will not offer true and full depiction of what is occurring on the ground introduction army pa is facing stern challenge as the army enters new century pa must adapt to major advancements in technology growing expectations for development of information and heightened need to communicate ideas army pa must adopt public relations model to maximize the potential strengths of current force structures in both installation offices and operational pa units using new practices that effectively present the army message and are consistent with army values this effort will require focus on public relations techniques and reduction of journalistic practices this article provides set of ideas aimed at altering the approach of pa practitioners and commanders in pa operations the new approach will require use of pa personnel that does not necessarily represent current doctrine and practice it does not however contradict legally mandated edicts for honesty timeliness and accuracy despite years of downsizing the army remains large and enduring institution however although we would like to believe that the army is an organization whose relevance is selfevident such is not the case what remains for commanders and pa practitioners is the need to remain connected to the american people in highly visible and ongoing way thorough refocusing of pa efforts and skills will ensure such connection is achieved why does the force need to change many members of the media growing segment of congress and large majority of the american public have never served in the military many states have military installations in short the lives of our military members and the american public are intersecting less and less it is incumbent on our military leaders to engender understanding of and support for the actions we take in preparing and executing our national military strategycenter for army lessons learned 4 for official use onlyin the end internationally if adversaries are sure we can defeat them they are more likely to stay in their box if americans know how good we are they will support our needs if our basepost neighbors know how important our mission is they will put up with noise and traffic if each soldier knows the story he will be better soldier1 moreover americans through the media are far more inclined to listen to senior officers than junior soldiers on large substantive issues such as readiness efficacy of operations and future development both types of interviews with both junior soldiers and senior officers are necessary and are necessary often senior leaders must step out of the shadows take the prudent risks and talk to the american people why must army pa change pa like any operation is commanders program although paos execute pa missions without direct commander involvement only mediocre results are possible commanders must establish clear pa objectives paos adopting some of the ideas below can develop the commanders plans and maximize use of all means available to effect results the us armed forces are populated by the finest military professionals in the world soldiers at all levels must understand that they are part of the team that will achieve pa results concerted effort to tell the military story is necessary as an ongoing way of military life the world of instant media and the reality that the public quickly shifts its attention to other events demands great effort to maintain public relations edge it doesnt make any difference how good you are if nobody knows it take the marine example when you hear that word marine it evokes variety of images mostly positive but you are certainly not left without an emotional response thats partly because they have 160000 pr peopletheir total force2 world of ideas commercial organizations compete in world of ideas through advertising and public relations in this vast marketplace lies numerous media outlets and venues radio television every form of print publication the internet music billboards handbills and phone banks of course there is commensurate ongoing competition among the various media outlets to capture information and deliver it to widely diverse set of audiences although the army and other military organizations are not in direct competition with national commercial institutions for market share commanders and paos can harness the competition between the information publishers and brokers to forward the armys ideas and positions the media intensely seek out new information to sell their product innovative commanders and paos can leverage regularly scheduled and special events for greater media impact by employing deliberate program of continuous interaction with key members of the media and other influential community leaders exploiting the use of personalities perhaps the most controversial of changes in an army culture that stresses team accomplishment is exploiting the abilities of certain individuals by repeatedly putting them in the media spotlight senior leaders with charisma and media savvy can become media personalities and therefore respected spokesmen for the armymedia is the battlefield 2006 newsletter for official use only 5while this ostensibly runs counter to the institutional desire to avoid cult of personality it can provide benefits to the organization for many years gen colin l powell until becoming secretary of state was popular circuit speaker he related his military experiences to rapt audiences despite having retired in 1993 gen powell may indeed be rarity however many bold personalities are within our ranks the army must make concerted effort to identify such personalities and use their media talents for organizational advantage although this individual focus undoubtedly will cause some discomfort the advantages are clear 1 the army gains credible consistent outlet for its message 2 in time of crisis that same credible figure can make an instant connection with the american public and 3 interviews with highprofile figures will transcend past individual publications or broadcasts and often will be used in multiple outlets reorganization effective future army pa will blend the current triad of community relations comrel internal information also known as command information and media relations into singleminded effort based on commanders stated intent for pa this intent created with the assistance of the pao is to describe the commanders goals for providing information to key public groups and the general public to meet the recurring information needs of key public groups and to conform to higherlevel pa guidance restructuring pa offices with the new focus on conducting public relations will require little if any changes in numbers of personnel indeed current pa manning for comrel command information and media relations is sufficient to create new public relations team pa offices cannot and should not compete with commercial newspapers smalltown newspapers with little or responsibilities for comrel or media relations publish newspapers with staffs that dwarf most pa offices installation newspapers usually have one editor and small number of reporters the reporters and to some degree the editors may have only few years of experience reporters on commercial newspaper staffs may have many years of experience and much greater educational backgrounds than soldierjournalists additionally commercial newspapers may employ sectional editors ie sports news community it is apparent that despite the best efforts of installation staffs to prepare newspapers their current focus on news items irrespective of any commanders intent for pa cannot yield the quantity or depth of commercial newspaper more importantly pa staff members in public relations model are part of the team not roving reporters looking for scoop the current focus on collecting news should be abandoned by employing methods that are focused on the needs of the commander and key public groups installation and operational pa staffs can refocus post newspapers using model that provides necessary information supports the commanders intent for pa and maximizes the strengths of current pa manning policiescenter for army lessons learned 6 for official use onlyinternal notes and publications post newspapers have become marginalized in importance with the emergence of computer communication for providing command information in seconds commanders can distribute command information to each key subordinate and quickly gain meaningful feedback other relatively new developments such as the commanders cable channel on continental united states installations internet bulletin boards and public folders on intranets further limit the usefulness of the post newspaper as tool of command information however that does not mean that post newspapers should be eliminated indeed new developments in technology can assist in the new approach suggested in this article other than the bulletinboard type of information that appears in every newspaper many future articles should be designed for internal andexternal audiences some articles will of course lend themselves to only the internal audience each army journalist must demonstrate knowledge of the commanders intent for pa every article must withstand the scrutiny of the pao in meeting the requirement to support the mission of the command the post newspaper is not venue for attempting to win pulitzer prize for examining societys latest problem unless such an examination supports the needs of the commander training of army journalists will require adjustments in focus soldierjournalists will not approach subjects for articles in the same manner as commercial reporter as member of the organization army journalists will work from the commanders intent in developing information articles gripandgrins using gripandgrin photo opportunities which include soldiers receiving awards and ribboncutting ceremonies represents change in the mindset of todays pa practitioners many commanders and command sergeants major ask for such efforts from their paos often meeting at least some resistance indeed past regulations suggest such events yield little in the way of newsworthiness3however concerns about newsworthiness simply miss the point such opportunities provide the commander with tool for achieving his information needs paos should reexamine the reasons for their reluctance gripandgrin photos while not always useful for newspapers can have positive internal or external public relations effect further with the emergence of digital photography production of photos is much easier sharing the photos is also quick through email and posting on web sites paos can consider creating systems that incorporate gripandgrins in support of the commanders intent for pa create short biweekly newsletter that uses gripandgrin photos publish the newsletter only as an email item and send it to an established distribution list expand the list to key external recipients when appropriate although some paos may consider this timeconsuming once template is built it will require little maintenance the installation comrel chief can be the newsletter editor although this represents departure from the current responsibilities of the internal information chief it will further tie comrel to the overall pa plan and foster solid relationships to key internal and external audiencesmedia is the battlefield 2006 newsletter for official use only 7furnish copies of photos via email for persons involved as part of the commanders pa plan within reasonable constraints future technological advancements such as email accounts that are permanently tied to individuals will increase the ability to make this program grow use the opportunities to discover useful stories ensure the articles can serve internal and external purposes stories must support the overall pa plan judge each article against that standard market outlets create an electronic file that includes email addresses web sites fax numbers and points of contact for local regional and national media outlets this data is important in forming the structure of the database but that is only part of the process such lists while useful require constant updating not unlike the improvement of defensive position working the lists is essential to successful implementation of ongoing and future projects by working the lists the pa practitioner routinely calls or contacts the primary outlets and just as importantly constantly seeks out new media outlets send cover letters and prepackaged material such as video products special edition newspapers and visitors guides to broad range of targeted local regional and national media outlets often periodicals with seemingly apparent interest in military matters city and county newsletters and newspapers scientific journals documentary writers and producers of various types consult with the chief of army pa angeles branch specialinterest publications and business magazines will see something in your packet that they can use4in addition there may be daily newspapers and television affiliates outside the local installations normal circulation area which may not have been considered before that are interested in various projects this effort is endless there are thousands of media sources that have constant need for story ideas it is important to note that many print broadcast and internet reporters have limited knowledge of military matters coach them along and develop interest where there may have been none before make strong effort toward providing opportunities for reporters to participate in events to the fullest extent allowable by law and good sense you may think your threeday multiple launch rocket system livefire exercise is business as usual however it may be the first time the reporters and the general public sees the sky ignited by streaking rockets staying current remaining current is the hard work of the pa business develop plans that ensure recurring events or key army strengths are presented forcefully and often for example cbs news followed the progress of student through the ranger course one summer the series of stories that resulted from that coverage demonstrated the commitment hard work and sense of duty required to complete the course it was great series however those stories aired more than 10 years ago virtually potential recruit rotc student or west point prospect has any recollection of the reports key army stories cannot be told once and for all through an article radio broadcast or television episode see superreporting below using the example above other logical stories could have been or could be coverage of the armys best ranger competition documentary on ranger missions or training or series of print humaninterest stories such stories offer poignant portrayal of the meaningful and rigorous work of the force and more importantly provide solid humanface connection between the force and the american publiccenter for army lessons learned 8

lessons learned planning factors and important media tips manipulation of the public in the bygone era of limited media outlets and few key media representatives reporters public relations specialists sometimes sought to manipulate the public through clever occasionally deceptive methods this could explain the development of an army pa apparatus that was to be seen as distinct from public relations two factors have largely moved the public relations profession away from such practices the first factor has been the explosion of media outlets print and electronic through such means as improved distribution the internet and 24hour cable television these factors alone have made it impossible to easily manipulate views over sustained period of course there are exceptions the second factor has been the general professionalization of the public relations community public relations specialists understand the sustained power of the truth more importantly they see themselves as professional advisors to their clients on business practices their advice can sometimes result in business changing its behavior in way that maintains its goals and may mitigate potential crises it also can enhance the publics perception of the company by demonstrating responsible approach to dealing with potentially explosive issues use of conferences major corporations employ convention organizers to schedule conventions conferences and seminars armyrelated organizations such as the association of the united states army and others plan and execute similar events the army and its major subordinate commands can develop highly focused messageintensive events the goals and purpose of such events cannot be limited to photo sessions and general presentations although elements of both will occur plan the events with definite themes establish key media centers follow the event with mediaimpact analysis are command messages coming through what products are receiving the most attentionmedia is the battlefield 2006 newsletter for official use only 9is the reporting based on the facts as the command knows them are there differences in print versus electronic media if so why how timely are reports do stateside media outlets respond to submissions from the pao what methods are employed to check this internet phone calls other have there been policy implications enemy or friendly in theaters of operations superreporting superreporting involves the constant surveillance of electronic broadcasts and printed materials and the anticipation of internal and external information needs and planning factors to maximize opportunities paos must superreport to gain and maintain an information edge over the internal and external audiences paos must understand trends and creatively find ways to take advantage of media information needs electronic databases are an essential element of superreporting pao databases must contain the following elements publicationbroadcast outlet name key points of contact phonefaxemail business mail addresses and street addresses for overnight delivery publication focus and formats ºprint publications ºfrequency such as daily weekly monthly ºgeneral theme general news or specific topics such as military aviation ºcirculation ºgeographical area of concern if applicable ºpublication policies ie acceptance of outside material ombudsman deadlines ºall mentions of the military or installationunit in the past six months electronic outlets ºbroadcast schedule ºnews programming format ºspan of broadcast ie in the case of radio stations watt emission all of the items above can be maintained on an offtheshelf spreadsheet program at higher levels database programs may be more desirable major commands must share their databases and constantly provide other paos with new and promising venues for telling their storiescenter for army lessons learned 10 for official use onlypaos can gain important leadingedge information by joining civic groups attending town council meetings organizing and participating in comrel events and maintaining personal contacts in the community and the media paos should develop informationcollection plans and routinely scour notes for internal and external dissemination such system will allow paos to properly target media outlets prepare useful press releases and schedule welltimed interviews to support commanders programs when deployed paos usually have the added task of producing an internal information publication newsletter perhaps but are not tasked with providing comrel the comrel task is much broader in theater of operations and is conducted as part of information operations by civil affairs personnel paos also have the task of continuing to provide the home installation with internal information in garrison or in theater of operations paos must continue to research and provide for key media opportunities commanders lead the pa effort commanders greatly influence the flow of information as well as the tenor and content of their subordinates media input by being conspicuously prepared to encounter the media the following suggestions provide the basis for commanders and command sergeants major to be more innovative when interacting with the media storyinapocket develop program that ensures key leaders have storyinapocket leaders in each unit can identify significant actions of the unit that have news value most battalions have soldierofthemonth program weaponsskills competition and multitude of other activities units of course will answer honestly when meeting the media but reporters dont know what they dont know about army units at all levels help the media find subject integrity is paramount while ensuring reporters learn about the great things units are doing it is important not to create false impressions about units record promotion of the army in any form that is deceptive in fact or source or puffery gratuitous selfpraise is outlawed as propaganda 5 gratuitous selfpraise however is easily avoidable by being honest when engaging the media it is not gratuitous selfpraise to introduce the winner of the yearly installation rifle competition to the media or to highlight achievements by the local retention noncommissioned officer nco of the year moreover accomplishments of units in the field are worth knowing by the general public such knowledge can even be seen as necessary meet the press where possible develop relationships at home station with individuals in the media invite them to meet and talk to battalion commanders and sergeants major and rightseat annually or more often on local exercises provide reporters with opportunities to see soldiers at work remain forthright in the face of bad news the army has proven its mettle in providing timely and accurate information about situations that have undoubtedly caused great discomfort almost private company can boast of such honesty paos should point that outmedia is the battlefield 2006 newsletter for official use only 11power the hometown news release htnr program paos and commanders must work closely to ensure items are sent to the armyair force htnr the adage all news is local news takes on added significance for soldier stories local newspapers and occasionally television stations are constantly searching for local stories these local stories include news about soldiers who are stationed around the world use the internet to make the htnr grow with minor article adjustments army journalists can provide hometown newspapers with local boygirlmadegood stories that may not fall under the purview of the htnr program army journalists should capture the hometowns of soldiers mentioned in local stories the gathered article can be emailed quickly to the soldiers hometown newspaper with digital photos when possible newspapers especially small outlets with little resources for travel are appreciative of such efforts this effort which is extremely lowcost gives existing stories greater impact provide photographs and articles to the army news service arnews when applicable paos should send photos preferably digital files and articles from their units or installation to the arnews arnewshqdaarmymil and space permitting create photo library on their installation server articles should support the commanders pa intent develop and invigorate installation speaker bureaus military thinkers use initiative in all operations by actively pushing speaker bureau activities paos can seize the initiative and control the high ground speaking at local functions provides chance for unfiltered communications it also is useful in connecting with the american public at the grassroots level because oneonone interaction often has deeper impact than media coverage speakers can include an assortment of officers and ncos working closely with the pao each speaker can deliver key command messages to variety of audiences the more this program is sold the more it is used local organizations often need outside speakers ensure that your own journalists cover the events and write stories know the organization all paos must ensure that they are thoroughly familiar with all facets of the command6the pao should be able to give full command briefing that relates units missions capabilities training methods major weapons systems equipment platforms ongoing projects historical summary and command philosophy pao who does not understand the mission of the organization is not useful member of the staff beyond possessing the simple just the facts knowledge listed above it is essential that the pao understands and can articulate the values of the organization it is of little worth to pa program if pao has bundle of media contacts but is unable to deliver key valuesbased messages commanders and paos should work to craft solid messages that accurately reflect the organizations goals and aspirations find populations of knowledgeable parties with thorough knowledge of the key public audiences the organization and the organizations values the commander and pao continually seek out populations of knowledgeable parties and try to communicate with them paos must ensure key public audiences understand the organizations values and that the command understands the audiences thinkingcenter for army lessons learned 12 for official use onlythe emperor has clothes paos assist commanders in developing list of the key public audiences as mentioned earlier one of the paos major functions is to consistently inform commanders of what these audiences are thinking how does the public perceive the command this feedback is gained through media analysis comrel event afteraction reviews and myriad of other sources including internal and external town hall meeting minutes and civilian town or county council minutes while some paos will insist that this service is already provided this new approach to pa will make such efforts much more vital advising the commander the following example is fictitious its purpose is to provide paos with an understanding the necessity of advising the commander it illustrates how the pao who is not necessarily an expert on the underlying issue can provide sound practical information to commander to limit or eliminate potential pa crises background fort columbia had problem during world war ii it was central transportation point for processing troops route to the pacific theater consequence of this activity was that hundreds of railcars were left in large holding area after the war the railcars sat unused for decades with little notice meanwhile advances in environmental knowledge led to the creation of an environmental office on the installation complete with inspectors and large set of federal regulations inspectors made their way through the installations training areas offices housing areas and ultimately to the rail yard upon examination inspectors discovered numerous major environmental hazards that required significant cleanup local reporters long suspicious of the environmental state of the railcars did not know of the actual depth of the problem some advised the garrison commander to leave the railcars in place and suppress the results of the report obviously the commander could not do that he was obligated to start cleanup effort the commander then was advised to conduct the cleanup but not to make the matter public he faced the dilemma of whether to publicly acknowledge the cleanup effort or to conduct the cleanup without advising the public through media release advice from the pao acknowledging the cleanup effort was only one of the things the commander could do to limit the effects of this situation while he could not possibly placate every faction of the public detailed media campaign could satisfy the public that his installation was doing what was required to address this problem the campaign could start with an announcement of the cleanup effort from the commander include tour of the area have detailed plan for press packets and provide background briefings by installation environmental officers in charge of the cleanup do this both for internal and external purposes the commander initial statement should point out that his installation discovered the problem took steps to alleviate the problem and will continue to announce progress of the cleanup the commander could activate the speakers bureau and arrange through the comrel program for senior officers to talk to important civic groups he could also dispatch briefing teams to speak to key audiences the installation newspaper of course should provide key information about the projectmedia is the battlefield 2006 newsletter for official use only 13in the above example neither the pao nor the commander are environmental experts however both have applied good sense and integrity to potentially explosive situation had the commander chosen to ignore the problem the situation details could have leaked to the media leading to scandal angle in the media coverage had the commander chosen to start the cleanup and not informed the media similar scenario could have played out by addressing the issue up front the commander and pao were able to set the conditions for message that showed that the installation was conscientiously attacking the problem and dealing with it systematically again this will not satisfy everyone in the public or the media such state is probably not possible with any course of action however the key audiences and the general public will not view this issue as scandal ensure that feedback given to the commander provides accurate data this is time to hold back needed information for fear of upsetting sensibilities too often commanders are told that the military is held in high esteem and it is left at that in fact such general respect is easily displaced by specific negative information handled poorly bad information festers and transcends an otherwise high opinion of the military role of the pao as information continues to grow in importance the role of the pao must change to support the commanders critical need to know what key audiences think the pao can longer simply function as funnel through which news clippings pass the pao must provide the commander with advice on how to

additionally and more importantly pa as an entire commodity must be used at the brigade tf level and below note although this article concentrates on brigade tflevel staff the same considerations and processes discussed can be applied to other combat support separate combat service support separate and special operation forces units that do not have organic pa assets pa assets with the exception of joint combined unified brigade tf headquarters separate or enhanced brigades and armored cavalry regiments there are organic pa assets available below divisionlevel units however this fact does not relieve the brigade tf commander of pa responsibilities brigade tfsize and smaller elements often work in an autonomous environment that is devoid of its habitual divisional relationship there are instances when higher headquarters pa staff is unable to provide timely support andor pa guidance perhaps the limited numbers of pa assets deployed are unable to provide support to battalion and companylevel units doctrinally the two sources for tactical pa support are pa sections organic to warfighting headquarters and pa units the four basic pa units are pa detachments mobile pa detachments

themes or messages for the brigade tf will these change from phase to phase of the operation how long has the media been operating in sector who is the medias audience what is the media angle or slant on key events could pa tactical assets become operationally controlled by the brigade tf during certain periods of the operation detect allocation of resources should occur during this phase do not fixate on organic pa resources or assets information may be the most valuable resource that must be allocated within the tf for example is the key talking point during the defense portion of the operation focused on the fact that the brigade civil affairs teams primary focus is the safety of all civilians and civilian infrastructure are units within the brigade able to support embedded media is the local radio station viable asset for use as pa medium deliver once again call newsletter 023 serves as the best reminder that attack assets can be both lethal and nonlethal the intent of civilmilitary operations cmo is to obtain cooperation from the local populace integrating pa operations during the deliver phase serves as the marketing outlet to inform the populace and peripheral audiences of this cooperation thus providing wider basis of support in this particular example the pa asset or method that can best support cmo must be decided during the decide and detect phases assess this is probably the hardest phase as you try to quantify or measure the success of pa operations especially when it involves media facilitation arguably this phase requires the most assistance from higher headquarters pa organic assets assessment has the biggest effect on future pa operations additionally this is the phase where the military can exercise the least amount of control on what product the media finally puts out by exercising careful detailed planning during the previous three phases even at the brigade tf level you can control the results of pa operations the focus during the assess phase must be based on the 50percent rule during any given media event you control half and they control the other half appendix d of chapter 2 below is sample format for media analysis

example everyone seems to have digital cameras did an industrious platoon sergeant provide the only photo taken of two soldiers sharing smile during joint training with coalition force did the local press use it did the product in this example support the talking point identified in the detect phase of the targeting process trends suggest key issues who on the brigade tf staff gets assigned to deal with pa operations there is doctrinal answer for who handles the pa portion of targeting and synchronization on brigade tf staff frequently the judge advocate general andor the brigade tf adjutant serve as the unit pa representative upar however the trend during rotations at the jrtc has been to assign either the brigade staff judge advocate or the brigade adjutant in some instances both have been assigned the task some additional points to consider include the staff officer or staff noncommissioned officer nco assigned the additional task or duty of being the upar should be present during the planning targeting or synchronization process the staff officer or staff nco assigned as the upar does not by default have to be the person responsible for physically escorting or facilitating the media this is the role of the unit media facilitator umf view the upar as the planner and the umf as the executor of the paoplan what products should be developed in targeting pa in the decide phase of targeting the brigade tf upar is responsible for developing the brigade tf pa annex to the brigade tf order as with any portion of the higher headquarters opord or frago it should serve as base to create brigade product the same principle applies to pa operations too often at the jrtc the substitute for solid brigade pa annex is to xerox the division or higher headquarters portion of the pa annex for distribution the result is an unrefined product that brigade subordinate elements do not read the example in appendix b chapter 2 paoplan is short and concise ensuring that subordinate staff and commanders can easily use it to plan and execute of pa operations how can brigade sustain effective pa training often pa training is the last thing on the brigades agenda units that have the most success with pa operations have sustained frequent training within their units by doing the following ensuring soldiers at all levels gain confidence in talking with the media and telling their units story incorporate this skill into the units lanes training in mediaonthebattlefield environment with assistance from local or homestation organic pa assets training upars and umfs with local or homestation organic pa assets to gain better understanding of what installation or divisional pa assets do for living some brigade tf staffs have successfully implemented processes or

office rather it provides systematic approach to synchronize pa within the planning process and mesh it with what the rest of the brigade tf is doing too often pa is not part of the synchronization process it becomes an afterthought or an isolated decision that does not meet expectations include pa in the targeting process rely on organic higher headquarters pa assets to answer the hard subjectmatterexpert questions this article also should drive home that synchronization is the key to proactive paoplan for example proactive paoplan takes the guesswork out of determining when and if higher headquarters is going to make the brigade tf embed media seeing where pa fits into the brigade tf plan at least 24 to 48 hours out provides the brigade staff options on how to best meet higher

public radio stations majormarket newspapers and television stations i can see that there is propaganda campaign against us or at the very least serious problem with misinformation in my area of operations my brigades mission is to bring stability to the chaos while fighting determined enemy on the streets the public is hungry for information they will devour lies or in the absence of information fill the void with rumors unless i provide the truth as i know it for the past six months brigades have entered the jrtc with resource never before available the jrtc allows brigades to conduct public and command information in support of combat operations at the tactical level with the media as condition of the battlefield rather than separate training event some paos do very well and others struggle the role of the pao brigadelevel paos are now part of the norm and an army at war will require paos to succeed clearly there are lessons learned that should be shared there are four common themes of successful brigade paos at the jrtc paos organize for and conduct future and current operations on the staff the pao team develops stringers and unit public affairs pa representatives upars to support command information and public information paos are resourced with communications and electronic newsgathering equipment to accomplish their tasks paos understand and know how the local information environment works doctrine already describes the role of the brigade pao chapter 8 of fm 3611 public affairs tactics techniques and procedures ttp says that working as both special staff officer and as member of the brigades planning team the brigade pao acts as the spokesperson for the unit advisor to the commander and provides pa guidance and planning to commanders at all levels today brigade paos sit side by side with psychological operations officers civil affairs ca team intelligence officers and information officers as members of the us armys new modular brigades and brigades who have organized for success in an information environment the brigades staff battle rhythm includes lethal and nonlethal targeting meetings under the emerging doctrine of effectsbased operations arguably nearly every operation becomes brigade fight with brigade plan there are three or more daily briefings to the commander or his designated representative there are rehearsals of all types combinedarms rehearsals logistics rehearsals communications rehearsals and rehearsals for rehearsals given all the meetings some paos might start to consider public and command information as distractionmedia is the battlefield 2006 newsletter for official use only 29the pao decides where he should be and given the gravity of future operations and the need to set the conditions for his battalions success tomorrow successful paos are serving primarily as planners getting the job done the first dilemma facing the brigade pao is how to divide and accomplish the tasks at hand soldiers are responsible for any perceived success successful brigade pao organizes to conduct future and current operations he takes the responsibility of planning future operations and allows his soldiers to conduct current operations he looks 24 48 72 and 96 hours out in conjunction with other staff officers he develops plans that direct battalions to perform pa tasks this planning is accomplished through the effectsbased operations process he continually refines his plans based on feedback and analysis and shares his analysis with other staff officers in turn the pao contributes to or writes fragmentary orders separate plans and annexes the pao anticipates challenges and makes recommendations that allow the brigade to fight and win in an environment that is dominated by realtime news and information he helps shape the environment by conducting embedded media opportunities hosting media events and developing public information products engaging the media personally or through designated members of the unit paos are only successful because of the superb noncommissioned officers and young soldiers working alongside them often these soldiers come directly from advanced individual training they are skilled at broadcast operations and print journalism but they are new to the process of being on staff the pao trains his staff and onthejob experience refines how they function the pao continues planning for the future and relies on his soldiers to conduct pa current operations ie anything that happens in less than 24 hours pa soldiers track the battle in the brigade tactical operations center they play major role in producing public and command information they focus on the close fight by monitoring the local media receiving media contact reports analyzing trends and making assessments they help staff pa products and keep the pao informed while the pao attends meetings briefings and planning sessions brigade pa soldiers create products such as press releases video news releases and radio spots in support of the paos plan they read understand and enforce pa policies and procedures from the tactical to strategic level they prepare for and execute media opportunities such as interviews and media events likewise they train others to perform pa tasks recently one pa soldier determined that there was pattern for misinformation on the local radio station through careful tracking using staff duty log the soldier gave the information to her pao who in turn was able to use other brigade resources and minimize the effects of misinformation and propaganda some might argue that it was someone elses job the pa soldier however was the only one besides the public who was paying attention the brigade is very large in terms of number of troops and expanse across the battlefield how do they increase their range and effectiveness stringers and upars pa soldiers are welltrained in developing news for the commander and enabling better understanding of lessons learned tasks and purpose throughout the army evidence from brigades recently deployed from jrtc directly into theater shows that command information remains crucial however the brigade pao teams time and range are limited to accomplish the commanders goal brigade paos use stringers and in some cases upars to supportcenter for army lessons learned 30 for official use onlycommand information and public information upars are trained at home station by pa soldiers they learn how to prepare subjectmatter experts for interviews upars learn and apply communications skills with media embeds or during select media opportunities upars submit media contact reports during and after scheduled and chance encounters with the media as part of its current operations function the pa office refines reports and keeps the chain of command informed of the local media environment at jrtc one pa soldier identified uncredentialed media through contact report and with the help of other staff members was able to prevent imposters from gaining access to forward operating base upars serve closely with battalion commanders as lowerlevel subjectmatter experts on pa plans and policy on embedding the media engaging the local media and conducting media opportunities at the battalion level this added expertise gives the commander more time and flexibility to engage the media at the time and place of his choosing often resulting in better preparation the additional duty of upar is often assigned to the battalion s1 experience at the jrtc has shown that the best upars are not necessarily members of any one designated staff section rather they are volunteers who are motivated for the task and are reliable one battalion commander selected his fire support officer to serve as the upar another chose ca soldier assigned to the battalion in both cases the upar had skills and expertise the commander preferred over his s1 the results were better interviews because both upars were better prepared and more comfortable in the media setting upars and stringers are the brigade paos direct link liaison of sorts to battalions upars function best when they are equipped with digital cameras and reliable communications equipment although upars broaden the paos effective range without the necessary equipment neither the pao nor the upar will effectively aid their commander successful brigade pao is resourced with communications and electronic newsgathering equipment to accomplish his tasks brigade paos are constrained by time terrain and the enemy at the jrtc the pao operates in an area where battalions are dispersed over 2700 square kilometers with determined foe who uses all tactics available to kill us soldiers the pao often lacks language skills to communicate with the local media but he still must accomplish mission tools of the media trade the brigade pao uses his own soldiers stringers and upars to gather images and stories with digital cameras to support urgent information requirements images are passed electronically from the point of action to the release authority rapidly through secure and nonsecure mediums digital cameras are supplied to the brigade and battalions for the specific purpose of gathering and developing news products the brigade pao uses the digital video and imagery distribution system and dedicated video editing system to produce and distribute video products to local television and the higher headquartersmedia is the battlefield 2006 newsletter for official use only 31one brigade commander chose to announce the arrival of his brigade on local television and radio in an area of operations ao his message clearly had public information value and did not violate the paos integrity the pao cleared the release through his staff and the release authority the public met the brigade commander early by virtue of his pao dedicated voice communication is must the pao relies on his higher headquarters for senior pa guidance one pao was denied dedicated phone causing the local media to be frustrated when they called the tactical operations center where either one spoke arabic or soldiers did not want to speak to them betterresourced pao used his phone to contact the media following deadly attack on newspaper office he was able to build rapport with the journalist through an act of compassion one brigade commander who saw his pao as key asset resourced the pao with an interpreter with proper training time and trust the interpreter helped the staff gain cultural understanding served as an assistant for media analysis and communicated directly with the media when the pao could not the information environment all the resources in the world are insufficient if pao does not understand the capabilities he brings and the dynamics of his information environment as the staffs expert the pao must understand the local information environment in detail successful brigade paos build estimates for their ao they consider and use all available resources for gathering news and disseminating information they know and understand the news cycle in their area so they can make an impact on news products at the right place and time one brigade pao knew the time and place for an upcoming combat operation and prepared preapproved press releases to coincide with the production of the daily newspaper he anticipated consequences and when the time was right tactically he released information to the public and filled the void the brigade pao understands the dominant news mediums and their constraints he makes recommendations to the command on how and where to engage the media he builds information folders on the media in his ao with the help of his pa soldiers he continuously assesses the local media and refines the overall plan conclusion doctrine is in place brigade paos are powerful addition to the brigade combat team and its staff successful paos are practicing planning as primary function with wellorganized staff they are developing their organization through training at home station and gaining effective stringers and upars they are resourced with personnel and technology to communicate with their command and the media successful brigade paos are experts in their craft and prepared to operate at the tactical level of the military information

had swept through just moments earlier emerging satisfied there were hidden threats the colonel wasnt so sanguine in fact he was paralyzed by fear at what he saw confident looking man sat at desk across from the brigade commander the local disc jockey dj appeared to have an equal amount of experience in his craft as the colonel the dj moved fluidly and issued instructions to his staff as the commander entered the room they were late for the scheduled show the dj looked up at col smith and spoke in arabic leaving the american clueless hand gesture seemed to suggest both haste and desire for col smith to sit down there between them were headsets and two microphones decks of equipment lined the walls there were flashing lights and music was playing col smith was clearly out of his comfort zone everything seemed foreign to col smiths senses we didnt prepare for this col smith said to himself the pao who had the foresight to bring video camera and col smiths interpreter took their flanking positions they still had on their body armor and the room seemed like an oven to all three their misery was only beginning the interview seemed like it would never end but of course it did col smith felt defeated and drained he knew he had not prepared for the engagement he also knew and believed such stuff was important after all he knew success here depended on his ability to engage the public warrior ethos he said to himself engage then with calm and firm voice he gave the pao directions to prepare for subsequent opportunities the pao smart young officer gathered team of

radio and print reporters each time he used the six pointsmedia is the battlefield 2006 newsletter for official use only 33build and maintain rapport with the interviewer and audience before during and after the engagement it is always best to greet the audience and host with an appropriate cultural and verbal greeting hand over heart arabic hello first and last names firm handshakes calm demeanor create connection with the audience for example im family man and my kids names are they want to live in safe world just like your children or i graduated from college with degree in science and i know that your nation gave the world its first scientists be polite and professional thank each person who asks you question take notes and answer each question asked be willing to say i dont know but your question is important and ill get you an answer have good interpreter that can express emotions sit or stand straight and look at the interviewer not the interpreter use hand and arm gestures that are natural and friendly think about your answer before you speak pregnant pause might be necessary in order to compose your thoughts show an understanding and appreciation for arabic culture compliment their culture country and traditions continuously use as much arabic as you can dont talk about your pets dont talk about your girlfriends dont joke dont talk about women dont argue about religion use metaphors that will work in the culture to describe enemies mention people places and organizations that are helping you because it builds their esteem and your alliance with them demonstrate knowledge of their history and religioncenter for army lessons learned 34 for official use onlybe confident with your response and the armys purpose dont say if say when its more powerful and positive immediately counter false accusations with denials we arent what you said we are we are _________ you are wrong too much empathy shows weakness speak from position of authority and power dont use uhhhh or ummm it sounds like you are grieving sound enthusiastic and passionate introduce the army values talk about the great ideals of freedom and democratic system look for creative ways to describe your purpose safe and secure environment provide facts that support your purpose react to each question with fact bridge to and close with command message be nested with your higher headquarters and what they are communicating short but complete answers are best allowing for translation remind people about our nations commitments and successes in history have and use facts dollars spent patients treated etc tell about fighting capabilities in general terms in the absence of facts talk about the process for among other things treatment of detainees investigations civil affairs assessments decision making etc our acronyms technical terms slang and some adages wont work plan and conduct the engagement like combat operation conduct rehearsals gather information about your audience the medium you are using and the interviewer use team approach to answering questions share lessons learned laterally and vertically reinforce the commands messages know that your audience will cross over multiple demographic boundariesmedia is the battlefield 2006 newsletter for official use only 35one week later col smith returned to the radio station this time hed taken few extra measures to make the event better engagement his staff had planned for it and rehearsed him thoroughly his messages were nested in those of the higher command he understood and used the six major points his staff had outlined for the engagement the pao and interpreter entered the radio station they greeted the dj with an arabic phrase and hand over heart as sign of respect after an introduction col smith smiled widely he was clearly more comfortable when the time was right they all entered the studio together the commander spoke to the interviewer he took time to build rapport he answered each question he realized that his message would be heard by hundreds of thousands in multiple audiences satisfied with his engagement the team left they had planned and conducted the

and says that the event should continue with an interview and everyone could accomplish their training objectives one specialist is thrust forward from the platoons ranks to give comments to the supposed media the first question is do you think the us policy in omnistan is authorized according to the principle of just war the reporter asking it has clue as to what constitutes credible answer he accepts whatever is tossed his way and the interview continues for four or five minutes then the reporters and their pao observer express gratitude and depart to find other soldiers and repeat their drill report is sent by the platoon to higher headquarters story appears in newspaper from the interview the event just ends and so goes mediaonthebattlefield training an opportunity was lost here this was superficial media training and its dangerous superficial media training is dangerous media has been thrown in to train soldiers on how to react to media on the battlefield although it was an impressive idea it had been merely an afterthought when the scenariobased training exercise was developed the mediaonthebattlefield training was poorly conceived and planned the unit in training had little or previous training for media on the battlefield prior to the encounter and one knew the units standing operating procedures sop for dealing with media the roleplayer journalists were not sufficiently trained for the task they were to perform and they were not resourced properlymedia is the battlefield 2006 newsletter for official use only 37the media role players public affairs pa soldiers with the fresh enthusiasm of postdefense information school training were injected at an illogical point in the scenario they wore civilian clothes and carried equipment that made them look like journalists but they did not know the scenario and asked unrealistic questions there was report in the news of the incident later because the scenario did not include an information environment complete with newspapers television and radio for the training the commander who had asked for mediaonthebattlefield training understood the importance of training and wanted his pao to play role he knew from his own experience that the public has need indeed right to know about us military operations within certain operational constraints likewise he understood that there is competitive strategy among our adversaries to misinform or exploit media for the purposes of propaganda he wanted his soldiers to know how to react to media on the battlefield and he wanted to see if he could communicate certain messages to the public unfortunately unrealistic portrayals of media on the battlefield reinforce bad habits and perceptions of journalists on the battlefield when the platoon finally deploys it encounters embedded local and international media on the battlefield and the world reads watches and listens as opportunities to tell the soldiers stories are lost with little preparation creativity planning and resources training centers can create an information environment that promotes effective mediaonthebattlefield training fixing media training start with internal procedures the battalion should have sop for incidental contact with media deliberate media engagements and embedded journalists the sop may require the company or battalionlevel organization to assign certain responsibilities to unit pa representative or stringer sops also should address procedures for reporting media contact sops should give guidelines for preparing for media interviews and procedures for hosting embedded media and media opportunities fragmentary orders or the operations order for the scenario also may include mediaspecific tasks or coordinating instructions next develop an information environment that makes sense and is supportable with available resources pa planner should be included for scenario development he should understand the scenario and the environment in which the unit is operating he can create replicated news mediums such as newspaper television newscast or radio broadcast which can be evaluated for content by unit leaders later then build pa architecture with higher headquarters involvement media engagements require the participation of multiple military and civilian echelons that are easily portrayed by actual or roleplaying staffs there should be higher headquarters that directs media procedures in the scenario realistic training aids such as credentials for roleplaying media ground rules for media and pa guidance should be produced and disseminated select assemble train and resource media role players soldiers can be used but there are great benefits to using civilians civilians are less enamored by rank also by using civilian media role players the training audience will recognize that the media are not fellow soldiers in disguise the dynamic of unfamiliarity favors realism in training for media on the battlefield you must train role players for mediaonthebattlefield scenarios role players should be given character description so they can act the part they should understand the media credentialcenter for army lessons learned 38 for official use onlysystem ground rules and the scenario in general they should be capable of engaging in dialogue to determine the essential elements of news story they should be able to operate assigned newsgathering equipment such as cameras and personal computers they also should be able to independently compose news story for print or broadcast resource media role players to act like journalists first the role player needs an identity badge to serve as credentials the design of the badge should be clearly marked for training only and should show the individuals photograph and identification number in accordance with the unit sop or scenario pa guidance next the role player needs communications device of some type eg cell phone so he can if necessary dictate news piece and expedite production of news story for radio or print cell phone also helps with command and control by the exercise controller the role player will need digital camera laptop computer with wordprocessing and photoediting software and removable drive if the information environment includes television replication media role players may require handheld video camera and digital editing system all media role players should have the ability to maneuver independently by automobile in the training area and be afforded base of operation where media products are edited reproduced and distributed certify media role players with rehearsal assign stories make precombat inspections of equipment and practice interviews roleplayer certification ends with the production of replicated newspaper or clipsheet television news broadcast or radio news broadcast next conduct classroom training with soldiers training circular tc 7981 stability and support operations training support package provides good model for briefing soldiers on media qualified pa representative should give the doctrinally accepted standards for engaging media conducting interviews etc the pa representative should explain actions required by the unit sop during this phase the trainer should explain the imperatives of communicating with media including the following topics preventing disclosure of classified information ensuring accuracy to preserve credibility avoiding comments on policy decisions maintaining propriety the trainer should also discuss constitutional obligations department of defense dod directives and the commands own stated philosophy finally the class should address theater or scenario restrictions derived from dod pa guidance and unclassified tactics techniques and procedures you are now ready to conduct mediaonthebattlefield training the commander determines how and where he wants to introduce media on the battlefield he may choose to embed media assign media with other civilians on the battlefield or assign visiting media to conduct media opportunity for specific event an observer may accompany the media roleplaying team the commander can assess the units ability to react to or engage media by the performance of individual tasks the resulting media product or combination of both but how does the commander decide where to inject media on the battlefieldmedia is the battlefield 2006 newsletter for official use only 39execution one option is to embed media with the platoon in essence the platoon is carrying an added member into the fight the platoon will need to be aware of the media safeguard information build rapport and communicate embedded media provide another set of eyes on the inner workings of the platoon which helps the command to see itself an embedded media role player in the earlier example might have written headline that read us patrol thwarts attack near omniville the story would include firsthand accounts of the platoons actions rendered by sympathetic member of the patrol the platoon leader would have time to articulate his purpose and give credible information to the embedded journalist so that the public understands the units intentions and mission another option is to place media among the local population in training this means that media role players see the unit as outsiders and report on their actions as perceived by the local populace placing media in builtup areas or among the population adds realistic dimension to training placing media among the local population might generate the following headline insurgents ambush patrol near omniville 10 killed the story might call to question the presence of the us patrol and drive other elements in the training environment to action or it might account for the units followon actions in the town and the leaders efforts to set conditions for humanitarian support the platoon leader may have of his own accord or by specified task in his operations order granted an interview to the reporter in the village one other option is to have the patrol perform task that relates to or serves media objective one such task might be for the platoon to establish security at site and prepare to receive media in this case the resulting story in the newspaper might describe schoolopening ceremony the platoon sergeant might render quote to hosted media that supports headline like this army sergeant were helping restore hope for kids in all cases media product results from the scenario and is produced after the actual mission ends there may be tasks that occur throughout the training event that are associated with individual skills fm 461 public affairs operations tc 7981 fm 3611 public affairs tactics techniques and procedures and various common task manuals address tasks that should be conducted when media are encountered but dissecting each properly performed task and rendering the armys standard of go or go may be shortchanging our commands true intention which is to communicate with the public through the media throughout this exercise higher headquarters supports training by analyzing media products and advising the commander on media task performance the trainer in the examples above is able to assess media perceptions and advise the command on how to improve training for media on the battlefield successfully executed training allows the unit to revise its sops retrain improve knowledge and build confidence for engaging media at every grade of rank conclusion properly conducted mediaonthebattlefield training requires planning resources preparatory training and followthrough if executed well it can be tremendous learning experience that exercises the command from the lowest level to the highest training headquarters mediaonthebattlefield training exponentially improves the commands ability to communicatecenter for army lessons learned 40 for official use onlywith audiences at home and abroad now and in the future it can also allow the command to see itself through anothers eyes something that often happens too late for remedy with realistic training second platoon would have been equipped with knowledge before it deployed with realistic training our leaders have trained generation of soldiers who understand the importance of engaging media on the battlefieldmedia is the battlefield 2006 newsletter for official use only 41chapter 6 media on the battlefield nonlethal fire cpt david connolly center for army tactics command and general staff college public affairs pa and the media play key role in operation iraqi freedom oif this operation proves that now more than ever the us military must be prepared to engage the media and provide timely factual information this article shares some experiences with the media during operation enduring freedom and the early stages of oif the intent is to explain from companyfield grade point of view how media played part in the operations and how tactics techniques and procedures ttp for engaging the media relate to current doctrine this article also shares thoughts on how fieldgrade officers can prepare themselves to conduct media interviews in todays environment introduction gen eric shinseki former us army chief of staff once said if we do not speak for the army others will the media should be considered as component of nonlethal fires andor nonkinetic targeting another tool to help accomplish the mission the media will write their story with or without input from the field it only makes sense to engage the media to ensure the entire story is told the media is venue where soldiers can pass along command messages that contain truthful and factual information soldiers have nothing to hide however when attempting to carry out orders within the laws of land warfare bad things can happen during these times it is best to confront the media and present the military side of the story when integrated and synchronized with information operations io efforts pa and the media in particular can be force multipliers however it is important to understand the difference between io and pa operations both belong to the io career field io uses deception and unlike pa operations specifically targets the enemy pa operations must be aware of the themes and messages io is pushing during each phase of the operation the intent is to leverage io during the initial phases of oif the coalition forces land component command cflcc always ensured pa planners were involved in the io working groups especially the effects targeting board process this involvement ensured that the pa officer pao would bring information to the media director the media director then would have clear picture of the commanders intent and what the staff was attempting to accomplish armed with this knowledge the media director could prioritize which of the thousands of media queries to work on while still maintaining level of fairness and equity to all reporters as an example prior to crossing the line of departure ld io was pushing themes to the enemy concerning capitulation knowing this the media director pushed reporters out to units responsible for dealing with large numbers of enemy prisoners of war to show the enemy how they would be fed clothed and provided shelter there is always tendency to overclassify information to avoid speaking to the media there are essentially two things you always want to protect timing and intentions you must ask yourself if the information you are providing to the media will give an adversary something they can use against you if operations security opsec or safety concerns make it impossible to support media request then simply say so reporters must understand when they can write or speak about what they see units were very successful during the decisive combat phase of oif in allowing reporters access to command centers the practice of allowing reporters in command centers will be discussed latermedia is the battlefield 2006 newsletter for official use only 43go ugly early is phrase sometimes used in pa bad things happen in war there were nearly 700 embedded reporters with units prior to crossing the ld they saw and heard everything there were many times when something bad happened and soldiers were unsure how to respond when reporter was on the scene there was an incident near the umm qasr area where several civilians were injured by coalition fire an embedded reporter captured the scene as british and us troops attended to the injured initially the troops shouted at the reporter to get back but eventually allowed him to continue to film as long as he remained out of the way the images of the soldiers faces told the story they were concerned that they had injured innocent civilians on the battlefield but the film showed that the primary concern at that point was to provide medical attention the embedded reporter had right to be there to do his job which was to report the activity the unit could have gained even more leverage by engaging the reporter by way of short standup interview with leader on the scene who could have released known information and delivered command message the message could have included sympathy for the injured and how the coalition makes every attempt to avoid civilian casualties followed by basic releasable facts this situation proves that soldiers must be able to articulate their story on the spot without violating opsec in order to do this pa must be incorporated into homestation training the bestcase scenario is when soldiers sailors airmen and marines are the spokespersons not the pao all soldiers must be prepared to answer questions pertaining to their area of responsibility aor third infantry division had the benefit of great deal of training prior to crossing the ld they were on rotation for operation desert spring in the fall of 2002 the division began training embeds where reporters were embedded with units for threetofourday period this training gave the soldiers an opportunity to become comfortable having reporters present 247 as they carried out their duties the reporters saw it all the good the bad and the ugly the reporters also learned how to do their job in the harsh desert conditions they began to learn how their equipment would work how to move with unit and so on the benefit from this experience was evident when the division crossed the ld with the embeds because there were very few problems associated with this new relationship training and experience dealing with the media were not the only issues initially coalition press information center cpic was not established in baghdad there were problems with reporters using press badges issued in kuwait to attempt to get through checkpoints in baghdad there were two types of badges issued in kuwait one for embeds and one for nonembeds the badges issued to nonembeds in kuwait were not intended for use in iraq and were only to be used during coordinated opportunities through the kuwait cpic the cflcc made conscious decision not to use badges in baghdad at the beginning of the war reporters knew their way around the city and did not need pao escort at that time they only needed information on where to go to cover certain activities as time went on and cpic was established badges were issued and controlled preparing for interviews todays military members must be skilled at preparing for media interviews there are generally two types of interviews to prepare for the taped standup interview and the print interview during these interviews one hears the question only the response press conferences are usually reserved for those higher in the chain of command even at the cflcc level decision was made initially not to conduct press conferences because department of defense dod would be conducting press conferences in washington dc and central command would conduct daily press conference in qatar preparing for an interview is basically negotiation stress to the reporter your need for information before you begin ask yourself what the story can do for your unit and the mission think about what phase of the operation you are in what themes and messages is io pushingcenter for army lessons learned 44 for official use onlyhow does this story help leverage them is this the right time to do the story for example prior to crossing the ld in kuwait you may not want to do story about how you are going to fight oil well fires do not give the enemy that information yet after you cross the ld and have passed that phase then proceed with the story many reporters will want fluff stories these are fine but given the choice prioritize stories depending on what phase of the operation you are in if you have not crossed the ld yet story about soldiers training in the desert should be given emphasis over story about women in the army remember you need to send message to the world and the enemy that you are trained and ready you can do story about women in the army later be polite honest helpful and friendly to journalists but remember the mission and soldiers on the ground how can you help them when preparing for an interview do what you do in other military operations gather intelligence ask questions such as what is the story about what angle is the reporter after what aspects of subject is the reporter interested in is the reporter talking to anyone else will you have to augment information he has already gotten will you have to refute information how knowledgeable is the reporter on the subject what does he know about the military what type of stories does this reporter typically write are they pro or antimilitary pro or antiwar gather background information on reporters get their biographies consider asking the journalists to send questions to you you may have to gather facts from other subjectmatter experts on the staff to help you articulate your side or the rest of the story asking for questions also helps you prepare for what might be asked during the interview brainstorm every question you think might be asked especially the difficult ones have response for all questions if you cannot do the interview tell the reporters why more times than not they will understand for example in baghdad news crew had gotten information on an effort to find pilot downed in the 1991 gulf war cflcc would often get offthewall requests such as this however after some investigation it was learned that team was in fact investigating the whereabouts of missing navy commander michael scott speicher for obvious reasons timing and intentions doing the story at that time would jeopardize the investigation after meeting between the news crew and the investigating team it was agreed to wait until time when the information could be released without risking the investigation know what senior leaders are saying about your operation this helps you anticipate questions if you have access to the internet review recent dod transcripts chances are the same questions will be asked at your level you do not have to regurgitate the secretary of defenses responses but you can ensure that your messages are in line and focused on how things are from your foxhole military leaders must be aware of what is being said to avoid their comments being taken out of context for example if the president said yesterday there are indications that foreign fighters are involved in conducting these attacks and you say we have indications of foreign fighter involvement it would appear that you are not on the same sheet of music if you knew what the presidents statement was you could have rephrased your response to more accurately articulate your message the president is speaking for the entire country perhaps in your specific aor there are indications of foreign fighters you could have said in our area there are indications this way you can avoid being taken out of context just being aware is the start point know current events if you are doing an interview tomorrow what happened in the news today that may relate to that interview how does that event impact what you are going to talk about remember you are the military to some journalists matter what the topic stay in your lane and speak to what you knowmedia is the battlefield 2006 newsletter for official use only 45conducting the interview for the purpose of this topic the focus will be on standup taped interviews where the question is never heard the most common situation for most soldiers the interview itself is all about control you want it the reporter wants it you have to learn how to structure effective answers and control the interview do not be questiondriven be messagedriven the trick is to use your messages as guideposts and not repeated phrases this is where skill preparation and experience come in you should be trying to articulate command messages that will positively influence the outcome of your mission use the media as nonlethal fire help raise the morale of that young e4 on the checkpoint if you have the information and it is releasable by all means give it but consider what other information to deliver to tell the remainder of the story structure effective answers you are engaging the media not only to respond to their questions but also to deliver message about your mission that is important for the world to understand again you must ask yourself how you can help soldiers on the ground by providing information to the media to do this you need to structure effective answers or responses you should come to the interview with about three or four messages that you want to deliver think of each message as pyramid figure 61center for army lessons learned 46 for official use onlyinitial brief answer elaborate further expansionstop stopyour response to first question state your message support message illustrate messagepositioning statement hook explanation evidence hook examples analogies hookthe top of the pyramid shows that you should state your message this is your response to the first question for taped standup interview it does not matter what the question is you should deliver your most important message first that way if you are interrupted later the message is already out one will hear the question on taped interview many times even if journalist comes to you with specific question in mind if you deliver clearly articulated message they will use it you may tell them something that they did not know it may look and sound so good on tape that the affiliates editors decide to use it as their sound bite after delivering your message you then need to support your message provide an explanation evidence that supports your initial statement middle of the pyramid at this point provide facts key statistics description of certain program or supporting argument or rationale for example to support statement made about what you are doing in western iraq you can talk about how many patrols you have conducted number of arrests made and food and water delivered if your position statement is that you are doing great things winning the hearts and minds of the iraqi people back the statement up with facts the media may have overlooked the bottom of the pyramid is where you further expand and illustrate your message give prepared example or analogy using the example above you might want to talk about specific raid in one of the towns during this entire process your goal is to be in control of the interview have the reporters follow you hook the reporters interest be passionate about what you are talking about usually the reporter will follow you through one message or pyramid the skill comes in bridging to second or third message the goal is to smoothly transition to your messages so you are not repeating things this takes practice and experience and sometimes bit of charm one key leader who uses this method effectively is colin powell he uses textbook communication skills both during speeches and while talking with reporters he transitions so fluidly the untrained eye may not notice by not sounding like robot he effectively communicates his messages and avoids losing credibility you have to continually bridge back to your messages always be aware which questions are out of your lane the tendency is to attempt to answer all questions the key is to first think about what is being asked if it is not for you to answer transition back on track and state i dont know about that but what i can tell you is or dod might have more information on that but the important thing to remember is flag or spotlight your message with phrases such as first lets clarify the facts or lets look at what is really important the hook is tool you can effectively use to control the interview you want the reporter to follow you the pyramid shows where you can briefly stop between your initial answer and elaboration by offering statement such as you should have seen what happened yesterday or we have this new approach then pause long enough so the reporter can ask well whats that this may not work easily every time especially with savvy reporters but you get the idea remember you want to control the interview embeds during the decisive combat phase of oif cflcc embedded an unprecedented number of reporters the reporters did not seem to mind the structure and limited freedom of movement between units they enjoyed certain sense of security especially when facing many unknown circumstances once decisive combat was declared over many journalists and their affiliates decided it was time to leave the unit and return to traditional reporting for official use only 47media is the battlefield 2006 newsletterembeds became part of the unit they saw military members who went out of their way to do the right thing many times at risk to their own safety embeds saw that soldiers care about limiting collateral damage they saw hundreds of soldiers in command posts struggling all night over target lists and the effects of striking specific targets they saw the amount of work involved in deciding on each and every target they saw soldiers put their own lives in danger to save the lives of civilians on the battlefield the rate of information drastically increased by embedding reporters units did not fully appreciate how much information would be out before it went through the official reporting chain however units still had to be responsible with information and not officially release it until it was confirmed and on the significant activities report there was lot of pressure to confirm things which simply could not be done on the spot reporters were out there and units had to let them report units continued to handle information in the same manner once the information was confirmed soldiers would acknowledge it if unconfirmed they would either refute it or state that to their knowledge it did not happen it is important to understand how embeds were deployed for oif dod asked cflcc how many reporters they could handle given the task organization cflcc worked with subordinate paos to work out specific numbers cflcc then provided dod with number dod took the number and allocated slots to specific affiliates and media organizations those affiliates and organizations assigned personnel to fill the slots not all the reporters assigned as embeds wanted the slot some had been in the aor for months and benefitted from the training embeds some had never been there at all between dod and cflcc the attempt was made to ensure the right reporters and media types were in the right places there was mix of different categories of media spread throughout the task force print tv weekly magazines regionalarab media subordinate commands had input if they desired specific anchor or reporter to embed with their headquarters some already had built good rapport with individuals through training the dod embed list assigned reporters down to division level divisions then pushed them down at times to company level there was some disagreement with allowing reporters in command centers without security clearance units were able to do this without violating opsec by establishing strict ground rules while still being responsible with information some have said we give away too much about our capabilities by letting in civilians without clearances one example given is that reporters learn too much about how far and fast we can go however this information is easily confirmed by events on the ground after unit crosses the ld and executes the mission everybody knows their capability what soldiers must protect are ttp and information they will use again in the future just because reporters are allowed into command center does not mean they are shown every secret in the book you must still be responsible with information it is challenging but doable units need to move away from the tendency to overclassify information while still protecting sensitive information that should remain classified that should be the trend even after the current fight is over it is balancing act that requires thought tomorrow todays graphics and basic plan or concept of the operation may longer be sensitive but some of the ttp required to build them still need to be protected security at the source requires that each individual understands the difference be conscious of the information you are providing and the situation at the time you are providing it protect timing intentions and anything that an adversary can use against youcenter for army lessons learned 48 for official use onlyground rules all reporters who desire access to forces are required to sign ground rules whether they are embedded or not most will abide by them because they want that access enforcing the ground rules however is sometimes difficult security at the source was the rule it became impossible to watch reporter 247 and was especially dangerous when reporters had satellite phones and the capability to go live at any moment geraldo rivera is prime example he went live on air and basically violated all the ground rules he was embedded with the 101st airborne division while they were on the move toward baghdad he scratched out sketch in the sand that showed their formation where they were how far and fast they had traveled and when they would be at their next location luckily it does not appear that his actions ever got anyone killed units always can add to the higher headquarters ground rules one good rule would be to instruct the reporter never to go live unless there is soldier or handler present this would have worked well in the situation with geraldo rivera depending on the reporter they may have good intentions and just not realize that certain piece of information may be sensitive at the time remember reporters are just like soldiers you have to train them and set the standard of conduct at your level ground rule is foolproof one of the cflcc ground rules stated that image or photograph would be taken of deceased coalition soldier the commanding general cg felt strongly about this he did not want family members to learn of their loved ones fate in the media there was much debate with dod on whether it should be ground rule an incident involving the use of photograph of dying 101st airborne soldier by military newspaper resulted in major debate between the cg and the newspaper even when you think ground rule is selfexplanatory or simply in good taste make sure your intentions are articulated in detail conclusion dealing with media effectively requires training and experience you will not personally like every reporter you encounter however you must be able to put your personal feelings aside get on with your mission and allow the reporters get on with theirs when encountering the media you should always ask yourself how you can use this nonlethal fire to help accomplish the mission and most importantly how it will assist the soldier at the checkpoint or on patrol for official use only 49media is the battlefield 2006 newsletterchapter 7 integration of information operations into planning and operating public affairs and the media extract from center for army lessons learned initial impressions report 053 information operations brigadelevel integration in most brigade areas of operations aos in theater the public affairs pa officer pao information operations io coordinator and psychological operations psyop representatives are integrating and employing sound communications strategies this integration may be attributed to smaller staff size and heightened command interest and control at brigadesized units the smaller staff size at brigade level contributes to successful integration of specialty elements because each specialty usually has only one representative at the brigade headquarters the three brigade specialty staff officers most directly involved in communications operations pa io and psyop tend to drift together and begin integrating their efforts command interest and influence is also contributing factor to increased integration of pa io civil affairs and psyop at brigade level the commander of brigadesized unit insisted on proactive information campaign for every civilmilitary operation cmo in his brigade ao coverage of each cmo project was an ongoing effort beginning with announcements at the start of project progress updates during work and media event or ceremony at completion the commander placed heavy emphasis on the distribution of photographs and dissemination of updated information pa and psyop became the primary tools to disseminate information and plan and execute media events at higher levels of command io components are not as well coordinated at these levels the lack of cmo project rollup limits the ability to determine if project has received media coverage the opportunity to leverage local national and international media coverage of more than one billion dollars worth of cmo good news projects in theater has not been fully realized lessons learned the small staff size at brigade level seems to contribute to successful integration of the specialty elements of pa io and psyop cmo projects must have visibility to receive media attention after spending more than billion dollars on cmo in iraq very small percentage was leveraged as positive media coverage media analysis some forms of media collection and evaluation are being accomplished at various levels throughout the theater however an analysis process has not been formalized and information is not shared across staffs and levels of command nearly every io staff interviewed had established some form of media collection cell or was using media data collected by other staff sections to assist them in developing themes messages and measures of effectiveness moe in two units io soldiers and native iraqi speakers staffed the cell in another the psyop and opensource intelligence staff performed media analysis tasks and would give the product to the io staff upon request for official use only 51media is the battlefield 2006 newslettervarious pa desk officers throughout the corps conduct informal media monitoring of webbased news each morning and periodically throughout the day however this process is not formalized formal analysis is being conducted nor is trend data being captured unit pa sections were not robust enough to perform this function and unit g2 sections were not involved in media analysis although almost every unit believed their io section was undermanned most dedicated assets to media analysis because of the importance they placed on it as gauge to assist them in developing io products and evaluating moe multinational forcesiraq and multinational coalitioniraq recognize the benefit and utility of having arab media analysis however staff members are not aware of the media analysis

identified the value of beginning key audience analysis and planning before deploying from home station close analysis of target audiences is needed to address cultural differences that may create need for special communications channels media environment the media cycle in iraq and the middle east tends to be faster than in the west local customs dictate that the remains of the dead be buried as soon as possible often the day of death products supporting io such as flyers television spots or statements that highlight io messages surrounding fatal event are far less effective if not on the street within 24 to 36 hours if not sooner terrorist groups often produce somewhat crude but effective flyers very quickly after one of their members is killed they flood the streets with these flyers to stir emotions among the populace following an incident in which arab noncombatants are killed or wounded by nonarab forces arab media will often play and replay the images on television this endless loop video technique is extremely effective in stirring strong emotions among people who otherwise would be indifferent if coalition forces take 48 to 96 hours to investigate vet messages engage media and disseminate the impressions of the event as portrayed by arab media are already fixed in the minds of the target audiences one corpssized unit pao reports that the pa staff is limited to rebutting incorrect information appearing in the media rather than taking more direct counterpropaganda efforts the corps pa planning officer stated that it is hard to coordinate counterpropaganda directly with the io staff without strategic communications direction from higher headquarters currently the corps pa planner and io staff are trying to work out system to proactively counter propaganda without specific guidance from above in addition to lack of higherlevel guidance the corps is further restrained by the lack of internal assets for countering propaganda or rebutting incorrect information most pa resources in theater that can be applied to the effort reside at the coalition press information center cpic an asset of the senior military headquarters in theater the cpic is located at the convention center in downtown baghdad in close proximity to the hotel complex where the majority of western and international media have established bureau offices the cpic maintains the most uptodate contacts for all arabiraqi media operating in theater the location organization and systems of the cpic make it the most appropriate tool to rebut incorrect information and reactively counter propaganda in this process the corps pao becomes an intermediary passing incidents of incorrect media reporting to the cpic for resolution operationallevel pa enable lower headquarters to counter propaganda by pushing pa down as required for particular events such as brigade or battalion media days press conferences or other operations these efforts could be considered proactive tactical counterpropaganda however there is little planning and coordination with io and counterpropaganda guidance or strategic communication direction from higher headquarters two msc paos hired iraqis with media experience to be their commands arabiraqi media coordinators when the commands schedule events that are open to the media the paos notify the coordinators who in turn notify the iraqi media of the media opportunity the mscs frequently provide transportation for journalists desiring to cover events to facilitate the coverage from iraqi and arab media reporters attending

the most uptodate information for media operating in theater media engagement one of the greatest challenges for brigade paos is getting subordinate battalions to engage news media representatives one brigade pao says this is usually function of the battalion commanders personality some battalion commanders openly welcome media while others only accept media when directly ordered to do so by the brigade commander brigade paos are instrumental in planning coordinating and executing the media embed program in the current iraq theater brigades operate aos that are geographically and culturally different from each other the differences in each brigade ao present unique opportunities for news media brigades receive few requests for embedding from arabiraqi news media representatives one brigade pao reported that he understood there was reluctance on the part of the arabiraqi journalists to embed because they were concerned for their safety arabiraqi journalists said they do not like to be seen traveling with us forces and they do not like to be out at night they are afraid that they may be perceived as working with us and coalition forces in one msc the pao realized that one of the key io objectives to put an iraqi face on the reconstruction efforts was not being accomplished because the responses to media queries were being answered predominantly by coalition members and not by iraqi officials this msc pao staff had earned reputation of being very responsive to news media queries news media operating in the area grew accustomed to dealing with the pao and developed the habit of simply querying the coalition as the primary source for all information the pao staff consistently provided the news media with what they needed quick response from credible source in position of authority in control of the situation however this responsiveness did not help to accomplish prescribed io objectives the pao began to refer news media representatives to the appropriate iraqi agency official or office for responses although this process took longer to get information to the media it enabled the command to better realize its io objectives while still meeting the information requirements of the news media organizations coordinating responses from appropriate iraqicenter for army lessons learned 54 for official use onlyofficials or organizations provided the

extent shape public perception of the national security environment now and in the years ahead this holds true for the us public the public in allied countries whose opinion can affect the durability of our coalition and the public in countries where we conduct operations whose perceptions of us can affect the cost and duration of our involvement our ultimate strategic success in bringing peace and security to this region will come in our longterm commitment to supporting our democratic ideals we need to tell the factual story good or bad before others seed the media with disinformation and distortions as they most certainly will continue to do our people in the field need to tell our story only commanders can ensure the media get to the story alongside the troops we must organize for
