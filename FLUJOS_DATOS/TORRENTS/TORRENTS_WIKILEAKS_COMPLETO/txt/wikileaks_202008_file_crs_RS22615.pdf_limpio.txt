zapateros 2004 election led some to challenge the legitimacy of his victory and contributed to tense political climate during his first term the 2004 elections came thr ee says after islamic terrorists bombed four commuter trains in madrid on march 11 2004 killing 191 persons and wounding over 1800 others until the bombings zapatero tr ailed aznar in opinion polls and observers agree that
