congress medical malpractice an overview summary the rising cost of medical malpractice insurance is of concern to congress largely because of its potential impact on the availability of health care providers and services as malpractice insurance becomes increasingly expensive some physicians claim that premium increases have forced them to limit the services they provide move their practice locations or leave medicine altogether this is especially the case for certain specialists who have experienced the largest premium increases some providers have gone on strike to publicize their plight they cite excessive malpractice lawsuits and unreasonably large jury awards as the causes of the malpractice insurance crisis some lawyer and consumer groups counter that the insurance industry is to blame for the rapid rise in malpractice insurance premiums these groups contend that bad investment choices in addition to the underwriting cycle have led to dwindling profits for insurers who then try to recoup their losses through expensive insurance products abetting this in their eyes is an exemption from the normal federal antitrust law for insurers congressional debate on these issues generally has conformed to the contrasting perspectives mentioned above during the first session of the 109th congress some members notably both house and senate majority leadership attributed the rise in malpractice insurance premiums to frivolous lawsuits and large jury awards other lawmakers respond that spikes in malpractice insurance premiums are the result of the insurance underwriting cycle and sagging insurer investments in addition there is third perspective which has not generated the same level of attention or controversy that sees the overall medical error rate as the root of the problem given the malpractice insurance debates from previous sessions proposals for legal changes hr 5 which has passed the house and s 22 and s 23 which are currently being debated in the senate most likely will be high on the legislative agenda these bills are designed to decrease the overall number of malpractice lawsuits and the payment amounts awarded in successful claims examples of specific reforms include establishing federal statute of limitations restricting attorneys fees and placing caps on the amount juries may award in damages proposals addressing the insurance side s 1525 hr 3359 include range of strategies to constrain the cost of malpractice insurance such as greater oversight of the insurance industry and stabilizing the reinsurer market in order to limit the liability that primary insurers face in the event of extraordinary loss some members also have expressed interest in alternatives to tort and insurance reforms among the proposals introduced during the 109th congress are efforts to disclose medical error data s 554 now pl 10941 establish administrative proceedings s 1337 and award tax credits to physicians to help cover premium costs hr 2291

become increasingly expensive during the past several years some physicians claim that premium increases for malpractice insurance have forced them to limit the services they provide move their practice locations or leave medicine altogether this is especially the case for certain specialists such as obstetricians who have experienced the largest premium increases some providers have gone on strike to publicize their plight they cite excessive malpractice lawsuits and unreasonably large jury awards as the causes of malpractice insurance crisis many physicians support tort reform legislation that would among other things limit the amount juries could award to plaintiffs in malpractice cases certain trial lawyer and consumer groups counter that the insurance industry is to blame for the rapid rise in malpractice insurance premiums these groups contend that bad investment choices in addition to the relatively normal underwriting cycle of higher and lower insurance rates have led to dwindling profits for insurers who then try to recoup their losses through expensive insurance products abetting this in their eyes is an exemption from the normal federal antitrust law for insurers lawyers and consumer groups generally support efforts to reform the insurance industry to address difficulties from rising premiums congressional debate on these issues generally has conformed to the contrasting perspectives mentioned above some members notably both house and senate leadership attributed the rise in malpractice insurance premiums to frivolous lawsuits and large jury awards moreover they argued that such lawsuits and awards make physicians fearful leading to the practice of defensive medicine and adding to overall health care costs1 other lawmakers responded that spikes in malpractice insurance premiums are the result of the insurance underwriting cycle and sagging insurer investments they also point out that capping malpractice awards unfairly penalizes individuals who have been injured due to medical malpractice in the 108th congress the house passed the help efficient accessible lowcost timely healthcare health act of 2003 hr 5 whose centerpiece was limitations on tort claims for medical malpractice on march 13 2003 the senate began consideration of s 11 bill substantially similar to hr 5 on july 7 2003 after two days of debate cloture motion failed and the senate turned to other business with vote on the underlying bill narrower bill s 2061 to 1 see economic report of the president council of economic advisers feb 2006 p 95 box 42 medical liability costs at httpwwwwhitehousegovceaerp06pdf crs2 reduce the excessive burden the liability system places on the delivery of obstetrical and gynecological services was debated on the senate floor february 23 and 24 2004 cloture motion then failed vote was taken on the underlying bill second narrow bill s 2207 which included emergency room services as well as obstetrics and gynecology was brought to the senate floor in early april the cloture motion on s 2207 failed on april 7 2004 following the absence of progress in the senate on may 12 2004 the house again passed comprehensive medical malpractice liability bill hr 4279 which was substantially similar to hr 5 further senate floor action was taken during the 108th congress in the 109th congress2 the house again passed on july 28 2005 bill numbered hr 5 entitled the help efficient accessible lowcost timely healthcare health act of 2005 which was substantially similar to hr 5 from the 108th congress the senate began debate on may 4 2006 on s 22 which was similar to hr 5 but notably had much higher limits on noneconomic tort damages 250000 for hr 5 vs 750000 for s 22 also on the calendar in early may 2006 is s 23 which focuses on reducing liability for obstetrics and gynecology in addition to bills focusing on liability for medical malpractice in july 2005 the 109th congress also passed and the president signed s 544 the patient safety and quality improvement act of 2005 pl 10941 this bill encourages the reporting of medical errors data which may ultimately reduce such errors and the medical malpractice claims that follow medical errors some members also have expressed interest in other alternatives to address the medical malpractice problem in addition to the reporting of nonidentifiable data as enacted under pl 10941 some have also suggested disseminating provider specific malpractice information included in the national practitioner data bank currently not open to the public another idea is to promote alternative administrative approaches such as mediation and arbitration which have proven effective in isolated clinical settings and may provide model for broader implementation different strategy that addresses the cost of malpractice premiums but not the underlying causes is to provide tax credits to physicians to help cover premium costs background on medical malpractice insurance3 the recent difficulties in the market for medical malpractice insurance constitute the third such crisis that has been proclaimed over the past three decades both the mid1970s and mid1980s saw similar situations where rising prices and decreased availability of insurance caused difficulties for physicians and other healthcare providers these past events led to both public policy and market reactions to 2 summaries of all bills from the 109th congress follow at the end of this report 3 for more indepth discussion of the economics of malpractice insurance see crs report rl31886 medical malpractice insurance an economic introduction and review of historical experience by baird webel crs3 address the problems and the crisis eventually abated judgments as to what solved the problems and what might be applied to todays difficulties can however be difficult to make since the crisis is typically seen as one of medical malpractice insurance it may be best to begin by examining the particular nature of this market and how medical malpractice insurance works prevalence of medical malpractice insurance most physicians are covered by medical malpractice insurance many states require physicians to have malpractice insurance in order to practice in that state also some states allow only those physicians with malpractice insurance to have access to state excess liability funds or other protections hospitals purchase their own malpractice insurance and typically require physicians to be insured in order to have admitting privileges in the case of physicians who are employees of hospital the hospital generally buys insurance that covers both itself and its staff however some physicians believe that the cost of malpractice insurance is too high and have decided to practice without it go bare in addition some hospitals choose to selfinsure by setting funds aside to cover future claims instead of buying an insurance policy according to the american hospital association 40 of its member hospitals are now selfinsured4 sources of medical malpractice insurance providers can get malpractice insurance through different types of organizations historically such insurance was the domain of large commercial carriers that offered several lines of insurance currently most malpractice insurance companies are providerowned insurance companies for physicians who cannot find coverage some states have established joint underwriting associations to act as insurers of last resort in addition some states have established excess liability or patient compensation funds which cover claim costs above prescribed amount the evolution of the malpractice insurance industry is described in greater detail under the market structure section below state regulation regulation of malpractice insurance is the responsibility of the states in general states require that insurance rates be 1 adequate 2 not excessive and 3 not unfairly discriminatory however the practical implementation of these tests varies by state states use six types of rating laws with respect to malpractice insurance prior approval modified prior approval flex rating file and use use and file and 4 reported in us general accounting office medical malpractice insurance multiple factors have contributed to increased premium rates gao03702 june 2003 hereafter cited as gao medical malpractice and premium rates crs4 filerecord maintenance5 most states apply either prior approval or file and use requirements to malpractice insurers but even among states using the same type of insurance rating law there are variations for example oregon initiates prior review procedures for rate increases greater than 15 whereas alabama requires prior approval for any proposed rate increase starting at 106 malpractice liability and resolution of claims medical malpractice liability arises when health care professional engages in negligence or commits an intentional tort negligence has been described as conduct falling below standards set by law for the protection of others in most instances it arises from failure to exercise due care but defendant may have carefully considered the possible consequences of his or her conduct and still be found to have imposed an unreasonable risk on others7 although tort law allows plaintiffs to sue defendants to recover damages most malpractice claims do not reach this point the vast majority of claims are settled before cases even reach the courts of those cases where juries reach verdict most are found in favor of the defendant thus only small proportion of plaintiffs actually receive juryawarded damages in malpractice cases moreover successful plaintiffs who receive judgment from court wait an average of four to five years from when the negligence occurred to receive payment with many claims taking much longer8 the underwriting cycle hard and soft insurance markets insurance can be seen as the transfer of an uncertain future risk for current finite payment an insurance premium the most critical aspect of the transaction is the size of this premium an insurer must estimate the amount and probability of future losses and charge sufficient premium to cover these losses since the losses are in the future while the premium is paid today the insurer invests that premium 5 for descriptions of these rating laws see insurance

commissioners sept 12 2004 p 10 hereafter cited as mcdaniel et naic medical malpractice white paper crs5 until the losses occur9 to do otherwise would require that the purchaser pay higher current price for the insurance coverage although the insurance purchaser generally benefits from the lower price due to the investment of the premium this investment also introduces another uncertainty into the equation namely future investment returns if investment returns change unexpectedly then the premiums paid will also have to change which can mean substantial increases or decreases in premiums even if there have been few or claims made by the insured propertycasualty insurance of which medical malpractice is part is known for its cyclical nature socalled soft markets periods where prices are generally low and insurance is readily available alternate with hard markets periods where prices are generally high and consumers may have difficulty finding insurance some trace these market cycles to changes in the investment climate although it is probably more accurate to trace them to unexpected events on either side of the insurance equation hard market could come about because returns unexpectedly fall or it could happen because unexpectedly large losses were experienced since 2001 both events have occurred with the fall of the stock market and interest rates as well as the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks medical malpractice insurance market structure the general market for propertycasualty insurance is huge and varied literally thousands of companies operate in the united states ranging from obscure small insurers that might focus on particular area or type of insurance to large companies that are recognized names across the country thirty years ago medical malpractice insurance was generally the province of large diversified insurers only 8 of the market was served by providerowned insurers largely in response to the difficulties experienced in the marketplace in the mid1970s and mid1980s the large diversified companies exited the market and were largely replaced by small companies many of these were mutual insurers owned by the healthcare providers who were also the ones insured and most focused on particular geographical state or region or on particular medical speciality within the target geographic area or speciality such small companies may have very large share of the market by 1992 providerowned insurers had grown to 62 of the market10 this market share has dropped somewhat since 1992 but such insurers have remained large part of the market particularly in hard markets as was seen after 2001 the market evolution from large diversified insurers to small focused entities has number of possible outcomes one of these is greater reliance on reinsurance small insurer pools risk away from an individual healthcare provider but it does not spread this risk as widely as larger insurer to further spread risk many insurers rely on purchasing reinsurance from other insurance companies using the reinsurance market effectively allows risk to be spread across large amount of 9 insurer investment practices are regulated by the states with the large majority of such investment going into relatively stable investments 10 conning and company medical malpractice insurance prescription for chaos 2001 p 86 crs6 international capital however it also makes an insurer vulnerable to the vagaries of international capital markets another result of the recent market evolution has been high concentration of market share by particular insurers this seems initially counterintuitive one might expect greater number of small companies to result in less market concentration the key however is the geographic concentration of the companies for example in 2003 pic of wisconsin may have held 07 market share nationwide but in the state of wisconsin its market share was nearly 40 the copic group had 07 nationwide market share but in colorado its share was 52 even the big insurers are not evenly distributed across the country mlmic group was the largest insurer with 94 market share across the country but its share in new york was 514 in new jersey 459 and wyoming 443 the only other state where it was one of the two largest insurers was massachusetts where it had only 10 of the states market11 premium data recurring theme in past examinations of medical malpractice insurance is the lack of solid data with which to make judgments12 this uncertainty extends even as far as seemingly simple question such as how much have medical malpractice premiums increased the insurance rating firm am best reports that total medical malpractice premiums increased 156 in 200113 225 in 200214 135 in 200315 and 55 in 200416 with data yet on 2005 the 2002 national association of insurance commissioners white paper working from slightly different data found 28 rise in 2002 the most recent year listed and 132 rise in 2001 regardless of data differences it is clear that aggregate premiums rose substantially from 2001 to 2003 the experience of individual healthcare providers however has been much more variable than the aggregate numbers indicate different specialities and different areas have experienced dramatically different rates for malpractice insurance and this impact on individual physicians and particular areas is usually what drives public concern it offers little solace to small town losing physician to note that the average rise in premiums may not have been that bad 11 medical malpractice top

survey of medical malpractice insurance companies for the past 14 years the mlm survey tracks three specialities internal medicine general surgery and obgyn it reports premiums for each speciality by company within each state by their own estimate the mlm survey captures 6575 of the market the surveys of the past few years certainly seem to track the aggregate numbers indicating that rates have gone up significantly since 200017 for example from 1999 to 2004 an obgyn in philadelphia might have seen rates go from 32236 to 161211 and general surgeon in florida from 99652 to 277241 in 2004 alone an obgyn in maryland might have seen an increase of 1328 from 44063 to 102587 there are however experiences on the other end of the scale as well rates reported by one company for an internist in northern california actually dropped from 7526 in 1999 to 6869 in 200418 and an internist in nebraska might pay only 3212 in 2004 unchanged from 2003 impact on consumers and providers concern about rising premiums for medical malpractice insurance extends beyond the affordability of coverage to include the potential impact on access to health services quality of care provided and health spending overall as mentioned previously some physicians claim that rising malpractice insurance rates force them to reduce relocate or end their medical practices affecting consumer access to health care some also argue that the fear of liability and the potential cost and professional harm malpractice lawsuit could entail leads physicians to practice defensive medicine that is physicians ordering of tests and procedures or avoidance of highrisk patients or procedures primarily but not necessarily solely to reduce their exposure to malpractice risk19 detractors of the limited consumer access and defensive medicine arguments contend that other factors such as the type and cost of insurance coverage that patient might have exert more influence over health care access or spending than does the malpractice system research on these issues has led to mixed or incomplete findings with ambiguous policy implications consumer access to services and providers over the past several years stories of physicians going on strike or moving their business in response to growing malpractice insurance premiums have populated 17 various mlm headlines 1999 survey finds widespread rush by medical malpractice writers to raise rates vol 24 9 sept 1999 2002 rate survey finds malpractice premiums are soaring vol 27 10 oct 2002 2004 rate survey indicates rate increases may be leveling but tripledigit hikes not over vol 29 10 oct 2004 18 rates for norcal mutual in san mateo santa clara santa cruz fresno and monterey counties in 2004 and northern california as whole in 1999 19 us office of technology assessment impact of legal reforms on medical malpractice costs otabph1 19 oct 1993 p 6 crs8 mainstream media20 doctors and their supporters cite multiple examples of providers curtailing highrisk services or shutting down practices altogether because malpractice insurance has gotten too expensive they claim that large jury awards and the burgeoning costs of defending against lawsuits are the causes for skyrocketing liability premiums and they see tort reform especially limiting damages awarded in malpractice lawsuits as the solution21 researchers have tested this theory by monitoring physician actions eg moving medical practices either in direct response to premium growth or in response to state tort reforms such as caps on award damages overall studies have found evidence of fewer physician services in response to rising premiums and increased physician supply in states that have passed tort reforms however access problems were not experienced uniformly so the overall impact on consumer access to health care is unclear for example the thengeneral accounting office gao examined the implications of premium growth on availability of physician services gao interviewed physicians and physician associations in nine states that included range of malpractice premium pricing and tort reform environments22 they found instances of health care access problems such as gaps in speciality surgical care and lack of obstetric services however these problems were not found in every area studied sometimes involved relatively few physicians and oftentimes occurred in rural areas where providers identified longstanding factors in addition to malpractice pressures that affected the availability of services23 with respect to the impact of tort reforms on physician supply number of studies have found positive relationship for example study published in the journal of the american medical association jama found that state adoption of direct tort reforms24 led to more growth in the physician supply from 19852001 the physician supply grew 24 more in directreform states than in nonreform states the researchers found similar impact for certain physician specialities associated with high premiums for malpractice insurance for example the supply of obstetricians and gynecologists in solo practice grew 23 more in directreform states than in nonreform states for emergency physicians the difference was 20 selected examples include david eisenberg and maggie sieger the doctor wont see you now time june 9 2003 rita rubin doctors act against

awards abolition of punitive damages mandatory prejudgement interest and reform of the collateral source rule for discussion about these and other malpractice tort reforms see crs report rl31692 crs9 11525 such findings comport with studies published in health affairs and by the american enterprise institute aei that also found positive correlation between malpractice tort reforms and physician supply26 however slight increase in physician supply does not necessarily translate to more consumer access and better health outcomes nor may the increase be attributed solely to tort reform for instance the jama study looked only at the change in physician supply but did not measure total number of hours worked moreover the researchers concede that the increase in physician supply in reform states may be consequence of those states having more room for growth27 and admit that their evaluation did not assess the impact of malpractice on cost access or quality studies that have looked at the impact of tort reform on quality of care have reached mixed findings one study analyzed the impact of tort reforms on hospital expenditures for medicare patients with heart conditions the researchers found that hospital spending decreased with significant impact on health outcomes however the authors of the aforementioned aei study found that the reforms lowered the standard of care provided and had an adverse impact on infant mortality under certain circumstances28 defensive medicine statements linking malpractice concern with reduced physician services are reflected in the discussions regarding the role of malpractice in encouraging the practice of defensive medicine the premise underpinning defensive medicine is that the fear of liability and the potential negative outcomes associated with malpractice claims lead physicians to administer additional health care treatments or avoid high risk services primarily to reduce their liability risk the implication is that defensive medicine results in either an increase in overall spending for health care that may not be medically necessary or decrease in access to certain services or for certain patients multiple studies have found evidence of defensive medicine but the policy implications remain ambiguous one study compared the rate of caesarean sections at hospitals that experienced high malpractice claims and had high malpractice insurance premiums with the c section rate at hospitals with low claims frequency and premiums the researchers found that hospitals with high claims and premiums had higher csection rate even 25 daniel kessler william sage and david becker impact of malpractice reforms on the supply of physician services journal of the american medical association june 1 2005 vol 293 21

when controlling for patient physician and hospital characteristics29 however it is doubtful that such results are generalizable to all physician specialties due to the heightened risk associated with obstetrics this specialty generally experiences greaterthanaverage malpractice claims and greater premium increases for malpractice insurance it stands to reason that such an environment would make obstetricians more sensitive to changes in the malpractice environment compared with physicians in nonhighrisk fields the aforementioned study of medicare hospital spending is another example cited as providing evidence of defensive physician behavior the study analyzed the impact of tort reforms adopted between 1984 and 1990 as previously mentioned the researchers found that spending decreased between 5 and 9 within five years after reform implementation with significant impact on mortality or severe complications the authors attributed the decrease in spending to behavior change prompted by tort reforms that directly limited physician liability30 like the previous study the question of generalizability is relevant given the narrow population studied these results could not be generalized to all health care consumers moreover cbo later applied the same methodology used in the medicare study to broader set of medical conditions and found evidence of reduced medical spending attributable to malpractice tort reforms31 multiple physician surveys have found that doctors practice defensive medicine regarding referrals treatments patient mix and business practices32 for instance nine out of 10 of respondents to survey conducted in pennsylvania reported that they practiced defensive medicine at least some of the time five out of 10 respondents said that they often provided unnecessary referrals and four out of 10 reported that they avoided treating highrisk patients however selfreports about physician behavior should be treated cautiously many physician surveys have low response rates generally physicians who are more likely to respond to survey focusing on malpractice concerns will be doctors who are more sensitive to the issue due to personal or professional concerns the pennsylvania insurance study specifically surveyed only physicians in six highrisk specialty fields33 the researchers note that the state had been hit particularly hard by the latest malpractice 29 russell localio et relationship between malpractice claims and cesarean delivery journal of the american medical association jan 20 1993 vol 269 3 30 daniel kessler and mark

health affairs fall 1984 hereafter cited as zuckerman medical malpractice and gao medical malpractice and access 33 the specialities are emergency medicine general surgery orthopedic surgery neurosurgery obstetricsgynecology and radiology crs11 crisis34 factors such as these can bias the survey response and cast doubt on generalizability to all physician specialties in all malpractice environments taken together studies quantifying the extent to which defensive medicine is practiced have shown that it exists to some degree but even physician and other provider groups concede that it is difficult to measure35 like the experience with rapidly rising premiums the extent to which defensive medicine is practiced also seems to vary based on physician specialty and practice location moreover defensive medicine can have both negative and positive aspects for consumers for example liability concerns may discourage physicians from treating certain medical cases but such concerns may also encourage physicians to spend more time with patients36 causes of the problem although the extent of the impact of higher medical malpractice insurance premiums may be unclear both state legislatures and congress have considered various proposals to address the discontent caused by higher premiums the wide variety of cures for the problems in medical malpractice insurance are largely result of three differing diagnoses of the underlying cause of these problems the tort system the insurance system or the healthcare system tort system frivolous lawsuits and high damage awards the focus in congress particularly of the bills that have seen floor action in the past several years has been on the tort system as the root of the problem in medical malpractice insurance many argue that the incentives under the current tort system have led to increases in both the frequency of malpractice claims and severity size of awards in theory the tort system can work very efficiently to both deter wrongdoing and compensate those who are injured by this wrongdoing in the current system many argue this model has become caricature of itself sort of lottery situation where frivolous lawsuits clog the courts the plaintiffs hoping to either settle before trial or find jury to award high damages out of sympathy to the injured patient with insurance claims from settlements and awards skyrocketing the insurance premiums increase as matter of course the joint economic committee jec issued study in 200337 that strongly supported this argument for the tort system as the root of the problem citing wider variety of influences than the jec gao also found in 2003 that increased losses 34 studdert defensive medicine p 2610 35 gao medical malpractice and access p 27 36 for more information about the range of defensive practices see zuckerman medical malpractice exhibit 3 37 us congress joint economic committee liability for medical malpractice issues and evidence may 2003 crs12 on claims are the primary contributor to higher medical malpractice premium rates38 the congressional budget office cbo cites increased payments of claims as major factor in driving medical malpractice insurance costs though they cite other market forces as well39 cbos cost estimates for bills that would institute limits on the tort system for medical malpractice have predicted significant savings in insurance costs the latest of these was for hr 5 in the 108th congress cbo concluded that this bills limits on tort damages and lawyers fees would reduce medical malpractice premiums by 253040 these conclusions have been disputed by many and definite conclusions are difficult to draw because of lack of underlying data41 for example many of the arguments on increased medical malpractice claims draw their information for the size of damage awards from jury verdicts research these numbers however have been criticized as incomplete and skewed significantly upward42 as compared to statistics from the national practitioners data bank npdb the npdb however has been strongly criticized as data source as well43 another study casting doubt on increasing claims as an explanation for high premiums came from review of the closed claims information in the state of texas this study found that from 1988 2002 the number of large paid claims was roughly constant the number of small claims declined and the real total cost per large paid claim rose by only 0812 per year44 these conclusions however have been disputed as well45 insurance system regulation and antitrust exemption another cause for the large increases in medical malpractice premiums that is frequently cited is the working of the insurance industry itself and the regulation or lack thereof of the industry as was noted above pricing for insurance seems to go 38 gao medical malpractice and premium rates p 15 39 us congressional budget office limiting tort liability for medical malpractice

paper crs13 in cycles of hard and soft markets that are at least somewhat based on investment returns earned by insurers some see the large price increases in medical malpractice insurance as an attempt by insurers to make up for stock market losses due to overly risky investment decisions others attribute the problem of increasing premiums to the limited exemption from the federal antitrust laws for the business of insurance that was granted by the mccarranferguson act of 194546 this exemption it is argued allows insurers to engage in certain anticompetitive behavior that pushes insurance prices higher than those that would prevail under free market47 as matter of economics investment returns will play role in pricing for insurance because of the difference in time between when premiums are paid by the insured and when claims are paid by the insurer whether the investments currently undertaken by insurers are too risky however is inherently value judgment that likely cannot be proven the individual states do currently have regulations outlining what investments may be undertaken and historically approximately 75 of general propertycasualty investments have been in bonds or cash equivalents which tend to be more stable than stocks48 for medical malpractice insurers the ratio is even higher approximately 86 is in bonds or cash equivalents49 states also regulate to various degrees the rates that companies can charge and usually require that rates be set on prospective basis current rates should cover the expected future claims not retrospective basis current rates covering past claims whether or not the state regulation is adequate however has been questioned in the past and stronger regulation has been cited as way to address higher insurance prices50 consideration of the effect of the limited antitrust exemption is complicated by the intricacies of both the law itself and judicial interpretations of it and by the way in which insurance companies set rates the legal question concerns the precise actions that courts have found permissible under current law as well as interpretation of any amendment that might be passed by congress in the future courts have found under mccarranfergusons exemption from the antitrust laws for the business of insurance that information sharing and joint rate making are permissible the definition of the business of insurance however has been narrowed over the years51 it is not implausible for example that some cases of insurer rate setting 46 15 usc 10111014 pl 7915 47 see for example the statement of robert

mccarranferguson act see crs report continued crs14 might be found by future courts to fall outside of the current antitrust exemption as impermissible price fixing nor is it implausible that even in the event of complete repeal of the mccarranferguson exemption some collective action and data sharing might be found to be permissible under the antitrust laws although anything determined to be price fixing would not qualify for such treatment52 some collective action even including joint rate making might also be judged permissible if states authorize such action proponents of even limited antitrust exemption argue that any repeal of the current exemption even if collective action might eventually be judged permissible would result in costly litigation and raise rather than lower or stabilize insurance prices however given that the limited antitrust exemption is ultimately defined by the courts the effect of such an exemption on the economics of insurer rate setting is uncertain and possibly unknowable given the current state of economic research it is clear from economic theory that the more information available to an insurer the more accurate and efficient the resulting insurance rates will be while some information sharing certainly lowers rates overall as more collective action occurs between insurers it seems more likely that anticompetitive collusive action would occur the policy judgment that must be made is where exactly to draw the line between collective action that enhances efficiency and drives down prices versus collective action that becomes anticompetitive and drives up prices health care system medical errors among the cacophony of voices attributing the growth of medical liability premiums to high jury awards or poor investment choices by insurers is third group which points to medical errors as source of the problem and patient safety as solution53 supporters of this view argue that efforts to reduce medical errors will decrease the possibility of medical injury and subsequent malpractice lawsuits since death is the most frequently cited injury in lawsuits that are found in favor of the plaintiffs 23 of all such cases54 they reason that patient safety efforts will 51 continued rs22118 courts narrow mccarranferguson antitrust exemption for business of insurance by janice rubin 52 under the rule of reason doctrine in antitrust law courts balance the anticompetitiveness of some actions against any procompetitive effects that might be produced by those actions per violations those that are automatically unlawful and may never be justified however are not eligible for rule of reason analysis 53 patient safety refers to the panoply of rules practices and systems related to the prevention of patient injury also known as adverse events intrinsic to patient safety efforts are strategies to prevent medical errors ie the use of an incorrect medical treatment or the failure of specific treatment to achieve the intended result for more information about these issues see crs report rl32092 medical malpractice the role of patient safety initiatives by bernadette fernandez 54 the remaining 77 is composed of

malpractice verdicts continued crs15 prevent some of these deaths as well as other medical injuries which should lead to reductions in malpractice claims and costly jury verdicts anesthesiologists make up one physician group that is routinely cited as model for patient safety and malpractice reform efforts as medical specialty anesthesiology is an example of local but complex highrisk dynamic patient care system in which there has been notably reduced error55 through combination of technological advancements committed leadership research focused on patient safety and informed decision making anesthesiologists have produced dramatic reduction in anesthesiarelated deaths as result the proportion of total medical liability suits filed against anesthesiologists has dropped and the median payment made in malpractice cases against anesthesiologists has been cut in half over the course of 20 years moreover the premiums anesthesiologists pay for malpractice insurance are lower today than the rates they paid 20 years ago56 the link between medical errors and malpractice liability is not universally accepted multiple studies have found that the majority of malpractice claims filed do not involve negligent medical care57 in other words the majority of patients who file malpractice claims have suffered medical injuries but not of the type that would be legally compensable on the grounds of provider negligence58 at the same time only small proportion of patients whose injuries are caused by negligence actually end up filing malpractice claim in one study only 3 of patients who experienced negligent injury sued for malpractice59 although these studies speak more to the misalignment of incentives under the current tort system than the relationship between medical negligence and provider liability the findings are cited in arguments that the relationship between negligence and malpractice claims is tenuous one given that medical error can lead to injury and that injury whether or not resulting from negligence is the medical basis on which malpractice claim is made analyzing the relationship between medical errors and malpractice claims may prove

for medical errors information and develop procedures to encourage the voluntary reporting and analysis of such data the expectation is that analysis of the data will lead to recommendations for the prevention of medical errors and as consequence enhancement of patient safety legislative proposals in the 109th congress given the complexity of the malpractice insurance debate it is wonder that legislative proposals vary in terms of the approaches they employ to address these issues proposals may focus on the problem itself or attempt to mitigate its adverse effects in addition legislative approaches will reflect logistical and political considerations legislative proposals differ on the problem each proposal is attempting to address and the presumed cause of the problem is the problem rapid growth in malpractice insurance costs caused by unreasonable jury awards or is it insurance companies attempts to counter dwindling investment returns by raising premiums or health system that does not do enough to prevent medical errors and how are these issues related to the twin goals of the liability tort system fair and timely compensation to those injured and deterrence of negligent medical care what then are the objectives of these legislative proposals is it to reduce the growth of malpractice insurance premiums eg through damage caps or insurance market reforms or make insurance more affordable eg through tax credit to physicians or is it broader aligning medical health insurance and tort incentives to equitably treat patients and providers these proposals also raise questions about the appropriate role for government as well as the appropriate level state vs federal for any intervention given the diversity of issues discussed above bills introduced in the 109th congress employ variety of strategies in addressing those issues the bills include provisions that target the legal system eg tort reforms the insurance industry eg prohibition of anticompetitive behavior and the health care system eg medical error reporting many bills also include provisions that use both public and private based solutions eg grants to states to develop administrative procedures for resolving malpractice claims the next section of this report summarizes current proposals using different legislative approaches tort reform patient safety and medical error reporting administrative approach and research tax credit antitrust prohibition and comprehensive reform tort reform hr 5 the help efficient accessible lowcost timely healthcare act of 2005 would preempt state tort law regarding certain aspects of medical malpractice liability and liability for medical products it would not preempt state laws that provide greater substantive or procedural protections to health care providers and organizations except that its caps on damages would not apply in states with their crs17 own caps whether higher or lower the act would establish federal statute of limitations concerning malpractice lawsuits limit noneconomic damages to 250000 make each party liable for damages in proportion to its responsibility for the patients harm allow the court to restrict attorneys fees to percentage based on the amount awarded to the claimant allow any party to introduce evidence of collateral source benefits limit punitive damages to the greater of 250000 or twice the amount of economic damages and provide for periodic payments for damages over 50000 s 354 the help efficient accessible lowcost timely healthcare act of 2005 is the companion

malpractice liability it is similar to s 354 except for several differences in scope and content for example s 22 would apply only to medical malpractice lawsuits whereas s 354 would apply to both malpractice and medical products liability lawsuits under s 22 the maximum amount of noneconomic damages that may be recovered from health care provider found negligent is 250000 however in cases where health care institution is named as codefendant successful plaintiff may recover up to an additional 250000 from the entity if more than one health care institution is named in the final judgment the plaintiff may recover up to 250000 from each entity provided that the total amount recovered from all such institutions does not exceed total amount of 500000 this act differs from s 354 in that the latter would establish maximum total cap for noneconomic damages at 250000 finally the caps on noneconomic damages and punitive damages in s 22 would apply only in cases where the state has not established such caps this provision differs from s 354 and instead follows the approach under hr 561 s 23 the healthy mothers and healthy babies access to care act is identical to s 22 except that the tort reform provisions apply only to lawsuits involving the provision of obstetrical or gynecological care patient safety and medical error reporting s 544 the patient safety and quality improvement act of 2005 would amend the public health service act to establish legal protections for medical errors information and develop procedures to encourage the voluntary reporting and analysis of such data the act would protect medical error data from being used in administrative civil or criminal proceedings or from being disclosed under freedom of information act requests with certain exceptions such as for public health or law 60 the differences are discussed in the crs report rs22075 medical malpractice liability reform s 354 109th congress by henry cohen 61 for additional

to tort litigation for the purpose of resolving medical malpractice claims the secretary may award up to 10 grants with each grant not exceeding five years in duration each state desiring grant must develop an alternative approach to resolve malpractice claims and allow for the collection and analysis of patient safety data each state must demonstrate how the alternative approach encourages prompt and fair resolution of malpractice claims promotes disclosure of medical errors increases patient safety and preserves access to medical malpractice insurance the alternatives developed may be based on three models described in the bill early disclosure and compensation model administrative determination of compensation model or special health care court model the bill was referred to the senate health education labor and pensions committee on june 29 2005 hr 2399 the improved medical malpractice information reporting and competition act of 2005 would establish the office of health
