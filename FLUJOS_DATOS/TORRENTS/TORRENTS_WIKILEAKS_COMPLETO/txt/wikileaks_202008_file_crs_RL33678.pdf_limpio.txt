concerning the placing and substitution of candidates names on the ballot for federal offices in the course of this discussion the report will analyze what have generally been char acterized as ballot access issues in the states division of constitutional authority initially it should be noted that under our federal system an interesting division of jurisdiction occurs in the case of electi ons to the united states congress in the first instance the terms of federal congressional offices and the qualifications of candidates eligible for federal offices are established and fixed by the united states constitution and are unalterable by the cong ress itself or by any state unilaterally8 the constitution expressly provides however in the socalled times places and manner clause that the individual st ates have the general authority to administer congressional elections within their jurisdictions9 furthermore the states within constitutional parameters have the authority to set the qualifications to vote forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33678crs3 10 in article i section 2 clause 1 and the 17th amendment of the constitution states are authorized to establish the qualifications to vote in federal congressional elections as long as such qualifications are the same as those to vote in state elections for the most numerous house of the state legislature the states must follow constitutional mandates for federal elections such as the 15th negroemancipated slave voting rights 19th womens suffrage and 26th amendments 18year old vote as well as equal protection principles of the 14th amendment and federal statutory requirements for voting rights 11 article i section 5 cl 1each house sha ll be the judge of the elections returns and qualifications of its own members 12

the final results of the election and seating in congress the constitution provi des that each house of congress has the authority to be the final judge of the results of those congressional elections held in the states and to judge the three constitutional qualifications for office age citizenship and inhabitancy in the state when elected of the memberselect presenting themselves for membership in the institution11 state authority over election administration and procedures the states authority over election administration and procedures for congressional elections is set out at article i section 4 clause 1 of the united states constitution and provides as follows the times places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof but the congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations except as to the places of chusing senators under this express constitutional authority of the states to regulate the times places and manner of congressional elections the states may promulgate regulatory and administrative provisions dealing with the mechanics and procedures of the elections for congressional office which are held within their jurisdictions this procedural and administrative authority has been found to extend to such things as for example the form of the ballots the positioning of candidate s names and party affiliations on the ballot voting procedur and mechanics counting votes and certifying winners and the nominating andor petition process generally including the authority to enact reasonable requireme nts and regulations fo r candidates name to appear on the ballot that is socalled ballot access requirements for major party new party and independent candidates12 in discussing the breadth of the legislative authority in the states over th conduct of federal ections the supreme court explained as follows the subject matter is the times places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives it cannot be doubted that these comprehensivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33678crs4 13 smiley v holm 285 us 355 366 1932 14 285 us at

prevention of fraud and corrupt practices counting of votes duties of inspectors and canvassers and making and publication of election returns13 it is this authority of the states over the ballot the structure of the ballot and concerning socalled ba llot access requirements for political party nominees new party nominees and independent candidates that has led to the varying and different treatment and requirements for placement removal andor substitution of candidates name on the ballo t depending on the state in which the congressional election is to be held since these matters are generally subjects of state law within the parameters and require ments of the united states constitution it is the application of the particular state law that may result in different outcome of withdrawal of congressi onal candidate who has won major party nomination in primary in texas as opposed to wit hdrawal and substitution of partynominated candidate for congress in ohio or in new jersey the death of nominated candidate in missouri or the ability to be on the ballo t in connecticut as an independent or the nominee of new party in general election after losing party primary for the same office although the state legislatures have broad authority under the united states constitution concerning the procedures for fe deral elections within their jurisdictions the constitutional provision expressly provides superceding residual authority within the congress to legislate different pr ovisions for federal elections held in the states this residual authority in congre ss has been found to be as extensive and complete as the state legislatures authority over such elections within their respective jurisdictions after discussing the breadth and extent of the states authority over election procedures for fede ral office the supreme court explained the authority of congress over such elections this view is confirmed by the second clause of article i section 4 which provides that the congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations with the single exception stated the phrase such regulations plainly refers to regulations of the same general character that the legislature of the state is authorized to prescribe with respect to congressional elections in exercising this power the congress ma supplement these state regulations or may substitute its own it may impose additional penalties for the violation of state laws or provide independent sancti ons it has general supervisory power over the whole subject ex parte seibold 100 us 371 387 ex parte

immediately following the first monday in november in the particular applicable evennumbered election years15 and has legislated detailed system for regulating reporting and disclosing the campaign fi nances of candidates to federal office16 however as policy matter and under article i secti on 4 clause 1 congress has traditionally allowed the states within the framework of the federal constitutional and statutory mandates to exercise the s ubstantive control over the procedures and administrative details of elections within their own respective jurisdictions and the states have then often further devolved immediate administrative and supervisory control over many election proce dures to local and county author ities within their jurisdictions this policy has generally recognized the principle that because of the varying political cultures practices and traditions across the nation and from state tostate that operational authority over most of the election mechanics is more appropriately left to the states and localities thus as shown by the recent instances regarding candidatesubstitutions on the ballot for the united states house of representatives and the united states senate the particular procedural laws of the stat in question govern the resolution of the issue in texas the courts looking at th matter of the attempte d withdrawal of and replacement for former representative tom delay on the ballot for the united states house of representatives from the 22nd district of texas interpreted texas election law in light of the united states constitutions qualifications requirements to find that former representative tom delay could not be replaced on the ballot by the republican party after mr delay had won the nomination at primary election to prevent what has been described as the gaming of the nomination system with the use of socalled straw candidates sta lking horses or placeholder candidates texas law currently provides that when parties nominate ca ndidates by primary election one party is not pe rmitted to later replace candi date so nominated unless the candidate is not eligible for the office17 since eligibility for the office of representative in the united states congress is established in and governed exclusively by the provisions of the united states constitution and those provisions require only that the candidate be 25 years of age citizen of the united states for seven years and at the time of ection be an inhabitant of the state from which elected mr delay was found not to be at the time of the decision ineligible under the united states constitu tion for the congressional seat and thus could not be replaced on the ballot under texas law18httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33678crs6 18 continued

state of ohio permit the po litical party to name substitute or if the candidate withdraws at least 80 days before the general election to have special election primary to nominate substitute19 so although representative ney withdrew from the congressional election race in ohio at an even later date than did former representative delay in texas special primary was allowed to be held in ohio to substitute name on the ballot as the republican partys nominee for the general election for representative similarly in new jersey the state election laws provided for specific procedure for the replacement of candidates who withdrew up to 50 days before an election20 but the courts found that the state statute did not necessarily preclude party substitution for withdrawn candidate closer to the election if the administrators of the elec tion certified that the substitution could be made without significant disr uption to election procedures21 in missouri however the democratic nominee for united states nator died in plane crash so close to the november 2000 general election on october 16 2000 that the deadline under missouri law for finalizing the ballot and programming machines

there may be different methods or tracks to the ballo t or differing requirements to have ones name placed on the ballot depending on whether one is the nominee of major political party minor or new

state laws which treat different candidates differently as far as ballot access the courts will not always pply heightened scrutiny to determine if the hurdles imposed on new minor or inde pendent candidates by election procedures are on balance permissible if the state laws impose only what are found to be reasonable nondiscriminatory re strictions on the protected rights affected then the regulations and procedures of the state would be upheld when they are sufficiently related to the legitimate state interests asserted26 however when the restrictions on rights are considered to be severe then the regulation in question must be narrowly drawn to advance state interest of compelling importance27 the supreme court explained the analytic framework it employs for state regulations

for federal office even though they may create certain procedural hurdles or requi rements which candi date must overcome to be placed on the ballot29 the distinction between per missible procedural

signatures on pe tition to appear on ballot as opposed to prohibited additional qualifica tion requirements added by the states was explained by the supreme court in us term limits inc the provisions at issue in storer and our other elections clause cases were thus constitutional because they regulated election procedures and did not even arguably impose any substantive qualification rendering class of potential candidates ineligible for ballot position they served the state interest in protecting the integrity and regularity of the election process an interest independent of any attempt to evade the constitutional prohibition against the imposition of additional qualifications for service in congress and they did not involve measures that exclude candidates from the ballot without

independent or as minor party candidate in early state litigation in 1902 minne sota statutory scheme preventing an unsuccessful congressional candidate at primary election from having his name printed on the general election ballot as an independent for th same congressional office was upheld against challenge that it created an add itional qualification to office as long as the candidate

questio n which have the combined effect of preventing candidate defeated in th primary from obtaining position on the general election ballot as the candidate of political body do not for this reason violate the first amendment or the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment41 filing deadlines as part of the administrative duties involving ballot access preparation and printing of the ballots state must by n ecessity because of the exigencies of time and duties limit or establis h timeframe or deadline by which the ballot must be set or finalized that is reasonable time before the general or primary election when more candidates may be placed on the ballot or programmed into the voting machines courts have noted that stat have compelling interest in setting deadlines and in finalizing the ballot so that general election ballots can be properly and timely prepared and distributed42 one of the consequences of not having set ballot at some reasonable point prior to an election and of allowing lastminute changes in the candidates on the printed ballot and on voting machines would be the disenfranchisement of military and other absentee voters since such lastminute changes would not allow sufficient time before election day to prepare print mail out and then to receive back by mail new absentee ballots with such changes as found by one federal court with an election mere fi ve weeks away even if plaintiffs had prevailed on the merits of their arguments against their exclusion from the ballot the court would have still refused to require the state to change its ballots by including petitioners names since the court recognized the overriding administrative necessities of deadlines to insure time available for election officials to complete their election preparations before the election43 the court noted the risk of substantial disruption of the electoral process that could ensue by changing ballot after the stateestablished administrative deadline for finalization of those ballots and noted the tight sche dule of election officials and the myriad duties and responsibilities that are valid administrative reasons for reasonable deadlines

or allow parties to force changes to ballots close to an election that is at th eleventh hour with an election close at hand or with the imminence of election because of the potential for seriously disrupting the states electoral process45 with an election less than three weeks away federal court refused to require the changing of ballot to add petitioners names even on strong first amendment showing by petitioners since much of the ballot and voting machine preparation had already taken place and there needed to be balancing and proper weight given to the states needs and interests in an orderly election including the prevention of the possible di senfranchisement of absentee and military voters caused by eventh hour changes to the ballot46 justice marshall on circuit turned down on october 1 request to order names to be printed on ballot for an upcoming november election citing among other reasons the states concern for the potential chaotic and disruptive effect upon the electoral process since the presidential and overseas ballots have already been printed some have been distributed the general abse ntee ballots are currently being printed47 the filing deadline and requirement for finalizing the ballots are among the reasons that political party might not be allowed under state procedures to substitute nominee on the ballot after pa rticular time prior to an ection this is often the reason that candidate who died or withdrew shortly before an election would still have his or her name on the ballot and programmed into voting machines at the time of the election48 states interpreting their own st atutes might show differing degrees of leniency as to such deadlines partic ularly as in the case of the united states senate election in new jersey in 2002 if election administrators attest that the change can be implemented in the time remaining before the election without significant disruption or disen franchisement of absentee voters49 overly long filing deadlines for parties and candidates particularly with respect to the deadlines established for the collection of signatures on petitions for new minor party or independent candidates might

parties to have their candidates appear on the ballot signatures totaling 3 of the number of votes for governor or pres idential elector which would be 24171 signatures as compared to only 10000 fo r independent candida tes would burden the rights of individuals to associate fo r the advancement of political beliefs the right of qualified voters regardless of political persuasion to cast their votes effectively and the right of citizens to create and develop new political parties 54 the court there determined that these burdens were not justified by narrowly drawn recognition scheme that served compelling state interest55 the court found from the history of ballot access by new party and indepe ndent candidates in arkansas that the 10000 signature requireme nt would suffice to meet the states asserted interests and needs the 10000 signature threshold is suffici ent modicum of support to serve the states interest in avoiding cluttered ba llots and the evidence shows quite clearly that the three percent requirement is much higher than necessary as it imposes severe burden under the first and fourteenth amendments on the associational rights of the green party and the candi

claiming that the twostep petition process violated the first and fourteenth amendment rights of associ ation and speech of its party its members and candidates the court there focusing primarily as did the complaint on the second 1 signature requirement did not believe that the character and magnitude of the burdens imposed on new and minor parties their candi dates and supporters were severe enough to overtur n the requirements the c ourt noted that the supreme court in the past has allowed petition requirements of between 1 of the total vote cast for governor in the preceding election in texas58 and in georgia up to 5 of the number of voters eligible to vote in the last election for the office in question59 in this case the court found that the sec ond petition requirement of 1 showing of support legitimately suppor ted the goals of the state voiding overloaded ballots and frivolous candidacies which in turn diminish victory margins contribute to the cost of conducting elections confuse and frust rate voters increase the need for burdensome runoffs and may ultimately disc ourage voter participation and in the electoral process60 as to the dual petition requirements taken together the court conceded that it is more burdensome for political organization to obtain the necessary signatures for becoming minor party and then shortly thereafter having to obtain signatures for its list of candidate s however the c ourt concluded that on the whole the burdens are still substantially less than the burdens imposed by schemes previously upheld by the supreme court61 the court concluded the state has separate interests in suring support for political party and ensuring modicum of support for pa rticular candidate nominated by that party the fact that these two petitions may under certain circumstances occur in the same election cycle does not crea sufficient burden to outweigh the important state interests served by the requirements62 combinations of factors in some cases court may look not only to the number of petition signatures required for candidate to be placed on the ba llot or to the length of time before an election that petition must be filed by new minor or independent candidates but may also look to the totality of circumst ances in finding unnecessary burdens on the first and fourteenth amendment rights of supporters voters par

keith at 9 10 13required the obtaining of signatures from voters equaling 10 of the vote in the last general election raised in 1979 from 5 and disqualified anyone who signs such petition for an independent candidate from voting in the primary as noted by the court since one year from the institution of these requirements 1980 not single independent candidate for state legislative office has qualified for ballot access64 the court concluded in that case when measured by comparison to the ballot access requirements in the other 49 states or by the stifling effect they have had on independent legislative candidacies since their inception the comb ined effect of illinois ballot access requirements for independent general assembly candidates falls on the severe end of this sliding scale because illi nois ballot access requirements combine to severely burden the rights of candidates and voters to unch and support independent candidacies they must by narrowly drawn to advance s compelling state interest we conclude that these ballot access requirements in combination severely burden first and fourteenth amendemnt rights and are not narrowly drawn to advance illinoiss interest in avoiding the political instability of party splintering and excessive factionalism and the ballot clutter of frivolous candidacies we do not question that these are important state interests they have long been recognized as such but the supreme c ourt has also observed that the interest in political stability does not permit stat to completely insulate the twoparty system from minor parties or inde pendent candidates competition and influence and that is effectively what illinois has done65
