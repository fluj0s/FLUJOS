strip at the end of the 19481949 war and egypt administered but did not claim the territory from 1949 to 1967 after the 1967 war israeli civilians began establishing settlements in the west bank the sinai peninsula the golan heights and the gaza strip the israeli military used force to remove some settlers from the sinai in 1982 when israel withdrew in compliance with the 1978 camp david agreement and the 1979 peace treaty with egypt according to the september 1993 israelipalestinian declaration of principles the future of west bank and gaza strip settlements was to be subject for permanent status negotiations in 1994 israel transferred civilian authority over 70 of the gaza strip to the palestinians the disengagement plan in speech on december 18 2003 prime minister ariel sharon stated that israel would unilaterally disengage from the palestinians by redeploying forces and relocating settlements if the palestinians did not act against terrorists and fulfill their commitments under the road map the framework for achieving twostate solution to the israeli congressional research service the library of congress crs2 palestinian conflict1 he subsequently asserted that disengagement was necessary for demographic reasons to retain the jewish democratic identity of israel after some revision the government approved plan to withdraw from all 21 settlements in gaza and 4 small settlements in the northern west bank and from military installations protecting them2 following withdrawal the plan calls for israel to continue to guard the land perimeter of gaza to

imposed similar closure on the northern west bank implementation of disengagement began on august 15 2005 when remaining settlers were given final 48 hours notice to depart israeli police and soldiers began removing those who did not leave voluntarily on august 17 authorities were able to accelerate their timetable and the evacuation of settlers from gaza was completed on august 22 and from the northern west bank on august 23 after demolishing homes in the settlements the israeli defense forces idf completed evacuating bases and personnel from the strip on september 12 and the israeli cabinet formally cancelled the military government in gaza implementation about 55000 israeli soldiers and police were mobilized to implement the disengagement plan forces were deployed in series of

crs3 settlements to beyond the gaza border beginning on august 17 small groups of unarmed soldiers and police from contingent of 14000 evacuated individual settler homes other soldiers secured roads to the settlements and periphery around them to serve as buffer between settlements and palestinian areas and to prevent infiltration by israeli opponents of disengagement more troops were stationed on the israelgaza border to respond to any palestinian attacks armor and aircraft were held in reserve for the possibility of heavier fighting disengagement proceeded efficiently many settlers departed voluntarily and those who did not resisted nonviolently despite israeli officials concerns about the possibility of settler violence there were few violent incidents and israeli fired weapon against another israeli those with religious reasons for settling in the territory were among the fiercest opponents of disengagement and many of them did not leave voluntarily before the disengagement the idf had signaled its determination to succeed and to prevent violence on june 30 security forces forcibly removed extremists mainly from the radical kachkahanist movement from hotel in southern gaza settlement israeli authorities placed several kach members in administrative detention and imposed httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22000 restrictions on suspected settler provocateurs in the west bank one with dual us israeli citizenship was sent home to america nonetheless suspected opponents of disengagement perpetrated two incidents of what prime minister sharon labeled jewish terrorism elsewhere on august 4 an israeli army deserter killed 4 israeli arabs and injured 13 on bus in northern israel and on august 17 west bank settler shot 4 palestinians at the settlement of shiloh the council of judea samaria and gaza yesha council the main settler organization vowed to resist disengagement peacefully and negotiated some parameters of its civil disobedience campaign with the idf the idf prevented the council and its followers from engaging in more obstructionist conduct such as marches into southern gaza nonetheless council leaders and nationalist religious figures successfully summoned an estimated 2000 to 4000 religious youth from israel the west bank and jerusalem to infiltrate settlements and resist evacuation they caused the most problems for the security forces during disengagement in addition to concerns about possible israeli violence the idf had developed contingency plans to deal with the possibility of palestinian violence israel had insisted that it was not withdrawing under fire but some palestinian militants took credit for the disengagement and there were fears that they would try to make certain that it took place under fire as it transpired hamas the largest group may have had vested interest in keeping gaza calm to advance its political ambitions and most palestinian militant groups generally were quiet the idf chief of staff reported below average number of shooting incidents and mortar shellings with casualties coordination issues although israeli officials insist that disengagement was unilateral act they nonetheless coordinated related issues with the palestinian authority pa disposition of assets on april 15 2005 the united states united nations european union and russia the quartet appointed former world bank president crs4 james wolfensohn to be their special envoy for disengagement among other tasks he promoted cooperation between israel and the pa first fruit of wolfensohns labors announced on june 19 was an agreement for the demolition of settlements in gaza with the palestinians removing debris some sites will be replaced by highdensity housing for palestinians palestinians will gain freer movement in the northern west bank after israels withdrawal but they will not be able to build in that area because it will remain under israeli control palestinian officials have said they will try to change the situation in the northern west bank and their israeli counterparts may be amenable wolfensohn also worked for the transfer of the settlers commercial assets primarily greenhouses to assist the palestinians with job creation settlers reportedly dismantled about onethird of the greenhouses and relocated them in israel wolfensohn raised 14 million from private us donors to the aspen institute to buy the remaining estimated 750 acres of greenhouses to transfer to palestinians the institute worked with the israel based economic cooperation foundation the official purchaser security us officials had urged israel and the palestinians to increase security cooperation to ensure that disengagement was conducted peacefully in order to establish httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22000 basis for resuming the peace process israeli defense minister shaul mofaz and palestinian interior minister nasser youssef agreed to coordinate on the ministerial level in joint coordination committees and between commanders in the field as disengagement neared coordination intensified the two sides set up joint operations centers at the erez and rafah crossings to help them respond to any violence and on august 14 palestinian security forces deployed to prevent attacks on settlements by palestinian militants the idf commander in gaza said that pa forces had prevented attacks during disengagement and against the idf afterwards under the terms of bilateral israeliegyptian agreement egypt is deploying 750 border police to secure the gazaegyptian border philadephi route and prevent arms and drug smuggling and terrorist infiltration the palestinians are not party to these arrangements movement israel and the palestinians have not yet agreed on outlets from the gaza strip to the wider world that are essential for the territorys economic development israel fear that freer palestinian movement will lead to increased terrorism within israel james wolfensohn us lt gen william ward whom the us administration assigned to work with the palestinians on security reform and the parties are developing plan to upgrade security controls at border crossings to ease the flow of palestinian goods but new system is not yet in place israel accepted an egyptian compromise whereby the rafah crossing would be closed for six to nine months for renovations transit from egypt into gaza would then be via terminal controlled by israel at kerem shalom where the borders of israel egypt and gaza meet after that period people would resume using rafah under european british monitoring with surveillance cameras transmitting images to israel goods would continue to pass through kerem shalom the pa rejected the compromise arguing that israel remains an occupying power as long as it controls access points after israeli forces withdrew from gaza the border was chaotically open to people and goods as well as arms and drug smugglers for several days the world bank will conduct feasibility studies on rail link or sunken road between gaza and the west bank which would take several years to construct and require crs5 israeli authorization israel has authorized construction of palestinian seaport which will take several years prime minister sharon told palestinian president mahmud abbas that he could prepare the gaza airport which could be operational in months for reopening but israel has not approved the reopening implications for the future after disengagement the palestinian authority will attempt to establish record of successful governance in gaza in order to lay the basis for future palestinian state its priorities include developing devastated economy to create jobs and housing and ensuring the security of the residents international aid will help but the pas use of funds will be scrutinized due to past problems with corruption nepotism and waste moreover the pa has not yet established the rule of law in gaza or the west bank problems include vigilantism abductions of aid workers and journalists and clashes between pa security forces and militants moreover hamas intend to transfer its successful armed resistance from gaza to the west bank creating dilemma for president abbas who wants to include the group in the political system and move rapidly to final status negotiations with israel httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22000 although the israeli government officially recognizes that the future will see the emergence of palestinian state palestinians fear that disengagement reflects an israeli gaza first gaza only policy citing statements of israeli officials on october 6 2004 prime minister sharons aide dov weisglass asserted the significance of the disengagement plan is the freezing of the peace process and when you freeze that process you prevent the establishment of palestinian state and you prevent discussion of the refugees the borders and jerusalem3 moreover to assuage settlers fears that disengagement from gaza will set precedent for withdrawals from the west bank and to win leadership contest in his rightwing likud party sharon has asserted that there will be more unilateral disengagements and repeatedly promised to retain and expand five large west bank settlement blocs and to connect them territorially to jerusalem and israel however sharon also has suggested that in final negotiations israel might have to give up more west bank settlements he has further declared that he would not hold negotiations on jerusalem under any circumstances after israels disengagement from gaza it has been assumed that the quartet would urge the parties to return to the road map framework phase i of the road map requires israel to dismantle settlement outposts and end all settlement activity and the palestinians to end terrorism us and israeli officials disagree as to whether the requirements of phase i are sequential or simultaneous with sharon repeatedly insisting that forceful pa action against terrorists ie hamas and other groups is precondition for the road map since president abbas has vowed not to use force against factions and intends to include them in the palestinian political process sharons precondition is unlikely to be met and as noted above israel is continuing construction in the settlements us officials have not indicated how they intend to assist or accomplish the transition from disengagement to road map the new york times reported that the bush administration seeking not to undermine sharon in the midst of domestic political challenges has urged 3 trshavit ari top pm aide gaza plan aims to freeze the peace process haaretz october 6 2004 crs6 its partners in the quartet to defer pressuring israel to make concession required by the road map process4 disengagement has made some arab and

september 14 shalom met the indonesian and algerian foreign ministers in new york shalom will travel to tunisia in november to revive ties that were suspended in 2000 cost and aid the total cost of

years with onethird to be used to relocate military bases from the gaza strip to israel and the rest to develop the negev and galilee regions of israel and for other purposes6 preliminary talks were held in light of the costs inflicted on the united states by hurricane katrina an israeli delegation intending to discuss the aid cancelled trip to washington and deputy premier and finance minister
