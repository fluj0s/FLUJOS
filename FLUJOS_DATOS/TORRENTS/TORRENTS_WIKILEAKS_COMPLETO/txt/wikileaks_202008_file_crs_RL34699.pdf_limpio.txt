states commission on civil rights commission as an independent executive bipartisan fact finding agency the mission of the commission was to inform both the president and congress on implementation of civil rights protections currently the commission is composed of eight members four members are appointed by the president and two each by the president pro tempore of the senate and the speaker of the house on the recommendations of the majority and minority leaders in each chamber more than four members at any one time can be of the same political party since 1957 the commission has been reauthorized number of times most r ecently with passage of the civil rights commission amendments act of 1994 pl 103419 which expired september 30 1996 however congress has appropriated about 9 million each fiscal year since 1995 for the agency on september 30 2008 the consolidated security disaster assistance and continuing appropriations act 2009 wa s enacted into w pl 110 329 hr 2638 which provides for the commission to be funded in fy2009 at the fy2008 enacted funding level of 85 million until march 6 2009 for fy2009 the bush administration requested 88 million for the us commission on civil rights which was 300 thousand above the fy 2008 funding for the commission according to some observers discrimination has become more subtle since the establishment of the commission and conti nues to affect women and certain racial and ethnic minorities resulting in inequalities that affect income job status and educational attainment these advocates believe that the commissions mandate allows it to support special legislative measures to overcome these socioeconomic inequalities opponent s of this view however contend that the purpose of civil rights laws is to ensure equality of opportunity not to guarantee actual socioeconomic equality among racial and et hnic groups and between the sexes they state that when the commission seeks gr oup preferences and be nefits it becomes more of an advocate for special interests rather than an impartial monitor of legal equality for several decades tensions have increased among advocates of these fundamentally different approaches to addressing the issue of civil rights when determining whether or on what occasion it is appropriate to consider race gender or other factors in forming policy the issue of civil rights triggers strong beliefs and emotions making it extremely difficult to reach consensus on the commission as consequence some allege that the process for appointing members to the commission has become major tool in controlling debate on civil rights and molding public policy on the issue leading to partisanship that interferes with the agencys effectiveness this crs report

traditionally was believed that the commission should be independent of the pr esident and that its members should be protected from removal for political reasons in 1982 debate developed over the work of the commission and the presidents power over it that year president ronald reagan nominated reverend b sam hart to the commission hart was opposed by some civil rights groups in cluding the

in 1983 he sought to replace three mo re commissioners who had been frequent critics of his administration s civil rights policies when some senate opposition to replacing the commissioners developed the president fired them rather than waiting until the senate conf irmed their replacements7 president reagans firing of the three commissioners triggered debate on the commissions independence who should appoint its member s and its mandate approaches to civil rights this debate revealed fundamental differences in approaches to addressing the issue of civil rights some members of congress and civil rights activists charged that president reagan was undermining the commissions traditional independence some members of the us commission on civil rights maintained that despite legal guarantees of equal opportunity inequalities persiste d between minority groups nd women on one hand and white males on the other in income job status and educational attain ment they believed that the commissions mandate allowed it to support special legislative measures to overcome socioeconomic inequality b ecause such inequality resulted from discrimination8 the administration and its suppor ters argued that the federal governments role in enforcing civil righ ts should focus on discrimination against an individual rather than against groups of individuals who historically have been victims of discrimination further accord ing to this view the us commission on civil rights mandate did not extend to s eeing that equality of opportunity resulted in actual socioeconomic equality among r acial and ethnic groups and between the sexes9 supporters of president reagan argued that in pressing for what they called group preferences and benefits the co mmission had become less an impartial monitor of legal equality and mo re an advocate of particular interests thus in this view the commission politicized itself and consequently forfeited its traditional independence from the president united states commission on civil rights act of 1983 differing views of the commission led to congressional proposals to allow the thenexisting civil rights commission to expire and to create new civil rights commission in the legislative branch eventually congress and president reagan compromised on the issue the united states commission on civil rights act of 1983 pl 98183 was

the commission have policy for determining when and how to select external re viewers the gao report compared the commissions policy on using external reviewers with the national academies and the congressional budget office agencies that use external reviewers to assess the completeness balance and objectivity of their reports according to gao the guiding principle used by these agencies is

offices such as the office of civil rights eval uation the office of general counsel or others which then would ensu re that agency procedures are followed each responsible project office would th

some civil rights advocat for two primary reasons first some commissioners said they did not believe that vacancy existed on the commission in november 1995 president clinton appointed judge leon higginbotham to six year term on the commission judge hi gginbotham died in december 1998 before the expiration of his term of service which would have been november 29 2001 on appointing victoria wilson to the v acancy in december 1998 president clinton in his appointment certificate indicated that her term would expire on november 29 2001 however her attorney leon friedm an claimed this was clerical error friedman was reported in the washington post as stating that statutes governing the commission did not allow for the appointment of members to inte rim or acting status and that all terms were for six years48 on december 6 2001 president bush appoi nted peter kirsanow labor lawyer and former chairman of the center for new black leadership to replace victoria wilson on the commission according to an article in the washington post kirsanows appointment was opposed by some civil rights advocates and commissioners49 moreover some commissioners did not believe that vacancy existed on the commission50 because the commission on civil rights act of 1994 provides that all commissioners serve six year terms commission chairperson mary frances berry insisted that wilsons term

staggered terms of office political balance in the membership of the commission and protection of commission members from presidential removal by limiting removal only for neglect of duty or malfeasan

november 29 2001 because she was appointed to fill the vacancy caused by judge higginbothams death it argued that the civil rights act of 1994 intended to preserve the same staggered sixyear term for commissioners that was provided in the 1983 act otherwise it would allow pres ident before leaving office to appoint majority of his people to the commission52 in 2001 when peter kirsanow appeared at meeting of the commission it refused to seat him by vote of 5353 the bush administration responded by filing fede ral suit seeking removal of commissioner wilson and the seating of kirsanow us
