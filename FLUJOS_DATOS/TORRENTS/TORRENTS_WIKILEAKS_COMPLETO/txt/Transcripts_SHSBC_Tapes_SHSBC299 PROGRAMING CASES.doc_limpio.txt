programing cases part ii lecture given on 30 may 1963 thank you okay how are you today audience fine good you look slightly less human boy youve got an awful comm lag since youve been over here in england you know this humormy jokes have harder time getting forward because youre developing this sense of humor you know thats got comm lag and youve got to stop that i mean whats the date audience thirtieth thirtieth of may all right 30 may ad 13 saint hill special briefing course and im going to talk to you today from the viewpoint of treating gpm as an engram and treating the time track in general and handling cases in general now i think youll find it rather interesting because the data is very fundamental this is actually continuation of yesterdays lecture first thing that you should know on the subject of cases is scale which will assist your reality on the reality of cases scale now this scale is not complete only the major points of this scale are mentioned and there are interim points on this scale which are not mentioned so you realize that youre looking at scale which is gradient scale which has midpoints between the major levels given all right your lowest level on this scalethe outthebottom aspect of the scaleis just total unawareness thats your bottom your next level on this scale is the level of awareness of own evaluations now thats quite an important level its lot more to that level than you would at first look at this is mental science as it has long existed people are aware of their own evaluations in other words what they perceive is their own evaluation of what they perceive you got that and you say thats an awful short look man but that psychiatrist walking around with somebody chattering about something or other and he becomes aware of his own evaluation of that person thats what the psychiatrist becomes aware at and thats whats held up psychiatric research he has evaluated that person as crazy so he is aware of his own evaluation of the person see hes aware of the fact this fellow is crazy now that spreads over to such degree that whenever he examines patient the patient is crazy dont you see see its an incapability of observation because its an observation of ones own evaluation and you see some of this in sciences but you see it most flagrantly in the field of arts and aesthetics and there it is really rampant and you can say the less that is known of subject the more that subject has authority or evaluation as its sole reality or adjudication see the less that is known the more that level that ive just given you is practiced people become aware of their own evaluation and that is it this by the way ismaterial is utterly priceless when it comes to talking to somebody about scientology its priceless because you could break their backs with it and itthey try to put up fight on this subject and youre in amongst them so fast it makes your head swim you see i mean it makes their head swim you realize that you say to somebody well we could make you feel better and scientology is suchandso dont you see and they say well i had an uncle once that didnt think you should ever examine the human mind thats his opinion of scientology dont you see or anybody who is interested in the mind must have something wrong with them see youve heard all these various arguments you see well realize what you are looking at because look at where this level lies now lets go to the next level this is the next major level on this scale which is dubin of dubin and that produces real ball that level of reality produces real ball the guy has dubin of his own nightmares you see something like this you know he dubs inhe dubs in the facsimiles that he got while asleep see he dubs in the dubin you know hes got dubin already see but hewell all he sees is dubin of the dubin and that is ball that one that is ball thats like somebody forming his opinion from newspaper articles you see how common this is see thats already dubin well actually thats allthat possibly even could be called dubin of dubin of dubin because youve got this kind of condition the newspaper reporter was talking to somebody who wasnt informed thats dub in of dubin see then of course if you had somebody who dubbed in on everything he observed his version of the newspaper article would be so fantastic as not to be recognizable and that would give you dubin of dubin of dubin the person interviewed was dubbing in you know like the ama an ama authority speaking you see the reporter he cant duplicate so he gives some wild hoppedup version of what this ama spokesman said all right thats dubin of dubin and then of course if youthis becomes ridiculousthis is your substratas of itif somebody came along and read this article who also dubbed inama spokesman says men from mars must not land i mean thats about the story you would get from the dubin dubin dubin see and the ama authority was talking about the fact that doctors must have more money you see now try to follow down line of evidence at this level this dubin of dubin just try to follow line of evidence at this and you get about the wildest thing you see you get somebody who hates to eat taking cooking from bad teacher boy this leads to more boston stomachs than you can count all right we are just now approaching unconsciousness as thetan manifestationas thetan manifestation the body plus thetan can go lower scale than thetan and thetans unconsciousness lies just above this dubin of dubin thats thetans unconsciousness see body plus thetan can stay conscious longer apparently than thetan you see as far as awareness of being thetan do you understand that all right regardless of the complications involved in that youll find somebody goes through lot of boiloff above this point and he gets some of the wildest stuff you ever heard of this stuff is pretty wild he can get everything pretty well combined into godelpus now our next level up is simply dubin of the track were not too much interested in dubin of the physical universe around us but it gives us test of what this pc or person is doing but were interested in it as auditors from the viewpoint of dubin of the track there is the facsimilethe facsimile is there you must know this the facsimile does exist but what the person sees is dubin of the facsimile that is there sees second facsimile you see quite intriguing and now you get as the next major point on this particular scale nonperception we know this more generally as the level at black five we used to speak of it but its level of nonperception whether the person is seeing blackness or invisibility or small rockets or something of the sort it doesnt matteryou know little specks traveling across in the darkness or something like that it doesnt matter what this visibility is as long as its nonvisibility see whats the field there that expresses this nonvisibility you see well its just an absence of time track however that absence is created and then above this level we get our next major level we get spotty partialperceptic glimpses of the time track the person may have only visio on or may have something else on or may have something else on but the rest of it is off dont you seeand sees two pictures of the engram but sees connecting pictures in between those two pictures and doesnt have any tactile or doesnt have any sonic or something like that thats your partial perception of the time trackonce more has to be mentioned and there is visible track and that is your nexttothehighest levelvisible track and as you can see that is gradient because you actually got state of clear there or that isoh i dont know how many goal clearfifty or sixtygoal clear something like this theres interruptions of the track doesnt all go black on him if its blackif the period on the track is black why the person sees blackness you see but otherwise doesnt some of the perceptions may shut down occasionally and turn on again but only shut down when the person isnt paying attention to them monitors the time track something like monitoring the physical environment youre not necessarily aware of all of the noises thator sights or perceptions or sensations that are taking place in the physical environment dont you see now theres one level above that and thats that theres track now you can see in looking at this scale that your track becomes mockerylowerscale mockery see your track becomes lowerscale mockery there several times so the first two levels of track and visible track interchange as harmonics on down the line so this makes it very easy for somebody casually observing this thing to make some rather horrendous errors in the pc you can get yourself all tangled up as to exactly where this pc sits on this scale unless you yourself get some practical experience with this scale now that is the scale and that is scale of perception of the time track and these are the different varieties or the different aspects of that perception one case perceives at one level another case perceives at another level another case perceives at another level and that is what makes cases different that is what makes cases different one case to the next and could to some degree be said what makes one case require longer in auditing than another case so any estimate of the length of time case would require in auditing should in actual honesty be made off that scale i have just given you now how would you determine levels on that scale now you probably could work out very rapid testing mechanism to recognize these various levels by using the physical universe thats quite interesting use the physical universe youd have the pc look at wall with picture on it and then close his eyes and see picture of the wall whats he got well what hes got is actually an upgraded aspectupgradedof that scale i just gave you its an upgraded aspect of it its better than that scale but not much see the error is that the case looks better than it is so you tell pc all right look at that wall shut your eyes do you see picture of the wall what is the picture like and hell put himself on the scale and he actually puts himself on the scale about half tone or tone higher because its present time hes not under duress for other reasons and closer to pt they very often are able to handle their track better dont you see so your estimate after the pc has done this is still taken conservatively but within that comment you will find that is pretty reliable the person says whatwhat wall you know takes picture of the wallwhat wall well i dont have any picture of the wall well that level tends to be more accurate than the other levels because you can spot him right there on invisible track just like that see with some fair accuracy but at the same time be prepared to have that case slip on the actual time track one half to one lower see the case does see picture and so forth its more likely to be dub see all right now this is quite amusing and this is an amusing exercise because everybody tends to slightly alter the proceedings now this gives everybody the feeling when they first try this sort of thing that theyre much worse off than they are actually none of these conditions are terribly serious until you get down to that evaluation one when you get as far south as that or into the next one unawarenessand when you get down to those thats pretty serious thats pretty serious because you cant communicate with the bloke hes sitting there wondering whether or not scientology would meet the approval of his grandmother and youre trying to run case i mean totally silly situation you see youre trying to audit and hes viewing his own evaluations and i dont know if you have ever tried to run pc who was totally unconsciousi mean totally unconscious in coma lying in bed someplace or something like thatits quite remarkable but all you can do isyou can do itbut all you can do is establish communication you eventually can establish communication but that is your first point now the establishment of communication at this particular level moves the person up to the next level they think you are not going to do them well or something theyre theyre more impressed with their own evaluation of why you are trying to help them something like that you see than they are in actually being helped and theyll move up into dub in of dub and theyll move up into dubin of track theyll move up to invisibility they will move up from invisibility into sporadic track and so forth but it all depends on how you handle the case in order to get it moved up but let assure you that the earliest stages there the lowest levels of that are not to be adventured upon with happy smile and jaunty cock of the hat thats not something that you flick your lapels off neatly and say well well knock this off in an afternoon now knowing this knowing this i can save you few loses based on an overoptimism youll occasionallyyoull by and large in the majority of the cases that you have anything to do with be dealing with invisibility and sporadic track that happens to be very large number of the cases youll be dealing withinvisibility and sporadic track and thats very fortunate but you slip downscale there on this case you know this case ayou know and you look at this same case and because youve just had some magnificent wins on somebody who waswell he couldnt see thing and you eventually got his facsimiles on and that sort of thing and gave you nice win and you grab the next fellow and this fellow is saying i wonder if i really shouldnt have listened to mywife about being processed iveive had some misgivings about it you see in my early life i had great deal of religious training and it has seemed to it has seemed to that tampering with the soul well base yourbase your conclusions accordingly youre not going to get the same win that you just got on the person you just processed its rocky road from that point up to track now i cant give you any fancy mathematical figure that gives you the multiple number of hoursand the figure would not be based on any real data and so would have great valuebut i can give you an educated guess and so on that it goes by times from sporadic track if you considered sporadic track one your auditing time valueand this is just an educated guessis you see twice for the total invisibility you see that and i would go so far as to say four for the dubin of actual track eight for dubin of dubin sixteen for your evaluation and thirtytwo or thereabouts for your unconsciousness all those numbers what times as long to get result multiply thirtytwo timeswell lets say it takes youits going to take you 150 hours to run out twenty implantsthats well thats number one lets say its very clumsy and so forth that would be terribly slow running and all that and allows for all sorts of things and an uneducated pc and i dont know what all dont you see but going to take you 150 hours well how long is it going to take you to handle an unconscious case up through the same thing well thats thirtytwo times 150 you see what i mean now of course what are we talking about what case result are we talking about thats the other thing that figures into this well of course youre not going to hear from here on talking about anything but otthe only case result im interested in weve already weve already got the fait accompli on clearing and all that sort of thing and you can let somebody else talk about that and you can beat the drum for it and you can pat people on the back for it and so forth and just realize that that is not necessarily rocky road and not necessarily an unactual road youve all of sudden taken off on new line and this line is is weve got that level whipped and you can talk about it all you want to to people and the public and that sort of thing but realize that any effort to approach an ultimate in processing leads you straight toward ot and thats where it goes youre going to be throwing anvils over your shoulder as thetan before youre through with this so why worry about it of course that upgrades the number of hours to such result and im looking at about five hundred hours to ot or something like that right about now thats not an educated guess but for what case for what case its that case with the sporadic trackabout five hundred hours because person would be awful close to ot if they had totally visible actual track dont you see all right now youve got this gradients of cases you got that i dont want to labor this because its actually not subject that you can labor very hard because it is based on very crude levels these levels are quite crude theyre quite factual but theyre very broad and they have lots of interims dont you see so there is the person who only half dubs in dont you see dubin you know and theres person who sometimes can talk sensibly and the rest of the time talks in terms of his own evaluations you see and theres interim areas there but somebody can have lot of fun with that as system of classification because it gives you classification and is interesting to you mainly in crude estimate of the number of hours of what you can do its the number of hours that are required to do what you can do but we have to say to what or to whom and if all cases look alike to you youve just been reading too much thomas jefferson nothing wrong with old tom but im afraid he didnt know too much about the mind theres differences and those are the differences now do you notice that insanity and neurosis play part whatsoever in that scale of case estimate ability to respond to communication and all of that sort of thing play part in that there is estimate there at all part of that well why this sudden skip of what man fondly calls his fondest divisions of case this fellow is insane and that fellow is neurotic and this other fellow is something else and so forth and man is marvelous on this subject he just thinks this is gorgeous he never had such time as classifications in these lines well those classifications have bearing in fact of any kind whatsoever and are adjudications all from one level of that scale see so you have much broader field of classification the moment that you step outside of observation of own evaluations the second you stay out of that now mental science unfortunately or perhaps necessarily has been in that particular state for very long time and therefore youll find most of its literature and so on is dreamed up from that particular level and therefore is not factual so that you get observational tests as being considered totally valid tests well any test that has human observer connected with it to adjudicate whether somebody passed it or didnt pass it and so forth is bound to be bad test just bound to be how many times have you been flunked on tr 1 for instance in the old days by coach that couldnt coach see well now there it was pass or flunk by uneducatednot even educatedopinion dont you see that has terrific variability and terrific invalidity and that was the reason for these new trs which you are using see it just removes all trs from coaching from that level of the scale so therefore youre free to make further progress than you were before well one of the things that knocks out insanity and neurosis as proper evaluation of state of case on anybody is because these are contained as goals in the helatrobus implants and i think any wisdom that is based on the helatrobus implants is sort of headed for the junk heap the goals in there are quite alarming i found goal on my pc last night to get it its there interesting goal isnt it to get it well what does itwhat does it refer to what does it modify sickness havingness being unlucky see its just one of those portmanteau things but you dont have to have that type of goal which is untranslatable or undeterminable theres goals in that lineup that are quite determinable such as to be sick its there to die thats there to move to escape nearly every oneany one of these implants has at some time or another been the source of the most learned treatises which explain all of mans ills how many articles and things have you seen on escapism so its not valid material on which to adjudicate such things and im afraid this whole subject of insanity is just about as valid as helatrobus implant as source of philosophy theres something else there are the mechanics of livingness and we have had these nailed down for long time and im rather proud of the fact that they have minimally been influenced by these implants here and there i have found an implant where something gave us bad twist for instance there are several incidents in what to audit or history of man that are taken from an implant given about four galaxies over it starts with goal oddly enough and then doesnt consist of gpm type thing they lay you down and show you endless pictures on motionpicture screen i just mentioned it the other day well actually thesethe actual engrams of these things can be found on the time track the actual engrams they do exist but this wasthe implant is what picked them up and restimulated them and kept them all in bunch you see and what to audit was influenced by that implant but the remainder of our material is remarkably uninfluenced by this we have moved toward the helatrobus implants because they were trying to find something that would really aberrate somebody and sooner or later we certainly would collide with the very bestthe very very best authoritarian minds on the whole track on how to do somebody in if we were trying to pick people up out of the mud sooner or later wed crosswed do crossroads with somebody who had been on an opposite tack and that was what happened there with the helatrobus implants thats quite remarkable that weve escaped it to the degree that we have now what then determines persons level on that scale and that is point that philosophers could sit down and philosophize over for very very long long time you could start with the basis of the inequality of thetan power one thetan has less thetan power than another thetan see you could theorize on the subject of well this persons overts are different than that persons overts you could have various reasons why they wind up at different positions on the scale i dont necessarily pay much attention to these that ive just mentioned but there is another one that you might pay attention to is length of time in the universe the older person is in the universe the further they are down that scalewhich gives you some kind of weird theory aboutit obviates the idea or throws aside the idea that the universe was created by sneeze at the same exact instant you see but predicates cumulative universe that picks up the home universes of thetans at different times on the track and people in better shape have been less long in the universe than people who are in terrible shape then this of course could be monitored by the number of overts committed and the amount of overwhelm and it could be monitored this way and that way but also could be monitored by different status of thetan at the time of entrance into the universe you could figure out lot of things around this way but you dont have to go into this line because youre asking why and were not interested too much in why because why has bearing on it to solve it we dont have to have why in order to solve it and its good thing its just how do they get there in those different levels see and thats only one short answer its contained in one word charge now this is very lucky for you that this can be stated as easily as it can be stated very lucky for too it makes good communication level and so forth but its very simple charge is quantitative thing like buckets of water lets say we could take all the charge off of case and run it through an ohm meter and put up its additive you know i mean put up the total amount run off you know your house usesone house uses so much electricity and another house uses different quantity but they send you bill well thats based on the amount of electricity pumped into the joint by the light company or what their meter says was pumped in well you take the eighteen buttons principally and you keep pumping charge into case by these buttons going out you know the case suppresses asserts protests invalidatesyou know this is life and button by button by button why this case is getting charge stacked up on him its residual charge if you could thetan however is not condenser if thetan were condenser or something like that you could discharge it with one short circuit the psychiatrists fond hope that unfortunately cant be done because charge is built up on case by intelligence understanding or lack of it and therefore has to be taken off case the same way and you see if life consisted of matter energy space and time without the additive of thought all this would probably be very easy you just pull so much mass off thetan and so much space off thetan and so much energy off thetan and so much time off thetan and youd stack them all up and lay them over there it probably all could be done mechanically but actually unfortunately theres this thing called thought and thought is composed of many things including volition and as result as the universe pumps the charge in on thetan he starts pumping the charge into others and into other things inhibits himself from doing so and you get the overts that cause withholds and you get the charge encysted cyst and the composite picture of the number of things done to the being held in place by the number of things done by the being as overtsthats what wraps them up and keeps them on the case you seeand you get x amount of charge now you might make it constant per case except that its growing all the time its progressive constant for instance this year why he has number of spluggits of charge and next year why hell have plus one years spluggits of charge you see andthis is the way itll goand then he gets into bad company the next year after and decides to join the fda or do some other criminal action and hell suddenly add onto his case you see at an accelerated rate it isnt just the amount of time person lives you see its also the person has volition and he could speed this up and he could slow it down and he does something likecriminal like joining the fda or something like that you know just completely sells out the human race and there he is in the course of the next few years he runs up as much charge as hes run in the last two lifetimes so you have that much more charge per case dont you see and then he decides that he doesnt feel very strong these days so hes going to sit the next few out and he goes out andor he decides hes going to bedo good works or something and maybe he lives for several lifetimes without accumulating much more than just few little ergs incidental to being in the universe dont you see he isnt viciously accumulating charge in other words well thats the way it goes it ebbs and flows he gets active and charge accumulates more and he gets inactive and accumulates less and he runs up lot of overts you see and he accumulates charge like mad and he tries to do some good and maybe even gets rid of little charge and various things happen but its always plus always plus always plus always plus and it wouldnt matter if it took hundred trillion years to get one more erg plus it will be plus see charge is always additive in the absence of scientology charge is always additive thats the trick of this universe thats the only thing that makes it bad universe you overcome that you got it made see then all the work somebody went to to put it here you see to be trap in the first place youve had him you see youve got the universe and its not trap i think itd be an awfully good joke im in very good frame of mind to just pull that joke too but the universe basically doesnt have to be aberrative and isntif you just go out and admire it and so forth youll find its therapeutic in other words you could drift along for quite while and do quite all right but its not going to drop charge off of you it might make you volitionally feel better about the charge that is on you already because you can also have an attitude toward the charge it doesnt vary the amount of charge but you can have an attitude toward it now in view of the fact that an ot can kick out more megatrons than little boy jack or khrushkis legions could this is very funny that charge would bother him till we figure out the basic overt of the thetan any overt thetan commits is also mixed up with the energy thetan is emitting so all of his overts have particles connected with the overt so the only way to really get him is to hit him with particles see its the path of his overts so naturally you find these implants are mostly connected with particles particle flow of various types now whats this amount to in the final analysis we have person who has amount of chargethat quantity aand quantity b and quantity c and another person quantity d and another person with quantitysee we dont carewe dont care so much why they got this charge or what is the source of all of this charge but we do care about the fact that they do have different amounts and this rule is operative the more charge person has the more difficult it is to release it that quantitative rule applies thats gruesome fact but thats what gives you your numerical relationship in how long does it take to process somebody and thats why ive showed you there going up progressively on the scale person thats unconscioushow much charge unless this unconsciousness is caused by some artificial means such as pressure on the brain or something like this which the moment its relieved will relieve the unconsciousness you then have temporary condition dont you see you have to differentiate between temporary condition and chronic condition duration of timehow long does temporary condition have to continue in order to become chronic condition well ordinarily its measured within the finite limits of one lifetimetemporary conditionsfinite limits in one lifetime when you exceed the limits of one lifetime you get chronic condition if you figure it that way so that ten minutes is part of lifetime see and eightyeight years for person that ordinarily only lives only seventy you see is not part of lifetime so that becomes chronic and if you get your divisional line between chronic and thatnot on mans viewpoint which only gives you about sixty seventy years to work with or something like that which is just sneeze in eternityyou start working out on some more practical basis such as well much more practical basis to work with is billion years thats little long thats little long its nice span of time though its good good healthy span of time half billion years well i dont know its pretty hard to complete cycle in half billion years you can try and you get it down to million years and of course hehheh to get anything done in million years and make it stickthats really going some man youre really on your way thats tearing the ground up in all directions the length of time since the birth of chrthe alleged birth of christ is so shortis so short that before youve gone very long on the road to ot you could probably remember what you had for breakfast in the year 2 and theduring the third day of the saturnalia or something like that not that you wouldprobably cause you as much work to remember what you had for breakfast that morning as it does now to remember what you had for breakfast yesterday see you probably cant think of what you had for breakfast yesterday right now so that is very finite period of time thats very short period of time couple of thousand yearsnothing id like couple of thousand years just to sit on rock and look at the sceneryone of my ambitions take off nice vacation i consider nice quick short vacation about ten thousand years i think that would bethats nice that would be nice see give you time to get fully accustomed to the view catch your breath you know or catch your beams get your beams untangled finitefinite or temporary conditions do result from physiological error in the mockup the person is packing around see the guy cant walk because hes got broken leg you see well this can carry over to some degree in that hes liable to have somatic in the next bodys leg but it doesnt carry over into the next lifetime he has broken leg so if you just consider onelifetime situation or any fragment of onelifetime situation as temporary and things which extend over the period of one lifetime as chronic then were talking the same language not that you have to consider it this way at all but its good language division this guy is chronically something or other well youre liable to hear some medico say hes chronically lame and we get to the next change of casethe next differences of cases is this person always going to be spastic matter what body he picks up or is this person merely spastic because of the condition of the body he picked up see now that makes difference in your processing of that spastic and enters in to an estimate of the amount of time person is going to require in processing is this spasticity chronic condition or temporary condition by which we mean is it just going to last this lifetime or is it going to keep on going with this poor thetan see now if it is so built and it is so strong as to be chronic condition that goes on and on and on and on lifetime after lifetime after lifetime dont throw up your hands in horror and say nothing can be done about it but just realize youre looking at much greater span of time much greater span of time now how would you find that out well you might put somebody on an meter and say well were you deaf in your last life and it bangs and you say all right were you deaf in the life before that and it bangs well youve allyouve made your estimate of the situation this is deaf thetan get the difference between that and body you see thetan just occupying body that happens to be deaf now thatsthats all part of adjudications of the amount of time in processing it is not necessarily part of that scale but causes you to make closer examination of the person with regard to that scale because the moreyou remember the old tone scale had neurological ills and that sort of thing on it and so forth well they were simply to give you tone level it wasnt because the neurological ills were of any importance the individual who was susceptible to these things over long period of time of course was lower on that scale ive given you all this thing adds up then about eighteen dozen ways from the middle and you can make lot of figurefigure on this thing and you can get yourself lot of answers im just showing you some various ways of use of the thing but charge is what causes the scale basically to be that way now you mustnt always be deluded into believing that because thetan plus body is in certain condition that the thetan is necessarily low on that scale i had person who was absolutely sure they were psychotic one time and i made some tests of this particular character and that person was deadon and moremore definitely that person could hold position of two objects in space hahhah that person wasnt nuts that person was simply in disagreement with the family and environment and they thought he was nuts see this was actually very simple case the person very easily belonged into the classification of sporadic track and therefore would have flown going to makeyoure going to make mistakes on this until you finally accustom yourself to it because it determines what you do with the person and therefore its an essential part of programing to be able to estimate what you are going to program and what youre going to program is the persons case therefore you have to have some estimate of the case in order to program the case and frankly in going for ot we have just left aside practically every method of measurement of cases we have for estimates in processing see weve just more or less thrown them all away because weve got different target therefore we have to make reevaluation of cases we have to have new scale for cases now unless you can do this thing ive just given you here unless you can you know add case up in there and understand this one way or the other then how are you going to program this case because case is programed in relationship to the amount of charge on the case now i gave you some factors yesterday that also influenced programing as to who is going to audit this case and that sort of thing they also influence programing but basically there is b units of charge on this case and programing is simply how were going to take the charge off the case now in view of the fact that it requires the cooperation of the thetan we are processingif it werent for that itd be easy you seeit requires the cooperation of this being matter how faint that cooperation is then an estimate of his ability as case is also pertinent but thats contained in the same package of scale ive just given you because each one of those levels has certain definite abilities and adjudications they have very definite abilities level by level by level and they just rattle off one two three four if you want to get job done dont give it to somebody whos unconscious in other words its direct relationship now if you want to find out something dont send somebody who dubs in dubin see so all of those things have direct relationships to the amount of time the case is going to spend but that time depends on the programing and the reason it makes it time is because the programing has to be different case to case and the longer the period of time going to be spent the more programing is called for here i can give you some very very fast programs one way or the other you will see quite few of these ill give you sample program we got case who dubs in track we found this out track doesnt seem to match up now we can still run charge off of this case we get big dialwide rrs on the helatrobus implants even though theyre seeing the wrong scene and all this sort of thing well if they can run it run it see but thats sort of running withwell thats sort of going for swim in sharkinfested pool with shark oil because this case can go to smithereens very easily programing for the case would at least consist of pulling the overtsthis lifetime or any stretch of track in which they have any reality certainly would consider that making awful sure that the case had withholds from the auditor about this lifetime particularly making very very sure that the case was audited in pretty muzzled fashion and wasnt driven very hard dont ever force that case man that case says i donti donti just dont think i can face that next ri because all of sudden all of sudden its grown green whiskers or something i dont think i can face it im afraid that would be case you would not say say it again that wouldnt be such case youd just hit the silk right there youd just hit the silk and you return to an arc break type process youd run implants if you could get them to rocket read but only so long as they were run easily and you would fall back with great speed to patching up and putting together any roughedup track because of running the implants youd always use since the last time i audited you get the idea youd always use this kind of thing make sure that youre not running session with withhold on it but thats dangerous and you should realize that running that case that way is dangerous and that would be very extreme programing for the case to actually run implants off this case very extreme programing now you could do it its the fastest way its the quickest way to knock down the case condition and move them up scale as case but its one of these things you know thats right on the edge right on the edge and youd also run the case this way if you got your hands on goal you would run all the charge off the goal before you did anything else and you couldnt run the case back too far without running them early you know youd never pull such trick as finding goal and then trying to find couple earlier than it see youd never scatter around you wouldnt drive the case hard to pull all of the charge off of the implant youd just be content with one long rocket read and then you would get out of there get that type of approach in other words this is all kidglove stuff see all right lets take thislets take this case with the sporadic now lets take this case with the sporadic view of the time track its pretty accurate that sort of thing now you can stack that case up awful hard you can stack that case up awful tight you can runyou can run bank and then you can move bankyou can move two three banks forward and then run back to the bank youve readyou just found you see i mean you run all the ris back to the bank youve already got clean then you could move him six goals forward from where you were just overtly and find the tops of those gpms you see run them through crash see run them right back to the last one that youd cleaned you get the idea in other words going forward several goals and sweeping back to the clean area and jumping forward several more goals you could even go worse than this you can even leave goals undone the case is now starting to get pretty uncomfortable but the case can do it the case gets arc breaks but case can do it do you understand because youre not running any danger its almost impossible to run this case into danger the case could be pushed hard get the idea the case that is an invisibility case cant be pushed anywhere near that hard but still cant really be gotten into severe danger its not anot case of being able to knock them off and have them spin for day or something like that you get the difference of programming now you get this dubin casea safe way to program such case is lots of track cleanup lots of straightwire lots of pulling missed withholds lots of straightening up track you see lots of havingness and then we find and run an implant ready to cut and run and hit the silk any time the pc starts going this way see get the difference of case handling of course doing something like that look at the amount of time it costs you over and above just sitting there running implants see all right dubin of dub that level of caseaw are you kidding you let him near an implant oh man they would get so involved and they would spin so fast and they would spin so hard that youd be hard put to put them back together again fortunately the case isnt very general that case is handled with straightwire arc break processes and build it up man keep going give the casenever give the case lose give it nothing but wins run it very lightly very mildly and run it just at that level where it gets session wins gets win in session win in session win in session win in session youll be surprised how tiny some of these wins are theyre wins and you know that youre doing it too steep when they dont get session win thats too steep and you drop right back down scale this is true of all cases but particularly that case its not true of person who has sporadically visible correct track he can have half dozen sessions with damn win at all and youve gotten charge off all the way and he comes out of it see and hes had wins see but this caseyou dont depend on that case that i just mentioned saying he has had wins you couldnt care less whether he says he has wins or not but this caseunless this case recognizes wins this cases reality is not coming up now lets go little bit further downscale and lets take the person who has own evaluations of own evaluations and boy youre sure getting toward case that can only stand havingness thats how extreme this is getting at this point its getting awfully extreme so youre looking at cchs youre lookingyoure looking at various types of roomcontact presenttimecontact processes so some fellow says well i dont know ive often thought you scientologists might possibly have something because i had patient once who thought that you possibly might have something what you going to do well of course if he has certain professional connections it might be great temptation to say you know all right lets pick up die and nix die and ohhehheh and fire away it might be great temptation but if youre going to help this case out man youre not going to run him anywhere near track because he doesnt knowhe doesnt know what hes had for breakfast he cannot differentiate an overt his level of responsibility is incapable of detecting an overt this kind of case by the way can go down and rob shop and then tell you all about it in session but it never comes off as an overt youve seen this type of response to security checking well theres where that case stands with relationship to implants thats cchs and your risk is straightwire now werewere really going to take big risk with this case see were going to run some straightwire get theget the different view and the case thats unconscious of course merely establish communication if you can eventually establish communication well touch that pillow touch the bed and move their hand accordinglyany type of communication or reach that you can establish that way its sort of downgraded cch youll get to such case animal processing and so forth doesnt necessarily follow this but againfollow on that scalebut its again question of establishing communication and if you can get the animal to reach why hell come up the line i told you one time i gave up on cat just out of pure laziness and so forth but i never did get the cat up to talking i didnt spend many hours on the cat but the cat got awful bright very brilliant cat after while there was time in processing now if id setif id programed that the way you should why the cat would come way up the line now i dont know how youd process beetle at the moment i really dont know because his reality would be if you were going to squash him or that youre some kind of giant or something he wouldnt have any kind of reality at all on the situation but theres cases and theres how theythere is the data on which you program thats how to establish the data from which you program and in using the scale in using the scale use it adventurously always establish somebodys level on the scale optimistically and fall back if you have to always be little optimistic now there are lots of tests for this kind of thing im sure lot of tests will be developed along this basic line by which you can establish this much more easily and probably these tests can be coordinated against the old ocas and that sort of thingagainst the behavior and the security the old auditors reports should be able toyou know youve got the persons oca and youve got the auditors report that had that oca and if we had enough time and so forth we could undoubtedly get an oca coordinated against this but that will probably happen too now the programing then is how much charge and the reason for programing is to get as much charge off as can be gotten off with the pc winning you get as much charge off as you can get off with the pc winning and its all quantitative proposition and you see this chargeyou see charge coming off case with the old meter every time that needle goes on big downsurge or throws off cracking big rocket read or something of that sort and every time you getparticularly you get blowdown of your tathats big one thats big stuff you seethats charge off the case thats charge off the case now in view of the fact that all the charge isnt in restimulation at the same time fortunately you see this charge come off one rocket read and so forth and one blowdown at time but its all adding up even though the ta tends to remain high on the case youre still blowing charge off of the case you see and gradually as you go along if you added up the amount of charge for each rr and the relative number of dials of charge that went off for every blowdownyou got the ideahow manyhow far do you have to put this tone arm down and that actually is so many ohms rocket read is registration of so many ohms of release of charge if you went to all of this trouble you actually would come up with mathematical figure see and you could say we have taken at the end of two or three intensives we could say we have removed five volts see or something like that from the pc but its that precise and thats what we mean by charge every time you see that thing blow down thats just that many more microamps that have been registered and longer apply now why is charge important why is it important well thats answered very very briefly its important because its what restimulates when he tries to outflow and therefore prevents his outflow so you see charge on the case does not then give him something that he can release in sudden zap or something like that that isnt it the charge that he has to release that way is actually created by him at the moment of release thats the creation of charge it has nothing to do with residual charge but if he tries to put out any kind of an outflow or tries to reach out hes reaching out through this charge and the charge reactivates because of his reach and knocks his ruddy head off charge is what educates him not to reach now it has numerous reactions upon the thetan such as somatics pain pressure and all that sort of thing but these things do not exist in the absence of charge when the charge is gone these things do not then activate so person can reach and he can do processing then becomes rather simple subject if you look at it theres just so much charge on this case and youve got to release that charge and we know the identity of some of the things the case has that does have maximum charge on it regardless of the significance and then were going to release that much charge off the case that case then will get that much better i mean its just onetwothreefour proposition like that nothing very esoteric so that if we can teach this case to think pure thoughts then at the end of that time he will be able to sit and regard his navel and bother nobody see were notwere not after that particular target we have found that if person cannot reach cannot communicate and cannot be active on their own selfdeterminism that that person is ill and more than that is quite menace to himself and he does himself in all kinds of things are going on that he has control over things look pretty awful now if you were to measure selfdeterminism on the scale i have given you of course total selfdeterminism is only present in the highest level i gave you thats the only place total selfdeterminism is present because if person were totally selfdetermined he wouldnt have any automaticities and therefore hed have time track so therefore thered be charge on the case so you have unlimited reach and thats what wes heading fo these days so brethren get off dat charge thank you editors note the scale referred to by ron in this lecture was later issued as part of hcob 8 june 63 the time track and engram running by chains in the technical bulletins volume vii
