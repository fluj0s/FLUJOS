of the 110th congress the administration requested 1965 billion in emergency supplemental appr opriations for fiscal year fy 2008 including 1893 billion for military operations 69 billion for inte

for international affa irs of the presidents total emergency request 1025 billion for defense and 54 billi on for internationa l affairs remain outstanding congress is expected to cons ider these remaining requests in spring 2008 supplemental appropriations bill1 the administration initially request ed emergency supplemental fy2008 appropriations for military operations in iraq afghanistan and elsewhere along with its regular fy2008 budget request in february 2007 it sub mitted an additional request for 53 billion in emergency funding for mrap vehicles in july 2007 and 45 billion budget amendment for emergenc defense and international affairs funding in october 2007 congress began to consider fy2008 suppl emental appropriati ons in earnest in the fall of 2007 throughout the fall key issue was what impact continued delay in providing funding for overseas military operations would have on the army and marine corps congress approved the regular fy2008 defense appropriations act pl 110116 in november the army and ma rine corps used money in the regular bill to finance both daytoday peacetime activities and also wa rrelated operations the high pace of operations in iraq howev er meant that amounts in the base budget for army and marine corps operation and maintenance in particular were being drained very quickly administrati on officials complained that without supplemental funding the army would r out of money by february and the marine corps by early april key issue then became how long the army and marine corps could extend operations in advance of s upplemental funding either w ith transfers of funds fromhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34278crs2 2 the regular fy2008 defense appropriations bill provides 37 billion of general transfer authority which subject to approval by the congressional defense committees can be used to shift funds between accounts the conso lidated appropriations act provides 37 billion in the iraqi freedom fund which may be transferred to personnel operation and maintenance or other accounts for operations either in iraq or in afghanistan and then transferred back again the consolidated appr opriations act also provides authority again subject to congressional approval to tr ansfer up to 40 billion of the 70 billion in emergency defense funding in the bill between accounts 3 see below for further discu ssion and also see crs

afghanistan and othe r global war on terror operations since 911 by amy belasco other accounts or by slowing the pace of peacetime operations the defense department could also have extended operations by invoking the feed and forage act which allows funding for some purpos in advance of appropriations or by using other measures congressional approval of 70 billion bridge fund for military operations at least temporarily resolved the issue although the bill provided only about 37 of the total amount the administration had requested it included most of what the defense department had re quested for the full year in army and marine corp operation and maintenance and military personnel accounts defense officials now estimate that funding provided in the c onsolidated fy2008 appropriations act pl 110161 for army military pers onnel and operation and maintenance together with amounts provided in the regular fy2008 fense appropriations act pl 110116 will last until about the middle of june for personnel and until the end of june or early july for operation and maintenance the defense department could extend operations further either by slowing the pace of obligations or by using available authority to transfer funds from other accounts to the army up to 114 billion in transfer authority is available2 it could also invoke the feed and forage act or use other standing authorities to extend operations further3 review of congressional action on fy2008 supplemental appropriations through december 2007 administration request the administration sub mitted

long omnibus appropriations would extend army and marine corps operations7 congresss agreement to provide 70 billion for overseas military operations resolved at least for few months dispute over war funding that had led the defense department to announce plans to shut down army and marine corps operations early in 2008 in the absence of supplemental appropr iations the defense department warned that money for ar my operations would run out the end of february and for the marine corps in ma rch even after transfer of 41 billion to the army on november 15 2007 secretary of defense gates said that the defense department would have to cease operations at all army bases by midfebruary next year which would result in furl oughs of 100000 civilian and another 100000 contractor personnel8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34278crs7 70 billion bridge fund will allow the army to operate into june without additional funding the 70 billion for defense in the conso lidated appropriations act averted the need for shutdown until least june 2008 it provided 352 billion for army and 40 billion for marine corp operation nd maintenance accounts these amounts were in addition to 274 billion

the rate at which dod would use up the amount of regular and emergency appropriations it requested ie it is the total requested for the year divided by 12 months actual monthly obligations of funds may vary substantially from the average however particularly if the services defer funding in order to stretch funding further the defense department may be able to extend operations further either by transferring funds from other accounts to the army and marine corps or for the om accounts by slowing the pace of ar my and marine corps operations dod has available at least 114 billion of aut hority to transfer funds between accounts including 37 b illion in general transfer authority provided in the regular fy 2008 defense appropriations act 37 billion appropriated to the iraqi freedom fund and available for transfer to personnel om or other accounts for operations in iraq and afghanistan and 40 billion of authority to transfer funds provided as defense emergency appropriations provisions in the consolidated appropriations act additional amounts may be available in cash balances of dod working capital funds transfers could conceivably extend army operations for as much as another month

and transportation in the past it has been used to sustain overseas military operations in advance of appropriations see crs report rl34275 cited above for full discussionfinancial flexibility to respond to other une xpected needs the defense department could also extend operations by invoking the feed and forage act or by using other authority to allocate financing of support activities among the services9 the recurring debate over the im pact of delays in providing supplemental appropriations while congresss agreement to pr ovide 70 billion fy2008 bridge fund resolved the debate tempor arily it does not settle the unde rlying controversy recurring issue for congress has been how much flexibility the defense department has to delay if not to avoid entirely shutting down operations when congress does not provide fullyear defe nse appropriations in the absence of supplemental appropriations the defense partment may rely on funds in the regular defense appropriations acts to finance both day today peacetime activ ities and warrelated operations abroad in fy2008 crs calculate d that these funds would be exhausted by february for the army and by early ap ril for the marine corps which is about what the defense department projected dods proposed transfer of 41 billion to the army would have exte nd its operations for another two to three weeks10 without supplemental appropriations the defense department could have extended operations for about nother month by transferring limited add itional amounts to the army and marine corps and by slowing down spending the defense department might ve been able to sustain operations longer by invoking the feed and forage act11 or by us ing nove l unpr ecedented measures such as assigning the navy and air force to pay costs of army support operations abroad each of these alternatives might have extended operations for some time but each has limits and disadvantages as well use of additional sources of funding for transfers would reduce dods financial flex ibility steps to slow down obligations of funds might disrupt daytoday operati ons use of the feed and forage act to finance ongoing military operations has in the past led legislators to worry that it weakens congressional war powers and th extensive use of navy and air force funds to support army operations might er ode congressional controls on the use of funds the potentially disruptive effects of these measures must be weighed against the potentially disruptive effects of initia ting process to furlough personnel sooner than might otherwise be necessaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34278crs9 12 in all the consolidated appropriations act provided 2385 billion in emergency funding for international affairs programs includi ng 1262 billion for the

appropriations may not apply to all of the money congress may ultimately provide particularly for ongoing warrelated expenses while sconres 21 exempts emergency amounts from caps on spending it also

emergency17httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34278crs17 17 continued v not permanent temporary in nature 18 moreover an emergency designation by the president is longer required the president was in the past required to agree with congress to designate funds as emergency appropriations in order to avoid triggering an automatic cut in spending if outlays exceeded statutory limits but legisl ative caps on spending expired after fy2002instead the budget resolution permits limits on overall funding to be adjusted by up to 1242 billion for overseas deployments and related activities that designation rather than emergency appropriations may be invoked to pe rmit some of the requested spending to be c onsidered without raising point of order for exceeding budget limits in the senate18 supplemental appropriations for other programs supplemental appropriations bills frequently provide s ubstantially more money than the white house requests and bills sometimes become vehicles for significant

data why warrelated supplemental requests have grown19 the increases in funding for the war ca nnot be attributed to the pace of military operations though the number of troops deployed in iraq and afghanistan has fluctuated over time and there was sur ge of troops into iraq in 2007 overall troop levels have remained re latively stable instead the increases are due in large part to the growth of investments to repair or replace equipment lost or worn out in military operations and also to upgrade equipment across for ground forces as table 5 shows the largest increases in funding have been for weapons procurement which has grown from about 19 billion in fy2005 to requested 64 billion in the amended fy2008 request op eration and maintenance funding has grown also much of that to repair equi pment and there have been increases as well in funding to train and equip afgh an and iraqi military forces supplementals have also been used to finance costs of reorganizing the army into

terror february 2007 traditionally the term reconstitution has been used to refer to repairing and replacing equipment lost or worn out in combat in order to restore the force to approximately its prewar condition s ecretary of defense rumsfeld however preferred to use the term reset to describe what was needed to reset the force meant to return the force not to its pr ewar condition but to the condition that it would have been in had planned changes in the force been carried on in the absence of conflict the intent wa s not to add to funding requirements but to refine and perhaps reduce them secretary rumsfeld argued for example that there was not necessarily need to restore stocks of army prepositioned equipment to prewar levels because plans to reduce overseas deployments might reduce prepositioning requirements now the defense department has resu med using the term reconstitution but the concept appears to encompass much more than just restoring the force in particular it appears to encompass substantial upgrades to the force especially for the army and marine corps the upgra des include measures to fix preexisting shortfalls in some kinds of equipment to add
