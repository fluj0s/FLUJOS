the 105th congress in each of the groups listed above this report describes legislative action on these proposals during the 105th congress the quality and quantity issues the elemen tary and secondary education teaching force is large in 1995 there were an estimated 26 million public school teachers and 380000 private schoo l teachers2 teacher quality teacher quality may be defined by and measured by the level of education teacher has completed the teachers tested ability level or the teaching credential s he or she has earned among other characteristics in particular concern about the3 quality of current teachers has centered in part on the extent to which teachers are currently teaching outoffield that is providing instruction in subjects in whic h they have relatively little prepara tion and academic background one analysis which considered the extent to which secondary school students were being taught n academic subject by teachers who had neither c ollege major or college minor in that subject found for example that over quarter of all public secondary schoo l students enrolled in math classes and that over half of public school students i

it should be5 noted that this measure of quality outoffield teaching is partly reflection f teacher assignment practices there is growing recognition that the success of nearly any effort to improve the academic performance of us students depends critically upon their teachers mastery of subject matter knowledge and their ability to teach it as result 6 teachers capabilities in the classroom and their impact on student performance ar increasingly considered integral components of teacher quality further concer n about teacher qual ity takes on more urgency as states and local school districts raise curriculum content and student performance standards in different subject areas this changes expectations about what teac hers need to know and be able to do in the classroom factors that have been identified by different analysts and policymakers s contributing to the quality problem include the following the abilities of individuals entering teaching poor preservice education limited ineffective professiona l7 development compensation systems that do not reward good performance organization of schools that militates against effective teaching teacher

state tenu re laws that are viewed by many as unduly protecting poorly performing teachers8 teacher quantity concurrently there are warnings of potential shortage of teachers during the next decade precipitated by large projected increases in student enrollment and n anticipated surge in retir ements from an aging teaching force overall public school enrollment is expected to rise by over 4 between 1997 and 2007 an increase fueled primarily by projected gr owth at the secondary school level of about 13 further9 the average age of public school teachers has grown sharply and more teachers will be eligible to retire in 19931994 the average age was 43 nearly 3 full years higher than it was in 19871988 based on data such as these for public and privat e10 elementary and secondary education some projections have been made that during the next decade 2 million teachers will have to be hired to keep up with enrollment growth and higher teacher attrition rates11 crosscutting concerns teacher quality and quantity are inex tricably linked actions to address one have consequences for the other of particular concern are possible negative interactions for instance tightening licensure requirements in order to improve teacher qualit may make it difficult for districts to find enough teachers who meet the highe r standards when school districts struggle to meet their need for teachers they may circumvent quality standards by such steps as hiring teachers under emergenc certification procedures this interaction is particularly evident in efforts to reduce class sizehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98166crs5 class size is measure of the number of students in class often average class size s12 are calculated separately for teachers with selfcontained classes typically elementar school teachers who teach an array of subject to single class and for those i n departmentalized classes typ ically secondary school teachers who teach subject to several classes of students for the latter the average size of all of the classes taught by eac h individual teacher may be determined and then an average taken of those class size averages across all departmentalized teachers generally special emphasis teachers such as thos teaching the disabled or those teaching specific subjects at the elementary school level such as music or art are excluded from the calculation of class size since the number of students they work with at any one time is often unusually small eg special education teachers or unusually large eg physical education teachers class size is distinct from pupilteacher ratios those ratios are most frequently calculated by dividing the number of enrolle d students by the number of fulltime equivalent teachers fulltime teachers plus an estimate of the full time equivalent of parttime teachers regardless of the kinds of classes taugh t or whether teachers duties are noninstructional partly as result of including the ful l breadth of the teaching fo rce the pupilteacher ratio is almost always lower than the average class size for example the size of the class taught by the average public school teacher in 19931994 was 232 at the elementary school level and 237 at the secondary school level the pupilteacher ratio for the fall of 1993 was 189 and 151 at the public elementary and secondary levels respectively reportedly class size

size and as described below the administration included class size reduction program in its fy1999 budget request and the omnibus appropriation for fy199913 includes funding for such action thes efforts have been prompted partly by belief that reduced class size will improve student performance this specific issue i s addressed in latter section of these report the impa ct on the demand for teachers resulting from large scale reductions in class size may be substantial and may have direct consequences for teacher quality the experie nce to date with the class size reduction initiative in california i s informative in this regard as perhaps the most prominent effort to reduce class size currently underway the california class size reduction program created as result of 19961 997 budget legislation provides local school districts with funds to hel p them reduce class size in the early elementary grades to not more than 20 students from an average that was over 28 in all grades the

training on topics related to effective instruction in smaller classes14 in the initial year of the progra m some 18400 teachers were hired 115 more than the number that would have been needed to compensate for normal teache r attrition and enrollment growth according to several analyses of the initial year15 teacher quality may have suffered in the drive to satisfy the greater demand for new teachers approximately onefourth of the individuals hired did not have teaching credential as one analysis concluded desperation hiring has brought in ne w teachers who are less experienced less qualified and less skilled on average tha n those of previous years the teachers on emergency permits have bachelors degrees and passed the minimum competency test but most have teaching experience or preparation it remains to be seen what impact these characteristics will actually16 have on the quality of classroom practice and student performance current federal role supporting precollege

keys to their effectiveness these features include the amount of assistance provided and the buy out terms that is the condition s under which the beneficiary can avoid providing service with regard to loa n forgiveness it is possible that loan debt among college students has increase d sufficiently in recent years that the prospect of loan forgiveness will induc individuals to consider teaching who ot herwise would not and keep them in teaching at least as long as necessary to forgive their debt further in an effort to make these provisions more attractive the portio n of borrowers debt forgiven for each year of teaching might be set relatively high thereby requiring fewer years of teaching t cancel the debt in addition there may also be other steps that could be taken t increase the effectiveness of loan forgiveness for example information might b widely and systematically disseminated early in students college years concernin g the availability and conditions of the forgiveness

and policymakers to the following conclusions concerning class size reduction43 enrollme nt in the early grades in classes of 15 or fewer students may have positive impact on students academic achievement compared to enrollmen t in substantially larger classes minority students in particular may benefit from smaller classes and the benefits students experien ce from reduction in class size may persist into later grades albeit at somewhat reduced levels in keeping with these findings the funding including in pl 105277 and other proposals are targeted to the early grades but the degree of reduction in averag class size likely to be achieved may be less than the literature suggests may b necessary for substantive achievement gains44 costs of tea cher hiring nevertheless even assuming that national efforts to reduce class size do lead to some degree of improvement in student achievement it must be as ked whether the gains achieved are worth the cost of the effort that the costs of hiring new teachers can be high is suggested by the aggregate levels f funding in the presidents proposal 12 billion over 7year period and in hr 3157 75 billion ver 5year period that would be used to hire 100000 teachers number equal to 34 of the current teaching force the funds required to hire new teacher are only tion of the total costs that are and will be associated with that new teacher

substantially less money in the short term and in particular over the longterm slavin for example identifies oneon46 one tutoring by certified teachers for atrisk first and second graders peer tutoring and cooperative learning as among interv ention strategies that can raise performance by larger amounts at fraction of the cost effects on teacher quality the potential impact on teacher quality of major nationwide hiring of teachers is also significant concern to address this issue for example the funds provided by pl 105277 can be used to hire only certifie d teachers the experience in california suggests that finding enough teachers wh meet regular certification standards can be difficult task at the same time some would argue that certification as currently awarded offers substantial assurance of teacher quality permitting the hiring of teachers recruited to teaching throug h alternative routes would open the pote ntial pool of teachers but in the view of some analysts such provisions could threaten teacher quality as well47 the proposals described above would also seek to address the quality issue in some other ways annual performance review of the teachers testing of ne w teachers and performance assessments of current teachers with regard to testing current state efforts to test teachers as condition of the granting of certification also may not constitute much of gauge of teacher quality as asserted by the national commission on teaching and americas future the testing required for certification are little more than multiplechoice tests of basic skills and general knowledge widely criticized by educators and experts as woefully inadequate to measur teaching skills furthermore in many states the cutoff scores are so low there is effective standard for entry48httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98166crs24 concluding observations the 105 congress considered large number of proposals to address th eth quality of elementary and secondary school teachers and their overall quantity i t enacted new pro grams to reform teacher preparation and increase available funding for recruiting an d hiring new teachers fashioning federal response to these issues raised numerous questions concerning the appropriateness of such response given the traditional responsibility at the state and local levels for teacher preparation training and hiring further as was discussed earlier some activities particularl the hiring of significant number of new teachers have substantial federal cost s associated with them at the same time the effectiveness of these efforts to address either of these issues are weighed against their costs perhaps most significant is the interplay between quality and quantity as has been observed in this report actio n to address one issue may have consequences for the other and some of thos consequences may be negative
