study august 11 2006 christopher bolkcom shirley kan and amy f woolf foreign affairs defense and trade division congressional research service the library of congress us conventional forces and nuclear deterrence china case study summary congress and the department of defense dod are engaged in an extended discourse over the future direction of us defense strategy and military force structure in the past these discussions have focused almost exclusively on questions related to us conventional military forces with discussions about nuclear weapons held in separate fora however the 2005 quadrennial defense review qdr examined both nuclear and conventional forces first in the qdrs history this indicates that analysts both inside and outside government are beginning to review and assess the potential deterrent and operational relationship between conventional and nuclear weapons it appears that considerable pressure is building on dod leaders to make strategy and force structure decisions with costeffectiveness in mind key question for contemporary defense planners is what proportion of us military capabilities should be focused on traditional military challenges and what proportion should be focused on nontraditional challenges such as irregular disruptive and catastrophic threats to effectively analyze the desired size and characteristics of tomorrows military some argue that we must take hard look at feasible realworld contingencies possible conflict with china attracts considerable attention from defense planners because it is regional competitor today and could over time grow to be nearpeer competitor analysts can also easily identify flashpoints where the two nations might meet and feel compelled to defend national interests the analysis that follows seeks to explore the possible role that us nuclear and conventional forces might play in four stages of potential conflicts deterrence prior to the start of the conflict crisis stability in the early stages of the conflict warfighting during the height of the conflict and war termination through either negotiated settlement or battlefield victory this report highlights number of policy issues that may bear consideration in the ongoing debate regarding military investments for example this report suggests that nuclear and conventional military capabilities can simultaneously have positive effects on deterrence or warfighting and negative effects on crisis stability or war termination objectives therefore changes in military force structure or capabilities to improve deterrence for example should consider potential effects on crisis stability for example further investments in military capabilities that may positively contribute to all potential stages of military conflict eg deterrence crisis stability warfighting and war termination might be preferred to investments that have mixed effect on the potential range of conflict this report will not be updated

study introduction congress and the department of defense dod are engaged in an extended discourse over the future direction of us defense strategy and military force structure1 in the past these discussions have focused almost exclusively on questions related to us conventional military forces with discussions about nuclear weapons held in separate fora however the 2005 quadrennial defense review qdr examined both nuclear and conventional forces first in the qdrs history2 as result this indicates that analysts both inside and outside government are beginning to review and assess the relationship between conventional and nuclear weapons the purpose of this report is to support this assessment using possible conflict with china as framework or case study dods attention to possible military conflict with china appears to have increased since the end of the cold war such potential conflict presents the challenge of very complicated politicaleconomicsocial relationship among the participants it also presents the noteworthy military challenges of defending distant ally or friendly country from proximate adversary possessing large conventional forces and nuclear weapons capable of reaching the continental united states many in dod appear to consider military conflict with china to be pacing threat the military capabilities required to successfully cope with this scenario are likely to be adequate to cope with other and presumably less challenging stateon state conflicts practical decisions regarding how the united states might most effectively equip its forces and develop strategies for their use to contend with possible military conflicts with china raise obvious issues concerning the structure of us conventional forces and the role of nuclear deterrence 1 examples of this extended discourse include the qdr process the house armed services committees congressional defense review dods annual report on china implementation of variety of measures designed to transform the military services the base realignment and closure brac and overseas basing and realignment processes and annual congressional oversight of dods budget 2 quadrennial defense review report us department of defense february 6 2006 p 4951 crs2 interplay between conventional and nuclear forces during the cold war assessments of the interplay between nuclear and conventional forces were most relevant and most often debated in scenarios that pitted the united states and its nato allies against the soviet union and its warsaw pact allies defense planners recognized and calculated the effect perceived balance or imbalance of conventional and nuclear forces might have on deterrence crisis stability and the outcome of potential conflicts in europe specifically the united states sought to extend deterrence and protect its nato allies with both conventional and nuclear forces for much of the cold war natos conventional forces were perceived to be weaker than those of the warsaw pact and were allowed to stay that way in part because nuclear weapons were seen as less costly alternative to large conventional force structure many analysts argued that under these circumstances the united states and nato could deter soviet and warsaw pact attack by threatening to escalate the conflict to nuclear use others however questioned whether such threats were credible in light of the fact that the soviet union could have responded with nuclear attacks of its own as result analysts often argued the pros and cons of increasing natos conventional force capabilities and the potential this might have for enhancing deterrence and raising the nuclear threshold3 dods 2002 nuclear posture review npr constructed new triad consisting of offensive strike weapons missile defense and the nuclear weapons infrastructure to describe the capabilities that are part of the us nuclear posture the old nuclear triad consisted of landbased icbms sealaunched ballistic missiles slbms and nucleararmed longrange bombers thus the new triad appears to be much broader construct one noteworthy aspect of the new triads offensive strike component is the planned interplay between nuclear and conventional weapons dod seeks to integrate nuclear and conventional capabilities in some military plans and applications where hitherto only nuclear weapons were thought to play role administration officials suggest that this integration may reduce potential us reliance on nuclear weapons studies and analyses subsequent to the npr have sought to consider whether the addition of conventional weapons to us nuclear plans might alter the role of nuclear weapons few appear to have asked however whether the integration implied in the new triad might alter the role or requirements for us conventional weapons further very few if any of these considerations appear to have informed the debate over budget and procurement of conventional weapons 3 generally speaking european nato members resisted improvements to conventional force capabilities in part based on the argument that it would raise the nuclear threshold and make conventional war appear more winnable to the warsaw pact the united states in general favored increasing nato conventional military capabilities because if the nuclear threshold were breeched both us and natonation cities would likely be attacked as consequence crs3 some dod leaders say that todays conventional and nuclear forces are well suited to deter stateonstate conflict and that the primary challenges are deterring nonstate actors4 this may be true however dod currently faces much more complicated stateonstate security environment than it did during the cold war when possible war with the soviet union dominated planning and procurement activities many potential military challenges exist eg north korea or could emerge eg iran or revanchist russia but possible conflict with china is often mentioned as the military scenario of great concern to military planners politicomilitary uncertainty conducting review of military strategy and force structure today is likely to be dominated by two overarching themes the first theme is uncertainty relative to the past contemporary defense planners must now consider broad and diverse menu of national security challenges when examining the relationship between conventional forces and nuclear deterrence and assessing the most effective mix of forces during the cold war the threats confronting the united states were reasonably well understood and comparatively predictable if the united states had the military capabilities to deter or defeat its most stressing threat eg the soviet union then these military capabilities were deemed adequate to address lesser included cases such as nation states with more modest military capabilities or even nonstate actors such as insurgents and terrorists the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 graphically illustrated that todays nonstate actors can exploit relatively inexpensive and commercially available technology to conduct very destructive attacks over great distances few observers today consider nontraditional threats to be lesser included cases increasingly it is recognized that in many cases combating nonstate threats presents different and in many cases greater set of challenges than combating conventional military foe key question for contemporary defense planners is what proportion of us military capabilities should be focused on traditional military challenges and what proportion should be focused on nontraditional challenges such as irregular disruptive and catastrophic threats5 preparing for nontraditional threats will likely call for much different investment pattern than strategy that seeks to further 4 jason sherman qdr will advance tailored deterrence for wideranging threats inside the navy december 19 2005 5 this nomenclature is found in the national defense strategy of the united states of america march 2005 us department of defense examples of irregular threats include terrorism insurgency and civil war examples of these threats can be found in framework for strategic thinking building toplevel capabilities briefing to senior level review group august 19 2004 us department of defense irregular threats include terrorism insurgency and civil war disruptive threats include bio or cyber warfare catastrophic threats include missile attacks on the united states enemy employment of weapons of mass destruction crs4 leverage our superiority over any potential peer competitor6 how should risk be apportioned across this investment spectrum budgetary constraints on force structure the second theme affecting any current strategy and forces review is that of resource constraints owing to growing concerns about controlling the overall size of the federal budget it appears that pressure is building on dod leaders to make strategy and force structure decisions with costeffectiveness in mind for example the cost of the ongoing operations in iraq and afghanistan could have much higher price tag than the 357 billion allocated to date7 some economists estimate that the final cost to us taxpayers could be 2 trillion8 in the past most of the funds for iraq and afghanistan have been provided through supplemental appropriations the office of management and budget omb however reportedly will resist any future large supplemental appropriations which may increase turbulence within dods annual spending plans9 further in june 2006 the senate passed an amendment of the fy2007 defense authorization bill that could restrict the use of emergency supplemental war funding10 longterm dod spending plans are already experiencing intense pressure the congressional budget office cbo estimates that dods spending plans are underfunded by 50150 billion annually during the years covered by the qdr11 such projected shortfalls lead some observers to believe that dod will increasingly be forced to make hard decisions about force structure such as having to choose between purchasing new equipment and maintaining old equipment another choice may have to be made between purchasing new equipment and maintaining personnel end strength12 failure to adequately consider the possible interaction between nuclear weapons and nuclear strategy on the one hand and the size and capabilities of conventional weapons on the other and failure to plan for and budget against the potential interaction between them could result in the acquisition of functionally redundant 6 dov s

need to address complex and broad range of possible threats combined with more expeditionary orientation for us forces and intense projected budgetary shortfalls make cost effective decisions on force structure and strategy unusually important nuclear weapons strategy and doctrine understanding how nuclear weapons and deterrence might combine with us conventional forces in possible conflict with china requires some understanding of both us and chinese nuclear strategy and doctrine forces and strategy are not static but evolve over time thus general discussion of the subject may be useful united states the us nuclear strategy and doctrine has evolved over 50 years it can be roughly divided into three distinct eras cold war postcold war and present or 21st century strategy cold war deterrence during the cold war the soviet union was the primary country to be deterred by us military forces the united states sought to develop policy and nuclear forces that it believed were needed to convince the soviet union that any nuclear attack on the united states would be met with retaliatory attack against the full range of valued targets in the soviet union other countries such as china and the countries of eastern europe were covered by us nuclear war plans but their presence reflected their relationship with the soviet union more than any independent threat they might pose to the united states or its allies the united states also expected its nuclear weapons to deter soviet nuclear attack conventional attack or coercion aimed at us allies in europe and asia13 many believed the united states needed to threaten nuclear retaliation to deter these threats because the soviet union and its warsaw pact allies had far greater numbers of conventional forces than did the united states and its nato allies according to this view if war was fought with only conventional weapons us and nato forces could be overrun therefore the united states fielded variety of strategic theater and tactical nuclear weapons that might be used to repel and defeat such an attack this doctrine came to be known as extended deterrence the theory underlying this doctrine was that if any level of aggression against us allies could escalate into nuclear conflict that might involve attacks on the soviet union then the soviet union might be deterred from all levels of aggression this theory was not without critics however as some analysts questioned whether the soviet union would 13 national security strategy of the united states the white house january 1988 washington p 13 crs6 believe that the united states would use nuclear weapons to defend its allies particularly if such use might invite soviet nuclear attack on the united states strategic doctrine and targeting during the 1950s the strategic doctrine known as massive retaliation envisioned simultaneous massive integrated us nuclear strike against targets in the soviet union eastern europe and china if the soviet union or its allies initiated any nuclear or conventional attack against the united states or its allies14 in the early 1960s the united states developed doctrine of damage limitation which called for attacks against soviet conventional and nuclear military forces this counterforce strategy explicitly excluded attacks designed to destroy cities and focused instead on attacks that would impede the soviet unions warfighting capability15 in particular it sought to destroy those weapons that the soviet union might use to attack us cities in the mid1960s dod developed the doctrine of assured destruction strategy that was designed to convince the soviet leadership that soviet society would be destroyed if the soviet union launched an attack on the united states or its allies but by the early 1970s many again questioned the credibility of doctrine that called for massive strikes against soviet society particularly if the soviet union could threaten to strike back against us cities therefore the united states shifted its doctrine once again to flexible response in the mid1970s and countervailing strategy in the late 1970s these policies emphasized retaliatory strikes on soviet military forces and warmaking capabilities as opposed to attacks on civilian and industrial targets and they called for limited focused attacks on specified military targets instead of largescale attacks on greater number of sites16 postcold war deterrence in its 1995 national security strategy report the clinton administration stated that the dissolution of the soviet empire has radically transformed the security environment facing the united states and our allies the primary security imperative of the past half century containing communist expansion while preventing nuclear war is gone17 the administration did 14 there was calculated strategy for war winning or termination beyond that of producing as much destruction as possible in single devastating blow see rosenberg david us nuclear

types of targets the united states sought to destroy remained relatively constant throughout the cold war these included strategic nuclear forces other military forces military and political leadership and economic and industrial facilities for description of the types of targets included in us nuclear war plans see us congressional budget office the start treaty and beyond october 1991 washington us govt print off 1991 pp 1112 17 national security strategy of engagement and enlargement the white house continued crs7 however determine that russia remained concern for us national security because it continued to control the only nuclear arsenal that could threaten the survival of the united states the clinton administration also argued that nuclear weapons served as hedge against an uncertain future guarantee of our security commitments to allies and disincentive to those who would contemplate developing or otherwise acquiring their own nuclear weapons18 the clinton administration did not consider china to pose direct threat to the united states as regional or global adversary nevertheless dod officials testified that chinas small nuclear force is still formidable and china continues to make steady efforts to modernize those forces assistant secretary of defense ted warner stated that the united states could not be sure that it would not need nuclear weapons to deter china in the future19 the clinton administration also identified other threats to us national security specifically noting in its national security strategy report for 1998 that weapons of mass destruction pose the greatest potential threat to global stability and security20 strategic doctrine and targeting although the clinton administration maintained the us focus on deterring potential russian threat it did issue new guidelines for us nuclear strategy in late 1997 in document known as pdd60 the administration stated that our military planning for the possible employment of nuclear weapons is focused on deterring nuclear war rather than attempting to fight and win protracted nuclear exchange21 in practice this probably meant that the united states would not seek to cause as much damage against as wide range of targets as it had planned on attacking in previous war plans but clinton administration officials also noted that this did not alter the structure of us nuclear war plans or the variety of options available to the president for us retaliatory strike many press reports about pdd60 highlighted the provisions covering the use of us nuclear weapons to deter nations other than russia and viewed this as an expansion of the role of us nuclear weapons however the united states has never maintained first use policy and has always retained the option to use nuclear weapons in response to attacks by conventional chemical or biological weapons these policies did not change in the 1990s 17 continued february 1995 washington dc p 1 18 national

before the senate armed services subcommittee on strategic forces april 14 1999 20 national security strategy for new century op cit p 6 21 ibid p 12 crs8 present environment deterrence the george w bush administration has emphasized that nuclear weapons continue to be essential to our security and that of our friends and allies22 as the only weapons in the us arsenal that can hold at risk the full range of targets valued by an adversary they continue to play key role in us deterrent strategy however in contrast with the clinton administrations focus on potential russian threat the bush administration has stated that russia and the united states are longer enemies even though russia retains thousands of nuclear weapons the increased cooperation between the two nations has allowed new strategic framework to replace the cold wars adversarial relationship the bush administration has emphasized however that the united states faces threats from multiple potential opponents sources of conflict and unprecedented challenges23 and that these challenges must be taken into consideration when the united states plans its nuclear weapons policy and force posture according to the administration these adversaries could include nonstate actors and terrorists as well as nations such as china24 iran north korea and others in the past us policy essentially viewed nuclear weapons apart from the rest of the us military establishment with nuclear weapons serving to deter global nuclear conflict with the soviet union or russia in contrast the bush administration has described more comprehensive role for nuclear weapons arguing that nuclear weapons along with missile defenses and other elements of the us military establishment not only deter adversaries by promising an unacceptable amount of damage in response to an adversarys attack they can also assure allies and friends of the us commitment to their security by providing an extended deterrent dissuade potential adversaries from challenging the united states with nuclear weapons or other asymmetrical threats by convincing them that they can never negate the us nuclear deterrent and defeat enemies by holding at risk those targets that could not be destroyed with other types of weapons25 doctrine and targeting in describing the future role of nuclear weapons the bush administration has stated that the united states will not only rely on the threat of nuclear retaliation but will also seek to deter and defeat adversaries with precision conventional weapons which are hoped to be capable of destroying some targets that were assigned to nuclear weapons in the past and ballistic missile defenses which might deter attack by denying an adversary the ability to threaten 22 us senate committee on armed services statement of the honorable douglas j feith undersecretary of defense for policy february 14 2002 23 us department of defense special briefing on the nuclear posture review news transcript january 9 2002 24 condoleeza rice promoting the national interest foreign affairs januaryfebruary 2000 v 79 p 56 25 special briefing on the nuclear posture review op cit these are the same four general defense policy goals outlined in the 2001 qdr crs9 us targets with ballistic missiles26 the administration refers to this change as tailored deterrence with the united states developing more specific responses that would rely on broader range of military capabilities to respond to the threats posed by emerging adversaries moreover the bush administration has stated that the united states will longer size and structure its nuclear forces to address the soviet threat27 instead it will employ capabilitiesbased strategy where it would look more at broad range of capabilities and contingencies that the united states may confront and tailor us military capabilities to address this wide spectrum of possible contingencies28 specifically the united states would identify potential future conflicts review the capabilities of its possible adversaries identify those capabilities that the united states might need to attack or threaten with nuclear weapons and develop force posture and nuclear weapons employment strategy that would allow it to attack those capabilities the bush administration has not discussed publicly how it will identify specific targets or allocate weapons in its capabilitiesbased strategy the most specific and visible change to emerge from this new targeting strategy has been the replacement of the cold war siop single integrated operational plan with new war plan known as oplan operations plan 8044 this document contains the major strike options and major contingency plans that had been included in the siop but could also include plans for wider range of options against greater number of adversaries some press reports indicate that the administration has also developed companion contingency plan conplan 802222 which plans for the prompt us response to number of contingencies with nations other than russia reports indicate that most of the options in this new plan call for the use of conventional weapons but some also allow for the use of nuclear weapons early or at the start of conflict29 as result it is evident that the bush administration has not altered the us policy that permits the possible first use of nuclear weapons further the administration has stated that the united states would develop and deploy those nuclear capabilities that it would need to defeat the capabilities of any potential adversary whether or not it possessed nuclear weapons the focus will be on how we will fight not who we will fight30 26 ibid 27 statement of the honorable douglas j feith op cit 28 ibid dod is also using capabilities based

start treaty limits china chinas nuclear force structure and public statements about nuclear policy are consistent with nuclear strategy known as minimum deterrence under this strategy nation seeks to deter nuclear attacks against its territory by threatening to respond with its own nuclear weapons if such an attack were to occur to be certain that it can retaliate after nuclear attack nation with minimum deterrent would need forces that could survive direct assault by another nations nuclear weapons this strategy of threatening retaliation against major population centers with even small number of nuclear weapons is assumed to be sufficient to deter nuclear attack however us estimates of the prcs evolving nuclear forces have been uncertain including both overestimates of the speed of deployment of new missiles as well as concern over chinas ability to surprise with undetected military modernization31 in their frequent reevaluations of the chinese peoples liberation armys pla capabilities us experts have questioned whether the pla has shifted or considered shifting its nuclear doctrine to one of limited deterrence32 the two countries lack dialogue over their respective strategic nuclear forces and doctrine as well as confidencebuilding measures33 31 jeffrey lewis the ambiguous arsenal bulletin of atomic scientists mayjune 2005 robert norris and hans kristensen

deterrence is treated in detail on p 12 of this report 33 there were some discussions on nuclear weapons during the clinton administration after secretary of defense donald rumsfeld visited the headquarters of chinas strategic missile force the second artillery in october 2005 the two militaries started to explore strategic dialogue see crs report rl32496 uschina military contacts issues for congress by shirley kan crs11 nuclear forces china has deployed relatively small number of nuclear warheads on operational delivery systems the department of defense reports that china has deployed approximately 20 silobased liquidfuel css4 intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms for its primary nuclear deterrent and about 2024 liquid fuel shorterrange css3 icbms for its regional nuclear deterrent china also deployed 1418 css2 intermediaterange ballistic missiles and 1950 css5 mediumrange ballistic missiles34 the pla also has 1014 jl1 submarinelaunched ballistic missiles slbms but the operational status of the single xiaclass ballistic missile submarine has been questionable china is developing new rail or road mobile df31 and df31a icbms and jl2 slbms 12 on each new type 094 ballistic missile submarine for greater survivability35 as for the evolution of the nuclear force the director of central intelligence estimated in 2002 that the prcs strategic nuclear force could grow by 2015 to about 75 to 100 warheads deployed primarily against the united states36 still us government estimates have changed and china could deploy significant new capabilities such as multiple warheads also some experts have charged us intelligence with overestimating dramatic improvements as the modernization of chinas missile force has been slower than predicted for about 15 years37 china employs variety of basing modes such as hardened silos and mobile launchers along with concealment and deception techniques to ensure that its missiles can survive first strike these basing modes can add hours or days to the amount of time that china would need to prepare its missiles for launch this long launch time could seriously hamper any effort by china to use these missiles in first strike against the united states because the united states would be able to detect launch preparations and possibly preempt the attack however these basing modes could ensure the survivability of chinas missiles in the event of us attack and help to guarantee that china would be able to launch retaliatory strike the prc has expressed strong opposition to us plans to deploy ballistic missile defenses us national and theater missile defenses even with limited numbers of interceptor missiles and limited capabilities could possibly undermine the credibility of chinas deterrent by denying its missiles the ability to reach us 34 the pla has more missiles than launchers for the css3 and css2 ballistic missiles these launchers can be reloaded to launch additional missiles but such preparations may take several hours 35 secretary of defense the military power of the peoples republic of china may 23 2006 also the office of naval intelligence depicted in worldwide maritime challenges 2004 12

power may 2006 china is believed to have deployed single nuclear warheads on its missiles note china also fields ballistic missiles of regional range nuclear strategy china has declared first use policy stating that it would not use nuclear weapons first against any nation and that it would never threaten to or actually use nuclear weapons against nonnuclear nations39 china has not however ruled out the use of nuclear weapons in retaliation for nuclear attack this is the essence of minimum deterrent strategy some observers note that declaratory policy is poor measure of nuclear strategy because policy statements need not be consistent with actual military plans or warfighting others however believe that china is sincere in this policy of firstuse because its nuclear forces lack commonly recognized first strike capabilities because of their propellant type and current deployment patterns china cannot launch its missiles promptly upon warning of an attack or early in crisis and add that the missiles lack the accuracy to destroy an enemys retaliatory forces which could be key objective of nuclear force strike the plas strategic nuclear modernization however combined with the occasional statements by some prc officials about chinas ability to strike the united states have led some to question whether china will change its minimum nuclear deterrent some have questioned whether china might pursue more proactive limited deterrence strategy with its nuclear weapons40 this strategy presumes that nuclear weapons can deter both nuclear and conventional conflicts and that if deterrence fails nation could use nuclear weapons to control escalation and compel the enemy 38 conceivably china could respond to us attack by striking us forces in japan in this context regional missile defenses could reduce the deterrent value of chinese theater nuclear forces 39 the prc does not consider taiwan country 40 alastair iain johnston chinas new old thinking international security winter 19951996 crs13 to back down with this strategy china might not wait for an adversary to use nuclear weapons before it employed its own nuclear forces it could respond to conventional attacks with nuclear weapons or it could threaten nuclear attack to compel an adversary to cease hostilities or other actions short of war that it perceived as threatening to its interests many analysts believe that such strategy would be more useful to china if it sought to deter us intervention in crisis with taiwan particularly if it feared that the united states could achieve its objectives with advanced conventional weapons and without resorting to nuclear attacks such strategy also would address some of chinas concerns about us missile defenses because chinese first strike might contain more warheads than retaliatory strike and therefore might be more capable of penetrating us missile defenses however limited deterrence strategy would place added demands on chinas nuclear forces they would need to do more than simply survive and retaliate against cities or widearea targets after an attack china would need variety of delivery vehicles and warheads types along with relatively high accuracies on its weapons so that it could credibly threaten to attack the full range of targets from forces in the field to military facilities and urban areas it would also need to develop relatively complex warfighting strategies and would need advanced command and control capabilities so that it could direct its attacks and monitor their effects china might seek to develop these capabilities in the longer term but dod reports evidence that chinas first use doctrine has actually changed41 chinas nuclear force capabilities and nuclear doctrine have been monitored closely many observers were concerned for example when in july 2005 pla major general zhu chenghu told western journalists in beijing that if the americans draw their missiles and positionguided ammunition into the target zone on chinas territory i think we will have to respond with nuclear weapons zhu also dismissed chinas declared first use policy saying that the policy applied only to nonnuclear states and could be changed42 some argued that gen zhus comments were reaction to chinas concerns about the growing challenges presented by us defense policy and nuclear strategy43 others downplayed zhus remarks saying they reflected his personal opinion for example the commander of the plas nuclear forces assured defense secretary rumsfeld that china would not be the first to use nuclear weapons44 41

relations among the united states and the primary actors in east asia will strongly affect the options considered and pursued to deter or defeat any aggression in the region us policymakers face the challenge of balancing us relations with the prc taiwan and japan in particular uschina relations measuring the deterrent value of us military forces visavis china is difficult unlike the ussoviet relationship during the cold war the uschina relationship is marked not only by competition and tension but also by cooperation and interdependence the potential economic and political fallout from military conflict between china and the united states would be significant china is the thirdlargest us trading partner45 china is permanent member with veto power at the united nations security council and has played an important role on policy priorities of the united states including nuclear nonproliferation in north korea and iran46 would china jeopardize this economic partnership and potentially economic relations with other countries by initiating military operations against taiwan or japan similarly would the united states jeopardize its economic and political interests in cooperative china by going to war against china some longterm ambivalence is apparent in the bush administrations policy in september 2005 deputy secretary of state robert zoellick called on china to be responsible stakeholder in his search for deeper framework for the bilateral relationship47 president bush issued his latest national security strategy on march 16 2006 declaring that if china keeps its commitment to peaceful development the united states will welcome the emergence of china that is peaceful and prosperous and that cooperates with us to address common challenges and mutual interests the new strategy also criticized chinas continuing military expansion in nontransparent way it explicitly declared hedging strategy against china which was first indirectly noted in the quadrennial defense review qdr issued on february 6 2006 in that qdr the administration argued that it had balanced approach in seeking cooperation but also hedged against the possibility that cooperative approaches might fail to preclude future conflict at the same time the qdr states that the us goal is for china to continue as an economic partner and emerge as responsible stakeholder and force for good in the world some have concerns that mutual hedging between washington and beijing is counterproductive 45 see crs report rl33536 chinaus trade issues by wayne morrison 46 see crs

with the united states and field disruptive military technologies that could over time offset traditional us military advantages absent us counter strategies the department of defense estimates that the pla has accelerated its modernization since the mid1990s with determined focus on possible conflict with taiwan and intervening us forces the defense secretarys 2006 report to congress on prc military power notes that china is pursuing longterm comprehensive military modernization to improve its capabilities for power projection and access denial49 specific pla investments include an expanding force of ballistic missiles cruise missiles submarines advanced aircraft and other modern systems because of chinas status as nuclear weapon state the united states has concerns that any intervention in the taiwan strait has the potential of beijing andor washington escalating conflict into nuclear war both sides have made implicit and explicit warnings over the years even military matters between the united states and china are not always clearly adversarial during senate armed services committee hearing for example senator carl levin asked admiral william fallon commander of the pacific command is it foregone conclusion that china and the united states are going to be at odds over security in the pacific or even globally admiral fallon responded and emphasized the countries common interests as well as his push to increase militarytomilitary contacts between the united states and china50 us policy toward taiwan the taiwan relations act tra pl 968 has governed us security assistance to taiwan since 1979 when the united states recognized the peoples republic of china prc instead of the republic of china roc51 the roc is commonly called taiwan the tra is not formal commitment to taiwans defense and therefore the united states is not legally compelled to extend deterrence to or otherwise defend taiwan the tra specifies that it is us policy to consider any nonpeaceful means of determining taiwans future to be threat to the peace and security of the western pacific and of grave concern to the united states to provide taiwan with arms of defensive

that both the president and the congress shall determine the nature and quantity of such defense articles and services based solely upon their judgment of the needs of taiwan section 3b also says that such determination of taiwans defense needs shall include review by united states military authorities in connection with recommendations to the president and the congress in passing the tra congress did not specify what us response might be to future situation in the taiwan strait us policy statements have added more nuanced qualifications regarding taiwans defense some argue that us policy regarding taiwan is vague although successive us presidents contend their policies are clear in march 1996 president clinton deployed two aircraft battle groups to waters off taiwan in response to chinese ballistic missile tests in april 2001 president bush said that he would do whatever it took to help taiwan defend herself if china attacked supporters have viewed such clarity as needed to prevent miscalculations in beijing and deter attacks against taiwan however critics have argued that bush encouraged provocations from taiwan and weakened willingness in taiwan to strengthen its own defense at hearing in april 2004 assistant secretary of state james kelly sought to clarify us policy saying that the united states intends to fulfill the defense responsibilities under the tra to the extent necessary we oppose actions that would unilaterally alter taiwans status leaders in taiwan misunderstood if they believe that president bush supports whatever they do and decisions of war and peace are made by the president with consultation with congress us defense relationship with japan there has also been rising concern about sinojapanese tensions52 despite its contributions to regional stability for decades the usjapan alliance is viewed by china with increasing skepticism about whether its continuation benefits chinas interests the historic hostility between chinese and japanese peoples rising military capabilities territorial disputes and emotional nationalism make sino japanese tensions have dangerous potential for conflict that could involve us armed forces in contrast to the ustaiwan relationship japan and the united states are military allies under security treaty concluded in 1951 and revised in 1960 under the treaty japan grants the united states military base rights on its territory in return for us legal commitment to protect japans security japan has also cooperated 52 crs report rl33436 japanus relations issues for congress by emma

endowment policy brief november 2005 crs17 with the united states in development of weapon systems including missile defense systems53 in general japans usdrafted constitution remains major obstacle to closer usjapan defense cooperation because of prevailing constitutional interpretation of article 9 that forbids engaging in collective defensearticle 9 outlaws war as sovereign right of japan and prohibits the right of belligerency it provides that land sea and air forces as well as other war potential will never be maintained in february 2005 secretaries rice and rumsfeld along with their japanese counterparts outlined more global and integrated vision of their mutual interests specifically mentioning the peaceful resolution of issues related to the korean peninsula and the taiwan strait as common strategic objectives japanese defense officials continue to stress however that the japanese military will not be involved in combat missions but instead limit its contributions to logistical support for counterterrorism operations or to humanitarian and reconstruction efforts illustrative scenarios requirements for military force structure and capabilities are often expressed in terms of the number and type of conflicts that can be addressed by that force for example dods 1993 bottom up review found that the united states must field forces sufficient to fight and win two nearly simultaneous major regional conflicts54 subsequent reviews recommended different formulas such as the 1421 formula us forces should be able to defend the us homeland operate in four key forward regions engage in two nearly simultaneous regional contingencies and swiftly prevail in one of those conflicts55 debate rages over such formulas because they are euphemisms for breadandbutter issues such as larger or smaller fighter aircraft forces bigger or smaller army and whether to spend more money on space systems or on ground equipment56 in the 2005 national defense strategy of the united states of america dod describes how it has adopted new approach for planning to implement our strategy dods capabilitiesbased planning is intended to focus more on how adversaries may challenge us than on whom those adversaries might be some find capabilitiesbased planning to be artificial or misleading in the end analysis always returns to the question of which countries or nonstate actors we may need to fight to effectively analyze the desired size and characteristics of tomorrows 53 for more information see crs report rl33436 japanus relations issues for congress by emma chanlettavery mark manyin and william h cooper 54 the bottomup review forces for new era september 1 1993 us department of defense can be found at httpthomaslocgovlsxlsx9314234docpdf 55 none of these strategy reviews considered the role of nuclear deterrence and nuclear weapons or factored in the impact of nuclear weapons into these capability formulas 56 barry blechman us defense planning its not that complicated defense news september 5 2005 crs18 military some argue that we must take hard look at feasible realworld contingencies57 examining feasible contingencies or scenarios can be useful in determining the preferred size and characteristics of us military forces in various contexts do some scenarios place greater emphasis on air and naval forces do others require greater commitment of ground forces perhaps more important how relevant are nuclear weapons in particular scenarios and how exactly might they influence the conflict or crisis for example some observers contend that the availability of nuclear weapons can help deescalate conflict by reminding all the parties of the risks of escalation others argue that nations ability to strike critical targets at the start of conflict can place pressure on the other nation to preempt such potential attack escalating the crisis and possibly complicating efforts to end it short of allout war dods 2006 report to congress on chinas military capabilities notes that chinas current options to prevent taiwan from claiming formal independence include persuasion and coercion if china were to resort to overt military force the dod report outlines four possible courses of actionthe pla would be likely to take missile strikes and information operations an air and missile campaign naval blockade and an amphibious invasion dods scenarios are not exhaustive however as additional sources of conflict could emerge between the united states and china for example taiwan in expectation of chinese attack could take the initial overt military action in the conflict further possible conflicts between china and japan might unfold and draw in the united states illustrative scenarios that capture these additional dynamics are addressed below examining these scenarios can contribute to an understanding of us force requirements and the potential dynamics of the conflict this assessment focuses on the possible interaction between conventional and nuclear forces rather than on the specific order of battle and force levels the united states might need in each particular scenario scenario sof infiltration of taiwan china attempts to insert military special operations forces sof into taiwan the total number of troops involved could be somewhere between 100 and 1000 the method of attempted infiltration is small boats submarines and helicopters sof forces cooperate with covert prc intelligence operatives already in taiwan to conduct disruptive attacks on taiwans political economic communications and military centers of gravity specific targets could include political and military leaders power generation and transportation infrastructure early warning radars and command and control facilities the purpose of these actions could be to foment fear and unrest in the taiwanese population in an attempt to undermine taiwans government another potential purpose of this infiltration may be to facilitate 57 ibid crs19 followon combined arms attack by the pla this attack could be preceded or accompanied by cyberwarfare or an information operations campaign against taiwans political and military organizations scenario b maritime conflict between china and japan chinas peoples liberation army navy plan deploys destroyer two submarines and other ships to support chinese oildrilling operations near islands in the east china sea that are claimed by china but controlled by japan called senkaku by japan diaoyu by china japan deploys p3 maritime patrol aircraft two aegis destroyers and f15 fighters to monitor plan activities nighttime collision between chinese submarine and japanese destroyer results in damage to both vessels and numerous casualties japanese forces attempt to assist the severely damaged submarine and chinese destroyer interprets the action as hostile it fires two antiship missiles which are intercepted by the aegis destroyers defenses naval forces in the area separate and further shots are fired the chinese submarine sinks with additional casualties both japan and china prepare to dispatch additional forces to the region japans ambassador to the united states requests personal meeting with the president to discuss the us japanese mutual security treaty scenario c fullscale combined arms attack on taiwan this scenario is the military conflict that is most often discussed in defense circles and may represent the worst case for both taiwan and the united states in this scenario china would employ air land and naval forces in an attempt to invade taiwan defeat the taiwanese military and impose military control over the island one of chinas military objectives would likely be to prosecute successful attack as quickly as possible to reduce the ability of the united states or potentially other allies from intervening in the conflict scenario d preemptive attack by taiwan on prc military forces fearing that pla plaaf plan exercise is actually defacto mobilization and the prelude to an imminent attack on taiwan taipei launches an attack on chinese forces and infrastructure across the taiwan strait specific military actions by taiwan include air and missile attacks on chinese ports airfields ballistic missile sites and ground forces in southern china taiwans navy conducts attacks on plan ships operating in chinese territorial waters taiwanese sof forces are reported to severely damage plan submarine believed to carry long range ballistic missiles crs20 analysis the analysis that follows seeks to study the role that us nuclear and conventional forces might play in four stages of each potential conflict deterrence prior to the start of the conflict crisis stability in the early stages of the conflict warfighting during the height of the conflict and war termination objectives and potential challenges or shortcomings are identified deterrence deterrence is based on threat or promise to be effective this threat or promise must appear credible to the actor to whom it is directed studies of deterrent theory suggest that credibility is something of nationallevel mind game perception of intent and capability is more important to deterrence than actual intent and capability in some instances clear indication of military capabilities and intentions has more deterrent value than an ambiguous indication of capabilities and intentions in other instances reverse is true finally cultural societal linguistic historical and other qualitative differences between countries play role in what might deter conflict and what does not given these uncertainties it appears that us deterrence objectives in these illustrative scenarios may be to field nuclear and conventional forces 1 that are more capable than the chinese forces 2 that are postured in way that makes their use appear credible and 3 cast doubt on whether china would be able to satisfy its military or political objectives at an acceptable cost in some circumstances the mere existence of military capabilities may be sufficient to deter military aggression some analysts argue that us and chinese nuclear weapons can overshadow all interaction between the two nations and deter behaviors that might lead to conflict that could escalate to nuclear use this school of thought appears to apply to scenario c combined arms attack and scenario d taiwan preempts the most overt uses of military force whether us nuclear forces actually would serve as the key deterrent in scenario c is unclear while superior us nuclear forces are clearly capable of severely punishing china for attacking taiwan chinas ability to respond with nuclear attack on the united states albeit limited one could be sufficient to deter the united states from credibly threatening nuclear response to chinas conventional attack similarly many fear that scenario d is plausible because of the questionable credibility of us extended deterrence to taiwan scenario sof infiltration and scenario b maritime conflict however represent crises where nuclear threats may not be credible and nuclear capabilities may not play an active role in deterrence because the level of violence is too low direct threat of nuclear use appears even less credible because the circumstances do not pose dire threat to national survival conventional us military capabilities also appear to have limited deterrent value in these scenarios in scenario there is unlikely to be unambiguous warning upon which to act and it is not clear that us crs21 conventional forces would be more effective than taiwanese forces because scenario b is the result of an accident it by definition cannot be deterred crisis stability once conflict begins participants can feel pressure to act quickly to control events and to manage the crisis in way that meets its interests this in turn can make the crisis escalate quickly and unpredictably for example if its command and control systems were protected from attack and offered redundant capabilities and its forces were not vulnerable to an early strike by the adversary then nation could delay its response await further information and possibly seek alternate means to resolve the conflict on the other hand if countrys command and control infrastructure and its key forces were vulnerable to attack early in conflict then it might feel compelled to act quickly using those forces before it lost them to attack and before it had complete information about the intent and capabilities of its adversary in pursuing the conflict preferably the capabilities or posture of nations conventional and nuclear forces would not inherently add to this instability specific us crisis stability objectives in these scenarios may include fielding forces that 1 are not vulnerable and do not make chinese forces vulnerable to use it or lose it pressures and 2 do not appear to be either vulnerable to or capable of political or military decapitation both the united states and china have currently deployed their longrange nuclear forces in ways that would not leave them vulnerable to first strike and therefore appear unlikely to undermine stability in crisis chinese forces lack the accuracy to attack us landbased forces and cannot effectively track and engage us submarines that carry ballistic missiles called ssbns chinese longrange missiles are deployed in deeply buried silos protected by rough terrain and mountains or deployed on mobile launchers therefore neither the united states nor china would experience pressure to use these weapons before losing them early warning and command and control systems could however still be vulnerable to disruption on both sides therefore efforts to disrupt these assets or other factors such as desire to achieve tactical surprise could stimulate prompt or accelerated responses as soon as crisis unfolds todays conventional forces do not appear to have capabilities or to be postured in ways that inherently erode crisis stability currently the great distance that most us forces must travel to address these scenarios imply that they will not effect the conflict immediately in scenario the forces that might most usefully contribute to taiwans defense might be surveillance intelligence or information operations resources because these assets could be deployed and employed unobtrusively they appear unlikely to exacerbate crisis scenario b represents classic unstable crisis it was caused by an accident but the stakes rise quickly as each side tries to defend its interests and becomes more entrenched the nature of this crisis probably would not be affected at least in the early stages by us forces or the doctrine guiding their use as each nation focused crs22 only on the actions of the other as the crisis unfolds us decision makers may not experience pressure to use its forces quickly to help resolve this crisis current us forces could be employed on purposefully long time line to allow the situation to cool and to give both countries time to find diplomatic facesaving way to resolve the crisis both scenarios c and d evolve into conflicts so quickly that it is unlikely that nuclear forces would either exacerbate or calm the crisis however if the united states maintained the ability with its conventional forces to attack critical targets in china and to disrupt chinas ability to prosecute the conflict china might feel compelled to move quickly to achieve its objectives this however may be more of an issue for consideration in the warfighting phase of the conflict than the crisis stability phase warfighting if the united states found itself drawn into military conflict with china via any of the illustrative scenarios above it would wish to prosecute this conflict on its own terms specific warfighting objectives would likely include 1 limiting collateral damage to allied or friendly populations 2 minimizing us taiwanese japanese casualties 3 emphasizing warfare in which the united states excels eg aviation and naval engagements and avoiding warfare that presents obvious challenges eg urban warfare and 4 avoiding protracted conflict are current us nuclear and conventional forces and doctrine well suited to achieve these warfighting objectives us conventional military involvement in scenario could present many of the challenges experienced in recent conflicts in somalia or iraq urban warfare in the midst of civilian population presumably civilians would form large or well armed militias in opposition to the taiwanese government such as the experience in iraq nevertheless the uncertainty regarding the number of chinese sof forces and the difficulty of separating friend from foe and the need to severely limit civilian casualties could make it difficult to achieve the objectives above scenario b presents obvious challenges to todays conventional military forces in terms of achieving the warfighting objectives above there appears little chance for collateral damage for example managing crisis stability may be the biggest challenge in this scenario although most discussions of nuclear weapons focus on their ability to deter conflict deterrence rests on the adversaries perception that nuclear weapons can achieve us warfighting objectives that cannot be otherwise achieved by conventional weapons us nuclear weapons could be used under wide range of circumstances but they would probably have the most to contribute in scenario c the combined arms attack if the united states determined that this level of warfare between china and taiwan threatened vital us interests it could be prepared to take whatever steps were necessary to defend its interests for example the united states might believe that it had to use nuclear weapons to destroy targets in china that were critical to chinas ability to achieve its objectives that could only be reliably damaged or destroyed by nuclear weapons these might include for example hardened or deeply buried bunkers housing weapons or command facilities crs23 the united states would likely explore all possible conventional options for disabling or destroying these targets but that it would not rule out the use of nuclear weapons casualties are likely to be high regardless of the specific targets nuclear employment could bring the conflict to an abrupt end but the longterm political consequences from using nuclear weapons under any circumstances is unpredictable but feared to be considerable this could also defeat overarching us politico military goals such as regional stability and international support and consensus the challenges of achieving us warfighting objectives with conventional forces in this scenario are well documented58 it appears likely that airpower would be used to defeat chinas air force engaged in military action vs taiwan to destroy or degrade the invasion force and to destroy or disrupt the plas command control and communications the forces most likely to be employed include land and sea based fighter and attack aircraft long range bombers command and control aircraft aerial refueling aircraft strategic and theater airlift aircraft and intelligence gathering aircraft the united states would use naval forces principally to destroy or degrade the invasion force naval forces would clear mines engage plan ships in transit and in port attacking targets in china and defend against missile attacks the navy would probably employ forces that included carrier battle groups aircraft carriers attack submarines destroyers cruisers frigates and marine corps amphibious ready groups the air wings on these aircraft are composed of tactical combat aircraft and helicopters long range maritime patrol aircraft and mine countermeasures ships could also plausibly be employed of primary concern in scenario c are chinas antiaccess weapon systems eg advanced air defenses fighter aircraft naval mines antiship cruise missiles theater ballistic missiles designed to impede us operations in the theater the united states would seek to disable defeat or destroy these capabilities early in the conflict like the nuclear force balance between the us and china it is generally accepted that us conventional forces are superior to chinas conventional forces59 unlike nuclear forces however geographical distance and the resulting operational challenges of timeliness and sustainment put us conventional forces at distinct disadvantage further the potential for high numbers of us casualties may diminish the us appetite for large scale conventional warfare which may be required to prevail in scenario c 58 the military power of the peoples republic of china 2006 op cit p40 the federal news

orourke and crs report rl33153 china naval modernization implications for us navy capabilities background and issues for congress by ronald orourke crs24 war termination if the united states found itself drawn into military conflict with china it would benefit from nuclear and conventional forces that would facilitate war termination on favorable terms war termination objectives that appear to be appealing include 1 decisive victory 2 longterm improvement in the key regional politicomilitary relationships and 3 longterm need for increased us basing presence commitment in the region achieving these objectives in scenario appears to be difficult the threat of escalation possibly to the use of nuclear weapons could play role in bringing the conflict in scenario to an end such action may appear decisive however threatening nuclear attacks is unlikely to improve the regional relationships and may not appear credible employment of us conventional forces may succeed in rolling back the chinese sof incursion and deterring or preventing escalation by the pla however once deployed it may be difficult to avoid longterm presence in or near taiwan to enforce or guarantee the peace conditions achieving war termination objectives in scenario b appears more promising by brandishing its conventional and nuclear capabilities and reminding china of the us commitment to japan the united states could possibly play significant role in ending the crisis on terms favorable to japan or at least not unfavorable to japan nonetheless the threat to leap to nuclear attack even in defense of treaty partner could seem extreme particularly if both china and japan were amenable to face saving way out of this accidental conflict deploying or using conventional forces could also demonstrate us commitment to japan possibly with greater credibility in either case increased presence or commitment by us forces is likely to be required the threat of escalation to nuclear weapons could play significant role in the termination of conflict in scenario c and may achieve us objectives of decisive victory and longterm increased us presence in the region whether terminating this major conventional conflict by threatening the use of nuclear weapons will contribute to long term stability is unclear terminating the conflict with actual use of nuclear weapons appears likely to achieve the first objective of decisive victory but only if china does not retaliate with an attack on the united states as with scenario terminating this conflict with conventional weapons capabilities appears advantageous but may risk the need for increased longterm us presence in the region scenario d appears to present noteworthy challenges to achieving war termination objectives this conflict would be very difficult to terminate without allowing either taiwan or china to win once this conflict had begun the stakes for both china and taiwan would be so high as to make it difficult to return to the status quo rapid and sustained deployment of large contingent of us or coalition forces might reassure taiwan sufficiently to terminate its attacks on the pla however the longterm costs of adopting such an obligation are probably unacceptable to the united states and the resulting peace could be so unstable china is unlikely to support large and longterm us military presence on or near taiwan as to raise concerns about the likelihood of continuing conflict with even crs25 greater numbers of us forces at risk and an even greater chance of escalation to nuclear use60 potential implications possible conflict with china attracts considerable attention from defense planners because it is regional competitor today and could over time grow to be nearpeer competitor analysts can also easily identify flashpoints where the two nations might meet and feel compelled to defend national interests the united states has longstanding nuclear deterrent relationship with china however during the cold war managing this relationship was far less important than managing the relationship with the soviet union with the demise of the soviet union and the improved relationship between the united states and russia the nuclear equation between the united states and china raises its own series of questions are existing us capabilities sufficient to deter or defeat china or other potential challengers would added or different capabilities enhance the us position in conflict by enhancing deterrence easing crisis instabilities or hastening the end of hostilities on terms favorable to the united states and its allies the answers to these questions can inform decisions about the balance of nuclear and conventional capabilities in the us military force structure in time of growing budget scrutiny investment in several conventional weapon systems or concepts is frequently justified by their perceived utility in possible conflict with nearpeer competitors such as china61 often these weapon systems are among the more expensive programs in dods budget examples of these weapons or concepts include ballistic missile defense prompt longrange conventional strike the f22a raptor advanced combat aircraft and the airborne laser the desired number of us navy aircraft carriers attack submarines anti submarine warfare ships and aircraft is also frequently linked to need to effectively counter potential chinese military action although not explicitly linked to china other us weapon systems programs appear to be geared toward largescale conventional war during time of increasing 60 see for example the discussion on the role of dissuasion in roberts brad operationalizing dissuasion of china practicalities and pitfalls institute for defense analyses april 2005 61 see for example robert dudney back to demolition derby air force magazine august 2006 michael fabey after cold war usaf searched for relevance defense news may 22 2006

june 2005 crs26 threats from nonstate actors examples of these weapon system programs include the navys conversion of trident nuclear missile submarines into conventional guidedmissile delivery systems ssgn after reviewing the scenarios and using the weapon system programs above as examples of potential future investments the following questions arise what potential do these weapons offer for enhanced deterrence crisis stability warfighting or conflict termination are the potential enhancements to deterrence crisis stability warfighting or conflict termination worth the estimated costs of developing and fielding these weapons are the potential enhancements in one situation offset by potential liabilities in other situations might other investments offer more promise at lower costs what linkages exist between nuclear and conventional forces the answers to these questions can also inform decisions about the balance of nuclear and conventional capabilities in the us military force structure nuclear deterrence as described earlier in this report it is too narrow to conclude that the united states and china have not engaged in an open armed conflict simply because each is deterred by the nuclear capabilities of the other potential flashpoints eg taiwan other territorial disputes have not ignited because both nations apparently recognize that on many fronts the costs of conflict would far exceed the benefits the us defense department for example contends that china is deterred from using overt military force against its neighbors by concerns over potential economic repercussions and fear of domestic instability62 some argue that as chinas economic and political interests in asia expand and as chinas military continues to develop the possibility of conflict could increase others however believe that the possibility of conflict is likely to decrease or at least not increase because the united states and china may find as many potential areas for cooperation as they do for competition there is doubt that this calculation could change if the political and military factors associated with the flashpoints were to change as one part of this broad calculation however chinas assessment of the costs of conflict would hinge heavily on its assessment of whether the united states would intervene and its assessment of whether the conflict might escalate to the use of nuclear weapons the bush administration has indicated and many agree that the united states can and should alter its nuclear force structure and nuclear doctrine so that they can play more prominent role in us national security policy others however question whether the threat of nuclear weapons employment would be credible if the united states did not face dire threats to its national survival 62 the military power of the peoples republic of china 2006 op cit p40 crs27 concerns about the credibility of more prominent role of nuclear weapons in us national security policy are magnified when questions of extended deterrence for taiwan or japan come up because as noted above china could retaliate against us cities with its own nuclear weapons however chinas threats of nuclear retaliation could also inspire questions about credibility china could launch small number of nuclear weapons at us territory if attacked by the united states but the united states could retaliate against china with far greater number of weapons and far broader nuclear attack hence it is possible that each could be deterred from escalating the conflict and any conflict would remain conventional moreover the possibility that china could invite far greater destruction if it used its nuclear forces after the united states used relatively small number of nuclear weapons against discrete targets has led some to some argue that the current and foreseeable nuclear relationship between china and the united states suffices to deter conflict for example one observer states we are not going to fight russia china or india the main reason were not going to fight these guys is that they all have nuclear weapons63 some have suggested that china might employ nuclear weapons to conduct an electromagnetic pulse emp attack on the united states or us forces others however doubt the likelihood of such an attack because it would affect chinas forces as well as us forces it is also unclear whether an adversary would interpret an emp attack as crossing the nuclear weapons threshold and how the adversary would respond much of the debate above is reflected in proposals to develop ballistic missile defense capabilities some argue that missile defenses including boost phase weapons like the airborne laser could increase the deterrent value of us nuclear weapons even limited missile defenses could make the us threat to escalate more credible because it would undermine chinas confidence in its ability to retaliate against the united states or its allies knowing this it is argued china would be deterred from initiating conflict that might draw in us response missile defense proponents also note that military conflict can evolve from accidents or miscalculations rather than cogent costbenefit analysis therefore missile defenses could enhance crisis stability and the us ability to conduct the conflict on its own terms if china and the united states unexpectedly found themselves caught up in quickly escalating conflict64 others believe that the us development of ballistic missile defenses could upset the current stable balance in the uschina nuclear deterrence equation in particular the united states does not yet have capable longrange missile defense system china could perceive us missile defenses as effectively swinging the military balance too much toward the united states and may thus decide to pursue military options against taiwan sooner rather than later while it could still deter 63 chet richards neither shall the sword center for defense information press january 2006 washington dc 64 for discussion of the role that defenses can play in strategy of deterrence and denial see us nuclear policy in the 21st century fresh look at national strategy and requirements center for counterproliferation research national defense university january 2001 pp 337344 crs28 us nuclear attacks on its territory with the threat of retaliation65 thus the potential for future missile defenses it is argued could be destabilizing in crisis further the us pursuit of ballistic missile defenses could motivate china to develop more capable missiles or missile defense countermeasures such as decoys or early release submunitions or to field more missiles to increase its retaliatory capabilities consequently any warfighting advantages that missile defense advocates desire it is argued are unlikely to be realized particularly if china could build additional ballistic missiles or field missile defense countermeasures more quickly than the united states could field effective missile defenses new or improved conventional weapons or capabilities as mentioned above the principal justification for many new and in some cases costly conventional military capabilities is that they are required to address possible conflict with china66 for example dod is exploring options for fielding prompt global strike pgs capabilities these options include for example conventionally armed inter continental ballistic missiles icbms or submarine launched ballistic missiles slbms67 and new hypersonic air vehicles that would be capable of accurately striking transcontinental targets within 60 minutes68 dod argues that pgs systems would be able to hold at risk targets that at present can only be destroyed with high confidence by nuclear weapons examples could include mobile buried or hardened targets or command and control c2 facilities they could also attack promptly at the start of conflict destroying an enemys airdefenses or other antiaccess forces therefore prompt global strike capabilities might enhance deterrence because these conventionally armed weapons would be more useable and therefore more credible than nuclear weapons china could still retaliate against the united states or its allies but with its nofirst use policy in place and forces consistent with minimum nuclear deterrent it may not be able to respond with nuclear weapons thus supporters argue that the united states might have greater credibility when extending deterrence to its friends and allies if through accident or miscalculation war were to break out conventional weapons could offer improved warfighting capabilities that would allow the united states to prevail conventionally and raise the threshold for the employment of nuclear weapons for example chinas ballistic missiles longrange air defenses long range surveillance radar and antiship cruise missiles are widely considered 65 these same arguments were made against ballistic missile defenses and in favor of the anti ballistic missile treaty abm during the cold war 66 it may be interesting to note that the original rationale for developing many of these same weapon systems was to address threats from the soviet union 67 for more information see crs report rl33067 conventional warheads for longrange ballistic missiles

these capabilities are likely to engender significant us casualties advocates argue that in warfighting context pgs and the f22 raptor by virtue of its stealth speed advanced sensors and avionics will be able to destroy or defeat these targets more effectively and with much less attrition than current weapon systems while these new conventional weapons might enhance deterrence they might also detract from crisis stability if conflict were to occur for example in scenario c combined arms attack neither us nor chinese nuclear forces appear postured in way that would exacerbate crisis over taiwan neither is vulnerable to first strike from the other however the same may not be true of conventional forces china may believe that its forces are vulnerable to an attack by either taiwan or the united states and that such an attack is about to occur it may then believe that in spite of the risk of escalation and possible attacks conventional or nuclear on its own territory that it would be better off initiating the conflict during the crisis in essence then the us ability to defend taiwan by attacking targets especially centers of gravity in china could actually make crisis worse and could spur china to begin or expand its attack on taiwan it can also be argued that potent conventional forces those that truly overmatch chinas defenses may weaken deterrence as described in the background section of this report during the cold war relatively weak us conventional forces were viewed by many as consistent with strong deterrence because the united states would have to quickly fall back on nuclear weapons if attacked by more potent warsaw pact forces in europe conclusion this report highlights number of policy issues that may bear consideration in the ongoing debate regarding investments in conventional and nuclear forces it appears that china and the united states currently have stable deterrent relationship this deterrence appears to be based on complicated nexus of economic political and military factors despite this deterrent relationship military conflict might ensue either as part of consciously planned strategy or due to mistakes misperception or accident together us nuclear and conventional capabilities contribute to military deterrence and therefore it appears that it would be worthwhile to consider the interplay of nuclear and conventional capabilities in force structure and strategy decisions crs30 nuclear and conventional military capabilities can simultaneously have positive effects on deterrence or warfighting and negative effects on crisis stability or war termination objectives therefore it may be overly simplistic to make changes in military force structure or capabilities to improve deterrence for example without considering potential effects on crisis stability for example investments in military capabilities that may positively contribute to all potential stages of military conflict eg deterrence crisis stability warfighting and war termination might be preferred to investments that have mixed effect on the potential range of conflict for other versions of this document see
