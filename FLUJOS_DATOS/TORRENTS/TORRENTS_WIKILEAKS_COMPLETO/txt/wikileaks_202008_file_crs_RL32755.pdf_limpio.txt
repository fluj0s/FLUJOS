divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32755air quality multipollutant legislation in the 109th congress summary with the prospect of new layers of complexity being added to air pollution controls and with electricity restructur ing putting premium on economic efficiency interest is being expressed in finding mechanisms to achieve health and environmental goals in simpler more costeffective ways the electric utility industry is major source of air pollu tion particularly sulfur dioxide so2 nitrogen oxides nox and mercury hg as well as suspected greenhouse gases particularly carbon dioxide co2 at issue is whether ne w approach to environmental protection could achieve the nations air quality goals more costeffectively than the current system one approach being proposed is m ultipollutant strategy framework based on consistent set of emissions caps implemented through emissions trading just how the proposed approach would f it with the current and proposed diverse regulatory regimes remains to be worked out they might be replaced to the greatest extent feasible or they might be overl aid by the framework of emissions caps in february 2002 the bush administration announced two air qua lity initiatives the first clear skies would amend the clean air act to place emission caps on electric utility emissions of so2 nox and hg implemented through tradeable allowance program the emissions caps w ould generally be im posed in two phases 2008 and 2018 the second initiative begins voluntary greenhouse gas reduction program this plan rather than capping co2 emissions focuses on improving the carbon efficiency of the economy reducing cu rrent emissions of 183 metric tons per million dollars of gdp to 151 metric t ons per million dollars of gdp in 2012 in the 109th congress seven bills have b een introduced that would impose multipollutant controls on utilities two of the bills hr 227 and s 131 are modified versions of the administration s threepollutant proposal the

compare those co2 caps with the administrations proposal concerning co2 both because the administrations proposal is voluntary rather than mandatory and because it is broa der covering all greenhouse gas emissions rather than just utility co2 emissions however it appears that actual us greenhouse gas emissions would be higher under the administrations proposal than those allowed by s 150 s 730 and

emissions the current bush administration has rej ected the kyoto protocol which would impose mandatory limits in favor of voluntary reduction program in contrast to the administrations position in june 2005 th senate passed nse of the senate calling for mandatory controls on greenhous gases while not imposing significant harm to the economy3 for many years the complexity of the air quality control regime has caused some observers to call for simplified approach now with the potential both for additional control programs on so2 and nox and for new contro ls directed at hg and co2 intersecting with the technological nd policy changes affecting the electric utility industry such calls for simplifi cation have become more numerous and insistent one focus of this effort is the multipollutant or fourpollutant approach this approach involves mix of regulatory and economic mechanisms that would apply to utility emissions of up to four pollutants in various proposals so2 nox hg and co2 the objective would be to balance the environmental goal of effective controls across the pollutants covered with the industry goal of stable regulatory regime for period of years4 the bush administrations proposals in february 2002 the bush administra tion announced two air quality proposals to address the contro l of emissions of so2 nox hg and co25 the first proposal called clear skies would amend the clean air act to place emission caps on electric utility emissions of so2 nox and hg implemented through tradeable allowance program the emissions caps w ould be imposed in two phases 2010 2008 in the case of nox and 2018 as part of complete rewrite of title iv of the clean air act the administrations pr oposal was introduced in the 108th congress as hr 999 and s 485 revised versions of clear skies legislati on have been introduced in the 109th congress as hr 227 and s 1316 the second administration proposal in itiates new voluntary greenhouse gas reduction program similar to ones introduced by the earlier george h w bush and clinton administrations7 developed in response to th us ratification of the 1992 unfccc these previous plans projected us compliance or near compliance withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32755crs3 8 pl 101549the unfccc goal of stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions at their 1990 levels by the year 2000 through voluntary measures th bush administration proposal does not make that claim only projecting 100 milli on metric ton reducti on in emissions from what would occur otherwise in the year 2012 instead the plan focuses on improving the carbon efficiency of the economy reduc ing current emissions of 183 metric tons per million dollars of gdp to 151 metric tons per million dollars of gdp in 2012 it proposes several voluntary initiatives ong with increased spending and tax incentives to achieve this goal the administration notes that the new initiatives would achieve about onequarter of the objective while threequarters of the projected reduction would occur th rough already existing efforts proposed legislation and legislative action in the 109th congress in the 109th congress seven bills have b een introduced that

all of these bills involve some form of emission caps typically beginning in 2010 most include tradeable credit program to implement that cap the provisions concerning so2 nox and hg in s 150 s 730 s

is difficult to compare those co2 caps to the administrations proposal concerning co2 both because the administrations pr oposal is voluntary rather than mandatory and because it is broader coveri ng all greenhouse gas emissions rather than just utility co2 emissions however it appears th at actual us greenhouse gas emissions would be higher under the administration s proposal than those allowed by s 150 s 730 and hr 1451 the seven bills are summarized in the appendix each of these bills except s 730 generally builds on the so2 allowance trading scheme contained in title iv of the 1990 clean air act amendments caaa8 under this program utilities are given specific allocation of permitted emissions called allowances and may choose to use those allowances at their own facilities or if they do not use their full quota to bank them for future use or to sell them to other utilities needing additional allowances in contrast s 730 permits missions averaging within single facility but not across sites so2 nox and hg controls as indicated in the appendix the caps for so2 and nox in s 131 are less stringent for 2010 than in s 150 s 730 and hr 1451 and remain less stringent even thr ough the second phase beginning in 2018httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32755crs4 hr 227 would require full compliance with its so2 and nox provisions by 2014 in effect accelerating s 131s proposed phase 2 emission caps by four years however s 131s phase 1 nox reduction would begin tw years earlier 2008 than s 150 s 730 hr 227 or hr 1451 and one year sooner than hr 1873 allowance allocation scheme s for the bills also differ with s 150 containing detailed provisions for allocating so2 nox and co2 allowances to various economic sectors and interests in most cases these interests or their trustees in the case of households and dislo cated workers and communities would auction off or otherwise sell their allowances to the ffected utilities and us the collected funds for their own purposes in contrast s 131 would base its allowance formulas on fuel usage adjusted by factors specified in the bill while hr 227 and hr 1451 would leave the allocation issue to epa s 730 provides specifics on allocating and implementing its so2 nox and co2 caps on electric utilities whereas hr 1873 and s 2724 specify co2 and nox limitations based on electricity output and so2 limitations based on the current title iv program on mercury s 131s emissions goal would allow about three times more emissions and eight more years for co mpliance than s 150 s 730 and hr 1451 which also would mandate pl antbyplant controls hr 227 would require epa to promulgate hg regulations by marc h 15 2005 and hr 1873 and s 2724 provide for limitations in between those of s 150 and s 131 but includes unitbyunit emissions limitations it is difficult to compare the hg controls of s 131 s 150 s 730 s 2724 hr 1451 or hr 1873 to hr 227 which does not specify an hg emissions goal leaving regulation up to ep s 730 is the most comprehensive bill with respect to hg control including not only stringent cap on electric utility emissions but also substantial reduction re quirements for six other categories of hg emitters related regulator provisions in addition to the emissions caps s 131 would substantially modify or eliminate several provisions in the clean air act with respect to electric generating facilities the bill would eliminate new source performance standards nsps section 111 and replace them with statutory standards for so 2 nox particulate matter and hg for new sources modified sources

the exemption does not apply to psdbact requirements if facilities are within 50 km of psd class 1 area existing sources can also receive these exemptions if they agree to meet particulate matter standard specified in the bill along with good combustion practices to minimize carbon monoxide emissions within three years of enactment in ddition s 131 would provide these exemptions for industrial sources that choose to opt into the clear skies program hr 1873 also contains significant regu latory provisions the bill would revise the nsr program to require pre1971 electri c generating units to

1873 would also provide affected units 20year exemption from bart requirements under the caa visibility provisions other changes to the visibility provision include the codification of the western

control technology for new source in similar vein hr 1451 would require all powerplants 30 years or older to meet current new source performance standards nsps requirements s 131 also would include an exempti on for steam electric generating facilities from hg regulation under section 112 of the caa including the residual risk provisions and relief from enforcement of any section 126 petition with respect to reducing interstate tran sportation of pollution before december 31 2014 in addition to its nsr provision s 2724 would eliminate the annual nox cap established under epas recently

s 730 nor hr 1451 would provide such regulatory relief provisions co2 of the seven bills s 150 s 730 s 2724 hr 1451 and hr 1873 would specify co2 reductions in contrast the administrations co2

the administrations voluntary program reaches proportional percentage of its 2012 goals10 this should not be taken as give n as neither the george h w bush administrations program nor the clinton administrations program achieved their stated goals thus in one sense comp aring mandatory reduction program such as that proposed by s 150 s 730 s 2724 hr 1451 or hr 1873 with the administrations

2000 doeeia0383 washington dc 2002 december 2001 p 177while s 150 s 730 and hr 1451 focus on electric utility emissions the mandated reductions would re sult in lower total greenhouse gas emissions in 2010 than those projected to ccur under the administrations initiative that includes all sources of all greenhouse gases both hr 1873 and s 2724 require fewer reductions than the administration hopes to achieve from its economywide initiative however neither the proposed legislation nor the administrations initiative would be sufficient to bring us emissions near the 19901995 baseline used under the 1997 kyoto protocol much less the 7 reduction in emissions from that baseline that would have been assign ed to the united states under the protocol discussion in the car observes that th pace of economic growth would affect emissions high economic growth scenar io would increase energy use and related carbon emissions compared to the reference case of business as usual likewise lower economic growth would decrease emissions for example under high economic growth scenario greenhouse emissions in 2010 would increase 377 above those in 1990 based on energy growth alone this increase would represent an additional 53 million metric tons of emissions over the reference case11 however s 150 and s 730 would cap emissions from increased electricity generation at 1990 levels which would reduce the 53 million metric tons by 16 million metric tons or 30 of the high growth increase the administrations initiative is voluntary and addresses carbon intensity not absolute emission levels it does not cap emissions growth table 2 comparison of administrations voluntary program with proposed legislation percentage change v business as usual 2010percentage change v 19901995 baseline levels
