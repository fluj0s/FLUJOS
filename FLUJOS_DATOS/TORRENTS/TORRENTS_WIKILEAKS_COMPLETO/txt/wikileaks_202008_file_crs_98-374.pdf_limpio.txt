nations are sometimes st ationed in the united states upon discovering specific instances of foreign troop presence some members of the pub lic have expressed concern in general however the presence of such foreign representation on us soil is neither new nor unusual phenomenon this report will be updated when significant new information becomes available background the great bulk of foreign military personne l in the united states are individuals assigned here for specialized training or to fill exchange faculty and staff positions they can be found on almost all major training in stallations of all services throughout the united states their duration of presence in the united states could range from few weeks to several years on occasion fore ign military units participate for few weeks in combined military exercises on us land or water training ranges one of the more widely noted being small russian unit that trained with us forces at fort riley kansas in october 1995 single comprehens ive listing of where and why all foreign personnel and units are here would be quite extensive and is not known to exist the largest number of foreign personnel co here under the in ternational military education and training program imet spons ored by the state department and executed by the department of defense for fy1998 dod estimated that some 8840 foreign military personnel

trains many military personnel in the united states is germany typically germany has some 2500 people at 54 locations throughout the united states and canada it maintains german armed forces command usa and canada headquarters in reston virginia in 1996 the german air force tactical training center for fighter pilots was established at holloman air force base near alamogordo new mexico see crs report 96462 german military presence in the united states the case of holloman air force base by karen donfried may 22 1996 6 p the german air force command for uscanada is headquartered and major surfacetoair missile training is conducted by the german air force air defense school at fort bliss near paso texas reasons the government of the united states invites foreign military personnel and units to train in the united states for severa l reasons in some cases there appears to be mutual benefit in providing unique us facilities to allies and friends for example most small nations cannot support ll the specialized and highlevel training opportunities found in the united states and many do not have the open spaces needed for intensive practice with modern weapons in other cases it is felt that todays immersion of foreign soldiers in us military doctrine and practices would pay dividends whenever they might be called to fight as partners in battle some believe that their temporary immersion in american culture leads to greater understanding and eventual promotion of democratic ideals abroad on narrower basis it appears that local us communities tend to welcome foreign military guest programs for perceived cultural and economic advantages finally there is some element of reci procity involved in inviting foreign military units and personnel to the united states for fifty years the us strategy of forward presence has resulted in large numbers of us forces being stationed in many foreign nations with their concurrence for ex ample while germany has approximately 2500 military personnel in the united states some 60000 us troops are currently stationed in germany see crs report 95829 us military dispositions fact sheet by edward f bruner updated april 13 1998 2 p
