chemical facilities for three years but excluded drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities from coverage an overarching sdwa issue concerned the cumulative cost and complexity of drinking water standards and the ability of water systems especially small systems to comply with standards the issue of the affordability of drinking water standards such as the revised arsenic standard merged with the larger debate over the federal role in assisting communities with financing drinking water infrastructure to help communities finance projects needed to comply with drinking water standards congress authorized drinki ng water state revolving fund dwsrf program in 1996 congress has appropriated roughly 840 million annually for this program in recent years nonetheless st udies show that large funding gap exists and is likely to grow as sdwa requirements increase and infrastructure ages the senate environment and public works committee reported s 1400 the water infrastructure financing act to authorize increased funding for the dwsrf program and parallel wastewater program and to provide grant assistance for small communities several other b ills were introduced to estab lish grant program to help small communities comply with drinking water standards and provide greater compliance flexibility for small water systems further action occurred on

300f300j26safe drinking water act background and issues in the 109th congress introduction the 109th congress considered legislation on wide range of drinking water quality issues and one safe drinking water act sdwa amendment was enacted during the first session the energy polic act of 2005 pl 10958 hr 6 section 322 amended sdwa provisions concerni ng the protection of underground sources of drinking water sdwa 1421d sp ecifically the energy law precludes the environmental protection agency epa from regulating the underground injection of any fluids except diesel fuel for hydraulic fracturing purposes related to oil gas and geothermal production1 during the second session the 109th congress addressed drinking water quality issues primarily through th appropriations process in may 2006 the house passed hr 5386 hrept 109465 the department of interior envir onment and related agencies appropriations act for fy2007 whic h included funding for the epa the house bill provided as requested 8415 million for the drinking water state revolving fund dwsrf program to provi financial assistance to help public water systems comply with drinking wate r standards the natereported version of hr 5386 srept 109275 also contained 8415 million for the dwsrf program 4 million more th an fy2006 f unding however further action occurred on the interiorenvironment appropriations bill under the continuing resolution providing appropriations fo r fy2007 through february 15 2007 pl 109383 hjres 102 epa prog rams have been funded at the fy2006 levels the fy2006 funding level for the dwsrf program was 8375 million the safe drinking water act2 is the key federal law for protecting public water supplies from harmful contaminants firs t enacted in 1974 and broadly amended in 1986 and 1996 the act is administered through programs that regu late contaminants in public water supplies pr ovide funding for infrastruct ure projects protect sources of drinking water and promote the capacity of water systems to comply with sdwa regulations the 1974 law established the fede ralstate structure in which states and tribes may be delegated primary enforcement and implementation authority primacy for the drinking water program by the epa which is the federal agency responsiblehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33549crs2 3 us environmental protection agency providing safe drinking water

the basic program for regulating public water systems and the epa has delegated primacy for this program to all states except wyoming and the district of columbia which sdwa defines as state the epa has responsibility for implementing the pwss program in these two jurisdictions congress passed the sdwa in 1974 afte r nationwide study of community water systems revealed widespread water quality problems and health risks resulting from inadequate facilities poor operating procedures and poor management of water supplies in communities of all sizes much progress has been made since then and 91 drinking water contaminants are now regulated in 2004 the epa reported that the population served by community wate r systems that met all healthbased standards increased from 83 in 1994 to 91 in 20023 nonetheless drinking water safety concerns and challenges remain the epa and state enforcement data indicate that water systems still incur tens of thous ands of violations of sdwa requirements each year these violations primarily involve monitoring and reporting requirements but also include thousands of violations of standards and treatment techniques moreover monitoring and reporting viola tions create uncertainty as to whether systems actually met the applicable healthbased standards concern also exists over the potential health effects of contaminants for which standards have not been set such as perchlorate and methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe and the act requires the epa to continually evaluate unregulated contaminants that may be candidates for regulation the 1996 sdwa amendments the 104th congress made numerous changes to the act with the sdwa amendments of 1996 pl 104182 culminatin g multiyear effort to amend law that was widely criticized as having too little flexibility too many unfunded mandates and an arduous but unfocused regulatory schedule among the key provisions the 1996 amendments authorized drinking water state revolving loan fund dwsrf program to help public wa ter systems finance projects needed to comply with sdwa rules the amendments also established process for selecting contaminants for regulation based on health risk and occurrence gave the epa some added flexibility to consider costs and benefits in setting most new standards and established schedules for regulating certain contaminants such as cryptosporidium disinfection byproducts arse nic and radon the w added several provisions aimed at building the capacity of water systems especially small systems to comply with sdwa regulations it also imposed many new requirements on the states including programs for source water assessm ent operator certification and training and compliance capacity development the amendments also required that community water suppliers provide cust omers with annual consumer confidence reports that provide information on re gulated contaminants found in the local drinking water the law authorized appropriations for most sdwa programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33549crs3 through fy2003 and although funding au thority generally has expired broad reauthorization bills have not been propos ed as the epa states and public

infrastructure funding needs the capacity of public water systems especially small systems to comply with sdwa regulations the security of water supplies and contamination of drinking water by speci fic contaminants including lead and unregulated contaminants such as mtbe and perchlorate although appropriations for most sdwa programs were authorized through fy2003 sdwa reauthorization was not on the agenda in the 109th congress rather legislation addressed specific drinking water issues ch as infrastructure funding and security and contamination of water supplies by particular c ontaminants such as mtbe and perchlorate as with other epaadmin istered statutes having expired funding authority congress continued to appr opriate funds for sdwa programs regulating drinking water contaminants standardsetting the safe drinking water act directs the epa to promulgate national primary drinking water regulation for contaminant if the administrator determines that 1 it may have adverse health effects 2 it is likely to be present in public water systems with frequency and at levels of public health concern and 3 its regulation presents meaningful opportunity for health risk reduction the regulations ge nerally include numerical st andards that establish the highest level of contaminant that may be present in water supplied by public water systems where it is not economically or technically feasible to measure contaminant at very low concentrations the epa may establish treatment technique in lieu of standard developing drinking wate r regulation is complex process and the epa must address variety of technical scientific and economic issues the agency must 1 determine the extent of occurrence of cont aminant in sources of drinking water 2 evaluate the potential human exposure and risks of adverse health effects to the general population and to sens itive subpopulations 3 ensure that analytical met hods are available for water systems to use in monitoring for contaminant 4 evaluate the availability and costs of treatment techniques that can be used to remove contaminant and 5 assess the impacts of regulation on public water systems the economy and public health re gulation development typically is multiyear process the epa may expedite procedures and issu interim standards to respond to urgent threats to public health after reviewing health effects studies the epa sets nonenforceable maximum contaminant level goal mclg at leve l at which known or anticipated adverse health effects occur and that allows an adequate margin of safety the epa also considers the risk to sensitive subpopulati ons such as infants and children for carcinogens and microbes the epa generally sets the mclg at zero because mclgs are based only on health effects and not on analytical detection limits or the availability or cost of treatme nt technologies they may be set at levels that are not feasible for water systems to meethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33549crs5 4 for more detailed discussion see crs report rl31243 safe drinking water act summary of the act and its major requirements by mary tiemann 5 sdwa does not discuss how the epa should consider cost in determining feasibility thus the epa has relied on legislative history for guidance congress most recently expressed its view on this matter in the senate report accompanying the 1996 amendments the report states that feasible means the level that can be reached by large regional drinking water systems applying best available treatment technology this approach to standard setting is used because 80 of the population receives its drinking water from large systems and safe water can be provided to this portion of the population at very affordable costsus senate safe drinking water amendments act of 1995 report of the committee on environment and public works on s 1316 srept 104169 p 14 nov 7 1995 approximately 80 of the population is served by community water systems that serve population of 10000 or more 6 sdwa 1412b6 42 usc 300g1 7 information on these rules can be found at http wwwepagovsafewate rdisinfectiononce the mclg is established the epa then sets an enforceable standard the maximum contaminant level mcl the mcl generally must be set as close to the mclg as is feasible using the best t echnology or other means available taking costs into consideration sdwa 1412b4 the epa has relied on legislative history to determine the meaning of feasible most recently the senate report accompanying the 1996 amendments stated th at feasible means the level that can be reached by large regional drinking water systems applying best available treatment technology the senate committee explained that this approach is used because 80 of the population receives its drinking water from large community water systems and thus safe water can be provided to mo st of the population at very affordable costs5 however because standards are based on cost considerations for large systems congress expected that standards could be less affordable for smaller systems an issue in the 1996 reauthorization debate concerned whether the costs of some standards were justified given their estimated riskreduction benefits as amended the act now requires the epa when proposin g standard to pub lish determination as to whether or not the benefits of propos ed standard justify the costs if the epa determines that the benefits do not justify the costs the epa in certain cases may promulgate standard that is less stringent than the feasible level and that maximizes health risk reduction benefits at cost that is justified by the benefits6 recent and pending rules the epas recent rulemaking activities include january 4 2006 rule package 71 federal register 387 that expanded existing requirements to control pathogens especially cryptosporidium and disinfectants eg chlorine and their by products eg chloroform these rules along with the long term 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule lt2 rule and the stage 2 disinfectant nd disinfection byproduct rule stage 2 dbp complete series of statutorily manda ted rules that impose increasingly strict controls on the presences of pathogens and disinfectants and their byproducts in water systems7 on november 8 2006 the epa promulga ted the ground water rule 71 federal register 65574 establishing disinfection requirements for systems relying on ground water the rule is intended to reduce the risk of exposure to waterborne pathogenshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33549crs6 8 the proposed rule and further information on the lead and copper rule and the epas review of the rule are available at httpwwwepagovsafewaterlcrmrindexhtmlfrom fecal contamination the epa also pr omulgated new or re vised standards for several radionuclides including uranium nd radium and revised standard for arsenic these regulations are expected to reduce an array of health risks for consumers but they potentially have significant costs for those communities that must expand treatment practices and facilities to comply with the standards on july 18 2006 the epa proposed revisions to the lead and copper rule 71 federal register 40828 the proposed changes are intended to addr ess weaknesses identified during nationwide review of th at rule following the discovery of high lead levels in washington dc tap water in 20048 the agency also has been developing final radon ru which was proposed in 1999 and has been evaluating numerous contaminants including perchl orate and mtbe for possible regulation perchlorate the key ingredient of solid rocket fuel perchlorate is used heavily by the department of defense dod the national ae ronautics and space administration nasa and re lated industries it is also used in road flares fireworks construction explosives and variety of other products this highly soluble and persistent compound has long been disposed of on the ground without treatment or controls and has been detected in sources of drinking water that serve more than 11 million people usually at w levels perchlorate is known to disrupt the uptake of iodine in the thyroid poten tially affecting thyroid function key concern is that if sufficiently severe imp aired thyroid function in pregnant women can impair brain developmen t in fetuses and infants the epa identified perchlorate as candidate for regulation in 1998 but concluded that information was insufficient at that time to make regulatory determination the epa listed perchlorate as priority fo r further research on health effects and treatment technol ogies and for collecting occurrence data in 2002 the epa issued controversial dr aft risk assessment for perc hlorate that concluded that potential human health risks of perchl orate exposure include effects on the developing nervous systems and thyroid tumors the findings were based on rat studies that observed benign tumors and dverse effects in feta l brain development the draft assessment included revised draft reference dose rfd intended to protect the most sensitive groups against thes effects that dos roughly translated to drinking water standard of 1 part per billion ppb the epas 1999 draft level had translated to standard of roughly 32 ppb because an rfd provides the basis for termining the level at which drinking water standard is set and because thes standards are in turn the basis of environmental cleanup standards dod and other perchlorate users and manufacturers have followed th epas perchlorate risk assessment efforts closely interagency debate over th draft assessment persiste d and in march 2003 the epa the dod nasa and other federal agenci asked the national research council nrc to review the science for perchlor ate and the epas draft risk

20059 the nrc committee broadly agreed with several of the epas findings however the committee suggested several changes to the draft risk assessment among other findings the committee noted that unlike rats humans have multiple mechanisms to compensate for iodide deficiency and thyroid disorders and that studies of rats are of limited use for assessing human health risk associated with perchlorate exposure the committee recommended that the epa base its assessment on human data the nrc calculated an rfd for perchlorate that incorporates an uncertainty factor to protect the most sensitive populations this rfd would translat to drinking wate r equivalent level of 245 ppb if the epa were to develop an mcl the agency would likely lower this number to reflect the amount of perc hlorate exposure that the epa determines comes from other sources especially f ood the epa has adopted the nrcs recommended rfd but has not decided whethe r to set standard for perchlorate despite the nrc recommendations substantial disagreement has persisted regarding what level of exposure is safe pecially for fetuses and infants and what drinking water standard is appropriate mass achusetts has established drinking water standard for perchlorate of 2 ppb nd california has proposed standard of 6 ppb10 an array of perchlorate bills were offered in the 109th congress many focused on california where most perchlorate cont amination has been detected the house passed two bills to address perchloratecontaminated gr oundwater in california hr 186 authorizes the secretary of the interior to make grants to the santa clara valley water district for groundwater remediation projects and hr 18 authorizes grants for local water authorities within the santa anna river watershed the senate did not act on either bill similar legislati on hr 3053 was introduced to authorize the restoration of perchloratecontaminated gr oundwater in the eastern santa clara river basin hr 4798 and s 2298 proposed to tablish california perchlorate cleanup fund to provide grants for remediating pe rchloratecontaminat ed drinking water sources and supplies and to authorize gr ants for developing perchlorate cleanup technologies these companion bills expresse d the sense of the congress that the epa should establish drinking water standard for perchlorate hr 213 would have required the epa to set drinking water standard for perchlorate by july 31 2007 congress did not complete action on any of these bills the 109th congress targeted some funding fo r perchlorate cleanup in conference reports for

the main environmental threats to childrens health the epa has long regulated lead in drinking water nd last revised the regulation for lead in 1991 in early 2004 th issue of lead contamination reemerged after water monitoring revealed high am ounts of lead in tap water in washington dc in response to this event th epa undertook national review of lead monitoring by water systems to determine whether the problem in the district was widespread in october 2004 the epa nnounced that the national data from 73000 water utilities indicated that lead in drinking water was not widespread problem however the epa also assessed national compliance with the lead rule and began reviewing the rule to determine whether major changes were needed elements of the rule that received most scrutiny included the public notification monitoring and lead service line re placement requirements the epa found monitoring and public notification deficien cies in the rule and in late 2004 issued guidance memo to clarify sampling requirements for public water systems the epa also revised its 1994 guidance on testing for lead in school drinking water in march 2005 the epa initiated drinking water lead reducti on plan based on its review of the lead rule under the pla n the epa outlined proposal to tighten and clarify monitoring and public notification re quirements and to re vise treatment and lead service line replacement requirement s on july 18 2006 the epa formally proposed changes to the rule 71 federal register 4082811 the 108th congress held flurry of oversight hearings examining lead in drinking water issues including nationw ide enforcement of and compliance with the lead rule and the overall effectiveness of the regulation in reducing exposures to lead in the 109th congress several bills were offered while the epa pursued its lead reduction plan and regulatory review ac tivities companion bills hr 3178 and s 1328 similar to bills in the 108th congress were introduced to require the epa to revise the lead rule and issue regulations for remediating lead in school drinking water and to reduce the amount of lead permitted in plumbing s 1400 as reported would have required study of lead in plumbing and authorized funding for lead service line replacement in the district of columbia further action occurred on these bills methyl tertiary butyl ether

least seven st ates have set their own mtbe standard the primary source of mtbe in drinki ng water has been petroleum releases from leaking underground storage tank ust systems once released mtbe moves through soil and into water more rapidl than other gasoline components thus making it more likely to reach drinking water sources the epa estimates that ust leaks involving mtbe can be two to four times more costly to clean up than conventional gasoline leaks whic h generally cost from 100000 to 125000 to remediate because of data gaps the epa has not issued health advisory or drinking water standard for mtbe however the ep as office of research and development concluded in 1993 that the inhalation ev idence would support classifying mtbe as possible human carcinogen13 in 1997 the epa issued drinking water advisory for mtbe based on consumer acceptability fo r taste and smell because even small amounts of mtbe can render water undrinkabl because of its strong taste and odor advisories provide information on conta minants that are not regulated under sdwa they are not enforceable but provide guidance to water suppliers and others regarding potential health effects or c onsumer acceptability although the mtbe advisory is not based on health effects the epa stated at that time that keeping mtbe levels in the range of 2040 parts per billion or lower for consumer acceptability reasons would also provide large margin of safety from potential adverse health effects the epa has taken steps that could lead to the issuance of drinking water standard for mtbe in 1998 the epa incl uded mtbe on list of contaminants that are potential candidates for regulation co mpounds on the contaminant candidate list are categorized as regulatory determina tion priorities research priorities or occurrence priorities the epa placed mtbe in the category of contaminants for which further occurrence data collection and health effects research are priorities thus although the epa did not select mt be for regulation the agency planned to pursue research to fill data gaps so that regulatory determination may be made however most current mtbe research is focused on inhalation risks and very little research is being done specifically to ssess the risks of exposure to mtbe via drinking water the 109th congress responded to mtbe conta mination concerns in the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 hr 6 th energy act did not ban mtbe but it removed the clean air act requirement that reformulated gasoline contain oxygenates which had prompted greater use of mtbe

and crs report rs21201 leaking underground storage t anks program status and issues by mary tiemann 15 for discussion of legal issues see crs report rs21676 the safe harbor provision for methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe by aaron m flynn comprised the underground storage tank co mpliance act which added new leak prevention and enforcement provisions to the federal ust regulatory program14 of major concern to drinking water suppliers was provision in the house version of hr 6 that would have provide d retroactive safe harbor to prohibit products liability lawsuits alleging manufacturing or design defects against producers of fuels containing mtbe and renewable fuels the provision would not have affected other liability such as liability for cleanup costs or negligence for spills with liability ruled out for design defects manufacturing defects and failure to warn of hazardous products mtbe ma nufacturers would likely be more difficult to reach under these other bases of liability15 the safe harbor provision was opposed by many states local government orga nizations and water suppliers opponents argued that products liability shield w ould effectively leave gas station owners liable for cleanup and because these busine sses often have few resources the burden for cleanup would fall to communities wate r systems the states and private well owners proponents argued that liability safe harbor was mer ited given that mtbe has been used to meet federal clean air act mandates and that the key problem was leaking tanks not mtbe the senate bill included safe harbor for renewable fuels but not mtbe and it was not retroactive unable to work out broadly acceptable compromise conferees dropped the safe harbor provision from the legislation although the mtbe ban also was dropped fro m the legislation the use of mtbe is expected to decline as the act did repeal the oxygenate requirement which became effective nationwide in may 2006 drinking water infrastructure funding drinking water state revolving fund persistent sdwa issue has concerned the ability of public water system s to upgrade or replace infrastructure to comply with federal drinking water regulations and more broadly to ensure the provision of safe and reliable wate r supply in the 1996 sdwa amendments congress responded to growing complaints about the acts unfunded mandates and authorized drinking water state revol ving loan fund dwsrf program to help water systems finance infrastructure projects needed to meet drinking water standards and address the most serious health risks the program authorizes the epa to award annual capitalization grants to states states then use their grants plus 20 state match to provide loans and other assistance to public water systems communities repay loans into the fund thus making re sources available for projects in other communities eligible projects include installation and repl acement of treatment facilities distribution

the dwsrf program at the fy2006 level through june 2005 the epa had awarde d 656 billion in capitalization grants which when combined with the state match bond proceeds and other funds amounted to 124 billion in dwsrf funds av ailable for loans and other assistance also through june 2005 7912 projects recei ved assistance and total assistance provided by the program reached 944 billion16 funding issues the dwsrf program is well regarded but many organizations and state and local officials argue that greater investment in water infrastructure is needed the epas 2003 dr inking water infrastructure needs survey concluded that systems need to invest 2768 billion in infrastructure improvements over 20 years to comply with drinking wate r regulations and to ensure the provision of safe water17 the survey includes funds needed for compliance with several recent rules including the arsenic rule and th disinfectants and disinfection byproducts rules and several proposed rules eg radon the survey also identified 1 billion in securityrelated needs all infrastructure projects in the needs assessment promote the health objectives of the act but only 451 billion 163 of the total need is attributable to sdwa complia nce of this amount 352 billion is needed to address existing regulations and 302 billion 86 is needed for projects to address microbiological contamination nearly twothirds of the need 1836 billion is for transmission and distribution projects alt hough aging deteriorated infrastructure often poses threat to drinking water safety these needs are largely unrelated to federal mandates related issue is the need for communities to address infrastructure costs that are outside the scope of the dwsrf prog ram and generally ineligible for such assistance ineligible categories include future growth ongoing rehabilitation and system operation and maintenance often these basic infrastructure costs far exceed sdwa compliance costs in 2002 the epa issued its municipa l wastewater and drinking water infrastructure funding gap analysis whic h identified potential funding gaps betweenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33549crs12 18 us environmental protection agency the clean water and drinking water infrastructure gap analysis report report epa 816r02020 september 2002 50 pprojected needs and spending from 2000 through 201918 this analysis estimated the potential 20year funding gap for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure capital and operations and maintenance om based on two scenarios revenue growth scenario and revenue growth scenario that assumed spending on infrastructure would increase 3 per year under the revenue growth scenario the epa projected funding gap for dri nking water capital investment of 102 billion roughly 5 billion per year and an om funding gap of 161 billion 8 billion per year using revenue growth assumptions the epa estimated 20year capital funding gap of 45 billion 2 billion per year and gap for om in response to the gap analysis the epas fy2004 budget request proposed that funding for the dwsrf program be continued at level of 850 m illion nnually through fy2018 the epas budget justifica tion explained that this funding level would allow dwsrfs to revolve at cumulative level of 12 billion m ore than double the previous goal of 500 million and would help close the funding gap for drinking water infrastructure needs other assessments also have reveal ed funding gap in 2000 the water infrastructure network win coalition of state and local officials water providers environmental gr oups and others reported th at over the next 20 years water and wastewater systems need to i nvest 23 billion annually more than current investments to meet sdwa and clean wate r act health and environmental priorities and to replace aging infrastructure win and other groups have proposed multibillion dollar investment programs for water infrastructure others however have called for more fi nancial selfreliance with in the water sector water infrastructure funding issu received attention in the 109th congress the senate environment and public works committee reported s 1400 the water infrastructure financing act s rept 109 186 this bill would have amended the sdwa and the clean water act to reaut horize both srf programs authorizing 15 billion over five years for the dwsrf the bill also would have directed the epa to establish grant programs for small or economically disadvantaged communities for critical drinking water and water quality projects authorized loans to small systems for preconstruction shortterm and small project costs and directed the epa to establish demonstration program to pr omote new technologies and approaches to water quality and water s upply management at markup the committee adopted an amendment to apply davisbacon prevailing wage requirements in perpetuity to projects receiving dwsrf ssistance action on similar legislation in the 108th congress was stalled largely by such an amendment the davisbacon measure remained contentious and s 1400 received further action in the face of uncertainty over increased federal assistance for water infrastructure the epa states communities and utilities have been examining alternative management and financing strategies to address sdwa compliance costs and broader infrastructure maintenance and repair costs such strategies include establishing publicprivate partnerships p rivatization options range from contractinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33549crs13 19 for further discussion of infrast

asset management and adopting fullcost pricing for water services still these strategies may be of limited use to many small and economically disadvantaged communities and stakeholders are likely to continue to urge congress to increase funding for water infrastructure19 drinking water security congress addressed veral drinking water security issues in the bioterrorism preparedness act of 2002 pl 107188 hrept 107481 which amended sdwa to require community water systems to c onduct vulnera bility assessments and prepare emergency response plans new sdwa s ection 1433 the act also added sections 1434 and 1435 directing the epa to review methods by which terrorists or others could disrupt the provision of safe wate r supplies and to review methods for preventing detecting and responding to disruptions introduced in july 2005 s 1426 proposed to reauthorize appropriati ons for sections 1434 and 1435 and require the epa to report to congress on progress and problems with their implementation however further action ccurred on this legislation key provision of the bioterrorism preparedness act required each community water system serving more than 3300 individuals to assess their vulnerability to terrorist attacks and other intentional act s to disrupt the provision of safe and reliable water supply combined these systems serve more than 90 of the population served by community water syst ems the law required these systems to certify to the epa that they conducted vul nerability assessment and to provide the epa with copy of the assessment the law also required the systems to prepare or revise emergency response plan s incorporating the results of the assessments later than six months after completing them table 2 outlines the deadlines by which utilities had to submit their assessments to the epa and complete emergency response plans the bioterrorism act authorized 160 million for fy2002 and sums as may be needed for fy2003 through fy2005 to provide financial assistance to community water systems to assess vulne rabilities prepare response pl ans and address security enhancements and significant threats the emergency supplemental appropriations for fy2002 pl 107117 provided 90 million for assessing the vulnerabilities of drinking water utilities and security planning and 5 million for state grants for assessing drinking wate r safety in fy2002 the epa awarded roughly 53 million in grants to help the largest systems complete vulnerability assessments by the march 31 2003 deadline essentially all systems met that

federal grants were not available for smaller systems covered by the bioterrorism acts requireme nts instead the epa st ates and water organizations have provided vulnerability assessment tools guidance documents training and technical assistance to support security enhancement efforts among these systems similar assistance also has been provided for the remaining 84 of community water systems that serve 3300 or fewer and were not required to do vulnerability assessments and emergency planning for fy2003 the epa requested 169 million for vulnerability assessments for small and mediumsized systems and 5 million for state water security coordinators to work with the epa and utilities in asse ssing water security pl 1087 included this amount plus 2 million for the national rural water associa tion to help small systems with vulnerability assessments nd 1 million to the american water works association to provide security training for fy2004 the epa requested and received 324 million for cr itical water infrastructure protection including 5 million for state water security coordination grants this funding supported states fforts to work with water and wastewater systems to develop and enhance emergency operations plans conduct training in the implementation of remedial plans in small systems and develop detection monitoring and treatment technology to enhance water security the epa used funds to assist the nearly 8000 commun ity water systems that serve water to populations between 3300 and 100000 and are subject to the bioterrorism act for fy2005 the epa requested 5 million for state water security grants and 61 million for other critical infrastructure protection efforts including 2 million for the water information sharing and analysis center which shares sensitive security information with water syst ems the epa noted that th 213 million reduction reflected shift in priorities from assistance for vulnerability assessments in pl 108447 congress provided the requested amount the president requested 5 million for st ate water security grants for fy2006 the request also included 44 million for th water sentinel program the epa proposed this water security initiative in re sponse to its water security responsibilities under homeland security presidential directive hspd 7 consistent with the bioterrorism act hspd 7 designates the epa as the lead agency for water infrastructure security the goal of the wa ter sentinel initiative is to establish pilot early warning systems in several cities through water monitoring and surveillance forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33549crs15 20 see also crs report rl31294 safeguarding the nations drinking water the epa and congressional actions by mary tiemannchemical and biological cont aminants and to build the analytical capacity to support the surveillance program for this initiative the epas fy2006 appropriations act pl 10954 included 81 million after resc issions in hrept 10980 the house appropriations committee urged the epa to develop clear goals for the water sentinel program and jus tify the request more clearly for fy2007 congress also provided 5 million 493 after rescissions for state wa ter security grants the fy2007 budget request included 495 milli on for state water security grants the request again included significant amount 417 million for the water sentinel program 336 million more than congress provided for fy2006 the epa continued to argue that this program is an essential com ponent of its water security activities noting that its purpose is to demonstrate an effective contamination warning system that could be adopted by dri nking water utilities of various sizes20 the epa fy2007 funding bill hr 5386 as passed by the house would have provided 167 milli on or 25 million less than re quested for the water sentinel program the senate co mmittee would provide 1813 million which was 236 million less than requested but 10 million above the fy2006 enacted level the continuing resolution providing ppropriations for fy2007 through february 15 2007 pl 109383 hjres 102 generally provided funding for epa activities at the fy2006 level chemical facility security the issue that received most attention during the 109th congress concerned the security of chemical facilities located where terrorist attack could cause harm to n earby populations while the bioterrorism preparedness act required community water system s to conduct vulnerability assessment and prepare emergency response pl ans it did not require systems to make security upgrades to address any identified vulnerabilities key concern has been the onsite storage of hazardous gaseous chemicals such as chlorine that pose potential risks to local communities if released s 2855 w ould have amended sdwa to require community water system s to replace hazardous gaseous chemicals with inherently safer tec hnologies eg switching from the use of chlorine gas to liquid chlorine s 2855 also would have required the epa administrator to provide grants to highconsequence facilities for use in paying capital expenditures needed to make the transition to the use of inhere ntly safe technologies ist both s 1995 and s 2781 would have amended the clean water act to address security at wastewater treatment fac ilities s 2781 srept 109345 did not contain ist requirements broader chemical facility security bills also were offered in the 109th congress that had implications for water utilities these bills generally would have authorized the secretary of the department of homeland security dhs to regulate chemical facilities that pose certain risks including certain water treatme nt plants s 2145 as reported by the senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee srept 109332 and its companion bill hr 4999 w ould have directed the secretary of dhs to issue rules designating chemical facilities subject to regulation and to establish security performance standards that regulated facilities must meethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33549crs16 21 for detailed discussion of issues and legislation see crs report rl31530 chemical

shared several similar ities with s 2145 but woul d have exempted water facilities covered by the gislation from redundant requi rements such as conducting vulnerability assessments unless dhs determined that more stringent security requirements were needed s 2486 proposed to cover wi der range of facilities and established general duty to ensure that facilities are designed operated and maintained in safe manner the bill defined this obligation to include use of inherently safer technology to the max imum extent practicable hr 1562 would have required consultation between dhs and the epa and focused on stronger security and emergency planning measures rather than requiring changes in technology hr 2237 would have expanded the epas existing authority to oversee chemical facilities but would require consultation with dhs several water and local government organizations including the american water works association awwa sought exemptions from s 2145 and other bills that proposed to give dhs authority to regulate water utilitie s that use hazardous chemicals such as chlorine gas these stak eholders argued that the epa already has an established water security program and has been designated the lead agency for water infrastructure security in addition the awwa generally has opposed legislation that would requi re water utilities to switch treatment processes without considering specific utility circumstances and local water and climate characteristics others have argued that mandating the doption of safer technologies is warranted because of the potential risk that hazar dous chemicals and particularly gaseous chlorine may pose to communities21 the 109th congress included chemical facility security provision in the dhs fy2007 appropriations bill pl 109295 hr 5441 the provision authorized dhs to regulate for three years highrisk chemical facilities excluding drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities and facilities in ports the dhs is required to establish riskbased security performance standards for covered facilities and to require designated chemical facilities to prepare vulnerability ssessments and facility security plans small systems issues key sdwa issue has involved the fi nancial technical and managerial capacity of small systems to comply w ith sdwa regulations some 84 44000 of the nations 52800 community water syst ems are small serving 3300 persons or fewer and 57 30000 of the systems rve 500 persons or fewer many small systems face challenges in complying w ith sdwa rules and more fundamentally in ensuring the quality of water supplie s major problems include deteriorated infrastructure lack of access to capital limited customer and ra base inadequate rates diseconomies of scale and limited managerial and technical capabilities although these systems serve just 9 of the population served by community water systems the sheer number of small systems has created challenges for policymakershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33549crs17 in the earliest sdwa debates congress recognized that setting standards based on technologies affordable for large citie s could pose problems for small systems during the reauthorization debate lead ing up to the 1996 amendments policymakers gave considerable attention to the ques tion of how to help small systems improve their capacity to ensure consistent compliance with the sdwa the 1996 amendments added provisions aimed at achie ving this goal including requirement that states establish strategies to help systems develop and maintain the technical financial and managerial capacity to meet sdwa regulations congress also revised provisions on standardsetting 1412b variances 1415e and exemptions 1416 to increase considerati on of small system concerns small system variances since 1996 the sdwa has required the epa when issuing regulation to identify technolog ies that meet the standard and that are affordable for systems that serve populati ons of 10000 or fewer if the epa does not identify compliance technologies that are ffordable for these systems then the epa must identify small system varian ce technologies variance technology need not meet the standard but must pr otect public health states may grant variances to systems serving 3300 persons or fewer if syst em cannot afford to comply with rule through treatment an alternative source of water or other restructuring and if the system installs variance technology with epa approval states also may grant variances to systems serving between 3300 and 10000 people the epa has determined that affordable compliance technologies are available for all drinking water regulations promulga ted thus far consequently the agency has not identified any small system va riance technologies and small system variances have been available however several recent rules such as the arsenic and radium rules and the stage 2 disinfectants and disinfection by products rule dbp have caused growing concern that the epa is not using the tools congress provided in the 1996 amendments to help small syst ems comply with sdwa regulations as discussed below the epa currently is reevaluating its affordability criteria based on this reevaluation the epa may authorize states to grant small system variances for the stage 2 dbp which the epa published in january 2006 exemptions the acts exemption provisions also are intended to provide compliance flexibility in certain cases states or the epa may grant temporary exemptions from standard if due to certain compelling factors including cost system cannot comply on time for example all systems are required to comply with the new arsenic standard five years after its promulgation date an exemption would allow three more years for qualified syst ems small systems serving 3300 persons or fewer may be eligible for up to three additional 2year extensions for total exemption duration of 9 years and for total of up to 14 years to achieve compliance in the preamble to the arse nic rule published in january 2001the epa noted that exemptions will be an important tool to help states address the number of systems needing financial assistance to comply with this rule and other sdwa rules 66 federal register 6988 however because of th administrative burden to the state the exemption authority may not be widely used through 2004 13 states had indicated that they would use the exemptions process for the arsenic rule however because the exemption process is resourcein tensive for states it is unclear whether states will use this authority with much frequencyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33549crs18 22 for information on usda and other assi stance programs see crs report rl30478 federally supported water supply and wastewater treatment programs affordability issues and compliance prompted by intense debate over the revised arsenic standard and its potential cost to small communities the conference report for the epas fy2002 ppropriations hrept 107272 directed the epa to review its affordability criteria and how small system variance and exemption programs should be implemented for arsenic congre ss directed the epa to report on its affordability criteria administrative actions potential f unding mechanisms for small system compliance and possible legislative actions epas 2002 report to congress small systems arsenic implementation issues summarized actions the epa was undertaking to address these directives major activities included 1 reviewing the small system affordability criteria and variance process 2 developing small commun ity assistance plan to improve access to financial and technical assistance improve compliance capacity and simplify the use of exemptions and 3 implementing 20 million research and t echnical assistance strategy in 2002 the epa issued implementation guidance for the arsenic rule which includes guidance to help states grant exemptions the epa has offered technical assistance to small systems and has sponsored research on lowcost treatment technologies for ar senic also the epa is working with small communities to maximize loans and grants under sdwa and the us department of agriculture water infrastructure programs22 congress continued to express concern bout the cost of compliance with the arsenic rule the conference report for the consolidated appropriations act for fy2005 directed the epa to report to cong ress on the extent to which communities will be affected by the arsenic rule and to propose compliance lternatives and make recommendations to minimize compliance costs congress also provided 83 million for research on costeffectiv arsenic removal technologies in march 2006 the epa proposed three options for revising its affordability criteria for determining whether complia nce technology is unaffordable for small systems 71 federal register 10671 states could use the criteria to grant small system variances when system s cannot afford to comply with standard using the current criteria the epa considers t echnology affordable unless the average compliance cost exceeds 25 of the areas median household income to date the epa has determined that affo rdable technologies are availa ble for all standards the three proposed options are well below that level 025 050 and 075 in addition the revised criteria ar intended to address the i ssue of how to ensure that variance technology would be protective of public health the epa proposed that the final criteria would apply only to the recent stage 2 dbp and future rules during the 109th congress various bills were introduced to help small public water systems comply with the arsenic st andard and other rules the epas fy2007 funding bill as reported by the sena committee on appropriations hr 5386 srept 109275 would have required the epa to make available at least 11 million for small system compliance assist ance s 1400 water infrastructure
