division september 21 2006 abstract prior to 2004 the extraterritorial income eti provisions of the us tax code provided tax benefit for exporters eti like the foreign sales corporation fsc provisions they replaced was designed to boost us exports the european union eu however filed complaints with the world trade organization wto charging that eti and fsc were export subsidies and so violated the wto agreements in succession of rulings the wto upheld the eus charges and authorized the eu to levy retaliatory tariffs on us goods the eu began phasedin application of tariffs in march 2004 several policy options for the united states were proposed in congress including retaining eti and accepting whatever tariffs would be imposed overhauling the us method of taxing foreignsource income by adopting territorial tax system reforming the us tax system in general by adopting consumption tax similar to the valueadded taxes levied by european countries attempting negotiations with the eu and repealing the eti provisions while replacing them with tax cuts elsewhere the last of these approaches was ultimately taken by congress in october 2004 with the enactment of the american jobs creation act ajca pl 108357 although the eu lifted its tariffs in january 2005 it also lodged wto complaint against transition provisions in ajca which had the effect of rescinding the eti only gradually in certain cases in may 2006 provision of the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act pl 109222 repealed the transition rules apparently bringing an end to the longsimmering controversy order code

long simmering controversy the economics of the eti provisions to understand the implications of the various policy options that were considered it is useful to first look briefly at the basic economic effects of eti and its predecessor fsc the fsc provisions allowed us firms to exempt between 15 and 30 of export income from taxation eti provides tax benefit of roughly the same magnitude the tax benefits attract investment to the us export sector and as consequence us exports are probably higher than they would be without the provisions beyond this effect however traditional economic theory indicates that the export benefits produce set of effects that are perhaps surprising to noneconomists first because of exchange rate adjustments the fscetiinduced increase in exports is diminished and us imports congressional research service the library of congress crs2 also are increased sales of us importcompeting industries thus fall economic theory indicates that although the provisions thus increase the overall level of us trade they do not change the balance of trade1 this result is perhaps better seen by stepping back from the exchange rate adjustments and recognizing that when country runs trade deficit it is using more goods and services than it produces to finance these purchases it must necessarily borrow from abroad by importing more foreign investment than it exports countrys trade deficit in other words is matched by deficit on capital account investment outflows minus investment inflows and countrys trade balance changes only if the balance on capital account changes thus if we assume that the export benefits do not change the balance on capital account they cannot change the trade balance2 perhaps more importantly the export benefits also affect us economic welfare traditional economic analysis indicates that they reduce overall us economic welfare because at least part of the tax benefit is passed on to foreign consumers in the form of lower prices this price reduction can be viewed as transfer of economic welfare from us taxpayers in general to foreign consumers these effects however are probably httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21143 quite small according to crs estimates based on 1996 data fsc increased the quantity of us exports by range of 2tenths of 1 to 4tenths of 1 and increased the quantity of imports by range of 2tenths of 1 to 3tenths of 1 the shift of economic welfare to foreign consumers is equal to an estimated 1tenth of 1 of exports the impact on the trade balance was probably negligible fscs cost in terms of forgone tax revenues is estimated by the joint committee on taxation at 27 billion for fy2000 the eti provisions were estimated to reduce revenue by between 300 million and 400 million per year beyond the cost of fsc if economic analysts are generally critical of tax benefits like fsc and eti support for them can be found in the business community reason for the divergence in views may be perspectives economic analysis looks at the benefits impact from the perspective of the economy as whole attempting to account for their full range of effects and adjustments in all markets supporters of the provision however are frequently businessmen whose exporting firms would likely face declining sales profits and employment if provisions were to be eliminated for economists there is denying that fsc and eti boost employment and increase incomes in certain sectors of the economy but they also result in contraction of other parts for example firms that compete with imports and transfer economic welfare to foreign consumers fsc and the eti provisions have also been defended on the grounds that they counter subsidies provided to foreign producers by their own governments purported subsidy that is sometimes cited is the practice among european and other countries of 1 for detailed analysis see crs report rl30684 the foreign sales corporation fsc tax benefit for exporting wto issues and an economic analysis by david l brumbaugh 2 eti probably reduces the net flow of us investment abroad by definition an export incentive encourages only domestic investment since exports cannot be produced abroad also if etis reduction in tax revenues is not offset by higher taxes elsewhere then the provisions likely increase the us federal budget deficit and drive up real interest rates attracting capital to the united states thus when capital flows are considered eti may increase the trade deficit crs3 rebating the valueadded taxes vats that would otherwise apply to export sales however from an economic perspective such border adjustments do not distort trade as described above the trade balance changes only when capital flows change and border adjustments by themselves have impact on capital flows exchange rate adjustments neutralize any impact they might otherwise have on the balance of trade policy options retaining eti one option suggested by some was to do nothing the united states could leave the eti provisions in place and face the eus tariffs to roughly gauge the size of tariffs impact note that total us exports to the eu were 1651 billion in 2000 the 4 billion in wtoauthorized tariffs is thus 24 of the value of exports to the eu level of tariffs that might be characterized as small but noticeable but even this gauge of the tariffs likely impact is likely too high the tariffs might diminish us exports to the eu but as with eti and fsc exchange rate adjustments would occur that would mitigate the tariffs impact the overall level of trade would shrink but as with eti and fsc there would be change in the trade balance httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21143 the impact of the tariffs on us economic welfare is uncertain but likely to be small in isolation imposition of tariff could reduce us welfare by effecting transfer from us exporters to foreign countries and by shrinking the level of trade below its most efficient level however the tariffs would not be enacted in isolation they would supplement the eti export tax benefit that as described above inefficiently expands the level of trade and transfers welfare to foreign consumers thus tariffs may mitigate part of the adverse welfare effects of eti but compound others if us economic welfare in general might not be substantially effected by the tariffs there would still be winners and losers given the shrinkage of the us export sector some us exporting firms and their employees could be expected to be adversely affected at the same time us industries that compete with foreign imports would likely indirectly benefit from the tariffs the size of these welfare effects however would probably be quite small but acceptance of tariffs might also lead to worsening of trade relations in general with the eu and reduction in the economic gains that accompanies the free flow of trade3 repealing eti second alternative was to repeal eti but make other basic changes in the us tax system as with tariffs this would trigger exchange rate effects that would result in contraction of trade both of imports and exports in this scenario employment in export industries would likely fall compared to what would otherwise occur and employment would increase in industries that compete with imports also existing stockholders and owners of export firms would likely incur windfall loss as the value of their holdings decline from what would otherwise occur employees of etiusing firms would also likely be made worse off as their employers shrink and reduce their employment however other sectors of the economy would expand as the export sector shrinks owners of firms in those sectors for example the importcompeting sector of the economy would register windfall gains in the aggregate and in the long run the gains to the economy from etis repeal would outweigh the welfare losses and 3 for further information on the imposition of tariffs see crs report rs21742 european trade retaliation the fsceti case by raymond j ahearn crs4 overall us economic welfare would be increased this would be mirror of the adverse welfare effects of eti outlined above provide alternative tax benefits transition effects were concern regarding etis repeal there was the possibility of loss of jobs among the affected exporting firms and windfall losses by stockholders these transition effects could be offset by transition relief for example phasedout reduction in taxes linked to firms past eti or foreign sales corporation benefit such provisions could structured so as to be infra marginal that is they would be based on exporters past behavior not their future level of exports for example tax benefit could be provided whose size would be dependent on the average level of exports over specific period in the past such benefits would not be export subsidies in substantive terms eu officials however have stated that they would object to an eti repeal that includes transition period indeed upon approval in october 2004 of an eti measure including transition provisions the eu lodged complaint with the wto another type of alternative tax benefit is one that would be heavily used by firms that used eti but is not linked to exports this is the option that was in fact contained in httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21143 pl 108357 for example firms that use eti necessarily invest in domestic production such investment is by definition necessary to produce exports accordingly such firms would likely find tax benefit linked with domestic investment in general attractive here however the tax benefits link with exports is severed by making the benefit available beyond just the export sector leading to either large tax revenue loss or benefit smaller than eti on firmbyfirm basis in 2002 chairman william thomas of the house ways and means committee introduced bill hr 5095 that would simultaneously repeal the eti provisions and provide range of tax reductions for foreignsource income in doing so the bill took the approach of addressing competitiveness issues related to overseas business operations while repealing the export benefit there was some lack of congruity however between firms who use eti and those whose foreign operations would receive tax cuts the bill was not considered by the full house before the 107th congress adjourned in the 108th congress representatives crane and rangel and senator hollings introduced hr 1769s 970 which proposed to phase out eti while phasingin tax deduction linked with income from domestic but not foreign production representative thomas introduced hr 2896 proposal that is similar to his earlier proposal but with the addition of several domestic investment incentives in the senate s 1475 hatch also proposed to replace eti with mix of tax benefits for overseas and domestic investment in october 2003 the house ways and means committee approved somewhat modified version of hr 2896 and the senate finance committee approved s 1637 containing different mix of tax benefits for overseas and domestic investment several other senate bills proposed to repeal eti while adopting tax benefits exclusively for domestic investment these included s 1688 rockefeller s 1922 smith and breaux and s 1964 stabenow the full senate approved slightly modified version of the finance committee bill on may 11 2004 on june 17 the full house approved hr 4520 modified version of hr 2896 conference agreement reconciling the house and senate measures was approved in october and became pl 108357 crs5 territorial taxation there are two basic ways country can define its tax jurisdiction in an international setting first it can assert the right to tax on the basis of residence and the right to tax its citizens and residents on their income regardless of where it is earned alternatively country can define its tax jurisdiction on the basis of territory or the geographic source of income and tax only income earned within its borders under territorial tax system countrys taxes stop at the border the foreign source income of the countrys citizens and residents is free of homecountry taxes the current us tax system is generally based on residence absent special exemptions individuals who are us residents and corporations that are chartered in the united states are subject to us tax on their worldwide income in contrast several european countries such as france the netherlands and in some circumstances germany have territorial systems some have argued that the united states could resolve the fsceti controversy and still maintain favorable tax treatment for exports by adopting territorial system of taxation and exempting foreignsource income from us tax indeed the designers of the eti provisions have argued that because us exporters can use the eti benefit to exempt certain amount of income from foreign operations from tax the eti provisions are in fact territorial and hence do not violate the wto httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21143 agreements the wto rulings however held otherwise the likely impact of territorial system on exports is uncertain if territorial system is to provide tax benefit for exporting at least part of export income must be assigned foreign rather than domestic source for tax purposes and international norms for determining the source of income may pose problems for allocating export income to foreign sources the internationally accepted method of determining the source of income is arms length pricing which divides income by assigning hypothetical prices to transactions between different parts of the same firm the prices that are assigned are those that would apply if the parts of the firm were unrelated under arms length pricing income from exports would possibly be required to be allocated to the part of firm that adds value to an export and thus little if any export income would be allocated to firms foreign branches or subsidiaries thus little export income would be exempt under territorial system unless income allocation rules that depart from arms length pricing were adopted given this requirement the debate over export subsidies might shift to controversies about methods for allocating income and arms length pricing adoption of territorial system has implications beyond exports depending on the particular form territorial system takes it might increase the tax incentive for us firms to invest abroad rather than the united states an incentive that would potentially reduce economic efficiency and us economic welfare at the same time at least one analysis has found that if some restrictions on interest tax deductions are enacted along with territorial system capital would actually flow into the united states from abroad4 consumption taxes the topic of consumption taxes arose in the fsceti controversy in the form of debate over the valueadded taxes vats form of consumption tax widely used in europe and elsewhere the us export benefits have occasionally been defended on the grounds that they counter tax subsidies inherent in the 4 harry grubert and john mutti taxing international business income dividend exemption versus the current system washington american enterprise institute 2001 67 pp crs6 practice among vatimposing countries of rebating the vat that would otherwise apply to their countries export sales the rebates work as follows under vat tax is generally applied at each stage of production to the valueadded by that particular stage when firm in vatimposing country makes an export sale it receives rebate of all the vat that has been paid with respect to the good at every level of production at the same time when vatimposing country imports an item it generally applies its vat to the full value of the import economists have long held that such border adjustments do not in fact help country improve its balance of trade in manner similar to the exchange rate adjustments that occur in response to eti and fsc exchange rate adjustments mitigate any increase the rebates may cause in the exports while at the same time causing an increase in imports while vatimposing countries rebate the tax on exports they also impose it on imports in manner that mirrors the exchange rate effects of the export tax rebates the imposition of vat on imports in isolation causes improvement in the balance of trade but reduces exports and imports alike in fact when the combined impact of export taxrebates and the imposition of vat on imports can be considered roughly offsetting assuming the vat applies at the same rate to all commodities as httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21143 consequence the distorting impact of the vat on trade is generally small consumption tax may affect the balance of trade through its impact on capital flows if consumption tax triggers capital inflows the us trade deficit would increase if it causes net capital outflow the deficit would shrink the impact of consumption tax on capital flows however is uncertain there would likely be net inflow to the united states of equity capital in response to the lower business tax burden on the other hand debtfinanced investment would not be taxfavored as under current law it would longer be deductible there may as result be net outflow of debt5 in any event as with adopting territorial system the impact of adopting consumption tax would be considerably broader than any effect it may have on exports and imports much of the debate over the economic effects of replacing the current tax system with consumption tax has centered on its impact on tax fairness in general and longrun economic growth negotiations some suggested that an alternative approach to the eti dispute might be negotiations while others argued that such an approach would trigger the eus retaliatory tariffs it might also be pointed out that negotiated settlement could not be strictly bilateral between the eu and the united states given the wto panel rulings other countries might file successful complaints against eti even if settlement is reached between the eu and the united states accordingly longrun negotiated solution would probably have to include an alteration of the wto rules themselves 5 harry grubert and t scott newlon taxing consumption in global economy washington american enterprise
