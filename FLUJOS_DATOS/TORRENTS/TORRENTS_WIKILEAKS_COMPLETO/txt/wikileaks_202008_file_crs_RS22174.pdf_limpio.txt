enforcement of consent decree is necessary to uphold federal right moreover unless the court rules on the motion to vacate within 90da period the consent decree would lapse and defendants would not be bound til contrary decision is ma the appointment of any special master to oversee the decree would expire at the same time first the bill is not apparently intended to prevent the formation of new agreements or consent decrees but to end judicial pervision of all decrees after statutorily mandated period but the dur ational limitation raises host of potential legal and practical considerations first it could be argued the bill may discourage plaintiffs from entering such decrees in favor of seeking l onger term more effective relief through costly and timeconsuming litigation moreover because consent decrees are often entered without the formal presentation of evidence or judicial findings on the merits of the underlying claim it may be difficult for plainti ffs to prove that the decree is still needed unless the court decides the motion to vacate w ithin 90 days the state or locality is longer bound by its terms until there is ruling in plaintiffs favor thus by placing the necessity burden very strict legal sta ndard on the decrees advocates and requiring judicial action within short time frame the bill could result in termination of substantial number of outstanding decrees under current practice the burden is on the party seeking termination of modification of the decree usually the state or local defendants to prove necessity as one observer has noted it will be unusual for plaintiffs to be ab to produce proof of the ongoing need for the decree when the defendants later move to have it vacated but if the defendant has taken the time to ask the court to vacate the consent decree it is fair assumption that the defendant wishes to do something that the decree does not allow that assumption however is not proof and plaintiffs will be at terrible disadvantage if they are forced to prove anew often years ter what they were about to prove in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22174crs3 1 see hitov steve memorandum for the nationa l health law program

not the bill would create situation in which many consent decrees against state or local defe ndant will in fact expire either at the change of administrations or after four years1 in such cases whether the consent decree was enacted before or after the bills enactment class plaintiffs would have to relitigate the matter to obtain any further relief they considered necessary faced with this dilemma plaintiffs may attempt to steer state and local officials toward alternative private agreements unanimous 2004 ruling by the supreme court in frew v hawkins 2 added judicial gloss to current federal consent decree pro cedures that may inte rest both proponents and opponents of proposed bills the consent decree in frew resolved suit against the state of texas for violating condition of state pa rticipation in medicaid that the state carry out program of early periodic screening diagnosis and treatment comprehensive plan for implementing the required program was ordered that was much more specific than the statutory mandate itself the fifth circuit found that the violations of the decree were not violations of the fede ral statute and that in the ab sence of violation of federal law the district court lacked juri sdiction to remedy the violations in brief opinion authored by justice ke nnedy the supreme court reversed holding that the eleventh amendment does not preclude enforcement of consent decree entered into by state officials even if that decr ee imposes obligations not otherwise specifically required by federal law first the court noted that the texa s officials did not contend that the terms of the consent decree were inconsistent with ex parte young 3 which permits suits for prospective injunctive relief against state officials who violate federal law or that the terms of the decree did not protect legitimate federal interests despite imposing specific obligations not found in the statute itself the court concluded that the decree reflected choice among various ways that state could implement the medicaid act accordingly the decree to be enforced remedy the state officials themselves had accepted was federal decree entered to implement federal statute and its enforcement did not violate the eleventh am endment as justice kennedy explained federal courts are not reduced to approving consent decrees and hoping for compliance once entered consent decree may be enforced the courts decision in frew emphasizes that public officials who enter into court approved consent decrees to ttle disputes under federal w may be required to comply with the terms of those decrees even if they impose specific obligations not found in federal law at the same time however the opinion admonished federal judges against rigid adherence to decrees not suited to cont emporary needs and to be more flexible when responding to requests for modification the federal court must exercise its equita ble powers to ensure that when the objects of the decree have been attained responsib ility for discharging the states obligationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22174crs4 4 540 us at 541 5 see richard j costa the prison litigation reform act of 1995

deciding how best to discharge their governmental responsibilitie s state in the ordinary course depends on successor officials both appointed and elected to bring new insights and solutions to problems of allocating revenues and resources the basic obligations of federal law may remain the same but the precise manner of their discharge may not if the state establishes reason to modify the decree the court should make necessary changes where it has not done so however the decree should be enforced according to its terms4 thus while frew provides impetus for litigation to reform state and local social programs it also counsels restraint when in truding on the policy making prerogatives of state and local elected officials unless necessary to safeguard federally protected rights whatever the outcome of the political debate prefigured by frew it seems largely settled that congress has authority to act on the subject thus the federal consent decree fairness act continues trend of legi slation to constrain the authority of the federal courts to grant remedi relief in various areas for example in 1996 congress enacted the prison litigation reform act plra after the federal courts had already issued consent decrees covering the administration of prisons in more than 30 states5 the prla mandated termination of outstanding decrees unless the federal courts that issued them finds that they are narrowly tailored and necessary to correct current and ongoing violation of the federal right6 under an automatic stay clause judge has 30 days to make written findings to this effect or else the motion to terminate automatically stays the relief7 in the telecommunications act that same year congress terminated the prospective effect of three prior consent decrees by providing that any conduct or activity that was before the date of enactment of the act subject to any restriction or obligation imposed by any of the decrees would after the act be subject to the restriction and obligations imposed by the new act8 congress power to establish nd ordain the lower federal courts9 includes authority to set standards and procedures for review of cases provided that the legislature does not usurp or interfere with article iii judicial prerogatives in violation of the separation of powers early circuit court rulings were divided over whether the plra termination provisions violated the separati on of powers as impermissible legislativehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22174crs5 10 compare eg hadix v johnson 133 f3d 940 6th cir 1998per curiamplra termination provision

judiciary10 any doubts on that score were settled however when the supreme court decided french v miller in 200011 in miller the seventh circuit had affirmed remedial order finding eighth amendment violations and imposing capacity limits rules about the use of mechanical restraints staffing standards food and medical services with minor modifications the injunction remained in effect until 1997 when the state filed motion to terminate the relief under the plra plaintiffs moved for temporary restraining order to enjoin the automatic stay citing both due process and separation of powers principles ultimately the stay provision was found to violate the separation of powers by the seventh circuit which did not address the plaintiffs due pro cess claims fivemember majority of the supreme court however disagreed with th seventh circuit nd upheld the automatic stay remanding the case for termination proceedings the majority was led by justice oconnor who emphasized that pr ospective relief is subject to changes in substantive law because it lacks the finality of compensato ry relief the automatic stay helps to implement the change in the law but it did not dictate how the courts must rule on each motion however some concer n was expressed by the court for the relative brevity of the time limit for judges to rule on the termination motion before relief is automatically stayed whether the time limit is so short that it deprives litigants of meaningful opportunity to be heard is due process ques tion an issue that is not before us we leave open therefore the question whether the time limit particularly in complex case may implicate due process concerns12 as dicta the open question is not central to the miller holding but does suggest that overly short time limits could meet judicial objection the federal consent decree fairness act is distinctive of course for the generality of its reach covering ll federal civil and civil ri ghts litigation except for school desegregation in contrast to earlier laws which are limited to discrete subject areas but after miller the prerogative of states and localitie s to move under the bill for termination of prospective relief appear s fairly wellestablished
