bridge enewsletter lrhs congress lectures date we can do something about it i dont think theres been time when culture at large was more accomplished technically and more stupid socially than the world culture were living in at this moment do you know that practically every dogooder organizations practically folded up did you realize that there are very few organizations activities or groups in the world today that are going ahead circulating around and trying to keep the show on the road and there is organization on earth today except ourselves who can do something about it and doesnt that saddle us with an interesting responsibility but for the sake all the way up the dynamics all the way up the dynamics our own sake and the sake of the family and the sake of the group and the sake of mankind and the sake of life and so forth all the way up the dynamics as we go the only wrong action we could take at this time is to do nothing we have the knowhow to do something about it excerpted from the theta clear congress lectures the cycle of our civilization an article by l ron hubbard from the theta clear congress lectures factually its very interesting how many civilizations there have been that have gone up in smoke and you should also be aware of this interesting fact that they all go up in smoke just about the same way this ones going up in smoke and they have been for some time they do an interesting job of smoking should be signs around on these planets saying smoking now the general the general situation on the whole track has been dwindling spiral and it keeps dwindling and dwindling and dwindling these moments of springup of civilization and its expression in some kind of mechanical culture are more and more rapid in other words we get culture built much more quickly these days because everybody starts remembering things that he has told himself he mustnt remember because its so painful and thats why nuclear physicists are in such bad shape theyre trying desperately to remember things which they have carefully blotted out with nice somatics so it wont happen again and then theyre obsessively remembering and doing the things which they have to do that they know very well theyd better not do and it cripples them up pretty badly because of the game of they shouldnt have done it they would have done it and so forth but for instance i dont think im stringing you fairy tale but there was couple of hundred thousand years ago planet not too distant from this planet but in another system which had almost exactly the same civilization as this planet almost exactly it had the same brownstone fronts it had the same fire engines the airplanes had just little bit bigger cockpits they had battleships and finally the battleships started firing electronic weapons and so forth the battleships looked just the same and they had war that looked amazingly like world war ii only trouble was right there toward the end of that war somebody developed an abomb and then the war kind of fizzled out for little while and it remained under cover and then somebody got mad at somebody else and some pete somewhere never having been able to make his postulates stick and being very sick indeed said well ill get even for all the times that mabel and bill and joe have been abusing and he pushed the button and that was the end of that society it was quite an interesting society if you trace back on some of your pcs or if you trace back on the track you may have come through the society on that route but everything got developed here with great rapidity because all they were doing was doing duplication of what they had in that society and its perfectly true what these fellows were saying mechanically scientist is always saying its all been thought of before well he shouldnt say that everything has been thought of before but certainly its true that most of the gimmicks the washing machines refrigerators electronic weapons and all this sort of thing that he is now building are just about as new as model ts see hes even using the same designs now im not trying to sell you anything on the idea of past life i dont know why youd have to sell anybody on the idea that he was himself but i will tell you that there have been awful long periods between the blowup and the next culture theres nothing to work with and nothing to do nobody to talk to you even get such things as genetic lines going where youre picking up clams and birds and anything come on up the track and make some kind of blueprint so as to excuse it when you finally start mocking up human bodies when you start tracking somebody on the genetic line make awful sure which time which sequence of beach waitontheedgeof you are spotting because theyve done it and theyve done it and theyve done it and theyve done it and they build it all up blow it all up then what wall what planet and then gradually get in start to build life forms somehow or other get it worked up to some kind of level get it speeded up and so forth blow it up and here we go again this is cycle of action that has been going on here for some time l ron hubbard excerpted from the lecture how to conduct an has coaudit and why this lecture is available in the theta clear congress lectures successes from listening to the congress lectures i am listening to the theta clear congress and lrh explains lot about bodies what happens when they are ill and how to be cause over that happening as result of having this datum as well as others in the lecture i was able to help someone lot i have also found that by listening to this congress my understanding of others has increased tremendously i am so glad to be applying what i learn bd listening to lrh is the best session i have ever had and the best session i could ever get i realized that there is tech and i see the track of how it came to be addressing the physical universe with auditing is vital as it is part of the eight dynamics and by doing so you gain greater stability another win i had was listening to the group processing lrh made realize that you have to get in comm with the physical universe so you can survive we can do something about it the cycle of our civilization theta clear congress successes from the congress lectures theta clear congress survive or succumb to go on living requires that one penetrate the mysteries which are making him back up and the greatest of those mysteries is the mystery of should i survive or should i succumb l ron hubbard from the theta clear congress an experiment that riveted the world eighteenfoot tomato plants and cucumbers the size of watermelons made global headlines but what those newspapers knew wasnt even half of the epic saga surrounding rons greenhouse plant experiments and breakthrough concerning life itself how the fundamental postulates of survive and succumb interplay in life and result in the game called victim in the wake of that breakthrough came further discoveries revealing the basic reasons for beings postulates of selfdestruction and their solution communication processes sweeping the track clean of core aberrations moreover heres where application took on fully massive dimension with the announcement of new type of auditing enabling one auditor to handle hundreds or even thousands of preclears at time its the means to broad scale clearing and planetary salvation and yet matter the magnitude of these developments standing behind them was something far greater for here is the historic congress where ron
