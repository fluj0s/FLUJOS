certifications and classifications lecture given on 3 december 1963 well im glad youre still alive report ive gotten on your auditing lately i wonder but thats i wonder you must have done something terrible to look that guilty when i said that all right whats the date here audience december 3rd whats the date audience 3rd december three december ad 13 saint hill special briefing course we have lecture here on these new certificate and classification changes and so on give you the rundown on this you might be quite interested in this tomorrow we will get demonstration of session that i taped of finding pt gpm and i will go over that with you over tv but today i want to talk to you about some administrative matters which also have bearing on technical all right now you have received or are about to see hco policy letter of november 26 1963 which isprobably be the first of many policy letters on this particular subject but which lays out the basic format of classification and auditing requirements for individuals first id like to give you the trpardon the scientology zero on this of why is this done why is this done we have to go back in actual fact here more than thirteen years to the original activity which sent dianetics forward in the community and in the society and the original method of dissemination which was intensely and extremely successful was simply getting some chaps around who quote wanted to be audited who quote had troubles and so forth and giving them some training supervised their coaudit and took money from them only for those sessions which were patchup sessions and nominal amount of money for supervising their coaudit that was actually the first method of dissemination along with this went hectographed edition of the original thesis which was the only textbook at that particular time 1949 and the textbook was actually not sold but was distributed by somebody making mimeograph copy of it and giving it to his friends and i dont know how far that book went and i dont know but what it isnt still going today of course we would never hear of it because all the addresses are closed on the lines and so forth that was the original thesis now the system there and this isthis was operating you understandthe system there was simply to get joe and bill and pete who wanted processinghad heard of this new thing and were interested in it and my statement well if you want some then you had better put the nose to the grindstone and study this over little bit and ill show you how to do this and then you three can form up coaudit of various lines and so forth and you make sure that youre here every weekend and we straighten all this out for you and then their complaints thattheir complaints about pete you see who at this time was flubbing little bit he wasnt giving as much auditing as he was getting you see and that sort of thing and somebodys effort then to get somebody else into this unit and the unit was up to six or eight before you could sneeze dont you see and finally somebody came along who was as clumsy as pete that could get paired off with pete dont you see and this sort of thing was carried forward in actual fact although the auditing was terribly clumsy and we didnt have the technology which we have today shadow of it practically although the auditing was terribly clumsy some rather fantastic things occurred with cases now when theyd get too bogged down one of these teams would get too bogged down or something like that well of course theyd call on to give them session so id sell them session and actually i dont think i ever really took any money off of them but they used to push money at and so forth because i was not at that particular time interested in any income but i know there was money there and on several different occasions i had to turn down 800 and 1500 and if you will just audit straight through to clear now and do nothing else so i dont have to co audit i will give you 3000 and immy saying well you can just put it back in your pocket because youre just getting along fine with joe and you just make up your mind to keep going you get this kind of an approach very successful extremely successful well when the foundations were formed they were formed not at my instigation but it all seemed like good idea good roads and good weathers and they got into big organizational this that and the other thing and there were an awful lot of people in charge and i guess there were more bosses around there than you could easily count and there were many different schools of technology operating and i remember old joe winter going around telling everybody that you had to believe in it for it to work auditingthere was nothing scientific about auditing actually it was merely an art you know this is all fine that was dear old joe ah this kind of thing dont you see youd give lecture and then you would find out that that didnt apply to whatthe session was going on immediately afterwards well they started training on the basis of just letting somebody hang around for month to see what was going on that was the first training course and parker i think dreamed that up and old parker saidi remember coming down one morning and parker said to well ivethese people keep walking up to the front door they want to be trained so ive finally arranged for this to happen and i charge them 500 to hang around pretty wild but the academy developed out of that particular activity that first group by the way was group of ten auditors they were pretty well trained but they were trained to audit others and they were not trained particularly to coaudit i remember teaching them old straightwire how to pick up psychosomatics and so forth off people and most of those fellows could do it their auditing was clever rather than otherwise auditors of that day were not badly trained but along with this came the same fault that the individual auditor runs into and that is people wanted processing and they wanted processing exclusively and only they didnt want to audit anybody they wanted to be processed now let call this to your attention as very terrible and destructive action let call this to your attention in that wise now weve always thought of this as thats good thing he wants processing and i suddenly tell you that thats destructive action haha imlet make my point now supposing id taken this fellows 3000 and id neglected the rest of the group and id just sat down and audited this fellow day and night supposing i had done that well what would have happened to the rest of the group hmm i can see an individual now an hca something like that and hes developed himself group of ten or twelve and hes got these people going forward very nicely and all of sudden mrs gotbucks from poughkeepsie shows up and flashes lot of green under his nose and he sits down to grind it out and so forth and earn this money hes going along all right but then her husband gets orders to saigon or something of the sort and she disappears out of his perimeter what is he immediately and instantly at that moment confronting he has dropped all of his dissemination hes dropped this group hes not paying attention to the eager beavers that wanted to outflow this stuff hes paying attention just to somebody that wanted to inflow it and nothing else he didnt get any dissemination in the area then did he he neglected the fellows who were keeping it whizzing and the net result is when her husband gets orders to saigon there goes his quote practice unquote and that is the end of that see so he says then well ive got failure on my hands im not doing well as an auditor actually it was not failure as an auditor it was failure in dissemination because he didnt use his best dissemination activities in order to keep himself going that is to say he wasnt taking people and making them coaudit and making them help each other and supervising it and making income off of this action and making income also on the inevitable patchup sessions now let assure you that if you want lots of processing to do youll get lots of coauditing going let make that point with an exclamation point you actually dont get any auditing to amount to anything if coauditing activity isnt going as soon as coauditing activity ceases and as soon as the individual swings in on just auditing one person everything hes doing goes up in smoke ahha but the central organizations of 1950 made that mistake although they had lots of students and so forth they went into the processing business and everybody they processed who wanted only processing and who didnt want to give anything for it introverted and you get this the preclear doesnt disseminate the purely preclear person doesnt disseminate ever you take this old boys long arduous experience in this particular field man you cured this guys migraine spooziks you know and he can actually now do fifteen chinups you see and everything is marvelous you see and you say well isnt that interesting therefore one of his family members or somebody like that ought to come over and get some processing that is the fond hope that you might have in this particular direction but his family members rarely appear oh sometimes why that person never mentions it that is about the wildest thing if youve done something wrong to them though they mention it but that is the phenomenonthis is forced on us in technical capacitythats the phenomenon of negative gain that he has had lumbosis has bearing on the situation its now gone so it doesnt worry him and if youve done thorough job of erasing it he never mentions it because its gone negative gain everything you do with case is negative gain its the eradication of something wrong and if its eradicated properly of course the fellow then never has anything to say about it he just feels better and everything is going along so that purely processing activities over the vast span of years have producedthey of course have produced some but they have produced minimal dissemination and just as the individual auditorjust as the individual auditor who formed up few people and he had them coauditingyou see you dont have to have big dress parade situation theres this fellow down at the garage and then theres librarian and then theres somebody who teaches in the kindergarten and thats perfectly representative group because if they start coauditing youre going to have two or three more drift in and then some of those fellows are going to drift out and youre going to get some more in your group has gradual even growth and tends to maintain itself unless you suddenly withdraw all your attention from that group and put it on one preclear or two preclears do you see all right just as fellow breaks his practice to pieces by knocking down his dissemination activities in that fashion seeconcentrating it on preclear who rarely disseminates people who coaudit disseminate see central organization can do the same thing they get so interested in their hgc income they never bother to make any scientologists now i shouldnt do this because this has nothing whatsoever to do with what im its on line that was privileged line and its all very secret but an assoc sec very recently reading the first info letter which inferred that hgcs would be cut outit just inferred this dont you seewas holding his head in his hands how was he going to keep his organization running if he didnt have an hgc because his hgc was his mainstay his hgc was his main income and he was suddenly confronting the problem of how was he going to keep his finances up how was he going to keep anything going at all because it seemed to be so terrible because his student income was so low you see central organization can do the exact same thing that private auditor can do now look if you hadif central organization really crowded them out we tried to do this down in angeles and they never got the word thats city over on the pacific coast of country on the other side of the atlantic they never got the word ive tried to give them outside private processing activities you see well let assure you that in the absence of these things you get minimal pcs too there is just nothing like good broad brawling coaudit activities going on all over the place regardless of how hard it was to promote them or how hard to keep them in line or how many tenphone calls these are quite wild to handle they sort of discourage you from handling them because youve got phone call at two oclock in the morning the guy cant end his session dont you see and so forth what do i do and various processes in the old days ive had some remarkable phone calls at some remarkable hours of the night one of the most remarkable is one time they couldnt get preclear down off the ceiling of the room and there were four pro auditors present and she had exteriorized and splatted up against the ceiling and they couldnt get her off the ceiling and so they held the telephone to her ear and i talked her off the ceiling back into her body so i well agree that the randomity of this type of activity is considerable you cant sit back in an ivory tower with lot of co auditing going on and some of the most remarkable goofs occur theyre incredible theyre unbelievable but you do sort of d of p action on these things you keep them going one way or the other you try to hold it down but those peoplethose people will get themselves wrapped around telegraph poles if youre speaking in terms of purely commercial auditing see and central organization would have three times the pcs if they had thousand coaudit teams running in that part of the state theyd have three times the pcsjust casualty rate have to straighten them up you know i know thats awfully coldblooded but it happens to be ifthe people are going to say well we mustnt disseminate or coaudit because its going to hurt the income of the organization see well lets counter with this coldblooded an activity what do you mean the income of the organization you got to have coaudit teams going to create enough casualties to keep you solvent youll find as private auditor that youre always being called on for emergency and people forget to pay you for this sort of thing and that sort of thing but you give them good understanding if you have to give an assist or put somebody together and give them special sessions and so forth the rate is soandso youll still come out all right with it as long as youve got coauditing going unless man you see there are tremendous technicaltechnical data associated with this were now speaking from the security ofand this whole policy letter by the way is erected from the security of technical information its the technology rounded out completed to ot that is making it possible now to lay down these various lines and say about what the score is because its forced off on us like this youll find that the individual who is engaged in helping somebody else while he is being helped gets extroverted and introverted with regard to his case he extroverts and introverts youll get somebody being audited during the week all week long this person is being audited and youll find out theyre very introverted during that week you see its all what theyre doing and so forth its very hard on the auditor meeting them at lunch you know they sit there and continue the session you know that sort of thing next week first day or so they dont really see how they can make it see theyve got to put their attention now on somebody else they got to pay for it they got to help somebody else an awareness of another being takes place at this particular line and they start extroverting and along about wednesday thursday friday and so forth theyre so extroverted that its not terribly vital theyre not going to die in the next five minutes if they dont get audited you see of course it can occur that something has gone wrong in the session that theyve been wrapped around telegraph pole and nobody patched it up left them in an arc break but normal course of existence is that theyreby wednesday of their processing activityare in rather extroverted frame of mind with regard to their case dont you see youve got an extroversion taking place here theyre looking outward when they get audited they look inward when they audit they look outward and youve got out and in with regard to cases and youve got an understanding of life going forward and for the first time it gets off the first dynamic and starts moving up onto the higher dynamics and life is an activity of multiple dynamics not an activity of first dynamic so technicallytechnically the individual is in far better frame of mind with regard to life when he is doing some auditing and getting audited as an activity this is by actual experience on the thing i think it agrees with your own experience along this line even though its very tough sometimes to bail out when youre in the middle of something and then audit somebody else now the nextthe next point here however is that an individual can only progress so far without an increase of understanding now previously we said it was good thing if somebody was clear to became ot that he should be trained well thats totally reversed now should be good thing noits nothing like that hell never make it unless hes trained now you can talk all you want to about the scientologist being rough case and so forth hes just being run on rougher things thats about all you couldnt get anybody else to run on this thing of course the fat the amount of charge that exists on the case that can be bled off easily starts getting bled off by the very easy processes now lets take look at the schedule of processing here very easy processes this is listenstyle guy discusses his ptp and he feels better about it see see lots of fat there and you can bleed charge off like mad but you have to do it more expertly after while and it requires repetitive process or the cchs or straightwire or overtwithholds or something like that to pick him up why youre coming to the bones of the case now of course this fellow in his original state to the amount of better off he is is in comparison to how bad off he is and of course hes just walking lightning bolt as far as charge is concerned hes just fat with charge and he is so bad off that bleeding any charge on the case at all makes him better but what is better see he doesnt scream with his headache you see its betterment in relationship to the worsement that the case is in dont you see all right we have this fellow feeling pretty good here at level ii and it takes repetitive processes of which there were innumerable wordings and processes it takes something like that to bite but it takes different kind of auditing this guy can longer wind upand i notice some of you characters doing that this day you think this characters going to go forever on selfaudit called itsa and so forth nah aint going to do it that is not going to happen see now it takes formal auditing do birds fly see recallrecall wreck thank you it takes the impingement the pound dont you see it takes the auditing cycle completely completed without cutting the pcs itsa line when he is talking but then not sitting back and making him make up things to talk about you get the idea you differentiate between pc who hasnt anything to talk about and pc who is answering your question you see hes completed answering your question all right thats the time to give him cheery thank you and bear along well that requires little greater sensitivity well thats hammer pound of auditing cycle thats going forward here and hell make frankly as much progress as he gets commands per unit of auditing time thats old he makes as much progress as he gets commands per unit of auditing time he gets command every three minutes he will make command every three minutes worth of ta see he gets command every minute he will make command every minute worth of ta now this carries out at the highest ot processes ill tell you this because this is actually piece of fantastic amounts of ta and action and so forth but the session i ran last night got the pt gpm which had sixteen items in it found the goal of it and got all sixteen items and got it joined into the rest of the bank the thing was found to exist after several banks had been run below it dont you see which is quite an ordinary circumstance did that in three hours found the goal pt gpm its top terminal ran the rest of the items out of it got it all flat completely bled of charge with complete accuracy and so forth in three hours with 175 divisions of ta now theres lot of ta now how youre going to hear some of this tape tomorrow by the way not for any particularnot for the technology in this particular instance but for the itsa the handling of itsa because itsa has to be perfectly handled in order to handle those levels of ta see you have to handle itsa perfectly to do these ot processes you have to handleyour basic auditing has to be absolutely well practically flawless if youre really going to fly but its actually the number of items that you find per unit of auditing time that gives you the ta you know if you just sit thereif you just sit there and let that ta drift about and it sits there awhile motionless and you think well maybe the pc will cognite or say something now thatll give you little more ta and youd better not talk because the ta might move again and all of this sort of stuff thats preying on your mind youre going to getthe next item you havent found yet starts to blow and your ta is coming from the next unfound item and your pcs going to get very unhappy in other words you just come right up on top of this thing and start driving your auditing session and its hard drive dont you see youre not talking when the ta is actually moving lot see that first blowdown that you get yeah youre not saying word during that blowdown see the moment that thing seems to steady down youre right in there with the next question that is going to kick the ta again you see the courtesy steps you know and then as soon as you sayget the answer to how does that relate to this gpmthe moment that you get the answer to this which gives you brrrrrrrrr surge you dont care whether the ta is moving or not because you know right now that any further motion of that ta is going to come from the next item you just get your question in there quick well now thats very refined very fantastically closely timed auditing the way you achieve that sort of thing is just work real hard at basic auditing on lower levels make your basic auditing practically flawless promote the itsa of the ta never sit around and get itsa that you didnt promote dont you see and handle that its like driving 16 horse team at dead run when you get up to ot but its fairly easy to do it at this level too because the repetitive process is very simple the pc has answered it pc has answered it give him the next question see bang youre not waiting around there for something else you dont sit there for three minutes hoping then the pc is finished talking and afraid that the pc is going to because the fact that youre sitting there motionless is inviting the pcs itsa dont you see so the pc always will say something else but it wont be germane and the pc has auditing question to answer so therefore the pc goes on to selfaudit and you longer have an auditing session thats how you destroy it with these silences and you can drivedrive your pc mad and your session down the drain they can throw your ta completely away so it takes when we get to level ii the guy by wandering around bleeding charge is longer able to produce ta so weve got to pound it out of him now so we say all right repetitive process however many old repetitive processes there were dont you know bang goes your question good impingement you know and the pc says whoa that was long well we dont care how long it took to answer were going to wait till he answers the question saying whoa mmmmmmmmmm and were going to make sure that we knew what he answered too were not going to be interested in yes ive recalled one well yes ive recalled one if youhe answers that way you also want to know what he recalled dont you see so you get your questions answered but as soon as you got that question answered and he has answered it and you know hes answered it you feed him the next question you see bang there you are again you know you keep ending off that cycle starting new cycle ending off that cycle starting new cycle without actually cutting his itsa this is very smooth auditing indeed but it requires very professional training guy has to get very good to handle this sort of thing but its enough atan auditor at level ii to handle that sort of thing all right well weve got this guy now hes bled lots of charge hes gotten to point where he doesnt think lion is going to spring at him when he goes down to the postbox hes had lot of wins one way or the other he finds he doesnt have to scream at his wife he finds out the kids make him just as nervous as they always did but he doesnt have to comment on it now you see he can suppress it see hes had lot of wins of one kind or another but life is livable he doesnt find hes living at that same level of anxiety that he was before hes still got lot of that sort of thing well thats fine is he going to get any better is he going get any better well yeah hes going to get better when hes on prepchecking ametered processes in the session and assessing and running arc breaks and that sort of thing thats his next logical step forward and youll be surprised what you can do for somebody if you can really gun them up into running arc break but look at thelook at the level of technology this guy has to be sharper than tack he has to be actually trained to do r2h he has to be able to spot this and that he recognizes that its bypassed charge he recognizes he spots the earlier bypassed charge well you would try to run that on somebody down here at level i the guy would just drift youve heard them youve audited people at this level and youve been surprised at how much they drifted and so on well actually what you were asking them wasnt real to them you werent then making the case progress you thought you were making see youve had the idea perhaps that the higher the process the more it would do for the case see well the process that does the most for the case is the process that is realest to the case at his state of case its merely whats real to him thats all thats quite remarkable revision of look dont you see thats technical revision of look hell get the most gains on the process that is most real and the further his case is away from optimum why the more insignificant tiny little things are real and the more rough and tough things are unreal why you say to this fellowwell we were actually running people over their heads in 1950 we were saying well its this engram if we just run out this engram why youll be all right people understand that pretty well by the way they respond pretty well but there was person after person couldnt run an engram couldnt even come close to an engram couldnt confront anything about engrams and yet those people responded beautifully to little straightwire processes and so forth ive seen guy run from total insanity straight on up to mild neurosis just asking him for times hed communicated interesting there was other auditing command used there was just repetitive process it was real to him that he had communicated see as simple as that now this guy doesnt have to be insane to get win on such process but when he was first doing that process it was already over his head communicated and the amount of comm lag and upset of trying to figure out if he had communicated or if hednever had communicated or what was communicating was quite pathetic to observe process was already over his head should have taken the cchs dont you see that would have undercut that beautifully and it could have cut up into these upper processes but nevertheless the person couldnt run an engram yet he could make marvelous case gain on just recalling times hed communicated dont you see now any case profits to some degree from this but these cases back here on these lower levels only profit from that dont you see theyre hung up at this state of beingness theyre hung up at this level of action they dont know enough about the mind now youre going to take this person here at level iii and youre doing prepchecking youre going to say what isbiggest changes that you have made in your life you know decisions you have made to change were going to assess all those and so forth oh the person will come quite along well and so forth youll be surprised every once in while youre going to get pc who shouldnt be running at that level but running at lower level decisions hes made in his lifetime heh ehhh whoa decisions make deciswhoa oohmmmmi dont think i ever made decision see well youre not getting your assessment list well why arent you getting your assessment list youre just running the pc over his head dont you see pc is not capable of deciding taking responsibility for ever having made decision to change dont you see well thatsback down the repetitive processes you might get something like that you might get concepta concept run get the idea of deciding to change get the idea of notof deciding not to change see get the idea of deciding get the idea of not deciding you know those old concept processes and all of sudden he has this red lightning bolt of cognition on the thing and says you know ive made decision in my lifetime oh gee wonder i dont trust myself to make decisions but you know i really have made decision well then you might be able to run prepcheck process on it see all right well now we take somebody who can get off his arc breaks its very educated level of process he has to understand lot of factors of life before he gets into this otherwise hes looking at so many ramifications of what youre asking him that his mind cant settle on any one of them theres just too much charge in his road all right now lets get into such fantastically esoteric thing as service facsimile have you actually any idea of what that requires of pc what does that really require of him it requires that he take enough responsibility so that he actually is keeping himself sick so as to make somebody else wrong he has to take over the responsibility of his own illness now let tell you that is asking the impossible for lower level cases you say to this fellow well now what did you do to make your mother wrong what sickness did you give yourself in order to make your mother wrong we dont care what question it was but this concept is given to this person this persons liable to fly off in mad state and tell you ah that wasnt the case that wasnt the case actually she was very mean to oh very mean very very bad to she used to tell all kinds of lies to my father so he would beat and my father you know hed beat incessantly this is your approach in an effort to takeget responsibility for service facsimile see look at your level of jump i was horrified in 1954 when i asked around about full responsibility the idea of person taking full responsibility you know i saw people around who actually had had some case wins and that sort of thing who were in state of collapse if you please on the subject take full responsibility for myoh actually its old advanced procedure and axioms i think thats in or its the handbook for preclears one or the other advanced procedure and axioms and when that book was published why we made lots of people who knew we were wrong yeah we were wrong you couldnt take responnot only could you not take full responsibility but of course it was impossible to take any responsibility in any direction see now what had happened there is that research had progressed forward on the subject of levels of case and the dominant level of case at that particular time1954 55were getting up little bit to point where they could take some responsibility so people close in who had had lot of fairly good processing up to that time were perfectly willing to accept this as concept and an idea but people who had not been processed in that particular direction or up that high werent you get the make and break point then of how far you can advance with statement or technology or thought or an idea and you get things like arc break assessmentsgetting somebody to sit still even though hes arc broken and so forth and go into it you cant do auditing on somebody whos too badly arc broke who has understanding of it at all youre running highlevel process here anyway you got programing cases and you got missed withholds well its very rough pulling missed withholds as different than ow this again requires an enormously highlevel of responsibility in order to respond to it ow youd be surprised at what you normally get on the man in the street running ow what have you done well i sat for while see level of responsibility makes you want to saw in and say well what have you done man done you know done theres sense pushing it thats what he has done and what has he withheld well he withheld getting up that would be your level of responsibility idea of interpersonal relationships at all lets move up on little bit higher here and we get implants engrams whole track whole track case analysis well very few people walking out on the street right now have any idea of themselves as spiritual beingvery few as matter of fact they buy meatbody philosophies very easily treatmentsaw off my arm it is sick you know well this kind of nonsense that goes on isthis guy doesnt have any idea of himself as spirit much less as spirit who has an eternity to live through you see has such concepts who has he been where has he been and so forth youll find out in that level itself they normally take off into past lives since roman days they may get back into greece dont you see if they work real hard why theyll push it back maybe to egypt and theyre sticking up at the early part of this run theyre up here in the last 2500 years quite ordinarily they talk quite happily ordinarily of having had bad time in castle that burned down over in france two hundred years ago you see this is whole track hah but that is nevertheless the approach to the situation i know these things ive been through them myself but that suddenly starts to get real and after while you say you know ii mightmight possibly have i might possiblyyou know ive been somebody else and it gets to be fairly good level of reality on this particular basis well thats far cry from actual whole track and yet that is gradient entrance into it guy gets some kind of reality has pictures on these things so they must have happened to him you know that kind of thing he gets little feeling of reality on it it moves up just little bit further to point where he might possibly have had higher longevity he might possibly have had higher state of beingness at one time or another not meatbody state he moves up into higher levels of things that have happened to him at one way or the other these things all increase in reality to the degree that he sheds charge off his case well in the final run of it he gets up to fairly comprehensive idea of what hes been and done this ebbs and flows the reality on it gets great and falls away and so forth because hes falling all over his actual gpms as he passes down the track and so on he nevertheless gets himself one godawful amount of time blocked out oh some terrific amount of time blocked out he gets up to trillions to the eighth power time you know oh man time you see first he gets horrified you see at the idea of twelve trillion years ago or something like that he gets finally up to point where trillions to the eighth power take him back to some of the earliest implants and hes perfectly happy at this level that theres an awful lot of track well when he moves up into level vii he finds out that one gpm will cover from trillions twentynine forward to trillions twentyoneone gpm of course that span of time is almost fantastic because thats much more span of time than the whole span of time back to the earliest implants you can dig up on this guy and thats just one gpm now his track goes sizzling back to trillions to the 200th power well thats of course one of these ridiculous figures thats trillion written two hundred times or one with two hundred times you write all the ciphers of trillion that gets to be quite few ciphers and every one of those things is year youre getting into the sweep of time by this time well i myself have hadi just thought i was doing fine when i was doing some research this last summer i said gee you know were getting clear back here trillions four you know whew you know dizzying concepts of time trying to date one of these confounded things you know trying to handle these fantastic periods of time with arithmetic and trying to dream up other methods of going into all this rough because it just took the auditor too talltoo long to say anything so you got crude rough approximations like trillions 45 see some comprehension of this gradually making it one way or the other now in gpms you dont have to worry about the time of an actual gpm it just is and you dont have to date the thing up fortunately and so on because youre into such vast spans of time that its fantastic now weve carried this guy from his ptp that went back to yesterday when his boss didnt look kindly at him who really cant remember what he had for breakfast who is asked for tolerance of this and that and whose life cuts in at about at the age of twelve or thirteenif you pushed him real hard if psychoanalyst had pushed him real hard and worked for four or five years he would have gotten him to remember when he was ten see this boy we pushed him up by gradients to greater spans of time greater concepts of thought greater concepts about life and the universe around him until his tolerance as far as processing him is concerned in time alone just well today say well trillions two hundred that gpms back there trillions two hundred all right so its back there trillions two hundred see theres gawp about that see reality familiarity why youd takeyoud tie whole session around telegraph pole if you said to this fellow all right now what were going to run on you joe going to run on you this fellow is kind of fellow whoit worries him that he cant remember what he had for breakfast you see if you cant remember what you had for breakfast thats one thing if you worry about it thats something else and this guy and we say well what were you doing in the 14th century youre just going to spend the rest of the session you see trying to get around this unreality and his grappling with it youre not going to get any auditing done see youve hit him with too much unreality he cant meet with that whatsoever so he goes out of with you because the r is out dont you see hell go out of c with you and so on well thats true of this whole scale so this is technical scale and this takes those gradients of processes which i have learned by experience over the past thirteen years that case normally follows through theyll be willing to talk to somebody about their troubles and then with assists theyre willing to have somebody touch them or something like this in order to square up some minor illness theyll talk on specific questions r1c theyll answer specific subject matter youre not giving repetitive question there youre just telling them tell all you can about marriage or something you know what solutions do you have something like that comes up to point where they can actually be disciplined and follow through and be alert enough to follow through repetitive processes cchs straightwire do these various things will actually be able to answer up to prepchecking an emeter decisions of change can get up to point of recognizing when arc breaks are arc breaks and what they come from and what missed withholds are all about and what all these various concepts responsibility are and particularly that they are doing things to make people wrong and theres difference of case responses that they themselves are doing then we give them the idea of whole track and that theyve been here for long time and then we move them up to the fact that doggone it they did it all themselves just let them get their bellyful of motivators five see youll find guy can only be run on implant gpms for two or three months and he just gets his bellyful he finally begins to figure out well howhow could this really have aberrated i know it was uncomfortable but whats this all about and so forth and we had students around here protesting about it and so on so it was all done to us it couldnt have been see here were violent protests and so forth well that was plenty of time to move out on to actual gpms now of course we have an additional level there whats this old route 1 and other drills well thats proper and right conduct for an operating thetan and weve had lots of drills of this particular character theyd probably be different drills today theyd be little smarter and avoidand avoid some of the rocks and shoals of the drills of yesterday i remember we used to have change of space drills and we had at one time two skulls i think those two skulls are still stored in washington and theyd just get the guy used to it and hed be in skull skull b you see be in skull skull b and so forth back and forth back and forth back and forth well if guya guy was pulled down really because of his actual gpms and all this case load that could key in you really cant do those things until you got the guys case practically gone but whether any of those are really necessary or not is point in question i know that if im outside and an auditor will just let itsa for while thats just about the only thing i require on the thing let find my feet quote unquote feet let orient myself let get over queasy idea that i might not be able to hold this position in space all right now the wholethe whole problem as far as were concerned is that of dissemination practice smooth processing forward progress and keeping the road open and keeping the bridge up behind us dont you see how does anybody else ever travel this road thats one of the problems and how does one travel this road best and what is the easiest procedure of dissemination whats the easiest way to take this on and so forth well obviously it would be to insist that somebody didnt outstrip his training level with his processing level because hes sooner or later going to come cropper he goes up above his training level too high and the further he goesalthough it isnt noticeable at one grade veryby the time its gotten two grades it starts to be noticeable and then he all of sudden gets up somewhere around v or vi and he practically spins in its just not anything that he can consistently make lot of auditors by being very clever im sure here or there can get person at higher levelspardon person at lower levels to sit still for processes at higher levels and by carefully holding the breath for the pc and so forth get the pc over certain hurdles in order to get them up to case gain and then im sure that here and there itll be done successfully but in many cases after theyve gone to all this trouble they found out that the guy just stepped over to theon the backtrack and went below where they had been they were running at level that was too high for them to attainway beyond their reality and they were just being propitiative so theres lot of questions like that but what interests us is is how do you keep the road open how do you keep people coming up the line and how do you guarantee that person can make it see now thats another problem see were not talking now about the possibility of somebody making it were talking about guaranteeing that somebody can make it lets take the economics of the situation theyre very much pertinent on this particular planet at this particular time the number of hours of processing between level 0 and level vii are very hard to estimatevery very hard to estimate but the number of hours of processing i dont know two thousand you make guess fifteen hundred i dont know i wouldnt know thats lot of hours of processing now multiply it by ten dollars however many it is multiply it by the very cheap rate of ten dollars completely aside from the fact that the guy couldnt buy his way all the way through without being trainedhe would never make it dont you see the economics that he is being presented with herethe economic picture is inequitable how many hours of processing could he buy for the training fees involved well if all the training feesthis isthis is just wild guesswork im nothavent added anything up and so forth supposing all the training fees and processing odd bits and other things added up in the line supposing these things all came together and added up to five or six thousand dollars supposing you could get all that why i dont say that its correct figure might be more might be less see thats five or six thousand dollarsim trying to give you comparative figures you see compared to perhaps twenty thousand dollars well immediately that you decrease the economicthe cost of the thing of course you make it more possible to make this line all right now lets see if we couldnt decrease this further in various ways and i think this could be done on the basis of bringing this schedule of courses up along the line and each course requiring that the earlier course had been well done then of course these courses would be briefer and you would have less costly situation you see how that would work out but he would get an unlimited amount of processing and he would also make it he would get as much processing as he himself was expert enough to keep his coauditor thats practically the technical definition of how much processing somebody gets processinghis own processing has got to be good enough to keep his coauditor and then your processings always got to be good enough to run your own sessions out of your coauditor just straight coaudit certain amount of skill that is to say his auditing youyouve got to be able to audit what his auditing of you did to him you see or what he said it did and youve got toits in yourin your vast interest to keep picking up his overts against you as an auditor you see and your sessions will get very smooth various lines completely aside from that do show us then that it is more economicthe figures i gave you are just so that you can see the point you see its more economical to coaudit along the line it is also only possible if it is coaudited up along the line because the levels of training are necessary to attain the levels of case so the only possibility of getting up the line its more economical to do so furthermore now the reality level of advance is cared for which cares for dissemination now if any hcahpa could train and issue the has certificate by application to the central organization to the person he trained and actually issue classification i to that person and so forth this would give him coaudit area that he could cope withthat he could cope with one way or the other now weve never been very successful in individual auditors training up cases at what is now given as level ii weve never been too successful at that its very spotty the results have really not been able to because the individual auditor really does not have the facilities to enforce tight schedule and handle the situation so that has not been too good so therefore that course would have to be given in some district or area and would have to be short and to the point but very effective as course and shouldnt be too terribly expensive in order to get that course it should be within the finite limits of thirty days because almost anybody can get thirty days off but you ask them to get off much morewell thats an awful lot to ask somebody to get in thirty days well it would all actually depend on how well they were trained at level i how fast they could go through the upper course now you see we are away because any auditor who had sent somebody out to get something like that could expand little bit further it wouldnt be that they would necessarily come back and do it all themselves but it would come back into zone or area and then youd have broader level of coaudit in progress thats what it would in actual fact amount to youd be coauditing at higher levels and it could move on up that way in whole district or zone could move on up in that particular wise now if every one of these levels had its own textbook or textbook with its question and answer sheets so that everybody knew exactly what was required of him at that particular level and all the data was there for that particular level and the examinations were all there and the examinations were particularized enough so that they wereyou had to really know the stuff in order to pass them this would make very little randomity in moving up the line thats another point that has to be taken care of that job falling mostly on the back of my neck i absolutely shudder at because it means my god ive got to rewrite about thirteen years of work into simple textbook form cost us lot of our scientologese but it is actually not to our interest to cut down too much on the esoterics of scientologese into the upper levels its only in our interest to cut them out in the lower levels thebecause there are many things weve discovered in the mind that nobody has any word for except us we can simplify then on the broad public front the wording and usages of scientologese as language you see but in preserving the necessary points still get simplification as we go up along the line but there are certain things you cant simplify you start calling an actual gpmyou start calling that in too much english and you use an english word of some kind or another for gpm and youve just about had it what you want is symbol that is not restimulative of the wording of goals or items see has lot to do with it anyway however that is somebody now is in this position hes out here on the street he hears about scientology so he goes around and he understands theres an auditor there and he has some meetings on friday night or something like that and he decides hell go along hes heard from bill or something and he goes along there he sees chart up on the wall of where hes supposed to go this tells him at once that there is someplace to go that there is way to get there and if various states of arrived beingness are described with great reality on this chart and so on he frankly wont look at the upper levels of the chart they wont interest him he will be mostly looking at the immediately adjacent interests of the chart you see and hell say those are good thing to have and this is all he has to do and this is all he has to study and this is his practice of activity and its on this schedule and that sort of thing and that shows him that he can move from that point on forward the road then is not blocked out because he sees that every time he gets at one of these points he can then take off to the next point similarly informed and equipped furthermore hes not being limited by fantastic sums of money being required of him for processing hes being asked for enough money to finance training but he is notand hes usually perfectly willing to give that by the way he then realizes hes buying an unlimited amount of training to get through the processes of these particular levels and move on forward well by restimulating lot of coauditgetting lot of coaudit going in areas and making central organizations concentrate on this and show auditors where they fail by not getting coaudit groups going then the central organization itself comes over on to training mainly for its income line it actually runs more courses than it did previously more levels of course and any hgc activity is basically patchup activity resulting from coaudit areas now there hasnt been any success whatsoeverany fast success of dissemination or broad knowledgein the idea of private professional practitioner who grabbed guys off the street laid them on the couch and ejected them out the front door i want to call this to your attention that this is notin spite of the fact we have one or two guys few guys in scientology that have been absolute geniuses at this and have made very good forward progressbut this has not been the picture of the whole at all this bloke who does this is following pattern laid down by earlier healing professions and we dont happen to be healing profession so were out of order to accept this particular zone now whats the score here whats the score yourimmediately you have figuresyou immediately have figures here before you it took the medical profession over hundred years to get anywhere with that system its taken the chiropractor naturopaths homeopaths the osteopaths almost equivalent lengths of time and theyre not really making it look at this as healing profession activity you look at the amount of time its taken them to get off launching pad and why just now the american medical association is getting up to point where they have something to do with public opinion in the united states and theyre doing it for the rather unworthy reason of just getting few more quick bucks into their pocket these boys took long time these fellows were long way on the road so that is obviously not fast system just looking at the comparative statistics we say then there is something wrong with this picture we have this freudian analyst who has an office in the ritz building and who gets couple of patients in every day and listens to them and so forth this picture is not successful dissemination picture it happens to be the only picture in the society that anybody is complaining about the medicosit took them hundred years to make it and theyre not going to let anybody else make it if they can possibly help it they know how tough it is theyre going totheyre going to scuff the track up in front of us theyre going to push us around in order to get that quick buck and the monopoly dont you see well we dont belong in their field we have nothing to do with them at all and so i dont think that pattern which is so well adapted to what iswhat is their highest level of pracoh letting blood yes they bleed people these days theyre the fellows that have those barber poles that go upno thats some other profession anyway all joking aside they have not been successful because they are all poised for the final kickover they were seized 100 percent in england by the government in the united states they will be in the near future socialized medicine is certainly going to be there the big insurance companies of canada and so on arehave all of their chips down on the fact that all medical healing in the united states will become socialized within the next five years well thatll be an adequate stop to any forward movement thatno matter what their forward movement might have been and it looks to meit looks to and has for some time that that is not successful pattern furthermore the society only complains about central organizations when they engage in public processing getting the guy off the street and straightening up something with him then they have an objection to this because its in the line of that they have also an objection to private practitioner let show you here that if this system is followedif this system is followedyou realize that anybody who becomes preclear has to become member of the club therefore anything thats happening to him he has right to try to help do something about if he doesnt like it he isnt just at the total effectpoint and hes moving on forward and he has some responsibility for the general forward progress of the scientology movement makes different picture now the senate antiamerican activityi mean the senate antiamerican committee i think thats one of their principal functions american organizations and so forth have to be stamped out now you see we mustnt have the organization never hired communist in his life blacklisted you know theyre going crazier and crazier youre seeing government go goofier and goofier now these boysthese boys come up on an investigatory level see and they want to know about this terrible movement scientology ohwooohwoooh theyre doing these poor little povertystricken doctors out of their honorable duty you knock them over in minuteyou knock them over in minute with another plan of dissemination dont you see youd say well as far as i know the only thing thats ever gotten us into trouble with the press or with governments or anything is because part of our plan of disseminationwhich fortunately for us was our most unsuccessful part of our dissemination activitiesparalleled that of the poor downtrodden medical doctor who must be protected you see now the government itselfthe government itselfgets the idea of somebody trying to influence the public at large they have another entirely different angle on this they get some idea of somebody treating members of the public this makes them sort of public activity but look ill call to your attention that in every area and state in the world there is this idea of the private club they have many privileges the idea of the private club the idea of the private activity this fellow is member of the club so he can buy drinks at hours which are not legal in any public pub you see all kinds oftheres all kinds of privileges associated here with the privacy of an activity well of course it doesnt seem to occur to them that the member of the public becoming scientologistthe member of the public becoming only preclearis pretty hard to draw in our particular instance but it does tend to wipe out forward randomity were now running into randomity weve got such things as the victorian parliament they got thethey got the straw out of their teeth long enough to utter asininities on the subject of what is this scientology and theyre now having some kind of investigation on the subject down there in victoria statethats state parliament down there they dont amount to anything i was fascinated by their summons to the inquiry its inquiring after the corporation which has never done any business in australia it wants all the papers of this corporation which has never done any business in australia just happens to be one of the scientology corporations they havent even got the right corporation in other words theyre adrift man of course i have objection to these attacks so long as they continue to attack along lines in which they will inevitably lose see the fda attacking us for healing people with an emeter hooking it up to people and saying their cancer will now be cured because we have turned the meter on see thats what they actually were charging us with so long as they bring attacks along that line its perfectly all right with because we win them well win all these attacks one way or the other god help the victorian state parliament i used to look at the hco exec sec down there occasionally she got an interested look across the street you seeits right across the street from hasi and shed say well well own that place one of these days and its already begun theyre the people who did enough overts now and of course theyll run for cover like bunch of startled quail but if their investigation starts by investigating corporation which has never done any business in australia as the corporation they should investigate well it gives you an idea of it see and theyre investigating things that dont exist and so on we dont care much about this type of activity except as it takes it out of and muddies up the lines and takes it out of assoc secs and hco secs around the world they manage to hold the fort they really dont do us lot of harm but if its stepped up to this particular point at this particular time we have just now gotten complete cycle of research here whats going to happen because of this is of course gruesome because this will make vast difference in its own right but everybodys gotten terribly interested in scientology newspapers are saying to us now oh of course anything that happens in scientology is news well of course what they consider news these days is bad news and were not terribly fascinated with being treated this way but wed better notthis isnt necessarily why we would put out this policy letter im just showing you that it does happen to have an advantage in that direction too now ive examined this from all fronts the only criticisms i have with itit sure does make an awful lot of certificates has lots of certificates but i call to your attention that these certificates are most of them extant they have at one time or another actually been issued or used and these certificates are an effort to handle the situation of somebody completes course but doesnt get his classification at least give him something for the course youll find this continuously operates as problem in handling courses and so forth youd be surprised how much upset you get if you dont do this and therefore the certificate does not carry the rights of the class at time here does the certificate designate or carry the right of the class these are just an afterthought the classification is carried by the roman numeral and only the roman numeral regardless on what certificate it occurs so someday you may see the odditybecause hga was given away years and years agoyou may see an hga with class ii on it sounds wild butand lot of administrative randomity can be kicked up along this way but its actually the class they have made and if they are studying for the next class they may do the processes of that class if they already have in their handsyou couldnt train anything unless you did thisunless they already have in their hands the level of their last class see they must have the level of their last class they therefore do the processes of the next class while actually being trained for that classwhile actually being trained for that class see because this breakdown will stand that much that much strain but may not do the next class see it can only move one above if they havent gotten the classification let us saytheyve got class iii and they havent gotten their iv classification but have been trained for iv and then they go on to try to take course for v cant do it because in the first place theres something must be wrong back here with their case or something like that something must be wrong with the basic understanding not to be able to get class something must be missing here someplace you see and youd throw the whole thing askew again if you permitted guy to just go on up training for each class up and doing the processes of that class because he was training for it it would become idiocy but you have to allow the next class to be trained from the class award actually given now the question came up what about class 0 and class i well of course thats the only one where you have this condition and thats because it is class 0 because you havent got scientologist yet and therefore you say class 0 youre actually not saying very much this class has to be double if you take good bold look at it youve got the person who is being trained for an has certificate you have to consider him class of some kind or another consider him class 0 striking for an has certificate and then theres your has certificate classed because there had to be certificate before he could get class now that condition doesnt ever occur again the person from that time on has always got some kind of certificate to put class on i mean its as elementary and as stupid as this particular thing there is other ramification about class 0 and class i both coming under has it has other meaning than that of course you call this person class 0 because hes taking course for an has dont you see now this permits however basic public release textbook to be issued at the level of class 0 which doesnt really contain the classification materials for has and class i its just public stuff one way or the other dissemination material all right not to labor the point too much i can tell you right now that there are cases all over scientology who are parked because they skipped some of these levels or havent got things squared away at one or another of these levels of processing and they tried to leap with seven league boots into the rare and stratified air of upperlevel processes when they are still desperately worried about the fact that water every now and then looks awfully green when it comes out of faucet but they really cant ever see that it is green dont you see and theyre worried about such things as visual perception or what is the environment all about something that would be solved all at once with the cchs dont you see and yet somebodys trying to run them on implant gpms or something like this see oh brother now that stretch of unreality accounts for lack of forward advance and if an individual in scientology doesnt feel that his case is advancing that he is advancing then somewhere along this lineand this schedule is laid out fairly preciselyhe has dropped the ball at one of these levels that level has never been flattened on him as case that contains things that he is still desperately worried about now its all very well to say that only in the upper levels do you get real resolution of the case thats true but how do you get past the camouflage and the nonsense of the ptps and upsets of present time in order to get through the case in order to relieve the things which are the real trouble with the case it is very true that the real trouble with the case lie at level vi these all lie at level vi and its also very true that youve got chance whatsoever to get to them because there are too many other things wrong already that lie on the top of them the unreality of the situation is such that one can ever get to these so the anxiety of some auditor to get the most see get the biggest effect on the pc you know do do the most for the pc you see takes this little kid who is awfully worried every time his mother leaves the room and tries to run an actual gpm on him see he isnt going to make it and the other pointthe only other point id like to make is i think this reduces the amount of danger the amount of upset the amount of randomity connected with processing results and im terribly interested in that well ive given you lot of data here one way or the other ive tried to give you my viewpoints with regard to this and i hope theyve been of some assistance in this matter thank you
