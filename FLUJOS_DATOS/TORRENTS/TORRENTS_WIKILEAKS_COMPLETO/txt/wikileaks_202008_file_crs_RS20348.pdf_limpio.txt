resolutions were enacted for fy1953 even though all but one of the regular appropriations were enacted late1 the antideficiency act 31 usc 13411342 15111519 generally bars agencies from continued operation in th absence of appropriations2 exceptions are made under the act including for activities involving the safety of human life or the protection of property the interval during the fiscal year when agency appropriations are not enacted into law either in the form of regular appropriations act or cr is referred to as funding gap although funding gaps may occur at the start of the fiscal year they also may occur any time cr expires and another cr or the regular appropriations bill is not enacted immediately thereafte r also multiple funding gaps may occur for fiscal year in 1980 and 1981 attorney general benjamin civiletti issued opinions clarifying the need for federal agencies to begin rminating regular activ ities immediately upon the occurrence of funding gap3 consequently when funding gap occurs the federal government begins shutdown of the affected agencies shutdown entails the prompt furlough of nonemergency personnel and curta ilment of agency activities including the provision of many services to the public4 the general practice of the federal government over the years has been to pay furloughed employees after the shutdown has ended for time missed even when work was performed in order to avoid funding gaps and th eir unwanted consequences proposals have been offered from time to time to establish an automatic continuing resolution acr that would provide fallback source of funding for activities at restricted level in the event the timely enactment of appropriations is disrupted5 the funding would become available automatically and rema in available as long as needed so that funding gap would not occur and the furlough of federal employees would be avoided or at least severely limited although the house and senate have cons idered acr proposals in the past none have been enacted into lawhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20348crs3 6 the enactment of series of continuing resoluti ons for fiscal year is discussed in crs report rl32614 duration of

fy1977 marked the first full implementation of the congre ssional budget process estab lished by the congressional budget act of 1974 the enactment of cr on the day after the previous cr expired which has occurred often is not counted as i nvolving funding gap during the past nine fiscal years covering fy2000fy2008 for ex ample nextday crs were enacted 14 times most of the funding gaps occurred during th first half of the 32year period during the 16year period covering fy1977fy1992 15 funding gaps occurred however only two funding gaps occurred during the re maining 16 years covering fy1993fy2008 multiple funding gaps occurred in four inst ances 1 three gaps covering total of 28 days in fy1978 2 two gaps covering total of four days in fy1983 3 two gaps covering total of three days

several days after the fiscal year had begun nine of the funding gaps ended in oc tober four ended in november three ended in december and one ended in january6 funding gaps ranged in duration from one to 21 full days six of the seven lengthiest funding gaps lasting between 8 and 17 days occurred between fy1977 and fy1980 before the civiletti opinions were issued after the issuance of these opinions the duration of funding gaps in general shortened c onsiderably ranging from one to three days with the longer gaps occurring over th weekend an important exception to this trend occurred in late 1995 and early 1996 when president bill clinton and the republicancontrolled congress engaged in di fficult and protracted negotiations over budget policy resulting in the veto of continuing resolution and several regular appropriations acts for fy1996 two funding gaps amounting to five days and 21 days ensued with about 800000 federal employees furloughed initially there have been
