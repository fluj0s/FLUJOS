commodity identification training dubai 1013 jan 2010 classified by jerry guilbert for reasons 14 b and d 1 u the department of energys doe international nonproliferation export control program inecp through funding provided by the department of states export control and related border security assistance exbs program conducted commodity identification training cit for dubai customs jan 10 13 2010 cit teaches customs agents to recognize wmdrelated dualuse items and this event marked the first time inecp had delivered any type of training in the unite arab emirates uae 2 u the inecp team consisted of chris walker doe hq heidi mahy and kevin whattam pacific northwest national laboratory basil picologlou argonne national laboratory and kirk walker kansas city plant lisa meyers dosoffice of counterproliferation initiatives and tyler hoffmann exbs advisor for the middle east also attended the dubai office of us immigration and customs enforcement provided organizational support and attended the course 3 u the course began with brief overviews of weapons and mass destruction and delivery systems missiles which occupied most of the workshops first day the remaining three days consisted of about three dozen modules covering range of controlled goods including machine tools gyroscopes precursor chemicals and many others the course also featured several practical exercises and games8 to test the participants grasp of the material unsurprisingly the attendees were not particularly lively during the overview presentations but they showed strong interest in the commodity presentations and especially the exercises dubai customs brought an xray van to the course allowing both instructors and participants to see how some controlled goods that is the ones inecp brought along as teaching aids look when xrayed probably the part of the course that generated the most interest and excitement this was the first time any customs agency had provided an xray van at cit seminar 4 u attendance on the part of dubai customs varied from about 15 participants on the first day to around 20 or so for most of days 2 through 4 plus few individuals from the training division responsible for organizing the event most of the attendees work in port rashid but there were also attendees from the jebel ali cargo village uaeoman border crossing and two representatives from dubai customs wmd division mr mohammed foolad the dubai customs manager for nonproliferation of wmd was the seniormost person in attendance and had good working knowledge about wmd related dualuse items from his work he leads special unit of five individuals one of whom attended the course with him he requested extra copies of the printed course materials and electronic versions of all the arablanguage materials which the team provided to him 5 u overall the level of interest was quite good the audience was fairly participatory and showed great deal of energy in particular while xraying the goods and during wrapup exercise in which groups of participants identify pictures of goods from the course multiple participants stated that cooperation should continue in the future time will tell if the sentiment was genuine 6 s in side conversation between mr foolad and ms meyers he noted that his job is to coordinate wmd related cases he works closely with the dubai general directorate of state security on sensitive issues when asked about the export control office he noted that he works with them but that they are new to this issue while dubai customs has been working on this issue for years he noted that the uae was developing computer system that will allow emirate level customs offices to communicate with each other 7 snf contd on targeting mr foolad noted that dubai customs is stopping wmd related cargo on their own without information from foreign governments using their targeting methods they currently use the control lists of the various regimes to target controlled goods as well as information provided by the united states germany and others to target end users they have handbook created by dubai customs to help their officers physically identify wmd related dualuse goods but noted they have had difficulty finding pictures of certain wassenaar military related items he described case of glass fiber stopped on its way from the netherlands to iran as well as some 7075 aluminum he noted that they really need more information on who the suspect end users are as they could use this information to help them better target wmd end users he mentioned that they routinely find that the same phone numbers are associated with different companies 8 snf contd mr foolad explained the serious problems they are facing at their cargo village facility which is where they handle air cargo shipments he noted that they have to look at over 9000 shipments month going to one country of concern ie iran he noted how difficult this is due to the quick time frame but how necessary given the sensitivity note mr foolad seemed to take the course and moreover his responsibilities leading the wmd unit very seriously 9 u point of contact for dosexbs program
