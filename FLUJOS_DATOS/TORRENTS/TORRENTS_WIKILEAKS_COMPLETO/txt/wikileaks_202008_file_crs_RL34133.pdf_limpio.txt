synthesized from coal natural gas and biomass are proposed as one solution to reducing dependency on impor ted petroleum and strained refinery capacity the technology to do so developed from processe s that directly nd indirectly convert coal into liquid fuel congress now faces decisions on whether and to what extent it should support such solution lacking domestic petroleum resources but abundant in coal germany built synthetic fuel plants during world war ii that employed the bergius coal hydrogenation process direct liquefaction and fischertropsch synthesis indirect the united states attempted to capitalize on the german experience after world war ii despite considerable investment in sy nthetic fuel research and development the united states cut support for commercializa tion when crude oil prices dropped and supplies stabilized in the mid1980s since then several synthetic fuels plants have been constructed around the world that convert coal natural gas or biomass to liquid fuels using the fischertropsch process several private ventures in the united states are now studying the feasibility of constructing fischertropsch synthetic fuel plants based on coal na tural gas and biomass proposals to expand the use of coal to synthesize transportation fuels have generated much opposition particular ly because the carbon dioxide co2 produced in the fischertropsch process is gree nhouse gas associated with global warming also opponents claim that coalbased synthesis in particular is inefficient and thus prohibitively expensive proponents count er that fischertropsch technology provides means of capturing carbon diox ide for geological sequestration though promising solution sequest ration remains unproven on an industrial scale and that it appears economically viable in sustai ned crude oil price range above 40 to 45 per barrel fischertropsch synthesis is well suite d to producing middl edistillate range fuels like diesel and jet the diesel produ ced is superior to conventionally refined diesel in terms of higher cetanenumber nd low sulfur content overall middle distillate fuels represent roughly quart er of us refinery production which is primarily driven by the demand for gasoline in order for synthetic fuels industry whether coal natural gas or biomass ba sed to begin rivaling or even supplanting conventional petroleum refini ng major shift in trans portation mode toward diesel engine lightpassenger vehicles would have to occur coaltoliquids would also compete for the same resources needed for electric power generation and the rail capacity currently supporting their demand recent energy legislation promotes research on capturing and storing greenhouse gas emissions and improving vehi cle fuel effi ciency among other goals fishertropsch fuels present the paradox of high carbon emissions associated with production versus lower carbon emissions associated with their use httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34133contents

capacity continue to stimulate congressional and private s ector interest in producing synthetic fuels from alternative resources current conditions almost reprise the era of the 1970s when energy security concer ns generated by oil embargoes stimulated federal spending in synthetic fuels despite considerab investment federal support was withdrawn after supply concerns eased in the 1980s the currently favored approach to producing synthetic fuels the fischertropsch process uses carbon monoxide and hydrogen from combustion of fossil or organically derived feedstocks the process and has been commercially demonstrated internationally and in pilot plant demonstration in the united states jet fuel from gastoliquids pilot plant has already been certified for use by the unite d states air force at least one coalto liquids enterprise is in the planning phase and others are being studied as an abundant resource in the united st ates coal has long been exploited as solid fossil fuel as oil and natural ga s supplanted coal throughout the last two centuries technologies devel oped to convert coal into other fuels proponents of expanding the use of coal such as the coaltoliquids coalition argue that the united states should alleviate its depe ndence on imported petroleum and strained refinery capacity by converting coal to tran sportation fuels opponents such as the natural resource defense council argue th at considerable economic social and environmental drawbacks of coalderived oil preclude it from being sound option to move america beyond oil1 fischertropsch

considera tions are presented along with bills recently introduced in congress pertaining to coaltoliquids research and indus trial development synthetic fuel technology synthetic fuels can be traced to the mid19th century processes of making coal oil coal gas and the later manufacture of town gas coal oil was introduced as substitute for more costly illuminating fuels particularly premium whale oil originally sold under the trad name of kerosene coal il was in turn replaced by similarly named but cleaner burning crude oil distillate coal gas also served as an early illuminating fuel but burned with ye llow flame of poor quality process for improving coal gas was devised by passing it over water bat h this was improved on further by passing steam through inca ndescent beds of charred coal coke to produce water gas mixture of carbon monoxide co and hydrogen h2 gases water gas more commonly known as town gas produced hotter cleaner burning blue flame than coal gas town gas illumination eventually gave way to electric lighting but it continued as an industrial heating fuel into the 1950s when natural gas became more widely available httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34133crs3 2

find widespread use until transportation modes shifted from horse and buggy to the automobile with the growth of the automobile and aircraft industries the demand for gasoline and t hus petroleum increased in germany researchers looked to coal for petr oleum substitute the carbon monoxide and hydrogen produced in manufacturing town gas provided an essential first step in synthesizing liquid fuel from coal the tw processes developed direct and indirect coaltoliquids conversion provided comp lementary means of producing range of fuels and chemicals each offe red advantages and disadvantages bergius direct liquefaction in the early 20th century german researcher friedrich bergius developed process to directly liquefy coal under high temperature and pre ssure coal begins to dissolve above 250 degrees centigrade nd then crack the coal molecules into smaller molecules using hydrogen2 bergius termed the process coal hydrogenation which was later referred to as direct liquefaction coal also served as the source of hydrogen in modern refining hydrogen is manufactured from methane gas ch4 decomposed by process termed steam reforming modern refineries rely extensively on hydrogen for hydroc racking and hydrotreating fischertropsch synthesis as bergius was perfecting direct liquef action german scientists franz fischer and hans tropsch were developing means of indirectly converting coal into liquid fuel in 1926 fischer and tropsch reporte d process to synthesize hydrocarbons using an iron or cobalt catalyst to react hydrogen h2 with carbon monoxide co under lower temperatures and pre ssures than bergius process essentially fischertropsch ft synt hesizes straight molecular chains of carbon and hydrogen whereas bergius br eaks heavierweight hydrocarbons into lighterweight shorterlength molecule s both processes involve hydrogen fischertropsch synthesis however relies on carbon monoxides potential for exchanging oxygen with hydrogen in the presence of catalyst as in the manufacture of water gas coal is bur ned to produce the carbon monoxide and steam reacting with hot coal disassociates to pr oduce hydrogen as shown in the following water gas shift equations3 c h2o co h2 and co h2o co2 h2 the co2 byproduct of these reactions can be scrubbed from the syngas stream before it is introduced to the synthesi s reactor this provides the opportunity to

developed by the american society for sting and materials astm international and the environmental protection agency pa these include octane and cetane number sulfur content and exhaust emissions the fuel specifications most familiar to motorists are octane and cetane numbers in the case of gasoline the octane rating refers to the property of resisting spontaneous ignition in contrast diesel fuel is rated by its relative ease of ignition under compression desired property this may seem paradox gasoline should resist ignition and diesel should ig nite easily as gasoline is more volatile than diesel it is desirable that it not ignite before the spark plug fires octane higher octanenumber fuels better re sist engine knock the sound caused by fuel prematurely igniting during compressi on in early gasoline research the least knock resulted from using iso octane which arbitrarily received rating of 1006 iso octane refers to branched isomer in the paraffin series having eight carbons c8h187 the straightchain isomer in this series noctane has rating 19 these isomers of paraffin are shown in figure 3 fischertropsch synthesis produces primarily straightchain paraffins thus any gasoline

deployment remains uncertain despite the completion of many small coaltochemical facilities while china sees unique advantages in promoting coalbased alternatives to petroleum there are key challenges

resources thus criticism that us energy policy decisions were shortsighted in abandoning synthetic fuel efforts contrast with the reality that the refining industry transformed itself under the same economic circumstances without government supporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34133crs27 72 edison electric institute q3 2007 financial update constructing first or even second fisc hertropsch synthetic facility regardless of feedstock is coal gas or biom ass is likely to encounter permi tting as well as economic barriers see crs report rl32666 the gas to liquids industry and natural gas markets advocates of developing synthetic fuels industry argue for variety of incentives they view necessary in helping help bridge barriers to entry such as loan guarantees streamlined permitting infrastructure improvements and longterm contracts for purchasing coal ga s or biomass toliquid fuels some might argue that offering loan guarantees for such an industry would be misplaced incentive given the current high prices of crude oil and refined gasoline others might argue that the petroleum industry s reluctance to increase refining capacity justifies federal intervention the ener gy policy act of 2005 already includes the provisions of section 391 refinery revitalization for streamlining the application and permit process among federal agencies for new refineries which arguably could be applied to fischertropsch plants mandated improvements in average fuel economy standards as provided in the energy independence and security ac t of 2007 pl 110140 could have some stimulus on fledgling fischertrops ch industry see crs report rl33831 energy efficiency and renewable energy legislation in the 110th congress automobile manufacturers mig ht achieve the proposed standards through increased production of diesel passenger vehicles which at the same time consume less fuel and emit lower co2 than gasoline engines partially offsetting the co2 emitted in producing such fuels in that case the mand for diesel fuel might increase us refineries would be pressed to adjust their product slate toward more diesel production and distributors woul d be pressed to import more diesel fuel however refineries may be limited to adjusting thei r product slates to more than 10 to 20 diesel without making capital inves tments the increased us demand for imported diesel would compete with eu ropean demand where the preference for diesel vehicles is already increasing either case could place upward pressure on prices and thus stimulate private investment carbon dioxides contribution to gl obal warming represents the primary drawback to fischertropsch particular ly when using coal feedstock it also represents the primary detraction to coal as fuel in general as evident in the cancellation of number in coalfired power plant projects 11000 megawatts in capacity in 2007 the edison electric institute attributes the cancellation in part to the uncertainty over the future regulation of carbon72 carbon capture and sequestration offers promising solution however sceptics of the solution may go unchallenged wit hout an i ndustrial scale demonstration private interests may forestall investment in synt hetic fuels over the uncertain ty of future carbon emission regulations particularly if rules are not applied evenly to existing emission sources policy makers may face few options in cont ending with the broad issue of reducing carbon emissions from existing fossil fuel usershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34133crs28 appendix gulf oil company direct coal
