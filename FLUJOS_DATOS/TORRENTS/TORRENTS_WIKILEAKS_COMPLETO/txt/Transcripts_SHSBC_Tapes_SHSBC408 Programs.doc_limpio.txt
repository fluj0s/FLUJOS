programs lecture given on 3 november 1964 thank you well aside from the staff you all look pretty good staff looks fine too thats just too good an opportunity for gag except some of the new people ooh this is serious we better get to work here all right whats the date audience 3rd november three nov3 november ad 14 saint hill special briefing course and you came just in the nick of time were winding up the areas between 0 and iv and its in the nick of time that you are because well probably very shortly never talk about them again probably all lectures in very short while will be exclusively devoted to joes report to what really is on alpha centauri you know i mean what are the martians planning now you know anywayanyway weve been doing roundup here of technology from 0 up to iv i should tell you something about this youre entitled to know what went on is i went on flatoutreally flatoutexcursion on research and worked very very hard on research beginning i think exactly on the 22nd of januarycompletely flatout straight on through till about april of 64 thats 22nd of january 63 to april of 64 well this was skullbuster to end them all and consisted of oh anywheres up to eighteen hours of grind at the meter and so forth day and finally rounded up by april the basic materials necessary for people to run level vi i didnt bother to polish these things off i left them about the way they were because up at that time it became obvious to that somebody could pilot his way through this and i didnt bother to give the perfect rootword lineup or finish off my endwords plot or anything of this sort but i just gave enough of it so that it could be run and i discovered all the rules of running the thing and so forth and pinned it up and that was it well then i saw something as far as i was concerned which was of considerable interest to meis the fact that i was now myself beginning to pass out of any interest area of any kind whatsoever in 0 to iv areas i just couldnt have cared less and i suddenly looked this over and i says to myself well now all ive got to do now is go on down the track and wrap this bank up and keep going and put these materials together perfectly you see and thats about all i got to go and at the end of that time im going to be so far out of touch personally that to get even vaguely interested in doing anything for anybody else along this line except at the level im working at you see that started to get unreal to meid begun to understand insanity in observation of people and why they were doing what they were doing to such degree that i was simply asising it left right and center so i didnt have to do anything about it and they began to look little silly to actually and somebody having hard time with studywell i knew he was just wrapped up with certain end word that he had in restimulation and so forth you know but that wasso there he was in an end word well so what dont you see i saw this attitude growing and i said now see here now young man i said you mustnt do this this is very bad thing youre doing what youve got to do is get yourself by the scruff of the neck and hold it down and go back and start in at level 0 and put the bridge together smoothly from level 0 on up through to level vi so from april of 1964 until now in november i have been very busy doing this and that project now is complete the materials have not all been written down or issued but the project as far as thats concerned is complete most of the materials are on tape in fact i think they all are now this culminated with the composition of book of remedies which picked up cases that werent running and put those together and so forth two new processestwo new routines were issued at this time and that was in brandnew discoverywas clay table work and the two new routines were those which go in for level iii which is clay table healing and those which go in for level iv which is clay table clearing i saw that these were quite necessary in order to bring somebody up to point where the bank was sufficiently unburdened that he wouldnt be stumbling around all the time lost and wandering in the midst of lord knows what and i saw that it was very feasible to clear somebody at this particular levels and i also saw just below that if somebody was very sick all the time well he wasnt going to be able to clear himself up of anything mental he was in too much physical duress dont you see and moving back down just below that if some fellow wasnt at all oriented in lifehe didnt have any good command of what life was all about he was in such puzzle all the time concerning this sort of thing that he wouldnt even be able to concentrate his attention up to point of getting well dont you see and moving it just back ahead of that this fellow has got to get over the idea that hes always going to get worse youd be surprised how many people are around that dont think anything could ever get any better they think they have nothing whatsoever to do with that nothing is going to get better and out of that we get the philosophy of man is an animal there isnt anything there to do anything about anything dont you see how can cell heal cell well of course it cant they have in other words lost totaltotally lost sight of the personality and beingness of the person well that we call level of release and actually person at the level of release is simply expected to realize that he can get better and then just below that weve got an area where the individual has an orientation of the philosophy or his thinkingness of life or what is life all aboutanother orientation area but mostly one of vocabulary of philosophic straightening out you knowthe sort of thing that you find in oh various essays various books of essays stuff thats appeared in certainty you knowis it possible to be happy you know that kind of thing bringing person up to this point and where he has some idea of what he is all aboutwhat is man in his relationship to the universe actually this is quite step and we look at it very front on we see that it is quite step because its wrapup of subject called ontology in the whole field of philosophy on which men have been working for about fifty thousand years and thats all wrapped upbut thats only level 0 do you see thats how far wed gone now if we look into this we see then that some sort of bridge has been formed and actually quite an effective bridge between the man in the street and weve even got the fellow who wont be audited we know whats wrong with him if we pay any attention to it at allthats somebody screaming around about something or other and hes never going to be audited and hes not interested in scientology or even somebody that just wont even talk about it and isnt interestedweve still got them we can resolve those moving it on up then the person can be graduated up through these levels and he finally collides with level vi and then what happened during that period of wrapup is i had recognition of necessity of firstfirst thing i realized was i had to get good command of the whole subject called study what was wrong with this subject how wasnt it ever written up how wasnt it ever put together because if youre going to put out materials and its put out into the messy technology which is called education today and if more is known about that technology than is known then the possibility of getting the material relayed over to somebody becomes quite remote so its necessary to finish up that communication bridge you see with the various materials so one had to know something about that and basically from the viewpoint of somebody who was going to put it together so the truth is that i started putting study together in april from the viewpoint of how am i going to write up the materials which i am now going to research and which i have researched that was the burning question how am i going to write them up what do i omit and actually ive never particularly released that technology its still in very secret place on written longhand on pieces of paper and every once in while i have heart failure because ive taken hold of it and referred to it dont you seeand i have forgotten to put it back you see and its already gone astray twice and its the sole existing record of this material you know but its all of the things you must and mustnt do in relaying communication materials well as soon as i started going in this direction of putting it togetherhow do you put it togetherthen ive got the reverse angle on it what interrupts study and how does one go about study and the rest of this technology started to fall out of it and then why people blew scientology and became upset also fell out of this hamper and then things just started to avalanche out of the hamper and we had science called education and the way i did this is rather unorthodox when one lives in an ivory tower of philosophy it is never necessary of course as everyone knows to have anything to do with reality every once in while somebody cracks sideways at you know of having lived here and there rather wild life well i assure you that some contact with life is necessary to understand it and i also assure you that any contact with life gets wild so the upshot of this was that i started in on the basis ofive got to go outside the field of scientology for field to study because imyou know if i kept studying inside the field of scientology im studying an area where i understand everything so i took subject in which id been mildly interested since i was kid and had very often used and actually had been professional in at one time or another but which i really knew i didnt understand very well and i took course in this took three year course crowded it into five months on top of all the other research materials and came crashing down the line with this thing and every time i myself would hit bugthe subject of course was photographyand every time i would hit bug then knowing scientology and knowing the combinations of things i would simply back off from thisoh id get arc broke man id be swearing you know throw the book halfway across the room and so forth what was thewhawhat they talking about you know and i kept watching these various phenomena you see and id go back and id trace them down very very carefully and using scientology trace those things down to their exact source at first i realized that it was merely noncomprehension on my part or failure to communicate on the part of the teacher and thats all i attributed it to and then i found out that this wasnt total satisfactory answer because one remained arc broke on the subject so i traced it back that little additional step and found out that one hadnt understood word and then it wouldnt have mattered whether the teacher had been articulate or the student bright the word gonethe mind goes its just onetwo and its just like hitting springboard that sails you through the air because the next few paragraphs after the missed word are blanks and you can go back and study those paragraphs and go back and study those paragraphs and study those paragraphs and you can take somebody who is in this cycleand you can plead with him you can coax you can howl you can scream you can beat the desk you can examine him you could do anything in the world you want to do i mean you would not be able to shake the thing because its hanging on the prior wordjust ahead of that misunderstood passage and very often having nothing to do with it now this is what drove instructors madhaving nothing to do with that word we get this skip so you had to go back and you had to locate that word the second you located the wordthe magic you see was that all the kerfluffle the person was in all the mess he was in all the mixupthats texan indian i think thats where we got okay same state anyway kerfluffle means an upset theas soon as we got into that then the instructor or the teacher or the writer or whoever was trying to communicate it see he would just try harder and harder to bang around what wasnt understood and you knowand they juston the subject matter of what wasnt understood and actually they werent discussing what wasnt understood at all it was just little bit earlier and it happened to be word that was misdefined in the persons mind and that was really all there was to it so you get word you dont know and cant define then you get into sequence of dont understand anything well this was one of the most important facts because this told us why people blew scientology this told us how we lost people and weve been busy here madly getting dictionary together this is very important factvery important fact so if somebody didnt understand the word scientology then he thereupon skipped the whole subject i think thats interesting isnt it so that tells you why psychology doesnt have to be worried about by you or psychiatrysame root words they obviously wouldnt believe them if theyd go on treating the people the way theyre treating them you see they have definition for that medicine has now broadened itself into the act of healing thats what the word medicine means i think thats very fascinating youll find it in all the latest dictionaries the medical profession has been able to get next to medicine is the act of healing of course to thee and it means something you take in spoon so theyve had to redefine their words in order to include they hoped both psychiatry and surgery those were the embarrassing areas they had to include and so now we dont know what medical doctor means and they try to push it down the throats of state legislatures you very often will find yourself very puzzled as why is medicine in that particular area well thats because theyve redefined their professional terminology which i think is gorgeous its gorgeous so we dont have to worry about them butthis poor guy going into medical school see medical school hes going to medical schoolhes had it he doesnt know what hes going to study in medical school because he thinks it has to do with what we used to consider the word medical to mean see well what did it mean i dont knowand they sure dont but theyre now trying to broaden it over to an imperialism of all healing see theyre now trying to make this mean this other thing only it doesnt mean this other thing dont you see its mess so one of the first things youve got to do is recognize when youre relaying anything to anybody that you dont pour on their heads words which boggle them see like the word boggle what does the word boggle mean see right in the middle of that youd derail colloquialism means popeyedbecome popeyed with puzzlement also derived from bog down meaning get ones wheels in the mud you clear from that point of the track all right now the upshot of this is then that we have been on very long and very arduous run in the field of technology and research and weve come out with our hands full of lilies and also violets and other things and life is much more pleasant and looks brighter and as soon as i get some of these books and materials written and the dictionary out and as soon as i get the pe books written why then i can go back to my emeter and keep going now every once in while during this period of time somebody has said well now why hasnt ron gone totally ot and gone well thats why ron hasnt gone totally ot and gone and if anybody chides with it im going to get mad all right so much for all that now that brings you uptodate on what the immediate history is concerned now as far as planning all during these last many months ive been putting together the basic planning of scientology from standpoint of programing what do central organizations do and whats the drill and hows it going to go in this way and i went ahead and planned boom and youll see the recent policy letters of just this last week and if you understood them read them very thoroughly went over them with finetoothed dictionary and got yourself in high state of comprehension as to how it interlocked why you would become little bit popeyed because this is the wildest thing that has ever been advanced around here this thingthis thing is machine in which not too much can go wrong if it does go wrong it cant derail it very much dont you see because its in from every place and it has to do with books and the reason central organizations havent gotten along well and why you see them staggering and their staff getting low units and so forth its very difficult to trace they just forgot to advertise books for instance hasi london up here used to spend 127 pounds month on book ads in magazines and they stopped doing that because they thought for little while they didnt have enough money to do it well then they made sure they didnt have enough money to do it by not advertising so by dropping out that one pinjust that one pinwhy they actually slowed the wheels of scientology dissemination immeasurably now by putting that pin back in and turning it into gold spike why these wheels will start to roll and then by making money available for that book advertising then make the books available which are comprehensible you see behind that program and then fixing it up so that if they dont advertise books the tax collector will get all the money which will make them frantic central organization cant do anything with the money which is invested in membership and so forth except advertise books with it its in sealed account as soon as membership is bought then it goes into that local account and it can only be spent for book ads and that account i can see it now itll go up there to twothousand pounds threethousand pounds then to fix it up so that people have to buy memberships see and then so that central organizations will insist on them buying memberships in spite of the fact that they get tremendous discounts from the memberships dont you see get 50 percent discount if you own both memberships you see horrendous both memberships cost much less than the amount of money you save by buying them so thats wheeled around the only place membership money can go into this book account and the only place that book account can go is into dissemination i can see it now thatand with the emphasis on the book ad so i can see it now the thing gets twothousand pounds in it see everybody is sitting there see and then they write despatch off to saint hill and they say dear ron we have about twothousand pounds worth of bills which we owe in the cape town area and itd be awfully nice if we could take that book money therei know we owe saint hill little moneybut if we could just pay our bills and we could borrow this money and i will write back check to local advertising agency i will have contacted and just commission them for twothousand pounds to place book ads i can see other organizations watching it you see it goes 1000 dollars it goes 2000 dollars it goes 3000 5000 8000 dollars in this account 10000 dollars in the account and so forth and then they get periodic letter saying make sure that you dont have any excess profits in any of your accounts at the end of the year because of course they become taxable and its all taken away by income tax and they all of sudden think of this wonderful account that theyve been storing and saving money in dont you see well how do they get rid of this do we transfer it to saint hill they havent read the policy letters you see or something you know well just give the name of local advertising agent and we will get rid of it for you and theres 10000 dollars worth of book ads see and then they earn lot of money by selling the books you see but the money they earn by selling the books also goes into the book account see so the more books you sell the more money there is in the book account and of course the more you advertise the more books you selland the more books you sell the more people come in it really doesnt depend then too much on how many students you train or how many pcs you process see therell be that number but the number of students and pcs will increase and the more students and pcs come inthe more books are sold the more students and pcs come in well of course the more memberships will be bought the more advertising will be bought the more ads will be placed the more students and pcs will come in do you see by having ended the scarcity in this particular direction then the field auditor has just had pistol pointed at his head if he doesnt become franchised auditor and that is nobody does anything to him but all these beautiful new book adsas soon as the person hasnt written the organization for three monthsyou know he bought book and then didnt say anything else three or four months they didnt come in through the front door or something like thatthen thats automatically moved over as an address plate into the franchised auditor files and the franchised auditor can then buy large stacks of brochures which are already pre addressed which he simply mails out and of course hes contacted all the book buyers in his area you follow now because he knows about definitions all hes got to do is ask them the burning question what word didnt you understand and if theyre the type of person who would never be audited to apply that particular action you get the idea the field auditor then would be rather denied that service if he werent franchised auditor right hed have to be franchised auditor to be able to buy these lists of preaddressed brochures and he can buy as many as he wants and of course as soon as the advertising goes these have lots of fresh names in them he mails those out from his zone or area and he of course can buy them just for his area and so he gets very busy in that particular area if hes franchise holder and the field auditor sits out there without any such communication lines so he wants franchise obviously right but franchise holder now cant teach anything but an has course he cant teach an hqs course i had to drop the boom on that for the excellent reason that i want the guy to become city office so hes very successful as franchise holder and he becomes city office the reason he becomes city office is because if he becomes city office he can teach an hqs course and an hca course of course he wants to become city office right away see but then if he becomes city office he has an hco book account and he has to control that exactly the same way that its controlled in any central organization and of course then that advertises books and that gets people in and so forth well this is one of these doubling dissemination programs and i can foresee that the saint hill course will probably become just an organizational briefing course by about 1968 probably grooving people in to how they should handle their immediate organizational area or something like that and r6 training by 1968 will pass out to central organizations you see i see that trend in the wind so this course will probably run until 1968 and then there wont be any more course as such which i have been warning people straight along i wasnt going to do this forever man so anyway thethis plan haswell its got all kinds of little pins in it one way or the other which keep it corralled and the thing is forced into widelevel action of course most of the books within yearall the books being advertisedwill be brandnew books written exactly at the level of the people who are buying them and with very careful dictionary things along with this comes your new has course and your first week or two of your has course is in actual fact the free pe and you just start in and teach this has course and at the end of the first five or six evenings or something like that why then the person has to sign up for the remaining course and it goes thirty to forty evenings and its mostly devoted to just telling people what its all about theyve come down there to find out what this is all about and we tell them whats it all about and mans relationship to the universe and we dont give them any braincracking words and in other words theyre away and this is done in peculiar and particular way which is brandnew and that is to saythe pe has been one of the hardest areas there is because the staff will normally take somebody who is not too au fait meaning hep with the businessyou know he really didnt make too good staff auditor so they moved him over into pe well of course this guys got havoc at his fingertips you know and thats what happens in pe courses they put somebody in there whos not quite straight on it and is having little difficulty or something because he cant hold another executive well this is the most important gate in the organization dont you see and every now and then theyve made this mistake and so they have shut off their entry into the organization well now i know this is very difficult to find somebody and its very great strain to have somebody stand up there and talk to an audience and so forth for long period of time on subject which hewould have to bone up on hed practically have to look over this whole thing i know you but youre you you see and youve been at it long time you got lot to say you know lot of things about it well lets take this city office in the mythical town of keokuk there is town of keokuk by the way and there is city office there thats why i always put one there so someday someones going tosomebodys going to delight by opening up an office in keokuk anyway thethink of this bird now hes got lot of other things on his mind and he hasnt got too groovedin staff and that sort of thing hows he going to teach pe and hows he going to keep pe from falling on its head well thats veryi worked on it quite while and finally worked out fairly simple answer you take book it has ait has the lecture in it its got the whole lecture in it and it says exactly what youre supposed to do and every word that is used in english is footnoted at the bottom of the page of exactly what its definition is and then the scientology words are defined very precisely in the text itself dont you see in other words strange words or words that might be beyond one syllable are in the footnotes and then the scientology words are described at some length in the text do you see and this is simply something that somebody stands up and reads and what you got to have for pe then is somebody who can talk loudly with good diction and you can find him very easily you see now all hes got to do is be on deck and talk loudly with good diction and he can go on down the line of this pe book and then theyre certain things hes supposed to do and pe evening breaks into three periods and the first period is simply reading the text the next period is discussion of the text particularly discussion of the definitions of these various words the fellow who isnt going to understand any part of it you know very well that hes stuck back in some earlier subject and you simply read this other thing off and you tell him so and you tell him to go look up that earlier subject whatever it was and go down to the dictionary and get the words in it defined bit better and then come back and its specific remedy and its going to hit the bypassed charge dont you see so he isnt going to arc break with you theoretically unless you chop him up or something hell say yeah what do you know thats true thats true i was all mixed up with spiritualism for years my mother was spiritualist and ectoplasm what the hell is ectoplasm you know yeah and hell be sitting there after that worrying about whats ectoplasm and hell leave you alone and you get on with it and hell finally be curious enough next day to look it up hes been told to and hell do so and that clears up that to large degree thatll handle the majority of such responses see all right that discussion period then reveals any difficulty theyre having with definitions see and then theres the third period of the evening were accustomed to pes having only two periods in the evening but actually its cut up into three periods so the first one isnt all that long dont you see and the third period of the evening is each student in the pe takes up his little ballpoint and he writes demonstration of the things which he is asked to demonstrate at the end of the read text and he writes his name and address on that piece of paper clean and clear and hands it in to the instructor now thatif he was so timid then that he didnt have chance to get into the general discussion and if that as it sometimes happens gets monopolized by somebody whos got rocks in his head and you will thatyoull discover thats the case every now and then every evening its just this fellow jing bingblatt is just thishes just blowing everybodys brains out dont you see he doesnt see how this reconciles itself with the local communist policy and in vain you tell him hes in the wrong meeting you know andbut something like that anyway these little quiet people that sit around and dont say anything normally they just feel little bit out of comm but theyre perfectly interested and so forth and they never get chance to talk back dont you see and they get sort of jammed in with the flow of it all so what you do is put this third period in and everybody there must put down demonstration that is an example out of life that has happened or that he could imagine happened that would demonstrate the points in that lecture now he may have two or three of these that hes got to put down and he hands that paper in to the instructor and thats good night you see all right now that is the rough outline not too rough either of pe course and their textbook then goes something on the order i dont know how long but its something like thirty to sixty of these lessons and theyre actually covering the whole field of ontology with crash because even little kid worries about the questions which come up in that fieldmans relationship to the universe see who am iyou know where did i come from was i found in cabbage patch you know how do i get along with my fellow man if one can and questions of this particular character are quite germane to everyone and philosophy only went upstairs because nobody understood it and everybody blew but the professors so you see it was originally subject that was owned by man dont you see and it longer is so we just put it back into his hands again and we call thisand here is trick term and you will find out this term will be preempted and handled and somebody will try to cop it and copy it and that sort of thing thats why were going to put it in titles and so forthapplied philosophy somebody asks you what scientology isscientology is applied philosophy they say gee you know ive got quarrel with philosophy i thought it was some kind of psychology psychology was an attempt to apply philosophy oh well scientology takes in lot of that i mean theres lot of stuff in that but theres great deal more of course it takes in the field of philosophy that so you get the idea see audience mmmm mmhm so along with this we had to have an easy quick way to say exactly what it was and so that was the designation so your pe coursesthey dont come down there to study some oddball psychology or study something else or study spiritualism or something they come down there to study applied philosophy and without philosophy man doesnt get along well in life because philosophy by popular definition is something you use to get you over the rough places it is what you say to yourself in some tricky epigram that then permits you to face up to the fact youre being steamrolled and the definition of whether or not youre true philosophy is whether or not you will take headon all the slings and arrows of misfortune you see without flinching so this is more or less the way it sits in the general ken and so forth but its actually very noble very upstairs endeavor andin the public ideaand nobody is going to find any fault with it and i can see now the medical profession trying to pass law in keokuk state legislature or kangarooland against the writing and study of philosophy of course everybody would think the exact truththeyre pack of madmen you see so this also is part of this general planning and campaigning which ive been at since april and it shaped up so that i tried to figure out how you could communicate scientology very easily to somebody without getting crisscrossed and getting it compared to everything now some wiseacre is going to start all of sudden quoting kant cant at you you know or something like that well just stand there and nod just stand there and nod yes yes thats all very true dont find yourself in big argument about it dont you see but you wont get into many arguments about it something like good roads and good weather dont you see if you do certain things in life and if you really did discover your relationship to the universeand these are proper subjects of inquiry in the field of philosophyand what actually is the actual composition of manyou find people going to get awful interested because theyve been asking themselves that question ever since they could talk dont you see so you dont drop out anything that youve got in scientology see you lose nothing of what youve got this is just your level 0 presentation of it that makes it very smooth very easy very glib very fast dont you see and far from removing vitality from it you will find out it puts it back into it again so anyway this isthis is the general shape of things so that pe course should be very easy to teach the people came down there to find out how to get along in life better and on theyour advertising is always on the suspicion that they havent been getting along in life quite as well as they thought they should have which is very safe assumption in this society and so youryour pe course as such takes up just the first few lessons in that same textbook and then goes on for the remainder now maybe thosethat textbook is split into two volumes one of which covers the pe and one of which covers the rest of the course i wouldnt be able to tell you at this moment which is which but in any event the book theyre being taught from is available to the student being taught you see now this is another proof of the situation even though it is being read to themand youll find out people are very funnyeven though it is being read to them even though theyve already read it they will sit there and listen to it being read dont you see and actually what they experience is agreement they dont experience boredom now thats only true of fairly searching truths and fairly searching material on which new thought matter can be found any time you go over it it is not true of little red ridinghood because little red ridinghood is not designed around the provocation of thought but the provocation of depravity i think its been barred from russia now because it teaches cannibalism and several other things anyway the upshot of it is that here is rather searching material in which new material could be found anyway and you have new shape of teaching this and of course all of this is built on the structure of what we already know about education now in addition to that providing i dontproviding i can keep meself whipped up and fascinated with it because whenever i start writing anything for university i myself start yawning in the first place you dont ever dare say anything thats one of the things that you mustnt do use lot of words but dont say anything and i have such an antipathy to false pomposity in prose or anything like that when i start to write anything in very pompous fashion or that sort of thing why i get to laughing too hard and i tear it up because its swindle you see its mess i remember i completely estranged one of my aunts one time by telling her that her who was pianist needed to develop himself style and public presence and that these were highly individualistic things and that they were totally planned and they werent spontaneous things which sprang from the clouds simultaneously with blast of lightning they were simply planned presence or presentation and unfortunately told her that her favorite conductor was simply standing up there in his tail coat and his white tie making the motions he was making and acting the way he was acting as public presence and that it was simply calculated action and that i knew one of them even went into temper tantrums as calculated public presence you see that this in other words was down to the crass level of press and public relations dont you see im afraid i estranged her forevermore she really hasnt been civil to since then and her sonhas not beenhe finally branched off and became successful in his own line but the point was that if you planned anything like that dont you see why that would be very bad indeed and that this was not natural that standing up and conducting symphony orchestra with temper tantrums now and then was natural action you know natural like putting on an old pair of boots or naturali dont know how anybody managed it you know because of all of the pomposity i have ever watched in my life it has come from some of these arts which pretend they are above it all you see and theyve got worship mixed up with art and i assure you that worship is merely root word and has nothing to do with art things like awe and reverence shouldnt be mixed up in education thats all im trying to say education is communication and youve got to have some attention at the other end but theres reason to overdo it now it just doesnt seem to to be subject for the church is the church and education is education you get the idea so anyway writing these materials up will be little bit of chore but if i enter into this zoneand that is to write textbook which would become the standard textbook of schools and university students and teachersit just mentions that this is out of the materials of scientology and of course has got my byline on it otherwise it just runs off and tells them how to study what theyre studying and how to teach what theyre studying and gives them the various axioms and rules connected with this particular line and how to handle the slow student and how to speed the student up and the mistakes they can make and the various types of examinations in other words just run this off on ratatattatatattata scientific approach this is codification of it here and there and so on now that of course would answer all academic questions with regard to scientology and it would answer tomorrows demand for scientology because little sammythe second that he got into trouble in grammar school and so forthwould be being taught out of that textbook you get the idea and hed get through the lines with that textbook and then when he really pulled cropper when he was senior in high school or whatever he became and so forth all of sudden would start studying it himself dont you see and he moves over in the university and its foregone conclusion of course that hes an expert on this particular subject so somebody comes along and tells him he needs some processing or something like that hed say of course you follow in other words this has been serviceable and workable so therefore he has comparable datum to scientology at large you see so therefore if this education worked and that got people over the rough spots why naturally then why other parts of scientology would work you see so it gives him basis of comparison and invades the field of education most mercilessly well that is almost an extraneous project and is not project on which i have my heart completely set because i get to laughing when i try to phrase something so that professor will not find any objection to it at all because you see i know that if he sees something simply phrased in its totality of simplicity then he will immediately relegate it to the firstgrade grammarschool teacher dont you see and he wont hold it up along the line and at the same time if its filled full of bunch of outrageous englishyou see command of english is command of the simple words of english my vocabulary was tested one time at 250 thousand words which i thought was rather interesting because i dont use them and i think command of english depends on what not to use rather than what you use do you follow i didnt mean to enter any plug sideways on vocabulary but that was the vocabulary figure but you donti know better than to use prerogative when i mean rights dont you see and let somebody crash into syllablemultisyllabilization paragraph after paragraph after paragraph when you could have said it much more easily fact which i learned in the field of writing it was called to my attention one time that one of the largest vocabularies in the english language was held by writer by the name of henry now you read henry in vain for any big words well the mystery of all of this is is he knew so many words he didnt have to use any big ones and that was pointed out to by very wise artist one time that that happened to be the case and that this was the end product of really knowing english well now how we can get by the professor without airing his particular frailty with which is the only thing he goes into agreement the guy absolutely dies if he doesnt have an adverbial clause modifying participial phrase of some character or another which syntaxes itself to death you know you read some of the old articlesthats strange word thats just thrown in sidewaysyou read the old encyclopaedia britannica and it was fairly simple but as the years went along they got more and more experts to write for it and now very often you look up an article on something and you read it in vain i finally developed system whereby i took piece of paper and blocked off the modifying clauses of which there might be as many as fifteen or sixteen from the middle of the paragraph you see and i carefully sought out the subject and sought out the object and sought out the verb dont you see and then would get that sentence straight out of that particular paragraph to find out what they were talking about and you know id very often find out they werent talking about anything anyhow very amusing business so theres certain pose or certain style which is accepted in certain areas as the right pose or the right style which carries with it certain presence dont you see and most of them are calculated and quite few of them are quite false and some of them are very unnecessary and in the field of philosophy actually walking around in old tattered rags and standing like statue at street corners looking thoughtful for hours on end isnt actually necessary to having wisdom but you know the greek the later days of greece had this pretty pretty tangled up philosopher had certain pose and certain style and certain presence but i call to your attention greece had long since gone past the zenith of its philosophical golden age when this sort of thing was occurring so that we find the emperor justinian had carried the fact of being philosopher to such an extent that it meant to him not bathing wearing ragged clothes being terribly plain eating very peasant type food he was emperor of the romans you see he could have had scrambled peasants tongues you see while sitting in the middle of the sahara desert and eating very plain food you see and enduring everything i dont know he had it mixed up with fakirism from india i suppose it was from the stoic philosophy that he had imbibed but he would have been very very happy to have lain for hours on bed of spikes dont you see and this showed he could endure things so well and so on and that was the way he had it defined but that was the pose of the day he got chance to lay on his bed of spikes he didnt put the empire together but went over to conquer persia and got nice long spike through him and that was the end of that but theim just making the point that it becomes pose too dont you see and whenever you enter falsity into any particular subject you may get perpetuity of that subject it may get muchmay endure much longer butbut its going to have something wrong with it if you look at anything around that isnt running right youre going to find it basically has lie connected with it theres going to be lie connected with that somewhere and if it isnt easy to handle then theres lie connected with it in some way theres something awry now ill give you good example of this in handling pcs ptp if you handle pcs ptp on monday and handle it again on tuesday and handle the same pcs ptp again on wednesday you can just plain make up your mind that that isnt the ptp theres lie connected with this either he isnt hung up in ptpthats probablethe most probable of these thingshe isnt but its something else entirely different that is wrong with him or the ptp being put forward by him is known and outrageous lie or it is continuing to be ptp because hes told somebody some fabulous falsehoods connected with this thing you see were getting in other wordsbecause of the character of asisness we cant asis it you see because it doesnt have in it what its supposed to have in it so when you audit preclear who is giving you bunch of stuff which doesnt exist then of course he cant asis it because it isnt there to be asised do you see so he gets in terrible mess and he tells you life is being mean to him well this could be perfectly true thats right the environment is perfectly capable of it but when he starts giving specific ways life is being mean to him and he has cognition about these things and then you start asking him for what hes doing in life you see or try to unpeel this package ofhes doing something too you seelife cant lean on him without him leaning on life you know and you start getting those and you find out the condition isnt gaining anynothings gaining dont you see you arent getting tone arm motion and youso forthand you look at this well just make up your mind youre looking at situation which has got falsity connected with it somewhere either hes kidding you or lifes kidding him oror theres lie here some place dont you see and of course its not socially polite to ask your pc now lets see is life lying to you or are you lying to you know thats not socially polite but could be effective at times now in other words the entrance of any false action prevents it from being asised but at the same time in order to get anybody to pay any attention to something at all it has to be in certain form with which they have agreementthey have agreement dont you see so what im doing is splitting these hairs of how much am i willing to concede in order to let the professors have something you see and you know im just being stubborn dog about it i just wont give very much but then this would mean that without book on education you would be trying to reform the entire university educational system of the world without any communication into it and you know i think that would be stupid too so i dont know what ill do with regard to this so i dont know whether youll ever have the book or not but im trying anywayim trying anyway that about rounds up the finite basic administrative planning and steps and so forth and covers the lastwell now i suppose its getting up there to around two years almost it will be two years on the twentysecond of this coming january and thats only about 2½ months away so this has been quite sprint and central orgs are beginning to realizeand city officesthat im paying some attention to them now and things are greasing up little bit better but lot of them got very sad and shaky during this particular period and worked themselves ragged and tried to hold things together and did beautiful job of it and im very proud of them because they had rough run of it i wasnt giving them anything they could use on anybody dont you see and i wasnt paying much attention to the sos ditditditdadadaditditdit you know i wasnt on the other end of the line be selfdetermined i would say you know used that as an excuse not to get involved but sort of let things run themselves but for the last many months now ive been working at it hammer and pound trying to get things straightened out and here at saint hill why weve been very alert on the comm lines and were putting it all back together but what were putting it together for of course is boom and were not putting it together for anything less than boom because thereshardly worthwhile spending your time on it you see unless it was going to boom so dont worry too much about the oppositionthere isnt any opposition newspaper that would refuse to take copies of book for advertisements and so forth is actually refusing freedom of speech and newspapers dont go in for stepping on freedom of speech because their whole livelihood depends on it dont you see and they will advertise books they might not advertise courses might not advertise practices they might not advertise anything else but they will all advertise books that isnt why were advertising bookswere advertising books because its the best thing to advertise thats why were advertising books and in central organizations i always when i wanted to gun up theirtheir activities in any given area and so forth why id just start banging books you see and doing most of the promotion work around there myself and everything would start moving on up the line it was all very happy now whether or not this winds up to anything or not is question one could logically ask but one would have to face that question of where else is there on the planet any answers to anything that is going on and as soon as one honestly answers that out of his own recognition of whats going on in scientology and then take fairly good look at whats going on elsewhere we realize at that point that boom does not to any degree depend upon any further information that we have because were filling total vacuum and thethere are people around who will shudder at the idea of all of sudden the amount of tumble and turmoil weve learned so much about tumble and turmoil and how to handle it and how to shunt it here and there and do this and that with it that it actually doesnt constitute much of menace it only constitutes menace if you dont have the publications if you dont have the administration lines to put things on youll find every central organization even though they may have forgotten it is subdivided in such way that you just start shedding hats in other words an individual on post just starts shedding hats the hats are all multiple and i know where they are multiple dont you see so that youll find two or three titles are being packed by the same person but he probably also hasnt noticed that hes wearing as many as thirtyfive hats if you really started into landslide of some kind or another youd find an org sec in order to get all of his hats worn under stress and so forth would in actual fact require thirtyfive people who havent been there before dont you see and those people are each handling this one little section which is now very busy sector dont you see now the only thing that made things enturbulated in 1950 is nobody was prepared for any such action and there was administrative control everybody keeps overlooking this fact it was boom with central control of any kind whatsoever because there was administrative control in the central organizations at elizabeth new jersey there was none i tried to get things done all on my little old lonesome without any board action without any backup without anything of the sort and the board most of the time was in total disagreement with everything that was being done and the next thingidwedi didnt have control of the organization there wasnt anything i could do to shove the thing through so i just threw in the sponge and went off and wroteworked away on another book and so forth but it just couldnt have run dont you see in the first place that first central organization had about six or eight bosses separate independent and not even vaguely in line with each other so that everything that was done somebody would come along and say do something else there was administrative pattern of any kind whatsoever there were two or three people on that board who believed implicitly that scientology was business where you made lot of bucks and it scientology is an activity which if done well gives you the additional embarrassment of getting rid of money and trying to organize it along these lines nobody had any agreement on its basics but weve got now all these years of experience backing that up so we have worries about booms but of course i look at the field auditor whos going to see all of those juicy mailing lists going out to the franchise center over there in the other side of town and who is going to walk around and apply for franchise on the idea that he might get couple of pcs you see well hes already for it hes for it because whatll happen to him from there on hed just be caught up in hurricane and whats going to occur right immediately after that is hes going to need certain things to buttress up the activities in which he is engaged and so forth and as franchise holder hes going to find life is very very hecticvery hectic because of course he isnt smoothly organized into working unit and eventually in desperation hes going to find out that if he sends somebody to the central organization they can be trained in the administration necessary to run city office and he thinks maybe that might be better in addition to that you can get rid of all these training requests and they wouldnt keep going over to that new city office now on the other side of town and that finance would make it possible to do lot of things get new building and that sort of thing so hell send somebody in to the central organization to be trained and at that first moment why he will run into the fact that there are orderly ways in order to handle this unless of course some franchise holder has been working in central organization in which time he would know he would alsoi find out these guys only go so long and then they turn themselves into city office scat they wouldnt work outside the organizational structure if you held gun on them theythey oh you know that kind of reaction so theyll learn this technology so were doing things to collect this technology at the present moment and most central organizations are well away on the project of writing up every policy they have ever known about in connection with the particular post which they are handling and those are being collected here and were putting those together into book of policies which justgot it all down the line ratatattatatattatatattat which of course is not terribly important to you as an auditor in auditing pc unless you realize that boom were being started in your direction with completely missing orderly procedure of expansion and that would be catastrophe that would be something to worry about but fortunately we have tremendous experience and so forth in this line were putting that together and that can graduate on up too we actually have tougher administrative structure than you would normally expect to exist its more precisei didnt mean the word tough its more precise really more hidebound more squared around more compartmented it can get so severely compartmented the whole organization will still functionfall out of communication with each other ive seen it happen everybody got so specialized in his own hat and refusing to do anybody elses hat to such degree the organization just went out of communication and its entirely inside itself but oddly enough still kept functioning was quite interesting so thewe had an organization board up there at hasi london out on the public board in other words the organization chart was up there where the public could get to it very easily without walking in the front door they could just walk into the outer hall and one day staff member up there came out and collided with tall cadaverouslooking fellow with long beard with piercing gleam through his pincenez and he was going over this board 100 percent ooh tedado is that so that so is that so and the staff member asked him who he was well he was the secretary of the british psychiatric association anyway he was going over this thing and so forth and he says its wonder we never get anyplace we never have anything like this he was very impressed and all of sudden he had seen something there that looked like an organizational structure and he intimate with the leading psychiatric organization of great britain knew that he didnt even have any vague shadow of anything like that so its wonder scientology is going of course he now attributed it totally to administration and organization see and i imagine he went back home and invented an org pattern made up out of his hospital administration experience of world war i ofthe captain kicks the lieutenant and the lieutenant kicks the sergeant and the sergeant kicks the private and the private kicks the mule and fails to realize that this cycle winds up with the mule being now in foul frame of voice kicks the head off the captain but anyway theres the size and shape of things to come now none of that is swami that is to say i can wear good swami hat and i like these bath towels and tencentstore diamonds its just really marvelous go to party and wrap bath towel around your head and put woolworth diamond on the front of the bath towel and tell peoples fortunes that used to be one of my biggest gags and so forth only id tell them what i saw in their banks an fbi man at one time or another at party where it was gagged up there in washington bunch of departmental heads and that sort of thingthis fbi man id already told him the case he was working on slightly and this had mystified him because that was dead secret dont you see i told his fortune with this deck of cards you see and he ererand so onvery creepy about the whole thing but he knew there was something false mixed up with this he hung around the edges and he watched tell the fortunes to an awful lot of other people around there and eventually when id finally taken off the bath towel that some girl had gotten and given the old dowager back her brooch why he came around to hostess had given drink and soon as she went away he leaned over to and said how were you doing that oh i said dead simple and i pulled the cards out of my pocket and showed them to him turned them over on the back and i said you see these baseballs well now you notice the number of stitches in that baseball and you notice this next card over here well the number of stitches in that baseball i said well thats seven stitches and then theyre at certain pattern and that makes seven of diamonds i turned it over and showed him it was the seven of diamonds he said oh he said marked cards he said of course and went away well anyway thatwithout anywithout any crystal ball or anything that is the shape of the future what the crystal ball is i dont know along about this time theyre busy electing president over in america and lord knows what thatlloutcome will be and i havent even dared to look at my crystal ball for fear it would explode you know but the fashion seems to be new governments maybe itll be kept up over there so that is basically the planned shape of things to come that we are taking all the steps to promote and put into being and square around you are here at this particular time rather fortunate because youre into the beginning of the kickoff on this and of course anybodys been here since april has been part and parcel of this and those that have been with us for many more years than that of course they know the drill one way or the other and they know this will work because theyll say yeah thats right hey hey hey how come i didnt notice that the book ads were dropped out howd that happen and i imagine their assoc secs and so forth sitting around right now kicking themselves you know soon as theyve been tipped off to the fact that this was the missing link theyve been sweating over trying to get units up and theyve been trying to do this and trying to do that well theyve dropped out their basic dissemination line of course is books and they even have bulletins in their hats that tell them the basic dissemination line is books you see but it was just that one datum that seemed to be as important as other datums but doesnt happen to be actually its the datum you see so naturally with that out why theyve had bit of rough time matter what they did administratively you put that back in again with crash and crush it through why the rest of it ought to follow through very easily how long this will take i wouldnt be able to forecast at this particular time i imagine it will be up to very very good proportions within year and with franchise right now why you could obtain mailing lists made out of the inactive lists of central organizations but because that has put it in your area why you still can do something with it and just to get the line grooved in until we get the new book names to start issuing on this basis you see you know i mean well be selling books and therefore getting new names and of course the lists which will beone will be getting later of course will behave lots of new bookbuyers and things like that and lots of fresh names but right now its just being issued on the other basis anyway to make long story short i would say that it would bestart very visibly getting up to speed in just few months itd be very visible i would say within year itd be going very well and smoothly and people wondering exactly where and how to turn and fit this in with that and id say in five or ten years why itd be hurricane and in maybe fifteen or twenty years it wont even be planet well thats their lookout okay so thats the size of what is going on right at the present moment and i was going to talk to you about something else but i saw that you were interested in what was happening and what had happened and that you have perfect right to know this because this is your scientology too thank you very much
