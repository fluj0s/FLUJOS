framework sec 3 that for the purposes of carrying out the provisions of this title any moneys heretofore and hereafter appropriated for the use of any executive department commission bureau agency

that had been added to the defense budget in fy1942 largely to fund huge armament program the president only identified total defense appropriations due to the need for secrecy this is war budget the details of war program are of course in constant flux its magnitude and composition depend on events at the battlefronts of the world on naval engagements at sea and on new developments in mechanized warfare moreover war plans are military secrets under these circumstances i cannot hereafter present details of future war appropriations however total appropriations and expenditures will be published so that the public may know the fiscal situation and the progress of the nations effort the defense program including appropriations contract authorizations recommendations and commitments of government corporations was 29 billion dollars on january 3 1941 during the last 12 months 45 billion dollars have been added to the program of this total of 75 billion dollars there remains 24 billion dollars for future obligation in this budget i make an initial request for war appropriation of 136 billion dollars for the fiscal year 1943 large supplemental requests will be made as we move toward the maximum use of productive capacity nothing short of maximum will suffice i cannot predict ultimate costs because i cannot predict the changing fortunes of war i can only say that we are determined to pay whatever price we must to preserve our way of life3 the first significant legislative response to the presidents defense requests in the fy1943 budget was the fourth supplemental national defense appropriation act 1942 public law 422 56 stat 3739 signed into law on january 30 1942 the measure provided several fy1942 and fy1943 appropriations for military and non military

page vi crs4 provided regular appropriations for fy1943 for many navy department accounts as well as many supplemental appropriations for fy1942 president roosevelt did not seek and congress did not provide blank check for war spending instead the president made specific requests for funds which congress dealt with through the usual annual appropriations process supplemental defense appropriations for fy1942 as well as regular and supplemental appropriations for fy1943 and later years were provided in the regular form that is as specified dollar amounts for specified accounts these amounts ranged from very small items tantamount to what would be regarded as line items today to much larger amounts that represented the lumpsum approach more commonly used at present for example the regular appropriations act for the navy department for fy1943 appropriated 2000 to the naval war college and 39000 for the care of lepers on guam as well as 29 billion for naval ordnance and ordnance stores and 40 billion for construction and machinery costs for the replacement of naval vessels for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21010
