of terrorism so as to protect critical sectors of the us infrastructure and reduce risks to public he alth and the environment competing bills s 994 and s 157 have been introduced into the senate both would require chemical facilities to conduc t vulnerability assessments and develop and implement site security plans but the approaches of the bills differ with respect to the chemicals and facilities covered planning requirements and mechanisms for federal and facility accountability in addition s 157 would assign the lead responsibility to the us environmental protection agency epa wh ile s 994 would give this role to the department of homela nd security dhs both s 157 and s 994 would provide c onsiderable discretionary authority to the lead agency to define the universe of regulated chemicals and facilities the bills would initially include chemicals for wh ich risk management plans are required under the clean air act from that list s 157 would exclude liquified petroleum gas that is used as fuel or held by retail facility for sale as fuel s 994 would exclude similar facilities using flammable substances as well as all federal facilities s 994 but not s 157 would requi re the secretary to consider cost and technical feasibility and scale of operations in selecting facilities with respect to planning the empha sis of s 994 is on enhancing the security of facilities against acts of terrorism while s 157 emphasizes lessening potential consequences of releases caused by criminal acts s 994 would require security measures and identification of equipment

terrorists in the even t of terrorist attack on or theft from such facilities release of such chemicals could threaten public health and the environment in addition many of these chemical facilitie s provide products or services that are strategically or economically critical to the us infrastructure or public health for discussion of the potential threat from vulnerability to and consequences of terrorist acts at chemical facilities see crs repor t rl31530 chemical plant security the 108th congress is considering legislation to reduce chemical facilities vulnerability to acts of terrorism in order to protect critical sectors of the us infrastructure such as oil refineries chemical plants and electric utilities and also to reduce risks of chemical releases to public health and the environment two bills with these goals s 994 and s 157 have been introduced into the senate both would require chemical f acilities to conduct vul nerability assessmen ts and develop and implement site security plans but the approaches of the bills differ with respect to the chemicals and facilities covered planning requirements and mechanisms for federal and facility account ability in addition s 994 would assign lead responsibility to the departme nt of homeland security dhs while s 157 would give this role to the us environmental protection agency epa this report describes the different approaches taken in the two bills and analyzes associated policy implications it does not discuss th many minor differences between the two bills which do not generally raise controversial policy issues the report begins with overviews of the two bills followed by the issue analysis table 1 summarizes selected provisions of the two bills in sidebyside format other proposed legislation is discussed in th crs report referenced above background s 157 the chemical security act s 157 was introduced january 14 2003 by senator jon corzine and referred to the committee on environment and public works the bill is similar to s 1602 which was repor ted by the committee on environment and public works in the 107th congress s rpt 107342 s 157 would direct the epa in consultation with dhs to issue regulations designating certain combinations of chemical sources and substances of concern as high priority categories for oversig ht based on the severity of potential harm in the event of release proximity to population centers threats to national security threats to critical infrastructure threshold quantities of substances that pose serious threathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31958crs2 1both bills define security measures generally in terms of hardening the defenses of potential targets using methods that detect ad versary action impede adversary progress and respond to neutralize the threat for more di scussion of options for reducing risks see crs report rl31530 chemical plant security pages 2427and other safety or security factors that the administrator of epa in consultation with the secretary of dhs determined to be appropriate1 owners and operators of listed facilities would be re quired to conduct vulnerab ility assessments identify hazards and prepare prevention prepare dness and response plans to eliminate or significantly lessen the potential consequences of an unauthorized release each owner or operator of regulated facility also would be required to certify in writing that the vulnerability assessment and plan had been completed and the plan implemented the bill would require facility owners and operators to submit to epa copies of vulnerability assessments and plans along with certifications within 12 months of enactment of the chemical s ecurity act for assessments and 18 months for plans assessments plans and cer tifications would ve to be updated periodically s 157 would direct epa to review each assessment and plan determine compliance and certify that determination vulnerab ility assessments and plans would be protected from public disclosure under the freedom of information act foia the bill also provides for early review and certification of assessments and plans that are submitted before epa issues regulations epa would be authorized to issue compliance orders 30 days after either notifying chemical source that its assessment or plan was inadequate or first offering compliance assistance if the plan were not revised to comply with epa requirements if dhs notified chemical source that its plan or implementation was insufficient to address threat of terrorist attack and the chemical source failed to take adequate action in response to that notice dhs would be authorized to secure necessary relief from district court to abate the threat s 994 the chemical facilities security act s 994 was introduced may 5 2003 by senator james inhofe and referred to the committee on environment and public works s 994 would authoriz the dhs to oversee security assessments and planning at selected chemical facilities the secretary would be directed to list and may promulgate the list by regulation chemical fac ilities that should be subject to regulation based on the likelihood that facility will be the target of terrorism nature and quantity of substances of concern present potential extent of death injury or serious adverse effects to human hea lth or the environment potential harm to critical infrastructure and national security cost and technical feasibility scale of operations and other securityrelated factors that the secretary determines to be appropriate and necessary s 994 would require the secretary to promulgate regulations directing owners and operators of listed f acilities to conduc t vulnerability assessments identify hazards and prepare security plans to reduce vulnerability to terrorist release and to respond in the ev ent of release written certification of compliance would be required by dhs fro m each owner or operator on schedule to be determined by the secretary copies of vulnerability assessments and plans would be retained at fac ilities but must be submitted to dhs on request and updated periodically httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31958crs3 s 994 would direct dhs to conduct or require the conduct of vulnerab ility assessments and other activities including thirdparty audits to evaluate and ensure compliance with promulgate d regulations and proce dures endorsed by rule endorsements are discussed below vuln erability assessments and plans would be protected from public disclosure under foia and state and local disclosure laws penalties are provided for unauthorized disclosure the bill would authorize the secretary to identify and endorse security measures that are substantially similar to any requi rements promulgated by dhs endorsement would indicate compliance with assessment or planning requirements if the endorsed assessment or security procedures were implemented any person could petition the secretary for endorsement of existing pro cedures if the secretary chose not to endorse such procedures the secretar would have to pr ovide written notice explaining why the petition was denied vulnerability assessments and response plans that were in accord with endorsed procedures would be exempt from other regulatory requirements dhs would be authorized to disapprove any assessment or pl an and to order revision if it does not comply with regulations or if the plan or implementation is insufficient to address the results of vulnerability assessment or threat of terrorist release the secretary would be required to provide notice of disapproval explaining deficiencies and to identify appropriate steps to achieve compliance s 994 would require the secretary to issue compliance order if plan were disapproved and compliance had not been ach ieved by date determined by the secretary to be appropriate the bill also would authorize the secretary to provide training relevant to the chemical facilities security act to state and local officials and facility owners or operators issues although the two bills are similar in many ways some differences raise significant policy issues selected i ssues are discussed in this section chemicals and facilities covered both s 157 and s 994 would provide considerable discretionary authority to the administering agency to define the universe of regulated chemicals and facilities both would have the lead agency begin by looking at the chemicals liste d by epa under the clean air act caa section 112r3 this list includes chlori ne anhydrous ammonia methyl chloride ethylene oxide vinyl chloride methyl isocyanate hydrogen cyanide ammonia hydrogen sulfide toluene diisocyanate phosgene bromine anhydrous sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide all designated in th caa and other che micals that have been determined by epa to pose the greatest risks to human health or to the environment based on three criteria severity of potential acute adverse health effects the likelihood of accidental releases and th potential magnitude of human exposure epa has promulgated list containing 77 acutely toxic substances 63 flammable gases and volatile flammable liquids and high explosive substances 59 federal register 4478 jan 31 1994 both bills would allow the list to be revised as necessaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31958crs4 2for definition of security measures see note 1s 994 would exclude flammable substances that are used as fuel or held by retail facility for sale as fuel congress adopted this exclusion in 1999 amendment to the caa primarily in re sponse to complaints from propane retailers and users they argued that the or iginal caa risk management planning requirements were redundant given laws in 48 states requiring compliance with national safety standards established by the national fire protection association nfpa prior to the 1999 amendment epa argued that the caa required it to list flammable and combustible liquids other th an gasoline because they were involved in more than 128000 reporte d accidental releases from 1987 through 1996 according to federal databases however congress overrode epas objections s 994 maintains this exemption which covers facilities that store or use any flammable substance including propane butane natural gas acetylene or proylene s 157 would adopt narrower exclusion for li quified petroleum gas propane or mixture of propane and butane when used as fuel or held by retail facility for sale as fuel thus s 157 would exempt from security requireme nts propane dealers and users without exempting other facilities that might st ore or use other fuels another explicit difference between the b ills is that s 157 would include and s 994 would exempt federa l facilities from assessment nd planning requirements federal facilities include hea dquarters as well as regiona l facilities such as military bases federal pen itentiaries office buildings and national boratories finally the bills differ with respect to the selection criteria the administrating officer is to use in listing or designating f acilities for regulation both bills direct the government to consider verity of threat and seve rity of potential harm in designating facilities but the bills appear to emphasize threats from different causes as well as different conseque nces of chemical releases the emphasis in s 157 is on eliminating or significantly lessening potential consequences of unauthorized releases an unauthorized rel ease is defined as release that is not authorized by the owner or operator of the facility and that is caused at least in part by criminal act on the other hand s 994 focuses on ensuring or enhancing the security of facilities against acts of terrorism 2 thus the final catchall criterion in s 994 is to consider other securityrelated factors while s 157 requires considering other safety or security factors s 994 includes criteria not mentioned in s 157 cost and technical feasibility and scale of operations since the purpos of the criteria according to s 994 section 4f3b is to he lp the secretary determine which facilities present risk sufficient to justify classi fication as chemical source inclusion of these criteria seems to imply that sufficient risk under s 994 would depend in part on the burden of reducing it although s 157 doe s not incorporate these criteria neither does it prohibit such consideration planning requirements the different emphases of the bills ie on reducing potential consequences of criminal acts as in s 157 vs securing facilities from terrorists as in s 994 are reflected in their requirements for vulnerability assessments and planning s 157 requires an assessment of the vulnerability of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31958crs5 source to an unauthorized release and prep aration of prevention preparedness and response plan required plan components are actions and procedures including safer design and maintenan ceaimed at reducing conseque nces to public health and the environment the bill defines safer design and maintenance as implementation to the extent practicable of 1 practi ces that reduce the possibility of release and the associated threat to public health and the environment ie so called inherently safer technologies 2 measures that contai n control or mitigate release 3 buffer zones and 4 security measures s 994 requires an assessment of the vulnerability of the source to terrorist release and site security plan that includes security measures and equipment plans and procedures to respond in the event of terrorist release but it does not require implementati on of buffer zones or inherently safer technologies accountability as mentioned previously both s 157 and s 994 provide considerable discretionary authority to the epa administrator and the dhs secretary respectively within broad gu idelines they may c hoose which facilities to regulate which substances are of concer n threshold levels of chemicals that pose significant threat and appropriate leve ls of vulnerability analysis and security planning the general advantage of executive discretion is the flexibility it allows the decision maker to efficiently adjust program to accommodate new information or unusual circumstances another possibl benefit is that sensitive information about facility security as well as c onfidential business information might be protected more effectively if agencies are not obligated to publicly defend their decisions possible disadva ntage is that congress and the general public may find it more difficult to oversee and evaluate agen cy performance due to lack of specific statutory requirements to which the agency can be held accountable as well as lack of access to decisionmaking processes several bill provisi ons that might open decisionmaking processes to public scrutin or otherwise provide some independent assurance that the purposes of the bills would be achieved are described below agency consultation and certification s 157 has numerous requirements for consultation the epa admin istrator is directed at key decision points to consult with the dhs secretary when designating highpriority facilities the administrator also must consult with state and local agencies responsible for planning for and responding to releases and providing emergency health care the administrator must consult w ith all of those groups as well as the chemical safety and hazard investigation board estab lished under the caa section 112r when promulgating regulations requiring vulnerability assessments and security planning after facility assessments and plans have been submitted to epa and reviewed the administrator must certify in writing the admin istrators determination as to whether each assessment and plan complies with re gulations s 157 also requires facility owners and operators to work with local law enforcement first responders and employees of facilities when assessing vulnerability and preparing the security plan s 994 does not require the secretary to consult or certify terminations about individual facilities but the bill does authorize the secretary to request technical and analytical support other than field work from other agen cies and to reimburse such agencies as appropriatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31958crs6 facility submissions s 157 would require all owners and operators of chemical facilities identified by epa regulations to submit completed vulnerability assessments and security plans to epa before deadlines established by statute furthermore owners and operators must certify in writing that assessments and plans comply with epa regulations and must submit such certifications to epa s 994 does not require submission to dhs of plan s or assessments except at the request of the secretary it does however require owners and operators of listed facilities to certify to the secretary in writing their compliance with dhs regulations the secretary is required to promulgate dead lines for certif ication neith er bill would protect these selfcertification documents from public disclosure thirdparty audit s 994 would require the s ecretary as appropriate to conduct or require to be conducted vulnerab ility assessments nd other activities including thirdparty audits to evaluate compliance with the chemical facilities security act thirdparty audits are in spections of facilities assessments andor plans conducted by an uninterested but expe rt party s 157 has similar provision early complianceendorsement both bills provide procedures that would allow facility owners and operators to prepare vulnerability assessments or security plans without reference to federal regulations if such assessments or plans met certain criteria three key differences ex ist between the provisions of s 157 and s 994 s 157 would authorize approval of pl ans and assessments submitted prior to promulgation of final regulations while s 994 would allow approval of plans and assessments matter when they were produced as long as they were in accord with endorsed model practices s 157 would require the administrator to review and approve or reject facility plans and assessments on casebycase basis while s 994 would authorize approval or rejection of model secu rity practices eg perhaps the vulnerability assessment methodology blished by the american chemistry council trade group for chemical ma nufacturers for its members and facto approval of all facility plans and assessments that are in accord with those models s 157 specifies procedural and substan tive standards that facility owners or operators would have to meet while s 994 directs the secretary to accept security measures that the secretary fi nds substantially equivalent to whatever requirements the secretary mig ht choose to promulgate s 157 would direct the administrator to review assessments and plans that facility owners or operators submit prior to publication of final epa regulations if the administrator in consultation with the secretary determined that an assessment or plan met the consultation planning nd assessment requirements for highpriority facilities that are specified in section 4a3 of the act the administrator would be required to certify compliance without requi ring any revision of the assessment or plan section 4a3 would require owners or operators of facilities to 1 consult with local first responders and employees in assessing vulnerability of the source to terrorist attack or other unauthorized re lease identifying hazards that may result from release and preparing prevention preparedness and response plan and 2 include in the plan actions and procedures to eliminate or significantly lessen thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31958crs7 potential consequences of an unauthorized release including implementation to the extent practicable of any technology pr oduct raw material or practice that reduces the possibility of release prior to sec ondary containment control or mitigation wellmaintained secondary c ontainment control or mitigation equipment security measures and buffer zones s 994 would not require f acility owners or operators to submit assessments or plans to the secretary rather the bill would authorize the secretary to promulgate regulations endorsing certain security practices as being in compliance with the law s 994 would authorize any person to pe tition the secretary for endorsement of procedures protocols and st andards established by law industry or federal state or local government authorities the secr etary would be authorized to endorse such measures if they are implemented and if the secretary finds them substantially equivalent to any requirements the secr etary may establish s 994 directs the secretary to provide to each petitioner written notice and explanation if the secretary chooses not to endorse the petitione rs security measures the bill would exempt from other regulatory requirements any vulnerability assessments and plans that are in accord with endorsed security measures the intent of s 157 it appears is to ensure through epa oversight the quality of vulnerability assessments and security planning at individual facilities quality is likely to come at the price of considerable epa resources however because there may be thousands of facility assessments and plans submitted before epa issues regulations on the other nd facility owners nd operators may fear that under the provisions of s 157 their early planning efforts might be in vain if epa later decides to reject their facility plans that fear might cause owners and operators to delay assessments and planning until epas final regulations take effect thus defeating the purpose of the early compliance provision in contrast s 994 would minimize th paperwork burden and might provide assurance to facility owners and operators that their facility assessments and plans if prepared in accord with established g overnmental or industrial guidance will be acceptable to dhs however s 994 provides limited means for reassuring the public that individual facility plans and assessments are adequate for security needs this potential problem might be resolved by the secretary however for example if the secretary promulgated rules requiring submission of copies of facility plans or required thirdparty audits disclosure both bills would prevent public disclosure under foia of any information provided to epa or dhs excep t the selfcertification of compliance submitted by facility owners and operators s 994 has several additi onal provisions to prevent disclosure of information firs t it would preempt state and local laws that require disclosure sec ondly s 994 would require with some exceptions punishment of anyone who knowingly or recklessly disclosed protected information removal from fe deral employment or office and either imprisonment for up to one year fine or both th ird provision would prevent public disclosure of the secretarys disapproval of an ssessment or plan finally s 994 would require all information obtained or submitted by the secretary to be treated in any judicial or administrative action as if it were classified httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31958crs8 these provisions of s 994 might make it difficult for terrorists to obtain useful information about the vulnerability or secu rity arrangements of chemical facilities on the other hand the same provisions may ma ke it difficult for us citizens to learn about risks to which they might be exposed and prevent informed public involvement in federal state and local policy development and contingency planning with respect to such risks conclusion s 157 and s 994 are similar in that both bills would require chemical facilities to conduct vulnerability assessments and deve lop and implement site security plans in addition both bills provide the federal lead agency with considerable discretionary authority in selecting facilitie s and chemicals for regulation the bills differ in the extent to which federal congressional nd agency and public oversight would be facilitated s 157 ge nerally provides more opportunities for oversight and informed public policy development and contingency planning while s 994 is more protective of sensitive information so as to avoid facilitating terrorist acts the bills also address somewhat different threats ie criminal acts vs terrorist acts and prescribe different approaches to reduce risks s 994 would mandate planning and implementation to ensure plant security and adequate resources to respond to any emergency while s 157 w ould require to the extent practicable actions and procedures to reduce the potential for harm in the event of chemical release in addition to security and emergency preparedness measures httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31958crs9 3the caa112r directs epa
