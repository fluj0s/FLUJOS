its strong performance in the marc h 2003 legislative elections in 2005 tensions within the party resulted in defections to new party the democratic revolutionary front fdr however in the march 2006 legisla tive elections the fmln recaptured left leaning electoral support from the fdr winning 32 of 84 legislative seats legislative record early in his term president saca garnered broad support for criminal justice reforms and used multiparty negotiations to facilitate passage of some aspects of his reform agenda including an antiterrorism law and electoral reform saca used support fro m third

candidates for the 2009 presiden tial elections are maur icio funes well known journalist and talk show host standing for the fmln and rodrigo ávila former head of the salvadoran national police standing for the arena party many analysts are predicting that the 2009 elections will be more competitive than previous elections given that the fmln has selected moderate media figure rather that former guerrilla leader to serve as its candidate the more radical wing of the fmln will be represented by funes running mate sá nchez céren analysts predict that funes main challenge will be to criticize current arena policies without alienating business leaders or foreign investors ávila may need to distance himself from the saca governments increasingly unpopular economic and security policies although funes app ears to be maintaining lead in most opinion polls the race has tightened since ávila selected arturo zablah political outsider who may appeal to m oderate voters as his

zones since th 1980s salvador has benefitted from preferential trade agreements such as the caribbean basin initiative and later the caribbean basin trade partnership act c btpa of 2000 which ve provided some of its exports especially apparel and related items dutyfree entry into the us market as result the composition of salvadoran expor ts to the united states has shifted from agricultural

that are resulting from the agreement proponents main tain that the mcc compact as well as existing trade capacity building programs f unded by the united states and other donors should help ensure that vulnerable sectors be nefit from the agreement critics also argue that although caftadr has provisions prov iding for the enforcement of domestic labor and environmental laws nd creating cooperative ways to bring those laws up to international standards the pe nalties for countries not enforc ing their laws are relatively weak some have challenged the assertion that labor righ ts and working conditions have improved in the region as result of caftadr
