george mason university reported that between 1948 and 2001 when the party in control of the white house changed the number of pages printed in the federal register increased an average of 17 during the ﬁnal three months of an outgoing administration when compared to the number of pages during the same period in nonelection years susan dudley the current administrator of the oﬃce of information and regulatory aﬀairs oira at the oﬃce of management and budget omb wrote in 2001 while senior research fellow at the mercatus center that the sharp increase in regulatory output at the end of the

administration involving change in the party controlling the white house the level of rulemaking activity by federal agencies tends to increase on may 9 2008 white house chief of staff joshua b bolten issued memorandum to the heads of executive departments and agencies stating that regulations to be finalized in this administration should be proposed later than june 1 2008 and final regulations should be issued later than november 1 2008 despite this directive federal agencies appear to be issuing an increasing number of midnight rules at the end of the bu sh administration including number of rules attracting controversy one approach that previous presidents have used to control rulemaking at the start of their administrations has been the imposition of moratorium on new regulations by executive departments and independent agencies accompanie d by requirement that the departments and agencies postpone the effective dates of certain rules however for final rules that have already been published in the federal register the only way for the departments or agencies to eliminate or change the rules is by going back through the rulemaking process although the administrative procedure act 5 usc 551 et seq permits agencies to shorten the rulemaking process for good cause an agencys use of this exception is subject to judicial review the congressional review act cra 5 usc 801808 permits the use of expedited procedures primarily in the senate to disapprove agencies final rules the cra requires that agencies submit all final rules to congress before they take effect if congress adjourns its annual session sine die less than 60 legislative days in the house of representatives or 60 session days in the senate after rule is submitted to it then the rule is carried over to the next session of congress and subject to possible disapproval during that session although only one rule has been disapproved using cra procedures since the legislation was enacted in 1996 congress has frequently added provisions to agency appropriations bills to prohibit the finalization of particular proposed rules prohibit the development of particular regulations restrict the implementation or enforcement of certain rules and put conditions on the development or implementation of particular ru unlike cra disapprovals however these provisions do not eliminate the regulations from the code of federal regulations and do not prevent the agency from issuing the same or similar regulation legislation introduced late in the 110 th congress hr 7296 would generally prevent any midnight rule ie rule published in the last 90 days that president serves in office from taking effect for 90 days after an agency head is appointed by new president and would allow new agency head to disapprove midnight rule within 90 days after being appointed this report will be updated when additional information becomes available

of regulatory activity at the end of presidential administration are systematic significant and cut across party lines 3 one explanation for the issuance of midnight rules is the desire of the outgoing administration to complete its work and achieve certain policy goals before the end of its term of officewhat cochran termed the cinderella effect however issuing midnight rules can also help ensure legacy for president as another observer said putting agency rules into effect before the end of presidency is way for an administration to have life after death4

1 2008 and final regulations should be issued later than november 1 20085 he also said the administrator of oira would coordinate an effort to complete administration priorities in this final year and that the oira administrator would report on regular basis regarding agency compliance with this memorandum6 as of the date of this report however the oira administrator had not produced any such

the bush administration one indication is the number of final rules being sent to the government accountability office gao pursuant to requirements in the congressional review act cra 5 usc 8018087 according to data obtained from gao from january through may 2008 gao received an average of 232 rules per month from federal agencies however from june through october 2008 gao received an average of 310 rules per montha 336 increase the rate of rule submissions from june through october 2008 is also higher when compared to the same junethroughoctober period in 2007 241 rules per month in 2007 compared with 310 rules per month in 2008a 286 increase the cra also requires gao to provide congress with report on each major rule eg rules with at least 100 million impact on the economy within 15 calendar days of the rule being sent to gao and congress 8 during the first five months of 2008 federal agencies sent total of 21 major rules to gao however in the second five months of 2008 june through october the agencies sent gao 46 major rules including 18 in the month of october alonea 119 increase the number of major rules in the second five months of 2008 is also higher than the number in the second five months of 2007 46 major rules during this period in 2008 compared with 28 major rules in 2007a 64 increase

number of rules being reviewed by oira before being published in the federal register although the oira data do not include rules issued by independent boards and commissions eg the securities and exchange commission or the federal communications commission the data do include all cabinet departments and independent agencies like the environmental protection agency epa and the social security administration also the data include only rules considered significant under executive order 12866rules that are the most likely to be controversial 9 in september october and november 2008 oira reviewed total of 222 significant rules including 150 final rules the monthly average num ber of rules reviewed in those months 74 was 45 higher than the average for the preceding eight months of 2008 51 more tellingly the monthly average number of final rules that oira reviewed in september october and november 2008 50 was more than three times the average of the previous eight months 16 also the 7 the congressional review act in 5 usc 801a1a requires all final rules to be sent to each house of congress and gao before they can take effect this requirement applies to all federal agencies including independent boards and commissions such as the securities and ex change commission and the federal communications commission 8 5 usc 801a2a 9 section 3f of executive order 12866 defines rule as significant if it would 1 have an annual effect on the economy of 100 million or more or adversely affect in material way the economy sector of the economy productivity competition jobs the environment public health or safety or state local or tribal governments or communities 2 create serious inconsistency or otherwis interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency 3

g345g561number of rules that oira reviewed in september october and november 2008 was nearly 82 higher than the same three months in 2007 222 versus 122 and the number of final rules was nearly 146 higher 150 versus 61 on the other hand there is also evidence that the pace of oiras work is declining as of october 31 2008 there were 136 rules under review at oira including 84 final rules the agencies with the most rules under review at oira at that time were epa 21 rules including 7 final rules the department of health and human services hhs 18 rules including 13 final rules the

and the department of homeland security dhs 10 rules including 8 final rules as of december 12 2008 however there were only 79 rules under review at oira including 44 final rules certain agencies

g348g561rulemaking that supplemented but did not supplant the january 29 1981 memorandum22 section 7 of the executive order directed agencies to suspend or postpone the effective dates of all major rules that they have promulgated in final form as of the date of this order but that have not yet become effective23 excluded were major rules that could not be legally postponed or suspended and those that ought to become effective for good cause agencies were also directed to prepare regulatory impact analysis for each major rule suspended or postponed and to refrain from promulgating any new final rules until final regulatory impact analysis had been conducted on january 22 1993 leon panetta the director of omb for the incoming clinton administration sent memorandum to the heads and acting heads of cabinet departments and independent agencies requesting them to 1 not send proposed or final rules to the office of the federal register for publication until they had been approved by an agency head appointed by president clinton and confirmed by the senate and 2 withdraw from the office of the federal register all regulations that had not been published in the federal register and that could be withdrawn under existing procedures 24 the requirements did not apply however to any rules that had to be issued immediately because of statutory or judicial deadline the omb director said these actions were needed because it was important that president clintons appointees have an opportunity to review and approve new regulations in contrast to the reagan memorandum and executive order 12291 the panetta memorandum did not instruct agencies to postpone the effective dates of any rules most recently on january 20 2001 andrew h card jr assistant to president george w bush and chief of staff sent memorandum to the heads and acting heads of all executive departments and agencies generally directing them to 1 not send proposed or final rules to the office of the federal register 2 withdraw from the office rules that had not yet been published in the federal register and 3 postpone for 60 days the effective dates of rules that had been published but had not yet taken effect 25 the card memorandum instructed agencies to exclude any rules promulgated pursuant to statutor or judicial deadlines and to notify the omb director of any rules that should be excluded because they impact critical health and safety functions of the agency the memorandum indicated that these actions were needed to ensure that the presidents appointees have the opportunity to review any new or pending regulations g7g143g143g142g140g157g156g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g5g138g155g141g561g15g142g150g152g155g138g151g141g158g150g561 in february 2002 gao reported on the delay of

g349g561rules and nine others had been altered eg different implementation date or reporting requirement while some agencies allowed the public to comment on the extensions of the effective dates most agencies simply published final rules citing the administrative procedure acts good cause or procedural rule exceptions to notice and comment rulemaking27 one author noted that such practices tended to evade judicial challenge due to their short time frames but they did occasion criticism28 g22g145g142g561g4g152g149g157g142g151g561g15g142g150g152g155g138g151g141g158g150g561 viewed in this context the may 2008 memora ndum by white house chief of staff bolten represents both continuation of trend of presidential involvement in rulemaking and an evolution in that involvement because the congressional review act prohibits major rules from taking effect for 60 days after they are promulgated one effect of the bolten memorandums requirement that final rules be published in the federal register by november 1 2008 would be to ensure that these rules will have taken effect before the 111th congress begins in early january and before the new president takes office on january 20 2009 as result the new president would be unable to do what was done via the card memorandumdirect federal agencies to extend the effective dates of any rules that had been published during the final days of the bush administration but had not taken effectsince the rules would have already taken effect by the time the next president takes office however the oira data discussed previously indicate that at least some major rules could be published late enough that they may not take effect before january 20 2009 thereby presenting an opportunity for their effective dates to be extended by the next administration 29 one publication has recommended that presidentelect obama do so30 other rules published after november 2008 could become final before the new president takes office if they are not major rules or if the issuing agency makes the rules effective in less than 30 days for good cause 27 as discussed later in this report the administrative procedure act allows an agency to avoid notice and comment procedures for rules of agency organization procedure or practice when an agency finds for good cause that those procedures are impracticable unnecessary or contrary to the public interest 28 jeffrey s lubbers ed guide to federal agency rulemaking fourth edition chicago aba publishing 2006 pp 121122 for discussion of these criticisms see william m jack taking care that

published proposed rule but has not published final rule the agency is under obligation to issue final rule unless required to do so by statute or court order to preclude further action on rule the agency may wish to publish notice in the federal register announcing its withdrawal of the rule31 once final rule has been published in the federal register the only way for an agency to change or undo the rule is by going back through the federal rulemaking process32 under informal rulemaking procedures established by the administrative procedure act apa 5 usc 551 et seq agencies are generally required to publish notice of proposed rulemaking nprm in the federal register allow interested persons an opportunity to comment on the proposed rule and after considering those comments publish the final rule along with general statement of its basis and purpose the apa does not specify how long rules must be available for comment but agencies commonly allow at least 30 days the apa generally says that the final rule cannot become effective until at least 30 days after its publication however the apa 5 usc 553 states that full notice and comment procedures are not required when an agency finds for good cause that those procedures are impracticable unnecessary or contrary to the public interest agencies can also make their rules take effect in less than 30 days by invoking the good cause exception 33 when agencies use the good cause exception the apa requires that they explicitly say so and provide rationale for the exceptions use when the rule is published in the federal register the apa also provides explicit exceptions to the nprm requirement for certain categories of regulatory actions such as rules dealing with military or foreign affairs agency management or personnel or public property loans grants benefits or contracts further the apa says that the nprm requirements do not apply to interpretative rules general statements of policy or rules of agency organization procedure or practice two procedures for noncontroversial and expedited rulemaking were designed not to involve nprms direct final rulemaking involves agency publication of rule in the federal register with statement that the rule will be effective on particular date unless an adverse comment is received within specified period of time eg 30 days however if an adverse comment is filed the direct final rule is withdrawn and th agency may publish the rule as proposed rule under normal nprm procedures direct final rulemaking can be viewed as particular application of the apas good cause exception in which agencies claim nprms are unnecessary 34 the other procedure is what is known as interim final rulemaking in which an 31 these withdrawals are recorded in the unified agenda of federal regulatory and deregulatory actions which is published twice year by the regulatory information service center within the general services administration 32 advocates of the unitary executive theory of presidential power assert that the president should be able to make the final decision regarding the substance of agency ruleseven when congress has assigned rulemaking responsibilities to agency officials even in those instances however it is the agency that must take the rulemaking action not the president the president cannot unilaterally eliminate or change rule issued by an executive agency eg by issuing an executive order but advocates of the unitary executive and others assert that the president can generally direct an agency official to do so for more on this issue see tes timony of curtis w copeland specialist in american national government us congress house committee on the judiciary federal rulemaking and the unitary executive principle hearings 110 th congress 2nd sess may 6 2008 available from the author 33 the apa also allows rules to take effect in less than 30 days if the rule grants or recognizes an exemption or relieves restriction or if the rule is an interpretative rule or statement of policy 34 for more see ronald m levin more on direct final rulemaking streamlinin g not corner cutting continued

immediately but with postpromulgation opportunity for the public to comment if the public comments persuade the agency that changes are needed in the interim final rule the agency may revise the rule by publishing final rule reflecting those changes interim final rulemaking can be viewed as another particular application of the good cause exception in the apa but with the addition of comment period after the rule has become effective35 the legislative history of the apa makes it clear that congress did not believe that the acts good cause exception to the notice and comment requirements should be an escape clause36 federal agencys invocation of the good cause exception or other exceptions to notice and comment procedures is subject to judicial review after having reviewed the totality of circumstances the courts can and sometimes do determine that an agencys reliance on the good cause exception was not authorized under the apa 37 the case law has generally reinforced the view that the good cause exception should be narrowly construed38 that said gao reported that about half of the 4658 final rules published in 1997 were not preceded by an nprm and that in these cases the agencies most commonly cited the good cause exception39 g18g152g156g156g146g139g149g142g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g146g152g151g138g149g561g3g153g153g155g152g138g140g145g142g156g561 congress

legislative procedures for this purpose primarily in the senate40 in essence the act requires that all final rules including rules issued by independent boards and commissions be submitted to both houses of congress and to gao before they can take effect members of congress have 60 days of continuous session to introduce joint resolution of disapproval after rule has been submitted to congress hereafter referred to as the initiation period 41 the senate has 60 session days from the date the rule is submitted to congress to use expedited procedures to act on resolution of disapproval hereafter referred to as the action period42 for example once joint resolution has reached the floor of the senate the cra makes consideration of the measure privileged prohibits various other dilatory actions disallows amendments and limits floor debate to 10 hours if passed by both houses of congress the joint resolution is then presented to the president for signature or veto if the president signs the resolution the cra specifies not only that the rule shall not take effect or shall not continue if it has already taken effect but also that the rule may not be reissued in substantially the same form without subsequent statutory authorization 43 also the act states that any rule disapproved through these procedures shall be treated as though such rule had never taken effect44 if on the other hand the president vetoes the joint resolution then as is the case with any other piece of legislation congress can override the presidents veto by twothirds vote in both houses of congress under most circumstances it is likely that the president would veto such resolution in order to protect rules developed under his own administration and it may also be difficult for congress to muster the twothirds vote in both houses needed to overturn the veto of the nearly 50000 final rules that have been submitted to congress since the legislation was enacted in march 1996

which chamber is in session once introduced resolutions of disapproval are referred to the committees of jurisdiction in each house of congress the house of representatives would consider the resolution under its general procedures very likely as prescribed by special rule reported from the committee on rules in the senate however if the committee has not reported disapproval resolution within 20 calendar days after the regulation has been submitted and published then the committee may be discharged of its responsibilities and the resolution pl aced on the senate calendar if 30

although the cra has been used to disapprove only one rule it may have other less direct or discernable effects eg keeping congress informed about agency rulemaking and preventing the publication of rules that may be disapproved httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34747g15g146g141g151g146g144 g145g157g561g20g158g149g142g150g138g148g146g151g144 g497g561g5g152g151g156g146g141

specific set of circumstances created by transition in party control of the presidency the majority party in both houses of congress was the same as the party of the incoming president george w bush when the new congress convened in 2001 and adopted resolution disapproving the rule published under the outgoing president william j clinton the incoming president did not veto the resolution congress may be most able to use the cra to disapprove rules in similar transitionrelated circumstances 46 g5g20g3g561g515g5g138g155g155g162g152g159g142g155g516g561g18g155g152g159g146g156g146g152g151g156g561 the ergonomics disapproval was also an example of the carryover provisions in the cra section 801d of the cra provides that if congress adjourns its annual session sine die less than 60 legislative days in the house of representatives or 60 session days in the senate after rule is submitted to it then the rule is subject during the following session of congress to 1 new initiation period in both chambers and 2 new action period in the senate 47 the purpose of this provision is to ensure that both houses of congress have sufficient time to consider disapproving rules submitted during this endofsession carryover period in any given year the carryover period begins after the 60th legislative day in the house or session day in the senate before the sine die adjournment whichever date is earlier the renewal of the cra process in the following session occurs even if resolution to disapprove the rule had been introduced during the session when the rule was submitted for purposes of this new initiation period and senate action period rule originally submitted during the carryover period of the previous session is treated as if it had been published in the federal register on the 15th legislative day house or session day senate after congress reconvenes for the next session in each chamber resolutions of disapproval may be introduced at any point in the 60 days of continuous session of congress that follow this date and the senate may use expedited procedures to act on the resolution during the 60 days of session that follow the same date

carryover period in the second session of the 110th congress can be determined only after sine die adjournment has taken place however the likely date or range of dates may be illuminated by examining congressional activity in prior years perhaps most relevantly since the cra was enacted in march 1996 the starting points for the carryover periods during second sessions of congress have always been determined by the house of representatives and have ranged from may 12 to june 23 with the median starting point being june 748 46 see for example susan dudley reversing midnight regulations

g343g344g561there are some indications that the cutoff date for the carryover provisions in the second session of the 110th congress may be even earlier again it appears that the calendar for the house of representatives will determine the cutoff date because the senate has been in session more days late in the year as of december 12 2008 if the house of representatives remains in recess until sine die adjournment the 60th legislative day prior to adjournment will be may 15 2008 under these conditions any final rule sent to congress after may 15 2008 will be subject to disapproval in the 111 th congress g3g153g153g155g152g153g155g146g138g157g146g152g151g156g561g18g155g152g159g146g156g146g152g151g156g561 although the cra has been used only once to overturn an agency rule congress has frequently used provisions added to agency appropriations bills to affect rulemaking and regulations crs analysis of the consolidated appropriations act for 2008 revealed nearly two dozen such provisions in the act which generally fell into four categories 1 prohibitions on the finalization of particular proposed rules 2 prohibitions on the development of regulations with regard to particular statutes or issues 3 restrictions on implementation or enforcement and 4 conditional restrictions on the development or implementation of particular rules49 review of appropriations legislation that was enacted fr om fy1999 through fy2007 indicated that many of the regulatory restrictions in the consolidated appropriations act for 2008 had appeared in one or more appropriations statutes in previous years so were in relevant appropriations bills in all 10 years some had been in multiple years but not all 10 and some were present in only one year in some cases the provisions appear to have been designed to slow down or prevent the issuance of midnight rules issued near the end of presidential administration or to ensure the implementation of rules issued during that period these restrictions in appropriations bills illustrate that congress can have substantial effect on agency rulemaking and regulatory activity beyond the introduction of joint resolutions of disapproval pursuant to the cra however unlike cra joint resolutions of disapproval these appropriations provisions cannot nullify an existing regulation ie remove it from the code of federal regulations or permanently prevent the agency from issuing the same or similar regulations therefore any final rule that has taken effect and been codified in the code of federal regulations will continue to be binding laweven if language in the relevant regulatory agencys appropriations act prohibits the use of funds to enforce the rule regulated entities are still required to adhere to applicable requirements eg installation of pollution control devices submission of relevant paperwork even if violations are unlikely to be detected and enforcement actions cannot be taken by federal agencies also unless otherwise indicated regulatory restrictions in appropriations acts are binding only for the period of time covered by the legislation ie fiscal year or portion of fiscal year50 continued disapproval of rules in subsequent session of congress by curtis w copeland and richard s beth pp 79 49 crs report rl34354 congressional influence on rulemaking and regulation through appropriations restrictions by curtis w copeland 50 see us general accounting office principles of appropriations law third edition volume i gao04261sp january 2004 p 234 which states that since an appropriation act is made for particular fiscal year the starting presumption is that everything contained in the act is effective only for the fiscal year covered thus the rule is provision contained in an annual appropriation act is not to be construed to be permanent legislation unless the language used therein or the nature of the provision makes it clear that congress intended it to be permanent httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34747g15g146g141g151g146g144 g145g157g561g20g158g149g142g150g138g148g146g151g144 g497g561g5g152g151g156g146g141

appropriations act or enacted in other legislation is longer binding on the re levant agency or agencies however some appropriations provisions are worded in such way that they have essentially become permanent or multiyear requirements most of the regulatory restrictions are in appropriations bills providing funds for particular agencies or groups of agencies therefore the prohibitions are generally applicable only to the agencies funded by that appropriations measure however some of the regulatory prohibitions are in the general provisionsgovernmentwide section of one of the appropriations measures for fy2008 title vii of the financial services and general government appropriations act and are therefore applicable to virtually all federal agencies other provisions are worded in such way that their effects are broader than the agencies funded by those particular appropriations bills eg those that prohibit the use of funds in this or any other act to publish or implement regulations 51 on the other hand some of the appropriations provisions limiting regulatory actions may not be as restrictive as they initially appear some federal regulatory agencies derive substantial amount of their operating funds from sources other than congressional appropriations eg user fees and the use of those funds to develop implement or enforce rules may not be legally constrained by language preventing the use of appropriated funds52 also some federal regulations eg many of those issued by the environmental protection agency and the occupational safety and health administration are primarily implemented or enforced by state or local governments and those governments may have sources of funding that are independent of the federal funds that are restricted by the appropriations provisions some state or local governments may also have their own statutory and regulatory requirements that are the same as or similar to the federal rules at issue or may even go beyond federal standards 53 if state or local funds or legal authorities are used to develop implement or enforce regulations those actions would not appear to be constrained by statutory provisions limiting the use of federal funds to restrict action on particular federal laws and regulations54 agencies may also find ways around provisions prohibiting the use of appropriated funds for rulemaking or other regulatory actions for example if an agency is not permitted to use its appropriation to issue formal rule on particular issue it might attempt to achieve the end result through other means eg guidance document that while technically having binding effect 51see us general accounting office principles of appropriations law p 233 which says that general provision may apply solely to the act in which it is contained part of any appropriation contained in this act shall be used or it may have general applicability part of any ppropriation contained in this or any other act shall be used 52 others however take the view that even these nonappropriated funds must be at least figuratively deposited into the treasury and that all spending in the name of the united states must be pursuant to legislative appropriation kate stith congress power of the purse the yale law journal vol 97 1988 p 1345 53 for example under the occupational safety and health act states may set standards for h azards such as erg onomic injury for which federal standard has been established see us general accounting office regulatory programs balancing federal and state responsibilities for standard setting and implementation gao02495 march 2002 54 see us government accountability office principles of federal appropriations law third edition volume ii gao06382 fe bruary 2006 which says that unless stated otherwise expenditures by recipients of federal grants are not subject to all the same restrictions and limitations imposed on direct expenditures by the federal government for this

g343g346g561may be granted great deference by affected parties55 more generally if congress restricts one agency or group of agencies from issuing rule on particular topic another agency with similar

jerrold nadler introduced hr 7296 the midnight rule act the bill defines midnight rule as one adopted by an agency within the final 90 days president serves in office the bill proposes to 1 prohibit any midnight rule from taking effect until 90 days after the head of the agency issuing the rule is appointed by the new president and 2 allow the new agency head to disapprove midnight rule within 90 days after being appointed by publishing statement of disapproval in the federal register and sending notice of disapproval to the congressional committees of jurisdiction however an outgoing president could permit midnight rule to take effect within 90 days of its publication if the president determines by executive order that the rule is 1 necessary because of an imminent threat to health or safety or other emergency 2 necessary for the enforcement of criminal laws 3 necessary for national security or 4 issued pursuant to any statute implementing an international trade agreement the bill states that this action by an outgoing president has effect on the disapproval procedures established by the congressional review act and says that the bills provisions apply to any rule
