wideranging debate as to what approaches might be beneficial part of that discussion has centered around whether assassination of terrorist leaders is or should be one of the options available this report offers summary discussion of the assassination ban in eo 12333 its context and possible interpretations of its scope on december 4 1981 president ronald reagan issued executive order 12333 on united states intelligence activities section 211 of the order provides prohibition on assassination person employed by or acting on behalf of the united states government shall engage in or conspire to engage in assassination section 212 of the order prohibits indirect participation in activities prohibited by the order stating indirect participa tion agency of the intelligence community shall participate in or request any person to undertake activities forbidden by this order eo 12333 is still in force eo 12333 is the latest in series of three executive orders which included assassination bans the first executive order 11905 sec 5g1 41 fed reg 7703 7733 president gerald ford 21976 was part of an executive order issued by president ford in response to concerns raised in the 1970s with respect to alleged abuses by the us intelligence community select committee chaired by senator frank church the church committee in its interim report addressed allegations of possible us involvement in assassination plots against certain foreign leaders in its recommendations section the church committeehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21037crs2 2 see alleged assassination plots involving foreign leaders

organization or government agency to undertake activities forbidden by this order or by applicable law 4 it is interesting to note that the ford order referred to political assassination term which was not defined in eo 11905 while the carter and reagan orders use the term assassination again without defining it it is thus unclear from these orders and the statements accompanying their issuance whether or not this change in language was intended to portend any change in the scope of the ban 5 public papers of the presidents of the united states gerald r ford 197677 book i 362 364 1979 6 public papers of the presidents of the united states jimmy carter 1978 book i 189216 1979 the context of president carters reference was as follows 3 our intelligence agencies have critical role to play in collecting and analyzing information important to our national security interests and on occasion acting in direct support of major foreign policy objectives it is equally important however that the methods employed by these agencies meet constitutional standards protecting the privacy and civil liberties of us persons and are in full compliance with the law to accomplish this objective major section of the executive order is devoted entirely continuedcondemned assassination and rejected it as an instrument of american policy2 the assassination ban in eo 11905 was superseded by executive order 12036 sec 2305 assassination prohibition and sec 2309 indirect participation prohibition3 43 fed reg 3674 3688 3689 president jimmy carter 12678 the pertinent provisions in president reagans eo 12333 in turn superseded those in president carters order what does the assassination ban in eo 12333 cover the term assassination is not defined in eo 12333 nor was it defined in the predecessor orders4 in general it appears that an assassination may be viewed as an intentional killing of targeted individual committed for political purposes however the scope of the term seems to be the subject of differing interpretations both generally and depending upon whether the killing at issue took place in time of war or in time of peace for example it might be contended that the ford executive order and its successors were responding to concerns raised with respect to killing of foreign officials or heads of state and may not have been intended to extend to killing of others such an interpretation would be consistent with the focus of the church committees investigation to which the ford executive order responded in his special message to the congress proposing legislation to reform the united states foreign intelligence community special message to congress delivered feb 18 1976 accompanying the issuance of eo 11905 president ford did not refer to the assassination ban in the order explicitly but did indicate that he would support legislation making it crime to assassinate or attempt or conspire to assassinate foreign official in peacetime5 president carter made only passing reference to the assassination ban in his statement accompanying issuance of eo 120366 and did not refer to it in his remarks on signing thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21037crs3 6 continued to setting forth detailed restrictions on intelligence collection covert activities in support of foreign policy objectives experimentation contracting assistance to law enforcement authorities personnel assigned to other agencies indirect participation in prohibited activities dissemination and storage of information and prohibition on assassinations the fbis intelligence activities longer have blanket exception to these restrictions at the heart of the restriction process is greatly enhanced role for the attorney general as the nations top legal officer to establish and approve procedures to regulate the conduct of the most sensitive intelligence activities these detailed procedures which will be made available to the congressional oversight committees will ensure compliance with the law protect constitutional rights and privacy and ensure that any intelligence activity within the united states or directed against americans will employ the least intrusive means possible and that the use dissemination and storage of such information is limited to that necessary to achieve lawful governmental purposes id at 21516 7 public papers of the presidents of the united states ronald

order nor did president reagan reference the assassination ban in his statement on united states intelligence activities of dec 4 1981 accompanying the issuance of eo 123337 others might argue for broader interpretation of the assassination ban contending that any killing of targeted individual for political purposes would be within the assassination ban in the sweep of the ford carter and reagan executive orders alternatively it might be suggested that the assassination bans inclusion within an executive order on us intelligence activities may serve to distinguish it from and limit its applicability to use of military force in response to foreign terrorist attack on us soil or against us nationals such an argument might place reliance on article 51 of the united nations charter which recognizes that nations have an inherent right of selfdefense nothing in the present charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective selfdefense if an armed attack occurs against member of the united nations until the security council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security measures taken by members in exercise of this right of selfdefense shall be immediately reported to the security council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the security council under the present charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security the right of the united states to defend itself against armed attack has been the focus of some of the recent debate as the united states considers its options in responding to the terrorist attacks of september 11 20018 in the process of rewriting the us army field manual 2710 the law of war

permissibility of an american assassination of foreign continued1a was prepared to explain the term assassination in the context of military operations in memorandum of law 271a it is suggested that in time of peace an element of covert action or surprise attack may be required for killing for political purposes to be deemed an assassination particularly where the target is private individual rather than public figure or national leader the murder for political purposes of national leader in time of peace may be regarded by some as an assassination solely because of the target while others might also consider whether surprise attack was involved for example the 1978 poisonedtip umbrella killing of bulgarian defector georgi markov by bulgarian state security agents on the streets of london falls into the category of an act of murder carried out for political purposes and constitutes an assassination in contrast the murder of leon klinghoffer private citizen by the terrorist abu abbas during the 1985 hijacking of the italian cruise ship achille lauro though an act of murder for political purposes would not constitute an assassination the distinction lies not merely in the purpose of the act andor its intended victim but also under certain circumstances in its covert nature finally the killing of martin luther king and presidents abraham lincoln james garfield william mckinley and john f kennedy generally are regarded as assassination because each involved the murder of public figure or national leader for political purposes accomplished through surprise attack9 in time of war assassination appears to be distinguished in some discussions from cases of lawful killing because the former is carried out in treacherous manner10 treacherous is not defined in the hague convention iv but does not appear to be interpreted to foreclose operations in time of war involving the element of surprise11 however putting price on the head of an enemy appears to be regarded by some as an act which would render resulting killing an assassination as distinguished from lawful attack on legitimate military targets including the enemy chain of command12 review of historical discussions of assassination suggests that this may be in part because by putting price on the head of an enemy one could be encouraging treachery by those close to the target13

order the presiden t may modify or rescind the assassination ban in eo 12333 section 211 by executive order except in specific circumstances an executive order revoking previous order would have to be published in the federal register under 44 usc 1505a if it is deemed to be an order of general applicability however under 44 usc 1505c in the event of an attack or threatened attack upon the continental united states and determination by the president that as result of an attack or threatened attack 1 publication of the federal register or filing of documents with the office of the federal register is impracticable or 2 under existing conditions publication in the federal register would not serve to give appropriate notice to the public of the contents of documents the president may without regard to any other provision of law suspend all or part of the requirements of law or regulation for filing with the office or publication in the federal register of documents or classes of documents such suspension would remain in effect until revoked by the president or by concurrent resolution of congress can congress revoke the assassination ban in eo 12333 to the extent that an executive order relies upon statutory authority congress may also legislate to modify or repeal it in issuing eo 12333 president reagan relied upon the authority vested in him by the constitution and statutes of the united states of america including the national security act of 1947 as amended and as president of the united states of america in order to provide for the effective conduct of united states intelligence activities and the protection of constitutional rights while there is express parallel to eo 12333s assassination ban in federal statutes there is provision in 18 usc 1116 which provides criminal penalties for murder manslaughter or attempted murder or manslaughter of foreign officials official guests or internationally protected persons14 this section applies to murder manslaughter or attempted murder or manslaughter committed within the united states in addition the us may exercise jurisdiction over such acts committed against internationally protected persons outside the united states if 1 the victim is representative officer employee or agent of the united states 2 an offender is national of the united states or 3 an offender is afterwards found in the united states15 internationally protected person is defined to mean chief of state or the political equivalent head of government or foreign minister whenever such person is in country other than his own and any member of his family accompanying him or any other representative officer employee or agent of the united states government foreign government or international organization who at the time

pursuant to any treaty or under the authority of any act of congress authorizing such participation or making an appropriation for such participation and which shall have been designated by the president through appropriate executive order as being entitled to enjoy the privileges exemptions and immunities provided in this subchapter for list of those organizations so designated see 22 usc 288 note 18 sec 2a 19 sec 2b1of his household16 international organization is defined to mean public international organization designated as such pursuant to section 1 of the international organizations immunities act 22 usc 288 or public organization created pursuant to treaty or other agreement under international law as an instrument through or by which two or more foreign governments engage in some aspect of their conduct of international affairs17 international organization does not appear to encompass terrorist organizations or networks nor does internationally protected person appear to reach the leaders of such organizations or networks the earliest version of this provision was first added in 1972 pl 92539 title i section 101 oct 24 1972 86 stat 1071 which predates the ford executive order however it was not referenced by president ford in his special message to congress accompanying issuance of eo 11905 repeal or modification of 18 usc 1116 would not necessarily have any clear bearing on the scope of the assassination ban in eo 12333 on the other hand recent joint resolutions of congress discussed presently may pertain role of congresslegislation on friday september 14 2001 both the house and the senate passed joint resolutions sjres 23 and hjres 64 authorizing the president to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations organizations or persons he determines planned authorized committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on september 11 2001 or harbored such organizations or persons in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the united states by such nations organizations or persons18 in addition the congress declares that this section is intended to constitute specific statutory authorization within the meaning of section 5b of the war powers resolution19 s j res 23 was signed by the president and became pl 10740 115 stat 224 sept 18 2001 this law makes explicit reference to the assassination ban in eo 12333 section 211 however if the assassination ban were to be interpreted to cover us responses to terrorist attacks on us soil the breadth of the authority provided by these joint resolutions might be viewed as sufficient insofar as us responses to the events of september 11 2001 are concerned to encompass actions that might otherwise be prohibited under the assassination ban other legislation has been introduced to expressly revoke the express prohibition against assassination in the ford carter and reagan executive orders see eg hr 19 introduced 1301 and referred to house committee on international relations
