high speed data links and networking software to link military personnel platforms and formations into highly integrated local and widearea networks within these networks personnel are to share large amounts of inform ation on rapid and continuous basis the department of defense dod and the navy view ncw as key element of defense transformation that will dramatically imp rove combat capability and efficiency1 examples of navy ncw programs cec and nifcca the cooperative engagement capability cec system links navy ships and aircraft operating in particular area into single integrated air defense network in which rada r data collected by each plat form is transmitted on real time ie instantaneous basis to the other units in the network units in the network share common composite realtime

by other units in the network it will also permit air defense missiles fired by one ship to be guided by other ships or aircraft the navy wants to install the system on aircraft carriers ae gisequipped cruisers nd destroyers selected amphibious ships and e2c wkeye carrierbased airborne early warning aircraft over the next several years the system has poten tial for being extended to include army and air force systems tests of cec aboard navy ships in 1998 re vealed significant interoperability ie compatibility problems between cecs software and the software of the airdefense systems on some ships in response th navy undertook major effort to identify understand and fix the problems the cec system with the new fixes passed its technical evaluation teche val testing in february and march 2001 and final operational evaluation opeval testing in april and may 2001 in 2002 the primary cec contractor ra ytheon faced potential competition from two firms lockheed and small firm called solipsys for developing the next version of cec called cec block ii so lipsys had devised an alternative technical approach to cec called the tactical com ponent network tcn solipsys entered into teaming arrangement with lockheed to offer tcn to the navy as the technical approach for block ii in latedecember 2002 raytheon announced that it had agreed to purchase solipsys in earlyfebru ary 2003 rayt heon and lockheed announced that they had formed team to compete for the developmen t of block ii some observers expressed concern that these developments would reduce the navys ability to use competition in its acquisition strategy for block ii as an apparent means of pres erving competition the navy in mid2003 announced that it would in corporate openarchitecture standards into block ii divide the block ii development effort into series of smaller contracts for which various firms might be able to submit bids in december 20 03 however the navy canceled plans for developing block ii in fa vor of new plan for developing joint service successor to block i the conference report hrept 108 283 page 290 on the fy2004 defense appropriations act hr 2658pl 10887 dir ected the navy to keep the appropriations committees informed on potential changes to the cec block ii acquisition strategy and stated that if the navy adopts new acquis ition strategy the dditional funds provided in this act for cec block 2 may be merged with and be available for purposes similar to the purposes for which appropriated the house and senate armed services committees in

marine corps shore installations nmci is to in clude total 344000 computer work stations or seats as of january 2006 the navy d ordered 341000 seats and fully implemented about 264000 the navy planned to achieve steadystate operation of all nmci seats during fy2007 in october 2000 the navy awar ded an industry team led by electronic data systems eds corporation an 69b illion fiveyear contract for installing supporting and periodically upgrading the nmci in october 2002 congress through pl 107254 authorized twoyear extension to this contract which is now worth 89 billion congress has closely followe d the program for several years the nmci implementation effort has experienced number of challenges and delays 2005 report from dods weaponstes ting office identified problems found with the program in 20037 on september 30 2004 the navy and eds restructured the terms of the nmci contract to consolidate the number of performance m easures and focus on measuring results rather than implementation steps user reaction to the system reportedly has been mixed8 december 2006 government accountability office gao report on nmci stated nmci has not met its two strategic goals to provide information superiority and to foster innovation via interoperability and shared services navy developed performance plan in 2000 to measure and report progress towards these goals but did not implement it because the program was more focused on deploying seats and measuring contractor performance agains t contractually specified incentives than determining whether the strategic mission outcomes used to justify the program were met gaos analysis of available performance data however showed that the navy had met only 3 of 20 performance targets 15 percent associated with the programs goals and nine related performance categories by not implementing its performance plan the navy has invested and risks continuing to invest heavily in program that is not subject to effective performance management and has yet to produce expected resultshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20557crs5 9 government accountability office information technology dod needs to ensure that navy marine corps intranet program is meeting goals and satisfying customers gao07051 dec 8 2006 10 see mark kellner top dod officials concede nmci woes on hill navytimescom mar 28 2007gaos analysis also showed that the contractors satisfaction of nmci service level agreements contractually specified performance expectations has been mixed since september 2004 while significant percentage of agreements have been met for all types of seats others have not consistently been met and still others have generally not been met navy measurement of agreement satisfaction shows that performance needed to receive contractua l incentive payments for the most recent 5month period was attained for about 55 to 59 percent of all eligible seats which represents significant drop from the previous 9month period gaos analysis and the navys measurement of agreement satisfa ction illustrate the need for effective performance management to include exam ining agreement satisfaction from multiple perspectives to target needed corrective actions and program changes gao analysis further showed that nmcis three customer groups end users commanders and network operators vary in their satisfaction with the program more specifically end user satisfaction survey s indicated that the percent of end users that met the navys definition of satisfied user has remained consistently below the target of 85 percent latest survey results categorize 74 percent as satisfied given that the navys definition of the term sa tisfied includes many marginally satisfied and arguably somewhat dissatisfied users this percentage represents the best case depiction of end user satisfaction survey responses from the other two customer groups show that both were not satisfied gao interviews with customers at shipyards and air depots also revealed di ssatisfaction with nmci without satisfied customers the navy will be challenged in meeting program goals to improve customer satisfaction the navy identified various initiatives that it described as completed under way or planned however the initiatives are not being guided by documented plans thus lim iting their potential effectiveness this means that after investing about 6 years and 37 billion nmci has yet to meet expectations and whether it will is still unclear9 department of defense fficials conceded problems with the implementation of nmci at march
