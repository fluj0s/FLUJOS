specialist in energy and natural resources policy january 21 2009 abstract this report answers frequently asked questions about the geologic storage of carbon dioxide co2 the questions are broadly representative of typical inquiries regarding the process and mechanics of storing co2 underground how much might be stored and what might happen to co2 once it is injected underground geologic storage is one step in process termed carbon capture and storage or ccs following capture and transportation co2 would be injected into geologic formations that have suitable volume or pore space to retain large quantities of the captured gas currently the most promising reservoirs for storing co2 are oil and gas ﬁelds deep saline reservoirs and unmineable coal seams preventing co2 from escaping would require careful reservoir characterization knowledge gained from over 30 years of injecting co2 underground to enhance oil recovery would be applied to storing co2 for ccs purposes given the complexity of most geologic reservoirs and the potentially huge volumes of co2 that may be injected risk of some co2 leakage over time may never completely be eliminated variety of techniques are available for monitoring leaks from reservoir however the longterm hundreds to thousands of years fate of co2 stored underground is not thoroughly understoodhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34218g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and committees of congress g561

co 2 would be injected into geologic formations that have suitable volume or pore space to retain large quantities of the captured gas currently the most promising reservoirs for storing co 2 are oil

with careful characterization of potential reservoir and monitoring of co 2 migration during and after injection the detailed fate of co 2 stored underground may not be thoroughly understood the us department of energy doe has made an assessment of the potential sequestration capacity across the united states and parts of canada and has determined that there exists sufficient volume to store approximately 600 years of co 2 produced from total us fossil fuel emissions at current rates the sequestration capacity estimate is primarily drawn from existing information on the geology and depends on several assumptions about geologic sequestration mechanisms how the doe estimate will compare to the actual sequestration capacity will depend in part on the results from series of seven largescale co 2 injection experiments to be conducted by seven regional carbon sequestration partnerships across the united states doe has awarded funds totaling 4567 million for the seven injection tests which are scheduled to begin in 2009 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34218g23g151g141g142g155g144g155g152g158g151g141g561g5g138g155g139g152g151 g561g6g146g152g161g146g141g142g561

carbonmost likely in the form of carbon dioxide co 2underground in geologic reservoirs this report answers questions broadly representative of typical queries about why where and how co 2 may be stored underground as well as how much co 2 might be stored in addition this report answers several questions about what might happen if co 2 escapes from underground storage the term carbon sequestratio n includes carbon capture and sequestration ccs but it is also used to refer to the biological uptake of carbon from the atmosphere through photosynthesis this report does not discuss biological sequestration1 capturing and storing co 2 in the oceans is another possible option for carbon sequestration although currently it is not deemed as promising as underground sequestration2 the only operating major commercial project dedicated solely to co 2 sequestration in geologic reservoir today is the sleipner project located approximately 150 miles off the coast of norway in the north sea two other operating commercialscale co 2 sequestration venturesthe weyburn project in south central canada and the in salah project in algeriause the injected co 2 to help recover oil and natural gas respectively in the united states the oil and gas industry injects approximately 48 million metric tons of co 2 each year for enhanced oil recovery eor but permanently sequestering co 2 has not been focus of these eor activities to date the us department of energy doe has sponsored carbon sequestration research and development since 1997 and is embarking on third phase of its geologic carbon sequestration research and development program doe is planning seven largescale co 2 sequestration injection experiments beginning in 2009 g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561

dioxide co 2at its source and storing it instead of releasing it to the atmosphere the first step in ccs is to capture co 2 at the source and produce concentrated stream for transport and sequestration currently three main approaches are available to capture co 2 from largescale industrial facilities such as cement plants or fossil fuel power plants 1 postcombustion capture 2 precombustion capture and 3 oxyfuel combustion capture transportation of captured co 2 is the second step in ccs pipelines are currently the most common method for transporting co 2 in the united states and would likely be used for ccs unless the co 2 could be stored directly beneath the emission source injecting co 2 underground into geologic formation is the likely third step in the process where the carbon would remain out of contact with the atmosphere 1 for information on biological uptake of carbon see crs report rs22964 measuring and monitoring carbon in the agricultural and

ccs is attracting interest as measure for mitigating global climate change because large amounts of co 2 emitted from fossil fuel use and other industrial processes such as cement manufacturing could potentially be captured and stored underground most scientists have concluded that greenhouse gases ghg emitted by humans are influencing the global climate although natural events such as volcanic eruptions or variability in the suns energy output also contribute to climate variability scientists cannot explain the climate changes in the past few decades without including the effects of elevated ghg concentrations from fossil fuel use land clearing and industrial and agricultural emissions 3 of all the ghgs emitted by humans co 2 is considered most important in part because large volumes of the gas are released to the atmosphere each year large fraction of co 2 emitted by human activities remains in the atmosphere in fact co 2 concentrations in the atmosphere have increased by onethird since the industrial revolution from about 280 parts per million ppm in 1750 to over 380 ppm today4 in the united states fossil fuel combustion accounts for 94 of all co 2 emissions onethird of us co 2 emissions come from fossilfueled electricity generating power plants these plants may be the most likely initial candidates for ccs because they are predominantly large single point sources of emissions an assu mption inherent in ccs is that co 2 will be stored underground in sufficient quantity and for sufficient time to significantly ameliorate impacts of ghginfluenced climate change

g344g501g561 co 2 would need to be stored underground in geologic formations5 with characteristics that would trap large volumes of co 2 and not allow significant leakage from the formation some of these characteristics include open spaces known as porosity sufficient interconnectivity between the open spaces so that co 2 can flow laterally or migrate within the formation known as permeability and layer or boundary that is impermeable to upward flow so that co 2 is trapped underground many types of geologic formations have these features such as sandstones and limestones and some geologic formations are tens to hundreds of feet thick and may extend laterally for miles geologic formations that are potential co 2 reservoirs may be analogous to reservoirs that trap oil and gas oil and gas can be found in sandstones limestones and other permeable formations trapped for millions of years until tapped by wells drilled from the surface to extract the hydrocarbons an overlying layer of low permeability commonly referred to as caprock or geologic seal such as shales or siltstones prevents oil and gas from migrating out of the permeable formation similarly caprock or geologic seal would be expected to trap co 2 and prevent it from leaking upwards 3 for more information on the science and policy of climate change see crs report rl34513 climate change current issues and policy tools by jane leggett 4 for more information on why co 2 concentrations are increasing in the atmosphere see crs report rl34059 the carbon cycle implications for climate change and congress by peter folger 5 geologic formation refers to body of rock igneous metamorphic or sedimentary that can be identified by its geologic characteristics eg types of minerals age chemical composition and can be mapped at the earths surface or traceable in the subsurface httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34218g23g151g141g142g155g144g155g152g158g151g141g561g5g138g155g139g152g151 g561g6g146g152g161g146g141g142g561

could trap co 2 underground for example coal beds are commonly porous and permeable and are viewed as potential reservoirs for storing co 2 in addition methane gaswhich forms naturally from the coaloften remains bound to the organic molecules within the coal seam experiments have shown that coal also can bind co 2 to its mineral surfaces and the organic molecules may actually prefer to trap co 2 instead of the naturally occurring methane other types of geologic formations known as black shales also possess this binding ability and may be potential reservoirs for co 2 sequestration shales typically have low permeability however which may make it difficult to inject large volumes of co 2 at rates comparable to other types of geologic formations another type of geologic formation that may be candidate for co 2 sequestration is known as flood basalt6 such as that found on the columbia river plateau large and thick formations of flood basalts occur globally and may have favorable characteristics for co 2 sequestration such as high porosity and permeability of further interest is the capacity for the minerals in these flood basalts to chemically react with co 2 which could result in largescale conversion of the gas into stable solid minerals that would remain underground for thousands of years

into three categories 1 oil and gas reservoirs 2 deep saline reservoirs7 and 3 unmineable coal seams oil and gas reservoirs and deep saline reservoirs are composed of porous and permeable geologic formations as discussed above whose pore space is filled either with hydrocarbons saline water brine or some combination of both coal that is not economically mineable because the beds are not thick enough the beds are too deep or the structural integrity of the coal bed8 is inadequate for mining may have the properties discussed above making them amenable to co 2 sequestration according to us department of energy doe report9 at least one of each of these three types of potential co 2 reservoirs occur across most of the united states in relative proximity to many large point sources of co 2 such as fossil fuel power plants or cement plants deep saline formations are the most widespread and have the most potential sequestration capacity compared to oil and gas reservoirs or unmineable coal seams oil and gas fields or unmineable coal seams however could produce incremental amounts of crude oil or methane with co 2 injection which could offset some of the costs of storing co 2 these techniques are referred to as enhanced oil recovery eor and enhanced coal bed methane recovery ecbm not all power plants cement plants and other large stationary co 2 emitters are close to potential reservoirs however 6 flood basalts are vast expanses of solidified lava that erupted over large regions in several locations around the globe in addition to the columbia river plateau flood basalts other wellknown flood basalts include the d eccan traps in india and the siberian traps in russia 7 sometimes the term saline aquifer is used in this context which is probably misnomer because the saline formations being discussed for co 2 sequestration are typically too saline for drinking or agricultural use shallow aquifers that are brackish might be used as drinking water or agricultural resources with some treatment such as desalination but such aquifers probably would not be considered as prime targets for storing co 2 8 coal bed and coal seam are interchangeable terms 9 us dept of

sufficiently wellunderstoo d so that ra nge of values for sequest ration capacity is given even the lower estimates of sequestration capacity when added together indicate that the united states has enough potential capacity to store its total co 2 emissions from fossil fuels for over 600 years at the current rate of emissions10 excluding co 2 emissions from fossil fuels used for transportation which because of the millions of small and dispersed sources would likely not be captured and stored underground these estimates suggest the united states could store over 900 years of co 2 emitted

compressing co 2 is important because it becomes denser and occupies less space with increasing pressure the denser it becomes the more co 2 can be stored within the pore space of geologic reservoir also with enough pressure and at high enough temperature co 2 becomes supercritical and is dense like liquid but flows like gas the ability of co 2 to disperse efficiently through the interconnected pore spaces of geologic reservoir increases significantly if it is under enough pressure to be supercritical fluid the density of co 2 increases still further if injected deeper due to the pressure of the overlying rocks the denser it becomes the more likely the co 2 may stay underground conversely if co 2 is injected at shallow depths it may be more likely to escape the reservoir above depth of 2500 feet the chances increase that co 2 would tend to rise towards the surface as buoyant gas thus it is likely that oil and gas reservoirs and saline formations located deeper than 2500 feet would be preferred over shallower geologic formations it is also recognized that injecting co 2 deeper increases the distance between the sequestration reservoir and fresh water aquifersused for drinking water or agricultural purposesthat are usually located at shallower depths g11g156g561g5g17

million metric tons of co 2 underground each year to help recover oil and gas resources enhanced oil recovery or eor13 injected co 2 expands and helps drive oil that is not recovered by primary or secondary recovery towards production well14 also the co 2 can dissolve in the oil making it less viscous and able to flow more easily in the geologic formation some of the co 2 is trapped in the reservoir during eor however large fraction of the injected gas may be pumped to the surface with the recovered oil where it is usually separated from the oil and reinjected15 approximately 75 of the co 2 injected for eor in the united states comes from naturally occurring underground deposits only about 12 million metric tons of co 2 comes from manmade sources like fertilizer or gasprocessing plants16 thus only small amounts of co 2 produced by industrial processes are currently injected underground in eor operations 12 see the doe national energy technology laboratory faq information

industry has over 30 years of eor experience engineering techniques and knowledge acquired since the early 1970s may be directly applicable to ccs in fact the amount of co 2 produced from typical 500 megawatt coalfired power plantabout 10000 metric tons per dayis comparable to the daily injection rates for some eor operations17 however because the purpose of eor is to extract oil and gas not normally recoverable the net sequestration of co 2 in eor operations may be negligible because the extracted oil and gas is burned for energy which releases co 2 to the atmosphere moreover even if all of the co 2 used in us eor operations today remained trapped underground it would represent small fraction of the current us emissions fossil fuel power plants alone emit to the atmosphere nearly 50 times the eor amount of co 2 each year the only operating major commercial project dedicated to co 2 sequestration in geologic reservoir today is the sleipner project located approximately 150 miles off the coast of norway in the north sea18 over 2700 metric tons of co 2 per dayseparated from natural gas at the sleipner west gas fieldis injected 2600 feet below the seabed over the lifetime of the project over 20 million metric tons of co 2 are expected to be injected into the saline formation which is sealed at the top by an extensive and thick shale layer19 monitoring surveys of the injected co 2 indicate that the gas has spread out over nearly two square miles underground without leaking upwards longterm simulations also suggest that over hundreds to thousands of years the co 2 will eventually dissolve in the saline water becoming heavier and less likely to migrate away from the reservoir

it is expected that the reservoir characterization process would rule out geologic formations that are too shallow do not have adequate caprocks or other geologic seals are intersected by permeable faults or fractures that might be pathways for escaping co 2 or are in tectonically active areas characterizing geologic reservoirs for the purposes of co 2 sequestration is an ongoing research effort and laboratory experiments field projects and modeling studies may reveal new challenges or breakthroughs abandoned oil and gas fields are often considered first targets for co 2 sequestration to take advantage of the natural configuration of permeable reservoir and overlying caprocks oil and gas reservoirs trapped hydrocarbons for millions of years before wells drilled into the reservoir produced the petroleum conversely oil and gas fields typically contain abandoned wells that may penetrate the target reservoir and potentially provide continuous pathway from the reservoir to the surface any geologic sequestration project would likely identify old or abandoned wells and evaluate whether the wells had been properly plugged and sealed so as to prevent migration of co 2 from below largescale injection tests planned for the next several years should also provide information that would be used to guide site selection for fulls cale ccs operations in the future especially for deep saline reservoirs and unmineable coal seams which do not have the same level of engineering experience as oil and gas fields23 all of these considerations however do not rule out the chance that co 2 could leak from geologic formations even when co 2 is compressed and injected as supercritical fluid it will likely remain less dense than the surrounding fluid it displaces and rise buoyantly to spread out laterally beneath the overlying caprock permeable cracks or other leaks in the caprock could allow the buoyant fluid co 2 to migrate upward how much could leak over what duration and wh at the effects might be are key questions g5g138g151g561g11g151g147g142g140g157g146g151g144g561g5g17

injected fluids interacted with previously existing faults the most notable example in the united states occurred in the early 1960s when scientists recognized relationship between earthquakes and the deep injection of hazardous waste fluids near the rocky mountain arsenal northeast of denver co24 the likelihood of induced seismicity from deep co 2 injection is probably greatest in seismically active areas with recent history of faulting and earthquakes25 the possibility of co 2 injection triggered earthquakes has been recognized for some time thus it is likely that precautions would be observed in the characterization of the potential co 2 reservoir and in the regulatory structure governing co 2 injection schemes for example the epas uic program currently contains provisions addressing induced seismicity 40 cfr 4613 and 40 cfr 4668 the most likely problem associated with induced seismicity would not be shaking hazards at the ground surface that are normally associated with earthquakerelated damage rather small earthquakes induced by co 2 injection could fracture the rocks in the reservoir or more importantly the caprock above the reservoir the epa proposed rule for geologic sequestration class vi wells discussed above would require that owners or operators not exceed injection pressures that would induce seismicity and initiate or propagate fractures across the geologic seal or confining zone creating or reactivating permeable faults might provide conduit for injected co 2 to escape upwards from the sequestration formation through the caprockif the fault extends through the entire caprock formation g5g138g151g561g5g17 g344g561g10g138g155g150g561g18g142g152g153g149g142g501g561 likely public concern would be the potential for large volumes of co 2 to leak to the ground surface and accumulate in lowlying inhabited areas co 2 is not toxic flammable or explosive like methane or propane gas for example but if allowed to accumulate in enclosed spaces at high concentrations eg 40000 parts per million or more co 2 could displace oxygen and cause unconsciousness or asphyxiation26 if co 2 leaks into the soil and root zone at high enough concentrations it may also harm vegetation and crops the chances of such high concentrations forming during co 2 injection for ccs are remote assuming the reservoir is well characterized and fast pathways such as unidentified and abandoned wells or unidentified permeable fractures and faults do not intersect the injection site and connect to occupied lowlying unventilated structures the chances are probably higher for small amounts of leakage during injection or leakage over time given the complex ity of most geologic formations although it is also likely that some reservoirs may never leak co 2

another possible risk is the chance of co 2 leakage into an aquifer used for drinking water or as supply for agriculture if that occurs contaminants that may be contained in the injected co 2 could

of upward leakage are fairly remote the same precautions would apply adequate caprock deep reservoir lack of fast pathways to the aquifer as well as engineering expertise to inject the co 2 without overpressuring the reservoir which could create fractures or increase the chances of leakage around wells over the lifetime of an injection project the chances of the injected co 2 encountering unidentified faults or fractures in the reservoir may increase as the co 2 disperses laterally from the injection point and fills pore spaces throughout the geologic formation however the pressure of the injected co 2 also decreases laterally from the injection point so that the likelihood of large releases over short timespan also decreases with distance from where the co 2 is injected some observers conceptualize the risk of leakage as increasing to peak during the injection phase and then decreasing after injection stops as the co 2 becomes more permanently trapped in the subsurface over time27 injecting co 2 into saline formations lowers the ph increases the acidity of the formation water more acidic waters may dissolve minerals in the formation such as calcium carbonate and release metals such as iron and manganese or other elements contained within those minerals the increased acidity could also increase the permeability of the formation allowing the injected co 2 to migrate more readily initial results from injection experiments that observed this process seem to indicate that the reservoir integrity remained intact and co 2 did not leak28 additional injection experiments may help understand whether increased acidity following co 2 injection is significant issue

sequestration project discussed above to map the shape of the co 2 plume at depth and plot its migration over time as co 2 is injected these techniques could be useful for detecting leakage from the reservoir especially if the co 2 concentrations were high enough to distinguish them from the saline formation water although seismic monitoring could be costly compared to other techniques to help detect leaks around wells or into nearby structures or dwellings tracer compoundswhich are detectable at very low concentrationscould be added to the injected co 2 and then monitored29 if shallow aquifers are concern monitoring wells can be installed above the co 2 sequestration reservoir and below the drinking water aquifer to measure changes in pressure temperature and chemistry that may indicate co 2 is escaping the reservoir also changes to vegetation at the ground surface could be monitored over time which may indicate co 2 leakage into the soil from below the terms measurement monitoring and verification or mmv are typically used to describe the plan system and tools for characterizing the subsurface reservoir and for detecting changes throughout the injection closure and longterm ca re phases of geologic sequestration project there is universal agreement on the specific ements that should be included in mmv for all largescale geologic sequestration projects because

pore space and displace the saline water oil gas or some combination of the natural formation fluids initially the injected co 2 would occupy the pore space as liquid or supercritical fluid as discussed above and remain in the geologic formation unless one or more of the possible leakage scenarios outlined above occurs this is commonly referred to as volumetric storage over hundreds or thousands of years however the injected co 2 would start to dissolve into the formation fluids further decreasing its chances of leaking out of the reservoir this is known as solution storage solution storage would effectively trap the co 2 underground for long time but the rate at which co 2 dissolves into the saline water decreases as the salinity increases co 2 would dissolve only very slowly in deep highly saline formations co 2 injected into coal seams could be tightly bound or adsorbed onto the coal surfaces and would likely stay bound to the coal for long time unless further disturbed studies indicate that co 2 could displace methane and the methane recovered at the surface which occurs naturally in many coal seams other studies indicate that injecting co 2 into coal seams may cause the coal to swell however which could reduce the permeability of the coal seam and limit its effectiveness for sequestering large amounts of co 230 injecting co 2 into deep flood basalts such as those found in the columbia river plateau occupying portions of washington oregon and idaho may cause the minerals in the basalt to react with the co 2 and form solid minerals known as mineral storage the minerals would likely stay underground in the flood basalts for thousands to millions of years essentially trapping the injected co 2 for geologic time flood basalts are attracting attention for co 2 sequestration in part because of their potential for mineral storage and because basalts commonly possess good porosity and permeability however unlike oil and gas reservoirs and deep saline formations which form in sedimentary basins and are often overlain by impermeable cap rocks flood basalts are composed of multiple layers of erupted lava flows lava flows may not provide the same degree of geologic seal as sedimentary rocks like shales of possible concern is whether the injected co 2 will have sufficient time to react with the basalts and form stable minerals before the co 2 migrates to the surface

g344g501g561 in most of the depleted oil and gas reservoirs and deep saline formations under consideration for geologic co 2 sequestration saline water or brine occupies the pore spaces in the reservoir carbon dioxide injected as supercritical fluid would likely displace some portion of the brine volumetric storage which means that the displaced brine would flow elsewhere where and how fast the brine would flow and how much w ould be displaced depends on the characteristics of the formation including its porosity and permeability as well as how much co 2 is injected in large potential co 2 reservoirs such as the mt simon sandstone that underlies parts of ohio pennsylvania and illinois the amount of brine displaced would likely be small relative to the 30 x cui r m bustin and l

likelihood of substantial migration of brine outside the formation is relatively small for formations with less volume relatively greater amounts of brine would be displaced compared to the initial volume in the reservoir any risk to underground sources of drinking water from the displaced brine would depend in part on proximity of the boundary of the co 2 reservoir to freshwater aquifer it is likely that reservoir characterization prior to injection as well as monitoring during the injection phase would provide needed information on the likelihood of brine migration into drinking water source after injection ceases the likelihood of additional brine migration decreases rapidly as the added pressure from the injected co 2 dissipates and as co 2 dissolves into the formation brine

sequestration partnerships to identify opportunities for carbon sequestration field tests in the united states and canada31 the regional partnerships program is being implemented in threephase overlapping approach 1 characterization phase from fy2003 to fy 2005 2 validation phase from fy2005 to fy2009 and 3 deployment phase from fy2008 to fy201732 according to the 2008 carbon sequestration atlas the first phase of the partnership program identified the potential for sequestering over 3000 gtco 2 across the united states and parts of canada the third phase deployment is intended to demonstrate largevolume prolonged injection and co 2 sequestration in wide variety of geologic formations according to doe this phase is supposed to address the practical aspects of largescale operations presumably producing the results necessary for commercial ccs activities to move forward on november 17 2008 doe announced it was awarding the seventh and last award for the largescale carbon sequestration projects under phase three of doe carbon sequestration and technology roadmap and program plan33 doe has now awarded funds totaling 4576 million an average of 65 million per project to conduct variety of largescale injection tests over several years in addition to doe funding each partnership also contributes funds ranging from 21 to over 50 of the total project costs 34
