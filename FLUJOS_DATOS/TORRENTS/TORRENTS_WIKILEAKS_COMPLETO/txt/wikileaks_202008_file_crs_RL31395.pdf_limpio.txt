neither dos santos with 496 of the vote nor savimbi with 40 won required majority unita officials alleged that the mpla government had engaged in widespread election fraud including the use of dummy ballots stolen ballot boxes and rigged counts and asserted that the personal security of unita supporters was being violated by government supporters in an atmosphere of increasing conflict across

control of over 90 of the country in late 2000 the government undertook large scale operations along the namibian border in apparent military cooperation with namibia and later attacked unita in the east near zambia unita also came under pressure as result of the angolan governments military presence in congo brazzavi lle and the governments participation as an armed ally of the drc government in the drc war6 the government conducted extensive military operations against unita in eastern moxico province near zambia in late 2001 and early 2002 it claimed to be routing savimbis forces but some observers remained skeptical public comments by angolan government officials had often predicted imminent military victory but the conflict had endured despite the governments military successes and unitas reported loss of most of its conventio nal military capability the group carried out many attacks across angola throughout 2001 and into 2002 these included attacks near luanda the capital

would leave in the hands of the mpla the selection and preparation of its presidential candidate dos santos is widely perceived to have designated clear successor the presidents announced intention not to run has reportedly elicited scepticism among some opposition members and observers of angolan politics given the presidents firm control of national politics and military affairs some see the move as bid to unify sometimes fractious party prior to elections to bolster the rationale for an extended dos santos presidency and to defend against and draw out potential contenders within his

shifts death of savimbi until february 2002 prospects for elections and many analyses of angolas political future had been premised on the assumption that angola would continue to be afflicted by armed conflict or related instability the death of unita leader jonas savimbi on february 22 2002 however radically altered angolas political landscape and raised the possibility that an end to the conflict could be reached savimbi 67 was killed following government ambush of unita military convoy in which he had been traveling toward the zambian border near lucusse small town in angolas eastern moxico province where he was later buried his death followed intensive faa counterinsurgency operations against unita that placed the group under severe military pressure in moxico and elsewhere the ambush resulted in the death of over 20 unita officials and followers and the capture of one of savimbis four wives some unita officials were reportedly able to escape about week before savimbis death the government had reportedly captured unitas deputy military command er and number of unita officers were captured or killed in late 2001 and early 2002 as result of similar military operations government forces were reportedly able to locate savimbi by tracking satellite telephone phone calls made by him and members of his party reconnaissance drones and tracking dogs were also reportedly used unita representatives citing the possible involvement of foreign governments in savimbis death have called for an international investigation into the circumstances of mr savimbis killinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31395crs7 savimbis death raised the prospect that subsequent unita leadership changes or internal realignments might lead to ceasefire or negotiations to end the conflict the angolan government and some international observers had long attributed the continuation of angolas conflict to savimbi they charged that he had abandoned the lusaka protocol and the electoral process instead seeking political power by force of arms savimbi for his part attributed the continued conflict to belligerence by the mpla government which unita viewed as corrupt dictatorship that refused to renegotiate the lusaka protocol seen as defective by savimbi the impasse between the two parties meant that attempt to bring peace to angola had succeeded after the failure of the protocols postsavimb i developments in the days after savimbis death the angolan government urged unita forces to surrender and stated its willingness to take decisive and rapid steps to bring about ceasefire such actions have been welcomed and strongly encouraged by the international community the us and portuguese governments the european union and secretarygeneral kofi annan among others have called for ceasefire details of efforts to bring about ceasefire such as proposed schedule for deescalation were initially announced during the same period leaders of the armed wing of unita who were said to be in the bush fleeing angolan government forces which initially continued the strong offensive that had led to the killing of savimbi maintained public silence unita parliamentarians in luanda and unita spokesmen in europe spoke on behalf of the movement they welcomed the prospect of ceasefire and further dialogue in support of such an outcome but stated that ceasefire offer would need to come from the government unita indicated that it was not prepared to surrender militarily and asserted that the angolan government despite its call for ceasefire was not truly interested in peace negotiations and intended to continue its military offensive some initial assessments of the postsavimbi conflict posited that unita would likely continue to pursue its military objectives in the short term if only because communicating political decision s to unita fighters in the field may take time peace negotiations that began in midmarch 2002 however appear to be producing movement toward peace unita leadership succession the leadership vacuum created by savimbis sudden departure created succession crisis prior to his death savimbi had reportedly sought to ensure the primacy of his leadership by eliminating rivals within unita who might seek detente with the government and many key unita leaders had been captured in late 2001 and early 2002 these circumstances and the weak military position of unita implied that unita might not be able to maintain the organizational cohesion necessary to continue its armed struggle and appear to have created the basis for later ceasefire negotiations the unita constitution reportedly calls for the unita vicepresident to succeed savimbi automatically pending the election of new leader by unita congress in conformity with this provision the interim accession to the top leadership position by unita vicepresident antónio sebastião dembo 58 was announced in late february by unita representatives in europe
