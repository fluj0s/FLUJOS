safety studies issuing safety recommendations aiding victims families in aviation disasters and promoting transportation safety near the conclusion of the 109th congress twoyear ntsb reauthorization measure covering fiscal years 2007 and 2008 was enacted pl 109443 during the 109th congress legislation to reauthorize the ntsb for fiscal years 20072009 was ordered re ported in the house hr 5076 seeking threeyear funding reauthorization for fy2007 throug h fy2009 that included 22 increase to authorized funding vels in fy 2008 compared to fy2007 requested levels largely to support proposed staffing increas of about 19 in contrast the senate initially passed twoyear reauthoriza tion bill s 3679 in ptember 2006 covering fy2007 and fy2008 that paralle led the administrations fy2007 funding request but did not provide the increase sought in fy2008 instead proposing to maintain staffing at current levels through fy2008 the ntsb indicated in reauthorization hearing testimony that staffing increase was needed to effectively carry out its mission pl 109443 authoriz funding in fy2007 slightly above the presidents requested appropr iation level and authorizes 135 increase in the authorized level in fy2008 compared to fy2007 actual funding levels however are dependent on amounts specified in appropriations legislation in addition to setting funding authoriz ation levels pl 109443 extends and expands provisions that relax certain c ontracting requirement s for investigation related services establishes various reimbursements to the ntsb as offsetting collections that are available until expended and authorizes reimbursable payment from the ntsb for department of trans portation office of inspector general dot oig investigations and audits of the ntsb the act also requires the federal aviation administration faa to submit report explaining why it has not implemented ntsbs most wanted aviationrelated transportation safety improvements and charges the gao with the responsibility of evaluating and auditing ntsb programs ope rations and activities on an annual basis or more frequently if determined necessary the act also directs the dot oig to conduct oversight and investigations related to the boston cent ral artery tunnel project while not formally addr essed during reauthoriza tion debate two other prominent issues involving the ntsb may come under congressional scrutiny concerns over industry stakeholders lobbying ntsb officials in attempts to influence the scope or language of ntsb investigative findings and the ntsbs heavy reliance on experts from transportation entities with vested interest in the outcome of an investigation for fact gathering and data analysis some experts argue that the ntsb should instead create stronger ties with government boratories and academic institutions for expertise to lessen the chances that bias or the perception of bias could creep into the accidentinvestigation process this repor t will not be

department of transportation dot in 1974 congress pa ssed the independent safety board act of 1974 in pl 93633 making the ntsb completely separate from the dot doing so gave ntsb complete indepe ndence from dot as fully independent agency the ntsb can carry out unbiased investigations and make recommendations regarding safety regulations and oversig ht practices of dot without the public perception of conflicting intere sts associated with being component of regulatory department whose policies nd regulatory oversight might be brought into question during the course of an investigation over the course of its 39year history the ntsb has established worldwide reputation as model agency for investigating accidents and identifying needed transportation safety improvements through the issuance of safety recommendations and advo cacy for transportation safety needs the ntsb has earned considerable respect from congress and the traveling public for its efforts in identifying needed transportation safety improvements and maintaining public confidence in transportation safety ntsb organization the ntsb consists of fivemember board and staff of approximately 400 about half of whom are located at its washington dc headquarters with the rest distributed among several regional offices throughout the united states in the current reauthorization cycle the ntsb is seeking to increase its staff size to an authorized level of 475 fu lltime equivalent employees beginning in fy2008 the ntsb has indicated that this staffing increase is needed to fully carry out the ntsbs mission which includes conductin g investigations and safe ty studies and preparing safety recommendations and safety advocacy materials for all modes of transportation1 while the initial house proposal included authorization for staffing increases that match the ntsbs request for an increase to 475 fulltime equivalents ftes in fy2008 see hrept 109512 th initial senatepa ssed bill would have maintained staffing level of 399 ftes in fy2008 which is consistent with the fy2007 budget request while the final enacted version of the national transportation safety board reauthoriz ation act of

levels absent specific report language directing how this additional funding authority is to be used it is uncertain if this would be used in whole or in part to fund additional positions if the increased funding authority were devoted exclusivel for personnel compensation and benefits the number of authorized ftes c ould be increased to about 450 the five safety board members presidentially appointed with the advice and consent of the senate serve fiveyear terms and may tinue to serve beyond their term until replacement board member is appointed not more than three safety board members may be appointed from the sa political party and at least three members must be appointed on the basis of technical qualifi cations professional standing and knowledge of tran sportation safety issues one recent point of contention among board members is the appointment process for board members pe rsonal staff under prior w the ntsb chairman was the final authority with regard to staffing including the staffing of member offices2 the national transportation safety board reauthoriza tion act of 2006 pl 109 443 however gives individual board member s full authority to appoint individuals for personal staff positions with the restriction that staff allocations be limited to full time equivalent level of one senior professional staff position and one administrative staff position ntsb mission the ntsb core mission consists of i nvestigating transportation accidents and based on investigative findings and focused studies of tran sportation safety concerns issuing safety recommendations and advocating for improvements in transportation safety additionally the ntsb provides assistance to victims families in airline disasters and serves as board of appeals for certain transportation regulatory actions accident investigation the ntsb investigates the following transportationrelated accidents and safety issues all accidents involving civil aircra ft and public

accident investigation process in these instances where ntsb is asked to consult or actively participate in an overseas investigation the ntsb is sometimes reimbursed for associated costs historically these reimbursements had been deposited to the treasury general fund however during this reauthorization cycle the ntsb requested that this and other reimbursements to the ntsb be specifically designated as offsetting collections for use by the ntsb the national transportation safety board reauthoriz ation act of 2006 pl 109443 included provision designating such receipts whethe r in the form of fees or reimbursements as offsetting collections available until expended prior to this legislative change only reimbursements related to activities of the ntsb academy such as tuition payments or classroom rental fees were specifically credited as offsetting collections4 other relate d functions in addition to its core responsibility of investigating transportation mishaps the ntsb renders assistance to the families of passengers involved in air carrier accidents and handles appeals of certificate actions by the faa or the coast guard and certa in appeals involving civil penalties from faa enforcement actions the ntsb also maintains database of civil aviation accidents and conducts special studies of selected transportation safety issues safety recommendations and advocacy while the ntsb has authority to change transportation safety regulations and practices its principal means for effecting change in transportation safety is through the issuance of safety recommendations to regulators operators and users of tran sportation systems since investigations of complex accidents may take several years the ntsb routinely issues recommendations over the course of an investigation as needed safety improvements are identified the ntsb highlights its key safety recommendations on list of most wanted safety improvements that currently includes5 reducing the

core drunk drivers improving school bus safety at railroad grade crossings and setting work hour limits and rest re quirements that reflect current scientific understandi ng of human fatigue for safetycritical transportation workers in all transportation modes these most wanted transportation safety improvements typically encompass multiple safety recommendations requesting action from the dot and the states for statutory and regulatory change to address these safety concerns while there is statutory require ment to adopt ntsbissued safety recommendations the ntsbs ability to bring about tran sportation safety enhancements is rooted in its longstandi ng reputation for thorough investigation and assessment of needed safety improvements however th ere is not always universal agreement that ntsb recommendations are needed for example the faa has opposed ntsbs urging to require child re straints on airliners for children under two arguing that the increased cost of having to purchase tickets for these children could cause some families to drive instead which is arguably more dangerous than flying6 also pilot unions have strongly opposed ntsb recommendations for cockpit video recorders arguing that video images would be of limited value and fearing that despite statutory protections these videos could be misused if publicly disclosed or used for other purposes in other examples some unfulfilled recommendations proposed by the ntsb were not technically f easible at the time they were issued and several years of research nd development have been voted to addressing these recommendations even though the recommenda tions have not yet been satisfactorily addressed for example following the crash of twa flight 800 in 1996 the ntsb recommended procedures and technologies to reduce fuel tank flammability and explosive fuelair mixtures in airline fuel tanks while the ntsb has been disappointed that interim operational measures to reduce fuel tank fires and explosions have never been satisfactorily implemented by the airlines the ntsb is encouraged that through extensive resear ch and development viable technologies for reducing flammability and inerting fuel tanks now exist and will be required on certain airliners under proposed regulatory changes to reduce fuel tank flammability7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33474crs5 7 continued federal issues

1135dhowever despite the current progress towa rd addressing this longstanding safety need the ntsb would like to see the re quirements more broa dly applied to all commercial airliners in general ntsbs safety recommendations and safety advocacy programs have influenced the regulatory agenda of transportation agencies regarding safety initiatives and have had profound influence on congressi onal decisionmaking and oversight of transportati on safety issues since 1967 the ntsb has issued over 12000 safety recommendations across all modes of tran sportation of which about 83 led to the implementation of acceptable safety improvements despite the generally high level of acceptance of ntsbissued safety recommendations there is lingering concern over the amount of time it can take to implement recommended safety improvements one significant fact or contributing to the length of time it can take to adopt ntsb safety recommendations is the pr ocess of assessing the feasibility cost and benef its of adopting recomme ndation and developing an implementation plan which is left up to the recipient of safety recommendation since the last reauthorization in 2003 the nt sb has tried to impr ove this process by working more closely and collaboratively with dot agencies when drafting safety recommendations to better ensure that these recommendations can be implemented in timely and acceptable manner the ntsb refers to this initiative as swat for safety with team8 however this approach has been criticized by some as having the potential effect of watering dow n the ntsbs safety objectives these critics contend that by collaborating too closely with regulatory agencies and other stakeholders the ntsb may be swayed away from issuing or wording safety recommendations that may be more difficult or challenging for regulators to address and could bring the ntsbs impartiality nd independence into question striking an appropriate balance between identifying needed safety improvements and proposing recommendations that are operationa lly and technically achievable remains an ongoing challenge for the ntsb polic ymakers may deliberate about how to best structure interactions between the ntsb and recipients of ntsb recommendations to facilitate the communication of the ntsbs desired safety objectives and the operational and technical limitations that may stand in the way of fully meeting these objectives the senate ntsb reauthor ization bill s 3679 include d provision that would have required the ntsb to review the dot s annual report to congress detailing its responses to ntsb sa fety recommendations9 under this provision the ntsb would have been required to transmit comments on this report to the appropriate congressional committees within 90 days after the report is submitted by the dot under existing statute the dot is to submit its report to congress each year onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33474crs6 january 1 while this language was not in cluded in the final enacted legislation pl 109443 did include provision requiring the faa to submit report explaining why it has not implemented aviationrelated safety improvements identified in the ntsbs most wanted transportation safe ty improvements list issued in 2006 also the senate reauthor ization bill s 3679 include d provision that would have required the ntsb to provide as appropriate recommenda tions and comments to congress regarding pending transportation safety legislation while legislation can serve as an appropriate means to implement ntsb safety recommendations that may otherwise languish and other improvements to tran sportation safety formally involving the ntsb in the review and an alysis of pending legislation may raise concerns regarding the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches the ntsb already actively participates in congressional oversight regarding transportation safety issues for example by providing testimony to congress at safety oversight hearings and through more informal meetings with members of congress and their staff ho wever formally involving an executive agency such as the ntsb in the legislative process and the work of congress even on limited basis may introduce complicati ons and potential challenges regarding separation of powers and may raise concerns that the ntsb could be drawn into partisan debates over transpor tation safety issues or pre ssured by stakeholders and special interest groups the enacted legi slation pl 109443 did not include this provision ntsb funding levels funding for the ntsb has historically consisted of base authorization or appropriation amount setaside emergency fund to cover unforeseen accident costs such as wreckage recovery salvage nd storage and suppl emental appropriations to cover the costs of large complex investigations such as the investigation of the twa flight 800 accident the national transportati on safety board reauthor ization act of 2003 pl 108168 authorized base appropriations from fy2003 through fy2006 for the ntsb the annual authorization level was set at 73325 million in fy2003 and was increased at rate of about 6 per year reaching 87539 million for fy2006 see table 1 in addition to these sums p l 108168 authorized additional funding for operating the ntsb academy from fy2003 through fy2008 however these additional funds for the academy were ne ver appropriated in stead appropriations language over the past two years has instructed the ntsb not to increase academy funding or increase investigator details to the academy in manner that may detract from their primary investigation duties since fy2003 appropriations for the ntsb have been slightly below authorized levels in fy2003 the ntsb received 72 milli on

authorizes additional f unding to increase the balance of the emergency fund up to the authorized limit of 4 million current issues for reauthorization several issues were identified during the current debate over ntsb reauthorization the central issue during this reauthorization cycle was the adequacy of the ntsbs staff size the ntsb requested staff increase of roughly 22 starting in fy2008 an increase it believes is necessary to adequately carry out its mission other issues considered during th ntsb reauthorization process included the mission operations and funding of the ntsb academy relief from certain contracting requirements for investigationre lated services the designation of various reimbursements to the ntsb as offsetting collections and payment for department of transportation inspector general investigations and audits of the ntsb ntsb staffing levels and accident coverage the washington post reported that in 2005 by ntsb s own estimates its field investigators deployed to only 62 of all fa tal airplane crashes in the united states compared to 75 in 200111 the trend has alarmed some aviation safety experts who contend that the ntsb could miss opportun ities to improve safe ty or identify critical safety concern before it leads to more mishaps the ntsb on the other hand asserts that its nearterm strategy has been to target the deployment of its field investigators to focus on crashes where new safety issues are likely to present themselves however without onscene invol vement this is ofte n difficult to assess particularly in the early stages of an i nvestigation therefore it appears that the ntsbs longterm strategy is to request funding for additional investigative staff beginning in fy2008 this request for add itional funding to hire new investigators and support staff was central issue in the current reauthorization debate analysis by the gao indicates that bot h the number of ntsb onsite field investigations of aviation

national transportation safety board dow jones newswires october 17 2005 was sent to the crash site have been declining since 200212 however the number of data collection accidents where investigators do not perform onscene functions has been steadily increasing in 2002 the ntsb sent investigators to 322 aviation field accidents compared to 219 in 2005 also the number of limited investigations where onscene functions are delegated to faa inspectors has declined by about half in the past three years from 1461 in 2002 to 762 in 2005 during that same period the number of d ata collection investigations where most or all of the investig ation process is completed in the office through telephone interviews and data gathering has increas ed by factor of almost five from 159 in 2002 to 783 in 2005 while this trend may in part be due to reduction in the severity of aviation accidents it is also likely the result of ntsbs changing strategy to manage its limited investigator resources and clear large backlog of uncompleted investigations in 2001 the ntsbs backlo g of cases more than six months old was 240013 this backlog was reduced down to 944 cases in early 2006 but one apparent consequence is that investigators have been spending more time in the office completing old cases and less time in th field doing onsite investigation while the most critical need for investigators appears to be for general field investigators that handle the bulk of ntsb s case load of aviation investigations involving smaller aircraft ex pertise in certain speciality fields may also need to be expanded to address the growing complexity of major transportation disasters for example the air line pilots association alpa the largest union representing airline pilots in the united states has been cr itical of what they consider lack of in depth investigation by the ntsb delving into human factors aspects of airline crashes union representative stated that the ntsb tended to overlook human factors either for the sake of expe diency or due to budget pressures14 while human factors causes play role in the majority of aviation accidents workload and staffing levels may limit the involvement of ntsbs human factors experts in exploring the root causes of these accidents such as tr aining policies and procedures besides human factors the ntsb also faces potential staffing needs in other highly specialized areas such as airline operations ai r traffic control airc raft structures and systems and maritime operations because these discip lines are highly specialized it takes considerable effort to recruit qua lified individuals and train them to apply their knowledge and expertise to accident inve stigation staff attrition in these highly specialized disciplines could increase the ntsbs reliance on outside expertise and have an impact not only on the ability of the ntsb to fully investigate transportation accidents but also on the quality of th ntsbs investigation and analysis policymakers may consider options to enhance the ntsbs ability to recruit and retain field investigators and specialists in variety of critical science andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33474crs10 engineering fields as well as professi onals with unique operational experience in various transportation modes while the house bill hr 5076 would have provided almo st full funding to support the administrations request for in creasing ntsb staffing levels by about 19 to address these concer ns the senate bill s 3679 did not include funding for increasing ntsb staff levels the sena bill s 3679 did however include provision that would have required the ntsb to include in its annual report lists of and explanations for transportation accidents that the ntsb was statutorily mandated to investigate but did not and any ongoing investigations that had exceeded the expected time allotted for th eir completion such information may provide better insight into whether and to what extent ntsb staffing levels are impacting its ability to meet statutory obligations for investigating transportation accidents and to carry out these obligations in timely fashion such data may also provide better sense of what transporta tion modes and specific areas of expertise may need additional staffing for the ntsb to effectively carry out its mission the ntsb reauthorization act of 2006 pl 109443 authorizes funding increase of roughly 135 in fy2008 compared to fy2007 au thorized levels while the act did not specify how this additional funding au thority is to be llocated crs estimates that if such funds are appropriated in fy2008 and allocated exclusively for increasing staffing levels the ntsb may be able to increase its fte level to about 450 in fy2008 the ntsb reauthorization act of 2006 pl 109443 also included provision adopted from the senate bill s 3679 that requires the ntsb to maintain at least one fulltime employee in every state located more than 1000 miles from the nearest ntsb regional office to provide initial investigative response to accidents across all modes of transpor tation this measure would most directly impact the state of hawaii where the ntsb does not have field office or any staff currently investigations of accidents in hawaii are typically run out of the ntsbs gardena california field office air safety in hawa ii has particularly been continuing issue of interest because of the importance of aviation for interisland transportation and large air tour industry in the state the ntsb academy the national transportati on safety board amendments act of 2000 pl 106 424 gave ntsb the authority to enter into agreements for facilities technical services and training in accident inves tigation theory and practice in 2000 ntsb awarded 20year contract for training site to the george washington university gwu construction on the ntsb academy located on the loudon county campus of gwu in ashburn virginia was completed in august 2003 in addition to assessing the funding needed to sustain the operations of the ntsb academy key issue for congress has been whether to fund the ntsb academy as separate entity or com ponent of the overall ntsb budget funding the ntsb academy within the overall ntsb budget would give ntsb greater flexibility to fund academy activities based on internal training requirements and external demand for training however doing so may place an additional burden on the ntsbs ability to carry out its inve stigative researc h and safety advocacyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33474crs11 15 us government accountability office national transporta tion safety board preliminary observations on the value of comprehensive pl anning and greater

providing separate funding authorization for the ntsb acad emy on top of ntsb base authorization levels pl 108168 allows the ntsb to impose and collect fees for services provided by or through the academy which may be credited as offsetting collections that remain available until expended in the current reauthorization debate the ntsb has proposed that funding authoriza tion for the ntsb academy be made part of the broader agency authorization rather than distinct entity the ntsb asserts that single authorization amount is more consistent with its obj ective of integrating the academy operations into the overall mission and program for the agency this would also be in line with appropriations ac tions over the past three fiscal years that have not identified separate funding levels for the academy unlike pl 108168 hr 5076 goes along with this request and does not specify any separate or additional funding levels for the academy also as requested the bill would strike statutory provision for separate re porting to congress on ntsb academy operations the ntsb has proposed that th is reporting be consolidated with the ntsbs annual report to congress on its ov erall operations th senate bill s 3679 likewise combines academy funding with the broader agency budget while the ntsb seeks to better integrate the operations of the academy with the overall role of the agency gao analys is of academy operations suggests that significant progress is still needed to accomp lish this objective despite the creation of the academy three years ago the gao found the ntsb has not developed strategic training plan nor has it identified the core competencies needed to support its mission and curriculum to develop these competencies15 the gao also found that the ntsb academy facility is signif icantly underutilized in part because the ntsb lacks core curriculum for its own staff in fact for fy2006 97 of ntsb staff training is expected to come from training vendors other than the ntsb academy gao estimated that available classroom space was utilized less than 10 of the time they were available durin g fy2005 moreover in fy2004 and fy2005 ntsb staff made up less than 20 of the total enrollment in classes offered at the ntsb academy however despite having an enrollment of about 80 feepaying external students and having the option to rent out classroom space when it is not in use revenues generated from these sources have covered only about 8 of the academys total operating expenses including lease of the facility itself under the terms of longterm lease agreement with the george washington university excluding the cost of the lease reim bursements still only c overed about 15 of ntsbs other costs to run the facility nd offer instruction even though the ntsb does not figure in instructor salaries for ntsb personnel assigned to teach classes at the academy in response to these findi ngs policymakers may seek to improve ntsbs approach to staff training and its initiatives to generate additional revenue through course offerings symposia and other training opportunities offered through the ntsb academy httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33474crs12 16

improved november 2006 gao07118 p the ntsb has indicated that in 2006 it significantly revised the philosophy for the academy and is focusing on developing stateoftheart tr aining courses and programs16 however examination of the av ailable course fferings and current academy operations suggest on the contrary that the academy is largely maintaining status quo with regard to its operations and approach to training because the ntsb academy has been operational for only few years opportunities exist for refining and expanding its structure and c ourse offerings the ntsb indicated that it plans to establish training and academic oversight board for the academy the oversight board will consist of senior ntsb staff and will work closely with other government training facilities to benefit from their experience and best practices17 congressional oversight may seek to more thoroughly examine the ntsbs planning and execution of efforts to improve and expand the curriculum of the ntsb academy the senate bill s 3679 included language that w ould have required the ntsb to develop plan to make the ntsb acad emy selfsufficient the bill proposed that draft of the plan is to be submitte d for committee and gao review and comments within 90 days after enactment and fi nal plan addressing comments received on the draft would be required 90 days thereafter the bill would have required the plan to be fully implemented within two years language in the bill would have directed the ntsb to consider subleasing of the academy facility for generating revenue and would have required that the plan include fiscal projection of its impact on academy expenses and revenue however s ubsequent gao study of ntsb academy finances and business practi ces concluded that the ntsb may have difficulty increasing revenues or decreasing external tr aining costs enough to ever fully offset the training centers costs18 also the gao report noted that the ntsb has been in violation of the antideficiency act because it negotiated the lease on the ntsb academy facility as an operating lease instead of capital lease and did not obtain budget authority for the full term of the 20 year lease language to remedy this situation was not included in the ntsb reauthorization legislation possible remedies identified by the gao include obtai ning deficiency appropriation for the full amount of the lease renegotiating the lease contract terminating the lease or obtaining authority to obligate lease paym ents on an annual basis gao concluded that vacating the space may be the most costeffective strategy however the potential benefits derived from this f acility were not fully considered in the gaos analysis because the reauthorization legislation did not address the issue of the ntsb academy management practices weighing the costs and benefits of maintaining the training center remains specific issue for congressional oversight and possible legislation during the 110th

procurement procedures re quired of contracts in excess of 25000 however the ntsb has been criticized in the past regarding its financial management and oversight at issue is striking balance between providing flexibility to complete needed investigative tasks in timely and efficient manner while providing sufficient financial management controls and oversight to minimize the risk of fra ud waste and abuse pl 108168 clarifies the nt sbs authority regarding exemption from contracting requirements to be used only if necessary to expedite an investigation and requires the ntsb to list all such contracts over 25000 in its annual report to congress however this provision ex pired at the end of fy2006 the ntsb requested that the sunset clause of this provision be deleted and the ntsbs special contracting authority for investigation related services be made permanent19 the ntsb reauthorization act of 2006 pl 109443 strikes the sunset clause of the ntsbs special contracting author ity as requested nd requires reporting on contracts awarded under this special authority to be identified in the ntsbs annual report to congress each year reimbursements to the ntsb as previously mentioned the ntsb participates in some foreign accident investigations where it is not representing particular united states interest in the process or outcome of the i nvestigation but rather lends its technical expertise and experience to the investigation in some cases the ntsb is reimbursed for the personnel travel and other expenses it in curs while participating in these accident investigations but these recei pts are currently not credite d as offsetting collections similarly airlines are required to pay the costs of disaster mortuary services for airline disasters however the ntsb often pays for these costs up front to ensure the immediate delivery of these services and later seeks reimbursement from those responsible for payment in the past these reimbursements were not specifically credited as offsetting collections under the statutes existing prior to the enactment of the ntsb reauthorization act of 2006 pl 109443 the only reimbursements to the ntsb that were specifically credited as offsetting collections were those items related to the ntsb academy such as tuition payments for courses and fees for facility rentals20 because other reimbursements th at were not specifically credited to ntsb funding lines the ntsb expressed concern that it could face funding shortfall if it is necessary to expend any sizable amount of agency funds on reimbursable items that are not directly offset by reimbursements received by thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33474crs14 21 testimony of mark v rosenker acting chairman national transportation safety board before the committee

law gives the dot office of inspector general limited oversight of the ntsbs financial management property management and bus iness operations but does not give the inspector general authority to re view the ntsbs investigative functions or safety recommendati ons process the statutory authority specified that the inspector general shall be reimbursed by the ntsb for any costs associated with audits or reviews of the ntsb this however posed potential problems by creatin g possible conflict of interest or at least perception of possible conflict of interest also because inspector general audits are not specifically budgeted for related costs could impact the ntsbs resources to carry out its core mission to investigate accidents and promote transportation safety theref ore the ntsb requested that this statutory language be repealed and the dot office of inspector ge neral be directly ppropriated funds for its activities related to ntsb oversight21 the dot office of inspector general concurred with th is recommendation the ntsb reauthorization act of 2006 pl 109443 authorizes such sums as may be necessary for the dot office of inspector generals costs associated with

and congressional oversight besides the issues specifically identif ied during the ntsb reauthorization debate two other prominen t and related issues involving the ntsb may come under congressional scrutiny first some have expressed concerns over possible industry stakeholder lobbying of ntsb offi cials in attempts to influence the scope or language of ntsb investigative findings22 second concerns have also been raised about the ntsbs heavy reliance on expert s from transportation entities with vested interest in the outcome of an inves tigation such as airlines and aircraft manufacturers for fact gathering and data analysis some experts argue that the ntsb should instead create stronger ties with government laboratories and academic institutions for expertise to lessen the chances that bias or the perception of bias could creep into the accident investigation process23 these issues were not specifically addressed in r eauthorization legislation stakeholder lobbying of ntsb officials one ongoing concern is the degree to which entities with vested interest in the outcome of an investigation may be able to influence ntsb board members this is an important consideration because under the ntsb party system of conducting investigations entities with vested interests in an investigation are made part of the investigation team and work closely w ith ntsb staff and officials to provide technical knowledge and experience24 however the potential exists for entities to cross fuzzy line between providing technical knowledge and exper tise and attempting to gain or exert influence in the ntsb investigative process and decisions about what findings conclusions and causal factors will be highlighted in the boards final report on an investigation former

of an accident investigationsway the ntsbs conclusions nd language in the final report25 conners maintained that lobbying efforts have not yet influenced the outcome of an investigation but these tactics have delayed the investigation process26 it is notable however that in the american airlines f light 587 investigation the safety board in split decision voted to change the orde r of causal factors recommended by the ntsb staff move that placed greater emphasis on the design characteristics of the aircrafts rudder control system an d deemphasized the role that american airlines pilot training played in the accident two board members at the time issued joint dissenting statement asserting that to diminish the role of the training in the accident is to downplay the role it played in the pilots actions which caused the accident27 the counterargument for reversing the order was to emphasize the design problems with the r udder system which more closely paralleled the new recommendations issued by the ntsb in its final report recommendations pertaining to pilot training had previously been issued by the ntsb during the course of the investigation the dissenting memb ers believed that the statement of probable cause should accurately reflect the findings of the investigation and not be flavored to emphasize the importance of any par ticular recommendations being put forth while the motives behind such change in emphasis to probable cause statement could arguably be justified based on more closely aligning the wording of the probable cause to the ntsbs agenda fo r advocating recommended safety changes based on investigative findings in this case the potential public perception that the adopted probable cause langua ge may have in part been influenced by lobbying efforts by party to the investigation could bring the board members motives into question pattern of actions of this sort could potentially lead to loss of public trust in the ntsb and the party process of investigating accidents variety of safeguards already exist to prevent external entities from influencing ntsb findings and conclusions first under the sunshine act28 the safety board as whole must meet in public on most matters pertaining to accident investigations which would increase the transparency of any attempt by board member or members to sway an investiga tion also while inte rested parties may provide technical expertise in the fact finding phase of an investigation analysis of these facts is done strictly by the ntsb st aff of investigators the investigative process is designed to provide each part an opportunity to provide the ntsb with its perspectives and concerns parties are free to submit their own analyses and exchange information and ideas with ntsb investigators also formal procedures exist for parties to petition the ntsb to reconsider or modify its investigativehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33474crs17 29 see 49 cfr 84541 30 cynthia c lebow et safety in the skiesfindings after an investigation has been completed and the final report has been adopted29 nonetheless in highly complex and contentious accident evaluating competing perspectives brought forth by various parties to the investigation can prove challenging for the ntsb and can stretch out the length of time needed to complete an investigation so despite these procedures the potential for parties to exert their influence on the ntsb process still exists and could have negative impact on the effectiveness of the ntsb even if the ntsb was not swayed by such efforts to influence an investigation pub lic perception that the ntsb was not fully impartial could diminish the agencys reputation and credibility striking balance between allowing involved par ties to provide unique data and technical analysis that often they alone possess while preventing these entities from subtly or overtly attempting to sway the investigative process in their favor or exert influence and pressure on board members is likely to be sizable challenge policymakers may consider limitations or more formal rules for the interaction between investigative parties and the ntsb although this issue has not been specifica lly addressed during the current reauthorization process use of impartial outside expertise on investigation teams lingering concern closely tied to possible stakeholder lobbying of ntsb officials is the ntsbs extensive reliance on entities with stake in the investigation such as airlines and aircra ft manufacturers for technical expertise this reliance on subject matter expert s from those entities that may be under investigation leaves open the possibility that ntsb could receive biased analysis of technical data and potentially puts the ntsb in the position of evaluating competing hypotheses and analysis of technical data provided by parties that approach the accident from particular perspective with particular interests to protect in 2000 the rand corporation institute for civil justice reviewed the ntsbs aviation investigation practi ces and found that concern about the party process has grown as the potential losses resulting from major crash in terms of both liability and corporate reputation ve escalated along with the importance of ntsb findings to the litigation of air crash cases30 the report strongly recommended that the ntsb develop policies and procedures for making great er use of outside experts from more impartial sources such as government laboratories and academia to participate in and contribute to the investigative process the report also recommended that the ntsbs internal res ources be enhanced th rough better training and strategic staffing if the agencys i ndependence is to be assured the report proposed model in which private consu ltants and academics be made an integral part of the party process instead of ving peripheral roles of support and analysis of elements of the investigation as first step rand suggested that the ntsb perform nationwide assessment of federal laboratories universities and independent corporations to identify the resources and expertise to augment ntsb investigative capabilities and form memo randa of understanding mous and other formal relationships with these entities while the ntsb has entered into formalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33474crs18 mous with the national aeronautics nd space administration nasa and has close working relationship with several department of defens dod laboratories these entities largely continue to play s upport role in investigations and are not an integral part of the party process while subject matter experts from academia are routinely consulted and sometimes asked to provide analysis of technical data and facts regarding an accident these experts also do not participate in the investigation to the same degree of involvement as par ties to the investigation such as aircraft manufacturers airlines and pilot unions policymakers may consider whether changes to the ntsb party process such as allowing outside experts to play more integral role in investigations could improve the ntsb investigative process
