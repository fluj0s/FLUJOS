russian government has not practiced religious discrimination in violation of its international commitments on april 15 1999 the pr esident determined that the russian government had not discriminated but stated that the issue requires close monitoring this report may be updated background since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 mos t people in russia have eschewed atheism and professed at least nominal adherence to religious faith although mos t russians profess to be russian orthodox there has been an explosive growth i n membership of other faiths including those relatively new to russia and in the work of foreign missionaries faced with this activity the russian orthodox church has been at the forefront in lobbying the russian government and legislature to impose restrictions on what it widely defines as false faiths many hardliners ultranationalists and others in russia also have argued that many faiths and foreign missionaries threaten russia s traditional cultural and religious values ements of the russian government have been sympathetic to these views passage of the religion bill in the latest of several attempts to amend the existing relatively liberal 1990 religious law communist deputy viktor zorkaltsev and th government c osponsored bill on freedom of conscience and religious association which received its first reading introduction in july 1996 the bill was criticized by yeltsin at that time as unconstitutional in june 1997 the bill was reported to the floor for its second reading substantive deba zorkaltsev stated that the bill totally recasthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97696crs2 as replacement to the 1990 law would introduce state control over pseudoreligious and destructive cults which are tearing the fabric of society the bill was quickly and overwhelmingly approved by the legislature but yeltsin vetoed it on july 22 1997 rather than sign it i nto law as he explained the bill did not respect constitutional provision s prohibiting the government from giving preferences to one faith or another and did not accord with russias international commitments however he also agreed that strong law was needed to protect the moral and spiritual health of russian citizens and put up secure barriers against the infiltration of radical religious sects zorkaltsev and som other duma leaders denounced yeltsins veto as allowing western influences to trample on russia and brainwash the young er generation alluding to political and generational divisions in russia which also animated advocacy for the bill advoca tes of the bill strongly urged yeltsin to soften his objections in talk s between yeltsin and orthodox church patriarch alexey ii on august 6 1997 yeltsi n reportedly agreed to support major provisions of the bill b acked by the patriarch andrey loginov presidential advisor on domestic affairs and executive secretary of th presiden tial council on relations with religious associations played primary role i n guiding the deliberations within the government reportedly the draft bill that reached yeltsin did not take into account concerns raised with the council by emissaries of the catholic pentecostal baptist and adventist communities yeltsin approved the draft although it was little changed from the version he had vetoed the state dum overwhe lmingly approved it with few changes the federation council unanimousl followed suit and the bill was signed into law by yeltsin on september 26 1997 key features the main characteristics of the law are as follows som characteristics that raised initial western concern appear to have been partly addresse d during implementation see below it affirms the separation of church and state and freedom of religious opinion including nonbelief the preamble mentions islam buddhism judaism an d christianity as part of russias her itage however it also highlights the special role of orthodoxy in the history of russia and in the establishment an d development of its spirituality and culture beyond ment ioning christianity the preamble does not cite other faiths long practiced in russia such as roma n catholicism baptism or pentecostalism the bill requires the registration of all religious associatio ns by december 31 1999 by local and central offices of the ministry of justice congregation must register at the loca l level faith that has congregations in two or more regions r republics which oft occurs must also register with the central justice ministry the bill affirms the 1990 law in distinguishing between religious groups an d religious organizations but changes registration requirements and the rights of the former religious organizations are those that have been registered by the russian government in order to be registered group must prove that it s existed in russia for at least the past 15 years groups exi sting for at least 50 years with congregations registered in at least half of the 89 federal subunits or i f ethnicallybased in at least three subunits are accorded the special status of all russian religious organizationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97696crs3 if registration is denied the rights of religious association are circumscribed to those allowed to religious groups or it may even be banned by court order religious groups may choose whether to inform the authorities about thei r formation and commencem ent of activity depending on whether they seek later to become religious organizations religious groups are forbidden to ow n property publish religious literature host foreign guests set up schools or carry out charitable work among other restrictions change introdu ced by yeltsin article 273 permits religious associations that cannot prove through documentation that they have exi sted for15 years in russia to appeal for provisional yearly registration if granted they are allowed t conduct charity work but the law otherwise treats them as religious groups prohibited from carrying out many activities besides the requirement that religi ous organization show that it has existed for 15 years registration is dependent on governmental approval of the aims an d activities of the group group will not be registered if it does not abide by l provisions of the constitution and laws or if its petition contains information that has not been confirmed does not reflect what the government views as the real aims and activities of the group the new law allows foreign religious organization to open offices in russi upon the approval of the authorities however they are for bidden to engage in any cultural and other religious activity if russian religious organization wishes to sponsor foreign group it must provide the government with the charter and confirmation of the groups legality abroad spell out the purpose of the groups activities in russia and disclose its beliefs history and practices area s of concern some features of the bill appear unobjectionable includin g provision s restating constitutional provision that alternative service be provided fo r conscientious objec tors and proclaiming the protected status of the confessorconfessee relationship the bill also states that if religious association is denied registration it can appeal the decision in court once religious organization is registered it has lega l rights to own buildings hold meeting s publish literature run schools and businesses and carry out charitable work within the territory where it is recognized to operate on the other hand religious rights concerns are heightened by vaguely written and contradictory provisions that appear to greatly increase the role of the government i n regulati ng religious practice all religious associations must report to the authorities except those groups never intending to seek the full rights accorded by registration reports include cha nges in religious organizations charter or activities and report every two years to renew its registration expert councils composed of representatives of privileged faiths will help judge the registration materials as necessary furthering the possibility of bias against some faiths registration may be denied or revoked and r eligious groups may be proscribed based on broad but vague lis t of offenses that some worry will be used to single out some faiths including violating public order promoting religious enmi ty using drugs and hypnosis in services performing lewd and illegal actions and promoting nonmedical forms of healing offenses are referred to the courts which may order the liquidation rhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97696crs4 prohibition of the faith and possible prosecution of its members other provisions seem to restrict the freed om of religious association to disseminate its faith to nonmembers especially minors or to set up new congregations where it is not already registered opponents of the law have stated that language seeming to give special status t certain faiths violates the constitution article 14 of the constitution stipulates tha t religio us associations are separated from the state and are equal before the law an d article 19 prohibits the restriction of citizens rights n the grounds of religious affiliation article 28 stipulates that each person is guaranteed freedom to choose hold an d disseminate religious and other convictions and to act in accordance with them opponents of language that seems to g ive special status to certain faiths also can point to the constitutions articl 29 which prohibits propaganda of religious supremacy many in russia and elsewhere have criticized the laws apparent violation of russia s international commitments including the helsinki final act and vienna concludin g document the european convention on human rights and the international covenant on civil and political rights the provision requiring that foreign representatives may not engage in religiou s activities threatens to restrain the over 4000 foreign missionaries working in russia the provision that all religious organizations be headed by nd composed of russian citizens or permanent gal residents affects local congregations that are headed by or composed of foreigners or some faiths where the parent church or center is abroad in the latte r cases congregation must have the foreign center provide russian authorities with it s charter and confirmation of its legality by the home government the provision tha t religious groups may only be composed of citizens seems to restrict religiou s observance by noncitizens in january 1998 regulations for reviewing applications for registration of branches of foreign religious associations were promulgated followed in mar ch 1998 by regulations for other religious associations disappointingly to many in the west the regulation s closely follow the letter of the law guidelines for implementation issued by the justice ministry provide more liberal interpretation of the law and reg ulations but the guidelines are not legally binding the guidelines suggest that most religiou s organizations registered under the 1990 law will be reregistered that the 15 year rule will not apply to centralized religious organizations and their branches and that unofficial documents such as new s clipping will be used to satisfy the 15year rule several registration decisions made by early 1999 have followed these guidelines easing some concerns about how harshly the law would be implemented these registrations include those of pentecostal roma n catholic mormon and seventhday adventist groups however all faiths have t received similar treatment and some localities do not accept the guidelines schismati c and independent religi ous associations that cannot meet the 15year rule have faced hard choices between affiliating with centralized religious organizations they may not totall agree with doctrinally or risking liquidation local religious groups that are awaitin g registration face criminal charges if they carry out worship activities in the meantime about onethird of russias federal subunits have passed laws restricting certai n religious activities while the new federal law supersedes local laws it also provides major role for the localities in judging whether groups should be registered som localities have viewed the new law as green light to restrict religious activities f which they di sapprove foreign missionaries faced an attempt last year to force them tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97696crs5 leave russia every three months to renew their visas the authorities reinstated the one year visa after much p rotest but the status of missionaries remains worrisome petitions by individuals and groups to russias constitutional court to examine and overtur n objectionable parts of the law such as article 273 have not yet been considered us response until passage f the new law the united states generally praised religious freedom in russia while monitoring russian behavior and ur ging it to abide by international human rights commitments during the

concerns known among other proposals some members of congress an d others urged russia to establish an ombudsman offi ce or other means to monitor religious rights violations during implementation of the religion law while an omsbudsman was not appoin ted these proposals may have influenced the formation of an oversigh t working group chaired by loginov the fy1998 foreign aid appropriations act pl

manner that is not i n conflict with its international obligatio ns on religious freedom however this issue requires continued and clos monitoring she called on the russian government to ensure that the localities uphold religious freedom and urged the ultimat replacement of the law major concern is the slow pace of registrations by the end of march 1999 only 700 out of over 1700 0 associations had been registered prompting secretary albright to urge extending the deadline for registration and ensuring full rights for associations until they are registered while russias central government policy is not directly inimical t religious freedom intoleranc by many individuals groups and local officials is rising the stat departm ent was aware of about thirty cases of violations of religious freedom by loca l officials recent cases of concern include prosecution of jehov ahs witnesses in moscow raids on scientology groups harassment of catholic parishes and rising overt anti semitism antiamericanism among some russians heightened by their objections t nato airstri kes in yugoslavia has contributed to some harassment of missionaries and faiths deemed americanl inked both the
