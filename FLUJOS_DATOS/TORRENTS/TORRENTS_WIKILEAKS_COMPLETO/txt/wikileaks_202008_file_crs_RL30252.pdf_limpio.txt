richard best jr foreign aﬀairs defense and trade division updated december 3 2001 abstract since the end of the cold war transnational threats especially terrorism and international narcotics smuggling have been identiﬁed as national security concerns as such they have been addressed by both law enforcement and intelligence agencies the joining of law enforcement and intelligence eﬀorts has been complicated by the diﬀering roles and missions operational practices and bureaucratic cultures of the two sets of government agencies this report describes evolving cooperation among these agencies it notes concerns that civil liberties may be aﬀected by the use of aggressive intelligence collection methods in judicial proceedings and that the extension of law enforcement activities beyond us borders may complicate other us policies it describes the establishment of coordinative mechanisms within the executive branch but also notes that some observers believe that fundamental diﬀerences between the two communities have not been adequately assessed and that the law enforcementintelligence relationship has evolved without adequate congressional

and law enforcement countering transnational threats to the us summary in the postcold war world terrorism narcotics trafficking and related money laundering are perceived both as criminal matters and as threats to the nations security often collectively termed transnational threats these issues have become the concerns of law enforcement agencies as well as the us intelligence community two foreign banking scandals in the late 1980s led to efforts to ensure that information in the possession of intelligence agencies would in the future be made available to law enforcement officials in the mid1990s the federal bureau of investigation began assigning additional agents to newly created offices worldwide the tragic events of september 11 2001 provide clear demonstration of how large threat international terrorism can become to national security the bush administration and congress have moved rapidly to promote intelligenceenforcement cooperation among us agencies in the campaign against qaeda this report looks at the separate roles and missions and distinct identities of intelligence and law enforcement agencies coordinating their efforts has raised significant legal and administrative difficulties that have been only partially overcome despite the creation of elaborate coordinative mechanisms under the oversight of the national security council some observers also have expressed concerns about the greater use of information derived from intelligence sources in judicial proceedings fearing that it may lead to overreliance on surreptitious means of information collection and thus undermine civil liberties other observers have cautioned that redirecting intelligence assets to collect information for legal cases may reduce support available to military commanders and policymakers some others believe that there may also be an overemphasis on law enforcement in dealing with problems arising abroad the report notes the employment of covert actions by intelligence agencies in certain law enforcement efforts this report also addresses congressi onal oversight of the law enforcement intelligence relationship that is spread among number of house and senate committees each of which has only partial jurisdiction some observers believe that there should be further efforts to base the evolving relationship in statutory law they have argued that closer attention should be given to coordinating the emerging relationship between intelligence and law enforcement efforts while practices are malleable rather than to wait until bureaucratic rigidities set in or unfortunate precedents are established during crises even with conscientious efforts at coordination others have noted that fundamental differences remain between matters of law and of national interest in world of sovereign nation states enforcement of international law and the extraterritorial application of us law can be vigorously and at times effectively resisted by other countries the necessity to adapt us responses to transnational threats to specific situations can also undermine respect for law by making enforcement appear inequitable

other aspects of the current international environment3 although the responsibilities of us courts and law enforcement agencies have always included activities that occur outside us territorial borders eg smuggling piracy etc such activities have not usually been considered in the same category as military threats posed by foreign countries that are the responsibilities of the state and defense departments and the intelligence community changed international realities have however led to more expansive internationa l role for law enforcement agencies combined with the employment of intelligence agenciesand the operational arms of the state and defense departmentsin efforts to counter them thus there has arisen on one hand the phenomenon of agencies charged with domestic law enforcement acquiring extensive overseas missions and on the other intelligence agencies focusing on illegal activities in foreign countries the evolution and intermingling of law enforcement and intelligence efforts have served to blur distinctions between law and security policy that in statutory principle and in administrative practice have been kept separate and distinct the federal bureau of investigation fbi the nations principal law enforceme nt agency has attained much more prominent international role in recent years assigning increased numbers of agents overseas to expand contacts with foreign governments and to acquire information about potential transnational threats the central intelligence agency cia and other intelligence agencies are devoting greatly increased resources to counterterrorism and counternarcotics activities as cia official has noted today there is clear primacy for either the law enforcement or intelligence communities in the realms of international terrorism narcotics proliferation as well as in some cases counterintelligence still the law enforcement and intelligence communities remain designed and operated in fundamenta lly dissimilar manners retaining different legal authorities internal modes of organization and governing paradigms4 there appear in addition to be few wellunderstood criteria for choosing the most appropriate approach in given situation and also sense among some policy analysts that ambitious law enforcement agency heads have not fully appreciated the complexities of these threats in an international environment within which the united states must protect its national security interests beyond addressing the need for closer cooperation among law enforcement and intelligence agencies however lay larger and more complicated issues that somehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30252crs3 5the need to consider rules of the road to guide the choice of approaches is urged by bruce berkowitz should we send in the

7see james risen in hindsight cia sees flaws that hindered efforts on terror new continuedbelieve have not yet been fully considered5 many observers continue to express concerns about the employment of intelligence agencies using any number of surreptitious collection techniques in laying the groundwork for criminal proceedings such concerns are deeper and more serious than the diversion of finite assets from more traditional responsibilities on the other hand the decision to consider certain significant threats from outside us borders as law enforcement matters presumes that adequate legal channels either in international law or in us law exist within which such concerns can be resolved this presumption is however seriously questioned by those who believe that international law remains in large measure illdeveloped and that the extraterritorial reach of domestic statutes is likely to remain distinctly limited the use of law enforcement mechanisms against international threats may also imply that nonlegal instruments such as military force or covert action by an intelligence agency are less important and can be deemphasized questioning this assumption observers argue that some important international outcomes are utterly unobtainable through judicial processes in 1999 military force was deployed in support of international law enforcement us armed forces undertook air strikes as part of the north atlantic treaty organization on serbian forces and other targets not only to halt the destabilization of other balkan countries by serbian attacks on kosovar albanians but also to stop violations of international law crimes against humanity occurring as part of policy of ethnic cleansing according to president clinton the united states was involved in operation allied force because we have moral responsibility to oppose crimes against humanity and mass ethnic and religious killing and cleansing where we can6 there is little question that the lines currently dividing law enforcement and security issues are blurred in several instances different approaches to transnational issues appear to some observers to have been confused and counterproductive especially worrisome in this regard was the fbis withholding information regarding illegal chinese political contributions from the secretary of state prior to an official visit to beijing in 1997 and sharp divisions over us support for certain dissident iraqi groups in the mid1990s among law enforcement and intelligence agencies that may have contributed to their violent suppression by forces loyal to saddam hussein the attacks on the world trade center and pentagon on september 11 2001 caused considerable discussio n of the relationship between law enforcement and national security agencies including the intelligence community some observers argued that inadequate exchanges of information among agencies may have contributed to failure to gain advance warning of the attack7 variety of viewshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30252crs4 7continued york times october 7 2001 p 1a joe klein closewor k why we couldnt see what was right in front of us new yorker october 10

afghanistan was the best response an approach that gained wide support among the american public antiterrorism legislation enacted in october 2001 included provisions facilitating information sharing between law enforcement and intelligence agencies potential congressional concerns given the clear possibility that the internat ional role of law enforcement agencies will continue to grow observers believe that greater consideration should be given to making less ambiguous distinctions between law enforcement and security policy and to the relationships between law enforcement and intelligence agencies as one journalistic account of the evolving relationship between the two communities concluded coordination sounds simple in concept in reality it is likely to prove very difficult challenging constitutional limits on domestic lawenforcement activity while drawing intelligence officers ever closer to proceedings that could compromise sources and methods of intelligence collection the momentum is clearly headed toward something like merger between the two worlds it is dismaying that this move to reinvent the relationship between spies and federal agents took place with virtually meaningful public debate and little journalistic scrutiny8 congress may choose to concern itself with the broad contours of intelligence cooperation with law enforcement congress authorizes the various instrumentalities of us policy appropriates funds and conducts oversight the ways that congress funds and oversees law enforcement and intelligence agencies may not however be optimized to support their evolving and overlapping missions in the postcold war world congress has reviewed the coordinative mechanisms that have been established but has not provided them with statutory charters oversight of law enforcement foreign policy and intelligence is largely undertaken by different sets of committees with disparate agendas oversight of the state department is conducted by the senate foreign relations committee and the house international relations committee intelligence activities including those of the fbi are overseen by the senate select committee on

department agencies there is also certain amount of concurrent jurisdiction shared with the house and senate armed services committees law enforcement efforts are overseen primarily by the two judiciary committees appropriations committees also have jurisdiction but diplomatic law enforcement defense and intelligence efforts are handled by different subcommittees in both the senate and the house of representatives given the different oversight responsibilities it is difficult at best to provide seamless oversight of intelligence and law enforcement activities abroad the jurisdiction of the judiciary committees is very wide encompassing many domestic issues including abortion and immigration and in the senate confirmation of federal judges for variety of reasons there have been regular reauthorizations of justice department programs since fy19809 on the other hand the intelligence and armed services committees often focus on procurement of advanced technologies and the links between intelligence and the military services rather than on operational practices in addition neither the intelligence nor the judiciary committees usually deal directly with questions of foreign policy that are the province of the senate foreign relations committee and the house international relations committee in situations in which law enforcement military diplomatic and intelligence efforts are closely related significant challenges to effective congressional oversight may arise given the disparate concerns of several committees and the executive branchs understan dable tendency to maximize flexibility in employing different instruments under different circumstances possible new approaches to oversight could include joint hearings or even the eventual establishment of select or joint committees more difficult would be further changes in statutes that affect cooperation between law enforcement and intelligence agencies few observers would seek to alter proscriptions in the national security act on the cia having law enforcement powers and wholesale revision of the posse comitatus statutes that regulate any involvement of the military forces in law enforcement would undoubtedly be resisted the office of homeland security ohs established by executive order 13228 on october 8 2001 involves intelligence and law enforcement agencies in developing national strategy to secure the united states from terrorist threat or attacks with its focus on preventing or responding to attacks within the united states most observers believe that the role of intelligence in ohs will be generally limited to sharing information10 the enactment of the usapatriot act pl 10756 on october 26 2001 expanded authorities of both intelligence and law enforcement agencies to undertake surveillance of persons suspected of involvement in terrorist activities and provided for closer information sharing these changes have raised concerns among some that intelligence methods might become routinely used for criminal investigations or that information gathered in criminal investigations might be widely spread throughout the intelligence community httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30252crs6 11 crs report 94166s extraterritorial application of american criminal law by charles doyle february 25 1994 p 1 the united states is not alone in this regard the united continuedsome observers note the importance of statutor authorities and regular congressional oversight of the law enforcementintelligence relationship such oversight could mitigate any potential abuses as previously occurred in the 1960s when intelligence agencies collected informa tion on domestic antiwar groups that some believed might have connections with foreign governments many observers believe that the resulting public distrust seriously undermined the effectiveness of the nations intelligence effort and jeopardized the careers of officials who believed that they were following legitimate directions further some observe rs believe that the continuing lack of clarity about relationships among us law enforcement and intelligence agencies and their roles and missions may reduce the effectiveness of their individual and collective efforts and lead to waste and duplicati on of effort the obvious limits to the success of counter narcotics efforts have suggested to such observers that neither law enforcement nor intelligence assets have been optimally deployed and organized the events of september 11 2001 and subsequ ent legislation have led intelligence and law enforcement agencies to remove barriers to the flow of information although most observers believe that the flow is not yet completely seamless congress may choose to investigate whether different agency relationships might have led to advance warning of the pentagon and world trade center attacks in any event it is widely believed that working out relationships among the many agencies involved will require time and that careful congressional oversight will be needed illegal activities and transnational threats some illegal activities occurring abroad affect us security interests these are chiefly transnational threats from terrorism narcotics smuggling and proliferation of wmd such activities have been held to justify the attention of law enforcement and intelligence agencies other illegal activities such as smuggling copyright and trademark violations monopolistic competition etc may not rise to level that would constitut genuine transnational threat in recent years especially since the enactment of the comprehensive crime control act of 1984 pl 98473 and the omnibus diplomatic security and antiterrorism act of 1986 pl 99399 there has also been an increasing tendency for united states statutes to contain extraterritorial provisions extraterritorial jurisdiction has been claimed for crimes committed aboard american ships or planes offenses which imperil or misuse our foreign commerce with other nations misconduct like genocide terrorism or air piracy condemned in multilateral agreements to which the united states is party the overseas theft or destruction of the property of the united states government the use of violence against its officers or employees or the obstruction or corruption of the functioning of its agencies overseas and misconduct outside of the united states which results in or is intended to result in harm within the united states such as drug trafficking11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30252crs7 11continued kingdoms criminal justice act of 1988 for instance brings certain crimes whether or not committed in the uk under the purview of uk law us laws tend to encompass more sweeping prohibition s on various controlled substances and on

page 255 the restatement adds universal jurisdiction is increasingly accepted for certain acts of terrorism such as assaults on the life or physical integrity of diplomatic personnel kidnaping and indiscriminate violent assaults on people at large this passage leaves open the possibility that there are certain other acts of terrorism for which universal jurisdiction is not accepted nevertheless

security interests may also be violations of international law international law is in general either based on treaty obligations that have been accepted by signatories or found within the somewhat amorphous contours of customary international law ie the rules and practices characterizing relations between states and between private entities and foreign states innovations in or even departures from customary international law can be initiated by individual states but patterns of conduct long established are recognized to have considerable benefit to the global community and are prescriptive the complicated origins of international law however mean that national courts required to determine questions of international law must do so by imprecise methods out of uncertain materials and they must look at process that is worldwide and includes the actions and determinations of foreign actors including foreign courts12 in recent years international law has itself come to address wider range of criminal activities for which individuals can be held accountable by foreign countries piracy of course has long been considered crime that all states must act to suppress since the end of world war ii other types of terrorist activities and human rights violations including genocide torture hostage taking attacks on diplomatic personnel and airplane hijacking have also been proscribed by international agreement for such crimes of universal concern any state including of course the united states may prescribe punishments13 materials that can be used in weapons of mass destruction have been the subject of several international convent ions to which the united states is party14 very significant problem is of course the fact that many benign and commercially available chemicals can be combined with lethal effect in addition the spread of knowledge regarding weaponsmaking techniques has been greatly facilitated by the internet it has proven difficult however to reach an international agreement on tight definition of terrorism given determination of some in the international communityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30252crs8 15 louis rené beres on international law and

review16 the state department subsequently designated some 30 organizations mostly but not exclusively middle eastern in october 1997 but many observers would challenge the fairness of the list17 foreign countries understand us efforts to counter terrorist groups that target the united states in the wake of the september 11 2001 attacks the international community has demonstrated widespread support for us counterterrorist efforts there remains nevertheless widespread support in various parts of the world for some groups that the us considers terrorist as result there can be significant political costs involved in actions against some organizations that engage in terrorist activities it is fact of international life that persons and groups that have engaged in terrorist activities have been accepted as leaders of sovereign states that the united states may find it necessary to cooperate with to accomplish important national goals dealing with such leaders is distasteful even abhorrent but many observers will see it as necessary narcotics trafficking has been declared illegal by several international treaties18 but the narcotics trade is not at present considered an international crime over which there is universal jurisdiction countries are expected to suppress the production and transit of illegal narcotics and to bring drug producers and traffickers to justice and when appropriate respond to requests for extradition from other countries but countries have universal jurisdiction to enforce drug production or trafficking as they do under conventions against piracy torture and certain other crimes19 the united states must rely on diplomacy and various types of pressure and inducements to encourage other countries to cooperate in halting illegal drug

dictator manuel noriega was however caused or at least greatly influenced by his involvement in illegal narcotics trafficki ng few observers however routinely advocate the use of military force or covert actions to interdict drug production and shipments within the territorial borders of other countries even if authorized such efforts would have significant drawbacks and could have damaging effects on other important interests intelligence agencies support law enforcement in seeking to take action against such criminal activities occurring in foreign countries it has seemed logical to many to bring to bear the enormous information gathering capabilities of the intelligence commu nity which has both collection systems and human agents available throughout the world it would some have argued be relatively simple to make information obtained by intelligence agencies available to investigators and prosecutors in support of the latter efforts to bring terrorists and narcotics traffickers to justice in us courts some observers would of course go further suggesting that in especially threatening cases covert actions by the cia or military strikes might be necessary closely coordinating the efforts of law enforcement agencies and the intelligence community alongside the state and defense departments presents however significant challenges as three knowledgeable observers have written the law enforcemen tnational security divide is especially significant carved deeply into the topography of american government the national security paradigm fosters aggressive active intelligence gathering it anticipates the threat before it arises and plans preventive action against suspected targets in contrast the law enforcement paradigm fosters reactions to information provided voluntarily uses ex post facto arrests and trials governed by rules of evidence and protects the rights of citizens20 the division of responsibilities between intelligence and law enforcement agencies reflects this reality and is based in statutes and executive orders many observersincluding intelligence agency officialsstrongly believe in the fundamental importance of distinctions between law enforcement efforts governed by laws and rules designed to protect the rights of the accused and the far less restricted operations of intelligence agencies21 the national security act of 1947

create an american gestapo or to encroach on the jurisdiction of the fbi there was then as there remains today concern that combining domestic and foreign intelligence functions creates the possibility that domestic law enforcement will be infected by the secrecy deception and ruthlessness that international espionage requires23 the 1947 act also reflected the division of labor during world war ii between the office of strategic services oss the cias predecessor intelligence service and the fbi even though the latter undertook extensive intelligence gathering in latin america most of the other elements of the us intelligence community are located in the department of defense dod which also has been largely precluded from direct involvement in domestic law enforcement efforts since the postcivil war enactment of the posse comitatus statutes dod has received legal authority to assist law enforcement agencies in counternarcotics efforts although with restrictions precluding any involvement of military personnel in the arrest and detention of suspects24 in some cases efforts of intelligence agencies in support of law enforcement efforts proved to be illadvised in particular instances of intelligence agencies acquiring information concerning us citizens or persons has been widely condemned in addition to various questionable cold war activities such as mail openings and involvement with the mafia the cia and military intelligence units gathered intelligence on antiwar groups within the united states during the vietnam war period25 such activities served as major impetus for wideranging congressional investigations of the us intelligence community in the 94th congress in the aftermath of sensational revelations about improper activities by intellige nce agencies both the intelligence community and its congressional overseers were determined to separate the work of intelligence and law enforcement agencies in order to prevent the use of intelligence techniques against citizens and legal residents of the united states unless court orders have been obtained proposals for enacting charter for the intelligence community did not succeed but the widespread criticisms of domestic spying by the cia and other intelligence agencies served to build walls of separation between the two communities that were widely recognized in practice even

years that followed the investigations were marked by some reluctance on the part of the two cultures to form interactive relationships this overcaution was based more on perception that closer association meant increased political risk than upon having any basis in prohibition of law27 even before the end of the cold war however terrorism and narcotics smuggling were emerging as matters of national concern executive order 12333 united states intelligence activities signed by president ronald reagan on december 4 1981 specifically assigned the cia responsibilities for collecting and producing intelligence on foreign aspects of narcotics production intelligence agencies were authorized to participate in law enforcement activities to investigate or prevent clandestine intelligence activities by foreign powers or international terrorist or narcotics activities 28 with the end of the cold war intelligence agencies have had to adjust their efforts to meet changed national security requirements by the mid1990s they were downsized roughly by third from 1980s levels and many cold war missions disappeared funding levels have risen somewhat more recently the intelligence community has faced major challenges in adjusting its expensive technical collection systemssatellites and signal intercept effortsto the changed environment it is now making much greater use of open sources ie books newspapers radio and television programs and pamphlets human collection has been particular challenge inasmuch as the personnel and methodologies useful for collecting information about topics such as soviet diplomat ic or military policies are far different than those necessary to collect information about terrorist or drugsmuggling groups the emergence of transnational threats in recent years and the availability of intelligence resources led many to urge greater use of intelligence community assets to obtain information that may at some point be used in criminal proceedings the intelligence community collects wealth of data about all regions of the world its data storage and retrieval capabilities as well as thousands of trained analysts could potentially be of enormous use in support of law enforcement efforts in some parts of the world intelligence contacts unique access can provide invaluable information concerning activities that may be related to violations of us

lie in our files next came the grinding review of individual documents and the growing realization that the reports were prepared for other purposes and so were unlikely to contain much of relevance

intelligence information about the activities of the bank of credit and commerce international bcci and banca nazionale lavoro bnl was apparently shared with prosecutors in haphazard and uncoordinated ways some never emerged outside the intelligence community although most observers did not conclude that there was an effort by cia to protect either of these two banks congressional committees recommended that procedures be established to ensure that relevant information about international criminal activity collected by intelligence agencies would be made available to law enforcement

cooperation arrangements34 in some countries of course rigid separation does not exist between intelligence and law enforcement agencies and us officials must carefully tailor their relationships with

having major role consistent with that officials statutory responsibility for the direction coordination and supervision of all government executive branch employees in that country35 observers note that not all ambassadors take an active interest in such concerns that law enforcement and intelligenc officials in embassies have not always been forthcoming with ambassadors and that officials may

enforcement relationship in the aftermath of the wave of criticism and congressional direction that followed revelations of cias failure to provide information about the bcci and bnl cases to justice department officials joint task force on intelligence and law enforcement was established in march 1993 the task force chaired by deputy assistant attorney general mark richard and cia general counsel elizabeth rindskopf came up with series of recommendations36 many of these proposals involved relatively technical and administrative efforts to improve information flow and data retrieval the creation of focal points ie coordinating offices in the justice department to interface with the cia new procedures to govern requests for intelligen cefile searches that might result in the production of materials to be used in court cases requirements for law enforcement agencies to provide notice to prosecutors when there is an intelligence interest measures concerning the treatment of the identity of intelligence officers whose identities are classified new procedures to protect classified information in situations not envisioned by earlier statutes such as the classified information procedures act memorandum of understanding between the attorney general and intelligence agencies that outlines the circumstances under which the agencies must report suspected criminal activity and an intercommunity training plan to facilitate coordination37 although deputy assistant attorney general mark richard claimed that the problems between the cia and justice department

notedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30252crs15 39 quoted in national security law report november 1996 p 4 40 section 990210a of volume 9a of the department of justice manual states although both are arms of the executive branch the federal law enforcement and intelligence communities have very distinct identities mandates and methods the mission of the former is to identify target investigate arrest prosecute and convict those persons who commit crimes in violation of federal laws the mission of the latter is to perform intelligence activities necessary for the conduct of foreign relations and the protection of the national security including the collection of information and dissemination of intelligence and the collection of information concerning espionage internat ional terrorist activities and international narcotics activities 41 an inevitable factor that might hinder cooperation is the fact that the justice department has the authority to investigate intelligence agency personnel for potential illegal activity see for instance vernon loeb and john mintz cia faces criminal probe in china case washington post december 5 1998 p a1 although this authority is uncontested its exercise may affect working relationshipsthere were three possible solutions i to blend the two services and place them under rules governing the law enforcement community ii to blend the two services and place them under intelligence rules and iii to coordinate the activities of the two services ultimately the decision was made to go forward with great caution39 major challenge for promoting cooperation between intelligence and law enforcement agencies are their respective bureaucratic cultures modes of operation sources of information and oversight structures40 the justice department which includes both the fbi and the dea is responsible for conducting investigations of possible law breaking and prosecuting alleged criminals in the judicial system although law enforcement agencies need background information or strategic intelligence regarding patterns of criminal activity eg analysis indicating that increasing quantities of cocaine are flowing through harbors in southern florida they tend to give higher priority to tactical information eg tip that specific cargo vessel is scheduled to offload shipment of cocaine at specific dock in miami on the night of august 4 under applicable rules of legal procedure this latter type of information may have to be used in public trial and its origins revealed to defendants lawyer law enforcement agencies typically work on casebycase basis when trial is completed and all appeals exhausted the information developed in the preliminary investigation has little use and can be consigned to the archives41 however national security policymakers require continuous stream of information from the cia and other intelligence agencies about world conditions especially about countries groups and individuals working against us interests there is endpoint to these requirements even favorable evolution of events such as the dissolution of the soviet union does not mean the end of the need for uptodate information in many cases the need for intelligence is more important than the need for dealing with particular incident thus it may be advantageous to support covert intelligence source for years even if the source is publicly identified as antiamerica n or involved in illegal activities and to keep the relationship with us intelligence agencies secret public disclosure could not only destroy the sources usefulness but also serve to undermi ne us efforts to recruit and retainhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30252crs16 42 see crs report 951204 intelligence agencies information supp ort to law

response to the 1994 assessment of the joint task force on intelligence and law enforcement reached to ensure that exchanges of information are soundly established and preserve the integrity of the judicial process as well as the legitimate functions of the intelligence community42 these entities have considered the nature and extent of appropriate law enforcement intelligence coordination in pretrial discovery and established administrative policies regarding such cooperation43 the joint task force did not consider that need existed for statutory changes concerns about the future of interagency relationships in the postcold war era were also reflected in the intelligence authorization act for fy 1995 pl 103359 signed on october 14 1994 the act established commission to review the roles and capabilities of the community the resultant commission on the roles and capabilities of the united states intelligence community44 made an extensive review of the activities of intelligence agencies and concluded that law enforcement can be an extremely powerful weapon against terrorism drug trafficking and other global criminal activity but it may not be the most appropriate response in all circumstances often the perpetrators have sought sanctuary in other countries and cannot be brought to trial compiling proof beyond reasonable doubtthe standard in criminal casesmay be even more difficult with respect to global crime diplomatic military or intelligence measures in many cases can offer advantages over strict law enforcement response or can be undertaken concurrently with law enforcement45 the aspinbrown commission recommended that direction of the effort be vested in seniorlevel committee of the nationa l security council nsc and that the committee include the attorney

perceived by the aspinbrown commission to facilitate the intelligence contribution to the struggle against transnational threats the fy1997 intelligence authorization act pl 104293 section 814 amended the national security act to authorize elements of the intelligence community to collect information outside the united states about individuals who are not us persons they would do so at the request of law enforcement agencies notwithstanding that the law enforcement agencies intend to use the information collected for purposes of law enforcement investigation or counterintelligence investigation for the defense department this authorization extended only to nsa the national reconnaissance office and the national imagery and mapping agency and not to the intelligence offices of the military services this seemingly minor shift was strongly criticized by some civil libertarians as significant step towards blurring of important distinctions between intelligence and law enforcement and essentially giving nsa law enforcement responsibilities for the first time in addition congress has undertaken to remove some statutory prohibitions that were seen as inhibiting intelligence support to law enforcement efforts the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 pl 104132 included provisions that allow the use of classified information indicating terrorist connections in deportation hearings of aliens seeking entrance into the us presumably the classified information could derive from either law enforcement or intelligence sources the information need not be disclosed to the alien or his or her attorney beyond summary adequate to prepare defense such use of classified information has been harshly criticized some observers including some members of congress believe that these provisions violate constitutional requirements for due process others however consider that revealing such information in deportation or visa cases could provide terrorist organizations

principles remain however that create limits to the extent of cooperation the department of justice manual dojm states although coordinatio n on matters of common concern is critical to the proper function of the two ie law enforcement and intelligence communities prosecutors must be aware of the concomitant need of both communities to maintain welldelineated separation between criminal prosecutions and foreign intelligence activities in which lessstringent restraints apply to the government not to do so may invite the perception of an attempt to avoid criminal law protections by

justice is quite different from our own in any case if the situation were reversed it is highly unlikely that we would let foreign law enforcement officials play significant role in sensitive internal investigation of an incident that occurred on us soil61 an area of growing concern is the possibility of attacks on us information systems although such attacks thus far have apparently been few in number and without permanent effects many observers are greatly concerned that significant damage could be inflicted on the computer systems and databases that are depended upon not only by government agencies but also by important sectors of the us economy it is difficult to determine the sources of such attacks whether they originate inside or outside of us territory or whether they are isolated or part of larger plan resolving such question may be significantly complicated by statutes that assign separate responsibilities to law enforcement and intelligence organizations an attack launched by teenaged hacker from computer in the united states is clearly law enforcement matter an attack by foreign government on us defense databases would undoubtedly be viewed as concern for intelligence agencies in actuality however determining the source and purpose of the attack within reasonable time might be difficult without the involvement of both law enforcement and intelligence agencies it is

abramovsky extraterritorial abductions americas catch and snatch policy run amok virginia journal of international law winter 1991arguing that drugtrafficking is legal justification for military action70 it is clear however that noriegas drugtrafficking lay behind the invasion there is question that such forcible abductions against the desires of foreign country can greatly complicate us relations with that country such efforts according to some observers appear to many in other countries to reflect us disdain for acceptable procedures of international law they arguably contribute to the impression that the us relies on brute force and undermine legal norms it is easy to imagine the public consternation in the us if another country snatched us official and put him on trial71 on the other hand supporters of such unilateral actions argue that in extreme cases forcible abduction may be the best means to deal with flagrant criminals whose activities seriously jeopardize us interests moreover the process results in public trial by judicial system that is arguably among the fairest in the world they further point out that the only remaining alternatives are diplomatic protests various types of economic restrictions or the employment of covert actions these they argue also have significant drawbacks diplomatic protest can be ignored recalling ambassadors or breaking relations may be an option in dealing with libya but relations with other countries including mexico are so multifaceted and important that maintaining diplomatic representation is essential economic retaliation may not affect desired target in another country but may harm broader american interests there have been more instances in which us military force has been used to inhibit and punish terrorism in april 1986 in retaliation for libyan involvement in bomb attack on berlin nightclub frequented by us military personnel president reagan ordered air attacks on libyan military targets

conformity with what international norm with what authority decided by what procedures where and how with what commensurance to the precipitating event with what degree of discrimination in targeting and with what effects as sanction and what peripheral effects on general political legal and economic processesto us military commanders and diplomats and cia clandestine units have had significant role in combat operations in afghanistan and possibly elsewhere but the response was fundamentally military operation capturing alleged criminals and returning them to the us can under some conditions be accomplished without the involvement of large military forces in such cases small elite military units or intelligence agents can capture an alleged criminal or bring suspect into the united states us courts have long ruled that such abductions do not necessarily jeopardize defendants right to fair trial72 as noted herein terrorists and narcotics smugglers abroad can be the targets of either military strikes or covert action in doing so military forces and intelligence agencies operate mostly but arguably not invariably within the indeterminate parameters of international law that permits states to act in selfdefense rather than the different and much tighter constraints of constitutional and domestic law efforts such as these that are undertaken by us officials or at the behest of us officials undoubtedly fall within the category of covert actions as regulated by statute73 supporters argue that covert actions have some advantages over certain efforts by law enforcement agencies they are deniable by definition covert action is designed in way that the role of the us is not perceived in many cases covert actions may be contrary to the laws of the country in which the action is to take place but at the same time they can be consistent with international law74 this deniability allows the us to avoid taking responsibility for actions that would be deeply offensive to foreign country or major interest group within foreign country covert actions would not necessarily involve the affront to another countrys prestige that would be involved in forcible abduction covert actions do not involve the tacit assertion or assumption that us law is superior to that of foreign country or of customary international law covert actions do not even require determination that given actions are contrary to specific provisions of us law they are built on the assumption that there are overriding national interests that have to be dealt with outside the framework of international law and normal statetostate relations but without resort to the use of military force given the existence of countries or other entities in the contemporary world that have respect for us interests or for any norm of international societyand the absence of worldwide institutions withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30252crs28 75 or us law in one case cia officials working with the iraqi resistance were

forcethe us must be prepared according to this view to take direct action to protect its interests while such covert initiatives will be endorsed by few countries they will be understood and tolerated by most such covert actions also have significant drawbacks to bring someone from foreign country to trial in the us or to act directly to impede criminal activity in foreign country the us or its agents is breaking or at the very least coming close to the edge of the laws of another country or even customary international law75 the immediate us goal may be achieved but the larger purposes of upholding rule of law are not necessarily enhanced according to some observers international law is undermined more by one country unilaterally apprehending suspected criminal and then trying him in its own courts than by the suspects allegedly illegal activities furthermore covert actions themselves reflect decision not to accept the constraints of acting openly within legal norms covert actions designed to punish illegal activities are especially hazardous some covert actions of course might only involve trying to disrupt narcotics processing or transportation facility the potential however for the loss of lives of us officials or agents is probably higher the country in which they operate if it doesnt consent to the operation may take grave offense and even retaliate covert actions also deprive the us of the premise that it is acting consistent with either national or international law there are trials court procedures cross examinations of witnesses etc resort to covert action clearly sends message that the us is prepared to operate on the basis of force and without taking formal responsibility for its actions covert actions are designed to avoid revealing the role of the us in their planning or execution they do little if anything to support adherence to norms of international society in choosing the appropriate option for dealing with threats arising abroad that can be characteri zed as criminal decisionmakers will have to weigh number of factors against the danger involved in letting alleged criminals continue unmolested they include is the country where the activity took place or is taking place prepared to deal with the activity if the us supplies relevant evidence is the country where the activity took place or is taking place politically able to turn the alleged offenders over to us authorities as result of request of through formal extradition procedures is the country where the activity took place or is taking place prepared to look the other way were the alleged offender to be forcibly abducted by us officials or agents and subsequently put on trial in the ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30252crs29 76this was of course the conclusion quickly reached after the september 11 attacks see charles krauthammer to war not to court washington post september 12 2001 p a29 similar conclusion reached before the september attacks is made by ruth wedgwood cause for alarm legal action can bring victories but preventing terrorism calls for tougher tactics washington post june 3 2001 p b1if not prepared to look the other way would the country be so offended by us actions as to retaliate in some way are there practical ways that covert action could be used to deal with the problem what would the other countrys reaction be to us covert action virtually all such decisions will be casedependent different criteria would clearly hold for efforts by terrorist group to smuggle weapons of mass destruction into the us as compared with ongoing narcotics smuggling endeavors the employment of covert action and most especially covert action that involved risk of lives would probably have far higher threshold than the delivery of démarche by the state department or request for extradition choosing the best response to transnational threats will inevitably be affected by important and not always compatible assumptions terrorism and narcotics smuggling have risen to the status of threats to us national security concern for legal standards leads many to argue that in most cases alleged terrorists and narcotics smugglers should be tried in courts of law rather than dealt with as if they were military opponents some terrorists and international narcotics traffickers are sufficiently dangerous as to lead the united states to capture alleged perpetrators and bring them to justice even if other countries laws must be evaded nevertheless the us must continue to deal with certain groups and governments even when they have relationships with terrorist groups and even narcotics smuggling some threats are sufficiently grave to require military response or covert action76 the most appropriate instrument will continue to depend heavily on the specifics of each situationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30252crs30 77this decision did not preclude the need to conduct trials of alleged terrorists captured in the course of the

advocated by stewart continuedlaw enforcement and intelligence in the war against terror the implications of september 11 2001 in the wake of the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 some attention was given to the question of whether the osama bin laden network in afghanistan should be dealt with as law enforcement or military matter the bush administration unable to persuade afghan authorities to arrest and hand over bin laden quickly decided on military option supported by covert intelligence units77 the approach was directly approved by congress by joint resolution pl 10740 recognizing that need would continue for related efforts by law enforcement agencies the administr ation also pressed for passage of legislation to enhance their authority to acquire information on terrorist activities by monitoring various forms of communications in the united states and to detain nonus persons suspected of terrorist ties in addition the administration sought authority to make available to intelligence agencies foreign intelligence information derived from grand jury disclosu res and criminal investigations this provision generated significant controversy based on concerns that such transfers would encompass extensive and sensitive personal information obtained by law enforcement agencies being made widely available to intelligence agencies some expressed concern about potential abuses noting that such information could be related to entirely lawful activities business transactions political relationships or personal opinions78 the resultant statute the usapatriot act pl 10756 eased restrictions on law enforceme nt agencies established in the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa of 1978 fisa was modified to permit exploitation of changing information technologiesrov ing surveillance pen registers and trap and trace authorities79 furthermore it permits the transfer of foreign intelligence information obtained from law enforcement sources to intelligence agencies with such transfers of information conducted in accordance with regulations established by the attorney general in consultation with the dci and with exceptions if the attorney general determines that disclosure would jeopardize an ongoing law enforcement investigation or impair other significant law enforcement interests80httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30252crs31 80continued

perceived the premise of the usa patriot act is that information about foreign terrorists acquired by law enforcement agencies including grand jury information should be available to intelligence agencies analysts would be able to put together the larger picture of groups plotting against us interests the appropriate response could be selected from variety of optionsdiplomatic protests to foreign country where terrorist activities were being planned military strike or covert action intended to destroy terrorist center or training facility an arrest in the united states or request for extradition or rendition of suspect in foreign country for trial in this country there will be advantages and disadvantages of any choice but the goal would be for the us government to have as complete picture as possible of the nature of threat as noted above particular concern regarding the use in judicial proceedings of information originated by or shared with intelligence agencies is the possibility that defense attorney might seek access to intelligence documents whose release could seriously compromise sources and methods conclusion postcold war realitiesgeopolitical and technologicalchallenge not only the statutory foundations of law enforcement and intelligence agencies but also more fundamentally constitutional separati ons of power the sorting out of roles and missions as well as oversight responsibilities has been under review by the executive branch in recent years and various coordinative mechanisms have been created nevertheless areas of overlap and uncertainty will undoubtedly remain for some time to come many observers argue that this uncertain situation should be allowed to evolve in practice before serious attempts are made to establish statutory framework for cooperation between intelligence and law enforcement agencies on the other hand some suggest that ambiguities in the roles and missions of both intelligence and law enforceme nt agencies should be resolved and that greater congressional oversight may be warranted they further argue that it may be easier to address complex jurisdictional issues and oversight responsibilities at time when relationships are malleable rather than to wait until bureaucratic rigidities set in or undesirable precedents are set during grave crises that require immediate decisions efforts to enforce international law and the extraterritorial provisions of domestic laws are increasingly important in the response of the us government to the transnational threats of the postcold war world few expect however that theyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30252crs32 will become the only recourse virtually all observers anticipate that other instruments of national power will remain essential if the security of the country is to be preserved choosing between law enforcement agencies and defense and intelligence agencies presents important difficult challenges to those responsible for policymaking competing interests have to be weighed and balanced compromises have to be made up until the present these delicate decisions have largely been made by the executive branch which has argued that statutory changes are needed some observers believe however that the time has come for larger role for the legislative branch whether major legislation is needed remains uncertain but some believe that far more extensive congressional oversight would ensure that competing values as well as institutional concerns are more thoroughly considered and that choices are subject to some public discussion the events of september 11 2001 made it clear that international terrorism is serious national security threat and have prompted major reassessment of cooperation and information exchange among all major intelligence and law enforcement agencies in the aftermath of the attacks congress took new steps to remove barriers among agencies in particular congress moved to ensure that information available from law enforcement sources including grand jury testimony would be made available to intelligence agencies in pursuit of the qaeda network all information was to be utilized to support multiphased attack by law enforcement military and intelligence agencies most observers believe that the destruction of the qaeda network in afghanistan will not mean the end of international terrorism much less all transnational threats countering them will undoubtedly require the collaborative efforts of intelligence and law enforcement agencies very few observers believe that the two efforts can be simply conflated important constitutional distinctions will remain careful analysis of the campaign against qaeda will undoubtedly inform congressional oversight of the relationship between the two communities
