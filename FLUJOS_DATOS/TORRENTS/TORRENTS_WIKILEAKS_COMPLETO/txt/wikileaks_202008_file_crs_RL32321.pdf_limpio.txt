divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32321policing in peacekeeping and related stability operations problems and proposed solutions summary one of the most crucial and difficult tasks in peacekeeping and related stability operations is creating secure and stab environment both for the foreign peacekeepers and for the indigenous population during the past decade the united states and the international community ve tried various appr oaches to providing that security most of these approach have included the use of united nations international civilian police uncivpol whose forces are contributed on case by case basis by member states while other countries usually contribute police personnel from their own national for ces the united states contracts those it contributes through private corporation in few cases such as afghanistan and iraq at this time coalition and us military forces and not the united nations train and work with indigenous police forces to provide security despite continuing improvements over the past decade the current system has several drawbacks uncivpol has been unable to provide an adequate number of welltrained policemen for indi vidual operations and to depl oy them rapidly their police forces experience lack of consistency in the type and levels of training and shortage of needed skills military for ces on the other hand are usually not trained to deal effectively with police situations these deficiencies lead to three gaps that impede the establishment of law and order particularly those cases where not all parties to the conflict are dicated to peace or where cr iminal networks have taken root the first is the deployment gap when international police are not available as quickly as needed the second is the enforcement gap where those deployed lack necessary skills in particular combined military and policing constabulary skills as well as investigative and intelligencegathering skills to deal with organized crime the third is the institution gap where competent judicial and penal personnel are needed to provide followup services to police work policymakers have long recognized th problems in february 2000 the clinton administration sought to remedy them through presidential decision directive pdd 71s broad policy reform s and guidelines although it did not allocate or request the necessary resour ces for effective implementation the bush administration is implemen ting some provisions in august 2000 the brahimi panel report proposed veral remedies to improve th civilian police system as did another report by

in peacekeeping and related stability operations problems and proposed solutions introduction after over decade of intensive expe rience with multifaceted peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations1 many analysts have conclude d that establishing secure and stable environment is one essential element for achieving sustainable peace as continued instability in iraq and afghanistan impedes the restoration of normal lives for those countries inhab itants and as haiti exhib its renewed instability some members of congress are examining with rene wed interest available tools to provide effective security while military forces are considered indispensable for establishing initial security and often are also used to maintain law and order in peacekeeping and related stability or stab ilization operations designed to normalize conditions in postconflict and postinterven tion environments their us is often controversial2 over the past decade international civ ilian police known as civpol have become increasingly recognized as generally more suited than military forces for most law and order tasks and their use has increas ed dramatically the senate foreign relations committee

on united nations peace operations under the chairmanship of lakhdar brahimi commonly known as the brahimi panel to review the united nations system for peacekeeping operations and to make recommendations to enhance its capability and response capacity in conducting future peacekeeping operations the report wa s published as letters from the secretary general to the general assembly and the security council united nations general assembly and security council compreh ensive review of the whole question of peacekeeping operations in all their aspects identical letters dated 21 august 2000 from the secretarygeneral to the president of th general assembly and the president of the security council fiftyfifth sessi on a55305s2000809 august 21 2000 this document henceforth will be referred to as the brahimi panel report civil police forces in promoting st ability in postconflict situations3 policymakers have recognized problems with their use and made efforts to deal with them among the current issues for congress are whether to provide for continued improvements to the existing system and whether to build new us and international civpol capabilities civpol advocates have advanced proposals to 1 facilitate the recruitment and rapid deployment of adequate numbers of qualified police and related law enforcement pe rsonnel to complex postconf lict missions and 2 ensure that such missions include personnel with the appropriate tr aining and skills to handle range of law enforcement situa tions these proposals encompass provisions that would stress continued imp lementation of us and reform efforts as well as provisions that would re form the existing system most important among the reform fforts were two key documents that recommended mechanisms to improve existin g civpol systems and approaches for providing and using civpol forces one was the clinton administrations february 2000 presidential decision directive 71 pdd 71 which specifically dealt with the law enforcement aspects of peacekeeping operations4 while its provisions were left largely unimplemented by the clinton administration5 the directive remains in effect under the bush administration which has begun implementing some measures the other was the united nations au gust 2000 brahimi panel report6 which dealt with problems of peacekeeping operations in general but also contained four specific recommendations to address problems with the civilian police system particularly in the areas of recruitment training and deployment of international civilian police personnel the united nati ons has begun impleme nting some of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32321crs3 brahimi panel recommendations and other proposed reform s while others remain under discussion among the proposals recommended by advo cates are 1 the creation of reserve civpol force as could be cont emplated under hr 1414 for the and as proposed for th united states under hr 2616 2 the diversification of international police forces as currently constituted including the establishment of units of police with military skills ie constabulary forces to handle hostile situations such as crowd control as is suggested for nato under hr 2616 and 3 the creation of more robust civilian res ponse mechanisms as contemplated by s 2127 and related proposals including propos for stability package of lawyers judges prosecutors and penal experts in addition to civpols to create viable law enforcement systems an important consideration to many policymakers is whether recommendations for improving the civpol mechanisms could reduce reliance on us military forces in postconflict ope rations or shorten the length of their deployments to such operations this report will provide brief synopsis of the evolution of the uses of international police in peacekeeping operations with description of the problems encountered appendix provides synopsis in chart form of many of these operations appendix b

acronyms used only once are not includedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32321crs5 7 some analysts also note that the relative proportions of military peacekeeping personnel and the numbers of uncivpols involved in operations have shifted this is due not only to the increase in uncivpols but also in large part to the assumption by nato and ad hoc coalitions of the military aspects of peacekeeping operations the number of military peacekeepers peaked in september 1994 when 75947 troops and military observers were deployed in 16 operations and 2017 uncivpols were deployed to those operations in novemb er 2000 the number of uncivpols peaked at 7800 while the number of troops and military observers had declined to 30601 in 15 operations the number remained above 7000 for nearly two years from july 31 2000 through june 30 2002 as of february 29 2004 there were 4655 uncivpol in eight of the 15 peacekeeping operations wh ich had total of 44590 m ilitary tr oops and observers 8 specifically section 660b6 exempts assist ance provided to reconstitute civilian police authority and capability in the postconflict rest oration of host nation infrastructure for the purposes of supporting nation emerging from in stability and the provision of professional public safety training to include training in internationally recognized standards of human rights the rule of law anticorruption and th promotion of civilian police roles that support democracy 9 some analysts argue that despite the excep tion for postconflict situations the existence continuedbackground the international community has increasingly turned to civpols to perform variety of functions in internationa l peace operations between 1994 and 2000 the number of international civilian police participating in operations uncivpols increased fourfold despite drop from that peak the number of currently deployed uncivpols is twice what it was nearly ten years ago7 as of february 29 2004 4655 in ternational civilian police including 476 americans were assisting with law enforcement tasks in the eight peacekeeping missions with uncivpol components in additi on several nations including the united states continue to provide bilateral assistance especi ally training to indigenous police forces in variety of postconflict s ituations some analysts urge the eventual deployment of sizable contingents of international civilian police to afghanistan where the united states germany and the united kingdom are now working to recreate an indigenous police fo rce to iraq where the united states and jordan are doing the same and to haiti as of february 29 2004 five uncivpol were deployed to afghanistan all us assistance for law enforcement entities abroad is carried out within the context of section 660 of the foreign assistance act of 1961 as am ended faa adopted in 1975 except for specific exempt ed cases section 660 prohibits aid to train advise or provide financial support for police prisons or other law enforcement forces of any foreign gove rnment or for programs of internal intelligence or surveillance on behalf of foreign government among the exceptions to section 660 is one that states that it does not apply to assistance in postconflict situations8 such assistance is provided and the details regarding it are worked out on casebycase basis as there is specific statutory authority to regulate and fund such assistance9httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32321crs6 9 continued of general prohibition on police assistance nd the lack of specific funding authority discourages its provision and impedes its delivery there are various more general authorities under which assistance to foreign police forces can be provided one recent policy analysis of postconflict needs argues that congress should replace section 660 with new legislation outlining available authoritiesthe replacement act should maintain appropriate conditions on funding to protect human rights objectives and ensure accountab ility while rationalizing and consolidating the numerous amendments and simplifying the mechanisms for applying resources to legitimate requirements play to win final report of the

duties receiving and investigating public complaints about the police and supervising investigations conducted by local police from congo to kosovo op cit p 17evolution of roles and functions international civilian police forces have been used for variety of purposes and in many situations since at least the late 19th century see appendices and b since then police forces with recruits fro m one to many nations have been used to monitor and supervise local forces conduct jo int patrols with them train and advise them and assist with their restructurin g and reformation including identifying and expelling undesirable members the acr onym smart has been used to summarize these functions ie support for human rights monitoring advising reporting and training10 sometimes partic ularly recently the intern ational forces have been armed and granted arrest powers referred to jointly as executive authority usually they are not11 during the past decade policing in peacekeeping and related operations has evolved through what might be described as five appr oximate phases of increasing scope and complexity aimed at establishi ng security these phases have been roughly but not entirely sequential and have tended to build on previous experiences as analysts have noted how ever operations need not necessarily be modeled after the latest opera tions the first two phases of this evolution involved the expansion of activities andor mandates from 1 monitoring mandates httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32321crs7 12 the grant of executive authority to intern ational police and military forces is highly controversial and there is considerable inte rnational debate over the utility and the wisdom of granting civpols such authority pdd71 mandated conservative approach towards conveying such authority to foreign forces stating that in most cases indigenous police forces should retain responsibility for local law enforcement with exceptions made in cases where indigenous police are unable to control local crimes pdd71 white paper op cit p 10 13 other proposals which are more operational in nature and will not be discussed at any length here are the need for more advance pl anning and procurement of resources and the need for the development of guidelines for the conduct of police and mechanisms to ensure accountabilitywhich have been constant of virtually all operations through 2 the addition of training components beginning in small ad hoc manner in cambodia intensified in salvador as part of the police reform effort and made an im portant part of us led and subsequent peacekeeping effo rts in somalia and haiti and 3 the development of mandates that include substantial reform and restructuring of existing police institutions or the creation of new institutions as in somalia and haiti and later operations two subs equent phases were 4 the addition of specially constituted constabulary units designed specifically to operate as such in hostile situations beginning with bosnia and 5 in the operations in east timor and kosovo the expansion of mandates to provide international police with executive authority to bear arms and make arrests12 see appendix for list of uncivpol and other police operations since 1989 and information on their responsibilities and the number of police authorized andor deployed on these missions and appendix b for narrative account of the evolution of civpol mandates and activities this evolution reflected the international communitys growing awareness of the broad range of security needs and types of assistance required by indigenous police forces in peace operations also as the scope of international interventions has broadened policymakers nd analysts have increasingly viewed ensuring public security as the responsibility of the countries and organizations which have intervened to be provided jointly where possible with indigenous personnel at the same time policymakers and analysts recognized several important problems these problems concerned the need for the adoption of clear and feasible mandates which is outside the scope of this pa per and the development of standards and procedures for smooth and effective implementation problem areas system and security gaps as policymakers and analysts have grappled with improving the mechanisms for implementing peacekeeping mandates they have identified two problem areas or sets of gaps which mu st be addressed in order to ensure public security these gaps are of concern to us policymakers and are the subject of recent legislative proposals13 the first problem area might be labeled system gap this concerns what many analysts perceive as deficiency in the recruitment and training mechanisms ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32321crs8 14 see for example andrew higgins as it wields power ab road us outsources law and order work wall street journal february 2 2004 pp a1 a12 15 the terminology used in this paper regard ing the three security gaps involved in peacekeeping operations the deployment gap th law enforcement gap and the institution gap is that of oakley et in robert b oakley michael j dziedzic and eliot m goldberg eds policing the new world disorder pe ace operations and public safety washington dc national defense university press 1998 hereafter referred to as policing the new world disorder pp 1113 other analysts use other terms in particular the term security gap for one or more of these gaps current systems the problem is considered particularly acute for the united nations which recruits volunteers from wide vari ety of countries with different police standards and policing practi ces because of this diverse pool the united nations has for years encountered difficulties in recruiting an adequa number of well trained and professiona l policemen who can work together effectively besides large number who lack basic skills including the ability to drive and required language capabilities some of the early recruits including both american and foreign allegedly engaged in corruption14 over the past decade the united nations has adopted procedures to weed out obvious misfits but as missions have become more complex and demanding problems re main in recruiting personnel with all needed skills in addition many analysts ar gue that additional training is required 1 to improve and instill common set of g eneric policing skills necessary for all policing missions and uniform standard of professionalism and 2 to enhance their ability to work together the second problem area is the presence of three security gaps in the ability of the international community to establish law and order in peacekeeping and other postconflict situations15 deficiencies in recruitment and training systems can contribute to the first two of these gaps these gaps can be particularly troublesome in situations where not all parties to the conflict are dedicated to peace or where criminal networks have taken root and where local authority has been removed or replaced by an international intervention the first of these security gaps is the deployment gap or the failure or inability to deploy police forces as quickly as needed or in adequate numbers to perform the mission assigned to them this was noted in the us unilateral intervention in panama in 1989 and subsequently in some of the earliest international missions of the 1990s for example in cambodia there the uncivpol mission could not perform some of its ma ndated tasks because it took several months to deploy civpol components and some 10 months for the mission to reach its authorized size in somalia it took nearly full year to deploy the first dozen unc ivpol in other cases such as bosnia in the mid1990s the unite d nations was able to recruit only about half of the number authorized for the mission although deployment time apparently has been somewhat reduced as missions have become more complex it still is not considered optimal in addition gap remains in the uns ability to deploy sufficient number of people with specialized skills httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32321crs9 16 for updates and more detailed information see httpwwwunorgdeptsdpkodpk ocontributorsindexhtmthe second is the enforcement gap or the inability of deployed police forces to assure the level of security needed to provide the necessary climate to conduct normal policing ope rations in these cases the police deployed often lack the necessary skills to handle the situation in particular th military skills needed to carry out constabulary functions in hostile situations and investigative and intelligencegathering skills to deal with organized crime when military forces have not been available to assist police in handling hostile situations either because they were in short supply as occurred in somalia in 19931995 or because their mandate did not include law enforcement functi ons as in bosnia in 1996 peacekeeping operations have been compromised the third is the institution gap where the indigenous law enforcement system lacks adequate numbers of honest and efficient judicial and penal personnel as well as sound judicial and penal institutions and thus are unable to effectively followup to police work with prosecution and punishme nt necessary for sustainable security in many postconflic t situations understaffed if not partially intimidated or corrupted judiciaries and penal systems lacking even basic resources ve not been able to handle effectively the increased workload that results from more efficient policing current systems and reforms since the end of the cold war the international comm unity has provided international police assistance through multilateral and unilateral mechanisms the united nations has been the principal act or in international police operations but the european countries and regional organi zations and the united states have also played important roles the united nations international civilian police system is currently the mechanism through which much international civilian police assistance is provided in multilateral operations as of february 29 2004 some 4655 uncivpol officers from 65 nations were serving in eight missions16 about fifth of those countries 13 provide about twothirds of those officers the largest contributor is jordan 553 and the second largest is th united states 476 other countries contributing over 100 officers are india 347 germany 259 turkey 194 the ukraine 192 nepa l 182 malaysia 178 romania 176 pakistan 172 argentina 146 poland 127 and the unite d kingdom 126 over 75 of those uncivpol 3508 were serving in kos ovo the largest uncivpol mission by far as of february 29 2004 other missions are

multilateral efforts during the early to mid1990s the united states provided police assistance in two us peacekeeping operations in somalia and haiti carried out under au thority the united states also took the lead in developing police training pr ograms in somalia through the justice departments international criminal investigative training assistance program icitap which continues to provide direct training and reform assistance for more information see appendix b many european union eu member states have contributed police ssistance on an individual basis including the united kingdom germany sweden belgium netherlands france spain and italy increasingly over the past decade the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce and more recently the european union eu have taken the lead in specific missions often as an adjunct or followup to missions for instance while the united nations has had res ponsibility for the overall police mission in kosovo the osce has provided civpols to establish the new police academy and train the members of the new police force there the osce also has missions which provide training assistance and support fo r building local

canadian peacekeeping press of the pearson peacekeeping centre canada 2002 pp 9496 references to the undpko seminar recommendations are taken from perito p 95 23 there was one brahimi and several undkpo seminar recommendations in this area for instance one undpko seminar recommendation called for an organizational change within the civpol office of the undpko proposing that the united nations augment the small group of six officers there who were res ponsible for supporting all uncivpol missions since that recommendation according to the undpko civpol office the number has been increased gradually to 24 20 of whom are pr ofessional staff and four of whom are administrative there was some overlap between the brahimi panel recommendations and the undpko seminar proposals as the undpko pr oposals also called for the incorporation of civpol personnel under the standby arrangement system created for military personnel as well as measures to improve training the undpko seminar recommendations also made specific proposal for pre positioning of equipment in order to facilitate rapid deployment three other undpko recommendations concerned proce dural and organizational impediments to efficient operations some of the brahimi panel and undpko seminar recommendations have been implemented although many analysts judg that significant problems remain with the uncivpol system the following sections on recruitment training and deployment discuss 1 the perceived probl ems in these areas 2 the three brahimi and the three undpko seminar reforms that were recommended to remedy recruitment training and deployment problems and 3 the status of reform implementation these sections also di scuss constraints on uncivpol reform in these areas since the brahimi panel report was issued some analysts find that the has made progress in other areas one of these is the reform of the operational technical and internal management of undpko wh ich was the subject of brahimi and of undpko seminar recommendations23 these topics are outside the scope of this report the brahimi panels specific recommendati ons were based on recognition that the increasingly broad and complex unciv pol operations targeted at reforming and restructuring local police called fo r new approach this new approach required more qualified and better trained law enfor cement personnel working in tandem with other rule of law professionals the brahimi panel report defined this new approach as doctrinal shift emphasizing reform and restructuring instead of monitoring advising and training activities further this doctrinal shift required that the law enforcement personnel integrate th eir activities with those of rule of lawhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32321crs13 24 brahimi panel report op

requiring them t provide even more welltr ained and specialized police experts at time when they ready face difficulties meeting current requirements25 further some analysts see various problems with implementing this approach for one it is c ontroversial within the civpol system where the undpko and cpd perspective seems to be that the primary role and function of uncivpol personnel is building local poli ce services capacity according to some experts the reasoning undergirding this viewpoint is that broad and intrusive undertakings would infringe on member st ates perceptions of the inviolability of national sovereignty and the principal of noninterference and in any event would prove unfeasible because of limited personnel material and financial resources nevertheless the united nations has take n steps towards greater use of full range of rule of law experts in peacekeeping operations by creating new rule of law unit still recent report of the henry l stimson center views progress towards integrating rule of law related components as gging as the undpko received only two of the six posts it requested for pl anning rule of law operations leaving it nearly as hardpressed to deploy mission with substantial criminal justice component police prosecutors judges correctionsas it was three years ago26 for further discussion on the use of such experts see the option on the development of us stability force below recruitment the current ad hoc system of recruiting civilian police from wide range of member nations re sults in three problems the first two of which are the subject of sp ecific reforms proposed by the brahimi panel report and the undpko seminar first the united nati ons still experiences uneven results in recruiting police who can meet minimum standards and w ho in many cases lack experience with community policing and international human rights standards even though efforts to improve the overall qua lity reportedly have had some success27 in addition as uncivpol roles have expande d the united nations has experienced significant difficulties in recruiting police officers with specialized skills third problem is the absence of comprehensive civilian police strategy including methodology for determining mission n eeds which has made it difficult to determine the appropriate au thorized strength and necessary skills for missionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32321crs14 28 in determining such requirements undpko does undertake on theground assessments of such factors as the character of the local population the ratio of indigenous police to the local population local crime statistics and the causes of criminality 29 criteria verified as current as of march 19 2004 additional desired but not essential competencies

guidelines for uncivpol first draft may 1997 30 ibid p12according to some analysts28 this in turn they argue complicates the process of recruiting an adequate number of suitable civ ilian police pers onnel with skills appropriate for ssion requirements despite increasingly complex manda tes and responsib ilities for uncivpol missions the united nations only requires mber states to provide officers who meet basic criteria excluding other missionspeci fic requirements29 currently the criteria for civilian police include 1 min ium age of at least 25 2 five years of service in national police force with community policing experience 3 proficiency in one of the official nguages arabic chinese english french russian or spanish 4 possession of drivers license 5 ability to operate four wheel drive

but not mandatory many analysts assert that some civ ilian police personnel still do not meet the basic selection criteria especially language driving and firearms skills despite efforts to improve the quality of recruits since 1996 the united nations has sent selection assistance teams sats to provide guidance to member states in selecting police candidates the sats and induction tests conducte

according to many analysts undpko reportedly has d better success recruiting for general skills than in recruiting in advance for specialists in areas such as training investigations organized crime forensics drug trafficking and police intelligence specialists have often been recruited from within the missions after uncivpol personnel have arrived three of the brahimi panel and the undpko seminar recommendations concerned the advance recruitment of personnel ie before mission is authorized in order to improve the quality of recruits and also to speed deployment although analysts consider activities in the predeployment stage crucial to holding down the costs of dealing with unqualif ied personnel success has b een mixed in implementing these recommendations the brahimi panel report recommended that member states establish under the syst em of standby arrangements unsas national ready roster of preselected and trained civpol personnel available for ployment on short notice the report specified that such nationa l pools be comprised of serving police officers augmented if nece ssary by recently retired police officers who meet the professi onal and physical

time frame for military and police personnel can be t according to the special committee on peacekeeping operations47 the committee alluded to three constraints on rapid deployment the inability of the current system to handle concurrent or nearly concurrent deployment of two or more missions the limited capacity of the civilian standby arrangements system with regard to regionspecific expertise and the need for contributing states to exercise the political will to quickly deploy welltrained and equipped civilian police personnel as mentioned in the section on recru itment above some reform is underway regarding the united nations system fo r standby arrangements unsas for personnel and equipment this reform will enable the united nations to deploy more rapidly in the future as will the

called for the contractor to identify technical advisors who are not police officers who could be called upon to assist with establishing institutional capabilities in police judicial and corrections systems the state departments decision to award contracts for the new civpol cadre program to multiple companies rather than one as originally envisioned has raised some questions about whether the proce ss will be as expeditious as originally planned while there may be some dvantages to be gained by continued competition for civpol deployments and the greater number of applicants from which to choose which some may judg necessary because of the iraq and afghanistan missions some analysts fear that these advantages will be offset by additional costs and delays moreover the extent to which the original rfp provisions continue to apply are unclear as the new contracts have not been made public further details are discussed below under the appropriate headings recruitment while the current recruitment program has enabled the united states to provide civpols to po lice missions for several years and more recently to dispatch them unilaterally to iraq experts have disagreed on the

agencies most poli ce officers take leave of absence others resign to perform international police service and some are recent retirees many analysts recognize that the system draws from overextended

compensation or reimbursement for detailing police officers to civpol missions this would appare ntly require new legal arrangements however currently law enforcement agen cies receive financial incentives for officers participating in international police service some also argue that the recruitment of individual us police officers rather than of formed police units has made the us police continge nt less cohesive this cont ributes to the already varied mix within uncivpol forces56 in addition some analysts assert that the us selection criteria do not accurately reflect mission requirements current employment selection criteria for civilian police candidates vary according to mission but all include 1 us citizenship 2 eight years of work experience with at least five years as an active sworn civilian law enforcement officer and currently serving as sworn office or recently separated from service within five ye ars 3 an unblemished record 4 valid drivers license and

th formation of standing force72 or force of paid reservists that train together some propone nts state that the bill only intends for the structure to be negotiated with the united nations73 the bill also expresses sense of congress that the corps should be given appropriate resources to do its job properly including funding equipment tr aining logistical support and staffing the staff would

regarding the use of uncivpol personnel in police missions most importantly the deployment gap and to sser extent the enforcement gap some proponents argue that such measure should address ot her issues such as creating mechanism to ensure adequate and c ontinued funding and specifying size for the proposed uncpc the bills findings state that the creation of professional police corps would allow the united nations to take re sponsibility more quickly and effectively for maintaining secure environment the findings argue that this would greatly reduce the number of combat soldiers needed

june 26 200375 among its provisions the bill contains sense of congress statements proposing two new mechanisms to provide security in postconflict situations where reconstruc tion efforts are underway one of those proposed mech anisms the establishment of us civilian police reserve may constitute substantial upgrading of the current ad hoc us civpol system according to the proposal this reserve of law enforcement officers would be capable of 1 serving overseas as an interim police force in postconflict situations and 2 of training and equippi ng indigenous civilian police forces in such situations the bill also suggests procedure by which the united states would establish the civilian police reserve through section 8 of the bill congress would call upon the president to establish task fo rce comprised of federal state and local law enforcement officials to develop the reserve second proposal calls for new nato mechanism to provide broad range of military and policing services in pos tconflict situations it calls upon the administration to propose to nato that 1 selected nato units be trained and equipped to provide security in reconstruction situati ons and 2 nato establish an integrated security support component to pr ovide that training and equipment if nato were to accept the proposal the bill authorizes the president to commithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32321crs31 personnel to the support component such personnel should be capable of providing for the security of civilians including serving as police force the illustrative tasks that the bill specifies that the selected units be able to perform include one requiring constabulary skills ie the c ontrol of belligerent groups and crowds as well as those requiring policing investigative and intelligence skills ie apprehending targeted persons or groups performing anticorruption tasks and supporting police investigations for mo re information on constabulary forces and their functions see the option on constabulary forces below relative merits of possible us reserve models proponents argue that the proposed legislation would provide us support for increasing international capabilities to provide security environm ent in which postconflict reconstruction can occur in particular civilian police reserve would help bridge the deployment gap as the availability of pool of onca ll officers would expedite the deployment of us civilian police it is unclear however whether the intention of the legislation was to establish civilian police reserve in line with the state departments current private sector model as described earlier or to establish new us government reserve force along the lines proposed under the stability force model discussed below proponents of the private contractor mode l argue that it is preferable because commercial contractors can often respond more quickly and because use of the private sector avoids the creation of new government bureaucracies opponents of this model might find that limitations often cited regarding the use of commercial contractors in military operations may also apply to policing operations for example commercial contractors may not exhibit the same dedication to their job in situations where unexpected changes may occur particularly in the level of risk and the conditions of the job some opponents of governmentsponsored reserve might concede that federal agency could conceivably deploy reserve civpol force as efficiently and speedily as private contractor but only if civilian law enforcement personnel were maintained as paid reservists such as under the us military reserve system at cost some policymakers may consider prohibitive proponents of the governmentcreated mode l argue that government reserve is more potent symbol of us commitment more responsive to us policy and might well prove more cohesive force than privatelycontracted force in addition proponents argue its members would be more accountable further some argue that government agency could better guarantee the quality of recruits as it would have greater incentives to establish more stringent screening mechanisms in addition it might more easily to draw qualif ied civpol personnel from local and state police departments as discussed in the u s civpol section above if compensation system were established fo r departments that provided personnel to federal service it might be easier to establish such compensation under federal reserve model than under private contractor reserve model the desirability of predeployment training also could influence judgments regarding the relative merits of governmentsponsored vs governmentcontracted reserve force if the police reservists regularly trained together as us military reservists do and established mechanisms for coordination with military forces they arguably could prove more effective and reliable contingent than those assembledhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32321crs32 76 pdd71 white paper op cit p 11 pdd71 does however recognize constabulary role for military forces it states that us military forces shall ma intain the capability to support constabulary functions abroad and if necessary carry out constabulary functions under limited conditions for limited period of time p 10 77 recently law enforcement officials have raised concerns over possible drain on municipal and state police forces because of the large number of law enforcement officers serving in the reserves and national guard with continuing guard and reserve callups for homeland defense and overseas military deployment levels additional demands for law enforcement personnel may limit the supply in addition law enforcement agencies may face financial hardship by holding position ope n up to one year for most police missions until an officer resumes active duty sheriff stephen oelrich of alachua count in gainesville florida is one of several law enforcement officials who has personally particip ated in and had his men volunteer for the us civpol program despite his support for th program he states that overreliance on municipal law enforcement agencies will likely limit supply for the us civpol program especially in the absence of financial incen tives pdd71 states that state and municipal governments should be reimbursed for the costs related to their participation in the provision of us civpol to field operations pdd71 white paper opcit p 4 telephone continuedunder the current ad hoc model this might be eas ier under governmentcreated model than under contractor model questions regarding nat constabulary capability the nato constabulary capability could help bridge the enforcement gap as it would provide through nato the full range of skills need ed in postconflict situations according to proponents some question however whether nato military organization is the wrong venue for any force with polic ing functions many analysts argue that the use of military forces for policing func tions may in the words of pdd71 over an extended period send in appropriate signals to ci vil authorities and the local population76 some critics also argue that the creation of such reserve within nato may duplicate current european uni on structures and possibly add one more source of friction in useuropean relations additional considerations some analysts argue that the bill should contain additional provisions on equipment training and coordination with the military for one they argue that without previous commitment of equipment by the united states the deployment of us and other police reservists may well be delayed while needed supplies are assemb led in addition some argue that the creation of us or intern ational reserves without th provision of standardized training would only perpetuate the lack of conformity in policing styles that is viewed as undermining current operations in addition many of the problems of past operations might be repeated in the future if mechanisms werent established and perhaps some joint training provided with the us and other military forces other critics are skeptical of the need for such forces or of the need for the commitment of us police officers to them some critics argue that by creating police reserves the bill may only draw upon existing police resources which are already in short supply and would contri bute to tensions with local and state governments77 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32321crs33 77 continued

within three years of enactment the bill would require that 10 of state department and usaid personne l be identified and trained for this force although this measure is interpreted as intended at least in part to address the institution gap created by delays in deploying rule of law personnel neither the legislation nor senator lugars floor statement in introduc ing the bill specify the types of personnel who are to be recruited and the extent to which this cadre would include stability ie police and other rule of law experts versus recons truction experts is not clear see the section below on the development of stability force for related opinions on such capability other options to strengthen current capabilities and address system and security gaps improve the training and professi onalization of civpol personnel many experts assert that substantially increased and improved training especially in basic functions and pr ofessionalization of existin g civpol personnel might significantly assist in bridging the depl oyment gap as the scope and mandate of police missions have increased predeployme nt training has not kept pace with the needs according to some analysts in stead in places like bosnia kosovo and east timor training adjustments were made in the field on casebycase basis recognizing the importance of adequate and appropriate trai ning pdd71

already have them and the creation of new capabilities in the nations that do not hr 2616 discusse d above proposes incorporating unit capable of performing cons tabulary functions within nato constabulary police perform variety of tasks that require less force than combat but more force than routine law enforcement ac tivities as defined by pdd71 constabulary tasks include the regulation of peoples moveme nts when necessary to ensure safety interventions to stop civil violence such as vigilante lynchings or other violent public crimes and to st op and deter widespread or organized looting vandalism riots or other mobtype actionand the dispersal of unruly or violent public demonstrations and civil disturbances80 less heavily armed than combat soldiers constabulary forces are trained in both military and policing skills and use those combined skills to carry out their duties making them essential for variety of hostile situations that occur more frequently in postconflict areas than in nations at peace when deployed on peacekeeping missions constabulary police often are quipped with their own communication and logistical support also constabulary forces usually can deploy more rapidly than other civpols because they typically are deployed as formed units ie in groups that have previously worked together and will continue to do so instead of as individuals many analysts argue for the establishment of specialized paramilitary units such as those available in other countries citin g them as the most appropriate forces to conduct constabulary tasks in peacekeeping operations81 presently several countries already have national police forces or specialized paramilitary police units that are trained as constabulary forces such as the italian carabinieri the french gendarmerie and the spanish guardia civil among others as noted by several analysts as well as pdd71 these resources can be and often are severely strained by high deployment

in the reserve shortages occur when peacekeeping deployment rates are high according to some reports army analysts and policymakers are considering this op tion however army leaders have long resisted structuring the rvice to facilitate peacekeeping operations arguing that military force is weakened if it is structured to fulfill secondary missions such as peacekeeping rather than its primary warfighting mission83 with the subsequent us interventions in afghanistan and ira q however many analysts have questioned whether military forces can be said to have won war if they have not established the conditions for durable peace as do some military personne l who believe army forces are most valuable if they are ad aptable and capable of performing security tasks in high medium and low intensity conflict environments proponents of such forces argue that as an intermediary security force for peace operations capable of handling some vi olent situations which are beyond the capabilities of civpol constabulary forces can reduce reliance on combat soldiers to engage in policing activities as well as shorten their withdrawal time from post conflict situations according to many analysts84 currently regular military forces often perform constabulary functions in peacekeeping operations despite their lack of training and resources despite these possible advantages analysts are uncertain whether other countries would be willing to augment their constabulary capabilities or whether countries that do not now possess such cap abilities might want to develop them for deployment abroad drawing an analogy with us localities that they perceive as stressed by the temporary depl oyment of police officers ab road some analysts judge that like the united states other countries are increasin gly concerned about meeting domestic needs develop us force for stability final option to address the institution gap in peace operations is the velopment of rapidly deployable units of law enforcement and rule of law personnel to ensure susta inable security several analysts have urged the development of us and international capabilities to rapidly deploy full range of rule

proponents of stability force model argue it has many advantages many analysts view the early deployment of rule of law personnel as essential to providing security from the outset of an operati on which they argue will enhance the possibilities for longterm stability and democracy in an intervened or postconflict country many also view such struct ure as permitting the earlier withdrawal of military personnel than would ot herwise be possible nevertheless as proposed by perito such force would require certain changes in current us practices for the military it would require the development of significant constabulary capabilities including an increased number of military police and for the international civilia n police component as proposed by perito constabulary and police personne l would be provided by new federal agency which would recruit active duty and retired officers as temporary federal employees instead of being hired through contract ors as is the current

police in peace operations op cit p 39appendix b historical background early international and cold war police operations the dispatch of groups of bilateral nd multilateral interna tional policemen to advise and train local police forces predat ed the first world war european nations sent police units in the late 1800s to provi nces of the disintegrating ottoman empire and to albania in 19131914 to create new po lice force early police monitors were deployed to guard the suez canal in 1882 and under the league of nations to the saarland in 193591 the first use of civilian poli ce in peacekeeping operation took place in 1960 with the operation in the congo when first ghanaian contingent was deployed for few months and next nige rian contingent which remained for about year after the operation ended in 1964 they were tasked with assisting the congolese police in maintaining order subsequently in 196263 the united nations provided temporary execu tive authority untea to administer west new guinea during the transition from dutch to indonesian rule and recruited philippine police officers to assist the cal force the peacekeeping force in cyprus unficyp beginning in 1964 and co ntinuing to the present day was the first operation where the term uncivpol was used and the first multilateral police force unficyp civpols assisted cypriot police in maintaining order and providing security in sensitive areas in hopes of diffusing tensions postcold war evolution of international police assistance predominance of monitoring manda tes cambodia et 1989 early 1992 and

recorded in n ovember 2003 took place in areas where there were welltrained police forces as did the operations of the cold war period92 the united nations transition assistance group untag in namibia

deployed in another tenuous situation through the protecti on force peacekeeping operation 19921995 to the new states created by the breakup of yugoslavia with civpols deployed in 1992 first to croatia then to bosniahercegovi and last to macedonia for variety of monitoring functions their missions were largely overwhelmed by the escalation of armed conflict which many analysts attribute to an inadequate mandate and insufficient number of unprofor military forces the transition administration in cambodia untac was one of the last and certainly the largest and most ambitious peacekeeping operation in which police served strictly monitoring manda broad operati on in other respects untac did little to increase the scope of police operations and powers in the mandate as result the untac police mission underwent significant shift of responsibilities in the field as rethought the focus of the untac police unit was to investigate complaints of violations of political liberties and human rights when cambodian police failed to apprehend those cited as suspects of such violations by uncivpols the secretarygeneral s representative began in january 1993 bestowing arrest powers on civpols by directive and for the first time in operation and mandating the establishment of an untac jail both actions however came too late to make the operation effective according to some analysts95 cambodia was one of the first places wh ere the slowness of deployment which took some 10 months to get to the field in full strength due to problems of raising large force was noted as hindrance to the effective performance of the entire operation96 it was also quickly recognized that although untac had been assigned the task of ensuring law and order the num bers of authorized police were inadequate for such task as result of this deployment gap the untac police missionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32321crs46 97 peacekeeping in transition op cit p 82 98 trevor findlay cambodia the legacy

quickly recognized the need for training not only the police but also the judiciary according to one analyst once in the field they could clearly see the value of such training as few resources were availa ble according to the same source some civil police undertook makeshift training using their own training manuals97 analyses of the untac operation among others led to the concept of the development of an institution gap as untac police were perceived as unable to promote justice due to the lack of an ad equate and i ndependent judicial system which had been systematica lly removed by the previous pol pot regime to punish those that untac police apprehended98 as result analysts developed the idea of deploying integrated justice packages of justice and penal officials as well as police officers police reform and training components added 19921994 and recognition of enforcement gap reform of police forces became pivotal element for the first time in the ob server mission in

convince contributing governments that civilia n police deployment in peacekeeping operation had come to stay despite her judgment that the success was overshadowed by high crime rates and the continued medd ling of the salvadorian sic military104 while the salvadoran experience may have been the first charged with creating new police force subsequent missions in the next few years had at

although it had orig inally intended to leave the reorganization of somali police forces to the force which was to follow107 the asf was intended to enforce locally agreed upon laws and be controlled by the community in essence to be community police force108 and eventually was present in 17 cities and towns109 as perceived by one of its organizers the asf would eliminate the n eed for unitaf troops to serve as police not only freeing them for other duties but avoiding confusion about their role and reducing friction with the local populati on thus minimizing casualties on both sides police force would also enable somalis to deal with ordinary criminal activity as distinct from organized looting and robbery and give them some responsibility for their own affairs finally it would creat jobs and provide income to several thousand otherwise unemployed somalis110 unitaf encouraged the somali police who according to at least one an alyst were respected by the somali population to act on their own while the llied military forces were available as backup near the police stations111 substantial assistance was provided for the asf by unitaf the united nations and indivi dual nations through bilateral assistance according to one analyst the development program undp paid salaries and operating expenses provided equipment and office furnishings and refurbished police

they arrived there were enough training and cu ltural differences among them to impede the development and deliver of coherent program116 in the interim unosom ii military forces worked with the us

uncivpols left in march 1995 with the forced withdrawal while the unitaf asf is judged as achieving some success in providing police forces that offered protection to citizens and enjoyed legitimacy that it conferred by extension upon unitaf its success was attributed by some analysts to the commitment of unitaf to back it up when it f aced level of violence that it could not control nevertheless

often due to the lack of widelyaccepted peace accord as result the use of military force may be needed to maintain law and order often in primary role when violence is high other times as s upplement to police forces when the level is lower the somalia operation also demonstrat ed several other problems in the judgment of many analysts these were that 1 an international civilian police force cannot function where there is eff ective ceasefire 2 uncivpol missions because of the sheer diversity of their ex periences are not as currently constituted particularly wellsuited for training local police and 3 an institutional gap ie the lack of adequate courts and prison system and lack of political settlement will undermine even successful police re form efforts in the long run118 similar gaps were highlighted in haiti where six years of intensive us and police reform effort s demonstrated dramatically in the opinion of some analysts the problems created by the institutional gap reform efforts in haiti began under the usled multilateral force m fn sept 1994 march1995 the mfns police component the international police monitoring force ipm with about 820 monitors from 20 countries was

deployment of iptf personnel in some analysts judgment the death of only one person during the weeks of relocation was remarkable accomplishment127 but the gutting burning and boobytrapping of many dwellings in the process pointed to an enforcement gap given that iptf had neither the authority nor the resources to act and ifor refused to act in law enforcement capacity in the absence of an imminent threat to life in the opinion of one analyst the result flight of bosnian serbs from sarajevo suburbs led to the perception of yet another failure in bosnia and loss of credibility for unde rstaffed and underresourced iptf which lacked law enforcement powers arguabl she writes it took the iptf almost year to recover from its inability to live up to exaggerated expectations and made it more difficult to gain popular confidence128 in late 1996 the smaller nato stabilization force sfor replaced ifor operating under the same provisions of the dayton peace accord as ifor it provide d backup when the iptf did not possess adequate force to maintain public order the enforcement gap in bosnia was also covered in another way the development of specialized units within the iptf term that meant paramilitary forces ie police forces specially trained in certain military skills necessary to handle exceptional law enforcement s ituations especially hostile groups paramilitary and paramilitarylike police its from foreign nation principally the gendarmarie from france the carabinieri from italy and the guardia civil from spain had taken part in other policing operations in the early 1990s they were integrated into international civpols and not assigned special functions by the late 1990s however the utility of such police to fill perceived gap between military capabilities and the abilities of unarmed police monitors was recognized the first place that the gap was filled with such unit was in bosnia in 1998 when the multinational specialized unit msu was formed the msu
