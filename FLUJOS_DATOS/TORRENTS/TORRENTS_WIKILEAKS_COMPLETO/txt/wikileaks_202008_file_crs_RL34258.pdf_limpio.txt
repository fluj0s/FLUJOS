supplies canadas oil sands will likely account for greater share of us oil imports oil sands account for about 46 of canadas total oil production and oil sands production is increasing as conventional oil production declines since 2004 when substantial portion of canadas oil sands were deemed economic canada with about 175 billion barrels of proved oil sands reserves has ranked second behind saudi arabia in oil reserves canadian crude oil exports were about 182 million barrels per day mbd in 2006 of which 18 mbd or 99 went to the united states canadian crude oil accounts for about 18 of us net imports and about 12 of all us crude oil supply oil sands mixture of sand bitumen heavy crude that does not flow naturally and water can be mined or the oil can be extracted insitu using thermal recovery techniques typically oil sands contain about 75 inorganic matter 10 bitumen 10 silt and clay and 5 water oil sand is sold in two forms 1 as raw bitumen th at must be blended with diluent for transport and 2 as synthetic crude oil sco after being upgraded to constitute light crude bitumen is thick tarlike substance that must be upgraded by adding hydrogen or removing some of the carbon exploitation of oil sands in canada began in 1967 after decades of research and development that began in the early 1900s the alberta research council arc established by the provincial government in 1921 supported early research on separating bitumen from the sand and other materials demonstration projects continued through the 1940s and 1950s the great canadian oil sands company gcos established by u sbased sunoco later renamed suncor began commercial production in 1967 at 12000 barrels per day the us experience with oil sands has been much different the us government collaborated with several major oil companies as early as the 1930s to demonstrate mining of and insitu production from us oil sand deposits however number of obstacles including the remote and difficult topography scattered deposits and lack of water have resulted in an uneconomic oil resource base only modest amounts are being produced in utah and california us oil sands would likely require significant rd and capital in vestment over many years to be commercially viable an issue for congress might be the level of rd investment in oil sands over the long term as oil sands production in canada is predicted to increase to 28 million barrels per day by 2015 environmental issues are cause for concern air quality land use and water availability are all impacted socioeconomic issues such as housing skilled labor traffic and aboriginal concerns may also become constraint on growth additionally royalty regime favorable to the industry has recently been modified to increase revenue to the alberta government however despite these issues and potential constraints investment in canadian oil sands will likely continue to be an energy supply strategy for the major oil companies

oil reserves are estimated at 1292 trillion barrels the middle east accounts for 58 of world oil reserves and the organizati on of petroleum exporting countries opec accounts for 70 the middle east also leads in reserve growth and undiscovered potential according to the energy information administration eia1 the united states total oil reserves are estimated at 227 billion barrels scant 18 of the worlds total see appendix us crude oil production is expected to fall from 54 million barrels per day mbd in 2004 to 46 mbd in 2030 while demand edges up at just over 1 annually net imports of petroleum are estimated by the eia to increase from 121 mbd 58 of us consumption to 172 mbd 62 of us consumption over the same time period2 when it comes to future reliable oil supplies ca nadian oil sands will likely account for larger share of us oil imports oil sands account for about 46 of canadas total oil production and oil sand production is increasing as conventional oil production declines since 2004 when substantial portion of canadas oil sands were deemed economic canada has been ranked second behind saudi arabia in oil reserves canadian crude oil exports were about 182 million barrels per day in 2006 of which 18 mbd or 99 went to the united states canadian crude oil accounts for about 18 of us net imports and about 12 of all us crude oil supply an infrastructure to produce oil upgrade refine and transport it from canadian oil sand reserves to the united states is already in place oil sands production is expected to rise from its current level of 12 mbd to 28 mbd by 2015 however infrastructure expansions and skilled labor are necessary to significantly increase the flow of oil from canada for example many refineries are optimized to refine only specific types of crude oil and may not process bitumen from oil sands one issue likely to be contentious is the regulatory permitting of any new refinery capacity because of environmental concerns such as water pollution and emissions of greenhouse gases challenges such as higher energy costs infrastructure requirements and the environment may slow the growth of the industry for example high capital and energy input costs have made some projects less economically viable despite recent high oil prices canada ratified the kyoto protocol in 2002 which bound canada to reducing its greenhouse gas ghg emissions significantly by 2012 but according to the governme nt of canada they will not meet their kyoto air emission goals by 2012 the pembina institute reports that the oil sands industry accounts for the largest share of ghg emissions growth in canada 3 major us oil companies sunoco exxonmobil conoco phillips and chevron continue to make significant financial commitments to develop canadas oil sand resources taken together these companies have already committed several billion dollars for oil sands with some projects already operating and others still in the planning stages many of these same firms with the us government did considerable amount of exploration and development on tar sands in the united states conducting several pilot projects these us pilot projects did not prove to be

abandoned because of the disappointing results in the united states and the expansive reserves in canada the technical expertise and financial resources for oil sands development has shifted almost exclusively to canada and are likely to stay in canada for the foreseeable future however with current oil prices above 60 per barrel and the possibility of sustained high prices some oil sand experts

matter quartz sand bitumen and water that can either be mined or extracted insitu 5 using thermal recovery techniques typically oil sands contain about 75 inorganic matter 10 bitumen 10 silt and clay and 5 water6 bitumen is heavy crude that does not flow naturally because of its low api7 less than 10 degrees and high sulfur content the bitumen has high density high viscosity and high metal concentration there is also high carbontohydrogen molecule count ie oil sands are low in hydrogen this thick black tarlike substance must be upgraded with an injection of hydrogen or by the removal of some of the carbon before it can be processed oil sand products are sold in two forms 1 as raw bitumen that must be blended with diluent 8 becoming bitblend for transport and 2 as synthetic crude oil sco after being upgraded to constitute light crude the diluent used for blending is less viscous and often byproduct of natural gas eg natural gas condensate the specifications for the bit blend heavy oil are 215 4 reserves are defined by the eia as estimated quantities that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions resources are defined typically as undiscovered hydrocarbons estimated on the basis of geologic knowledge and theory to exist outside of known accumulations technically recoverable resources are those resources producible with current technology without consideration of economic viability 5 insitu mining extracts minerals from an orebody

sand deposits dates back to the 1930s throughout the 1960s and 1970s 52 pilot projects involving mining and insitu techniques were supported by the us government in collaboration with major oil companies such as conoco phillips petroleum gulf oil mobil exxon chevron and shell several steamassisted technologies were being explored for insitu production these sources have had little economic potential as oil supply the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 however established public lands leasing program for oil sands and oil shale 17 rd based on the canadian experience with oil sands production it was established that commercial success in mining oil sands is function of the ratio of overburden to oil sand thickness18 this ratio should not exceed one in other words the thickness of the overlying rock should not be greater than the thickness of the sand deposit it was estimated by the usgs that only about 15 of the us resource base has ratio of one or less 14 canadian oil

include remote and difficult topography scattered deposits and the lack of water for insitu production steam recovery and hot water separation or undeveloped technology to extract oil from us hydrocarbonwetted deposits19 the canadian technology may not be suited for many us deposits in texas deposits were considered by conoco oil to be too viscous to produce insitu bureau of mines experiment with oil sands production in kentucky proved to be commercially infeasible in utah there were attempts at commercial production over the past three decades by several oil companies but projects were considered uneconomic and abandoned as of 2004 some oil sands were being quarried on utah state lands for asphalt used in road construction and small amount of production is taking place

one of its newly recruited scientists dr karl clark began his pi oneering work on hotwater flotation process for separating the bitumen from the sand in this separation process the mined oil sand is mixed with water and sodium hydroxide base and rotated27 in horizontal drum at 80 degrees centigrade dr clarks efforts led to pilot plant in 1923 and patented process by 1929 he continued to improve the process through several experimental extraction facilities through the 1940s the technical feasibility was demonstrated in 1949 and 1950 at facility in bitumont alberta located on the athabasca river near fort mcmurray the technology being tested was largely adopted by the early producers of oil sands great canadian oil sands gcos ltd and syncrude sunoco established gcos ltd in 1952 and then invested 250 million in its oil sands project another major player in the oil sands business in canada was cities services based in louisiana cities services purchased controlling interest in the

in 1967 using the hot water extraction method developed and sted by arc in 1967 suncor began to produce oil sands at rate of 12000 barrels per day just year later in 1968 the government of alberta deferred an application by syncrude canada for 200 million 80000 barrel oil sands facility eventually in 1978 the energy resources conservation board of alberta approved syncrude s proposal to build 1 billion plant that would produce up to 129000 barrels per day however arco which represented 30 of the project pulled out of the consortium as costs of th plant climbed toward 2 billion at that point 1978 the federal and provincial governments joined in the federal government purchased 15 share alberta 10 share and ontario 5 making up the 30 deficit at the time the canadian government was promoting the goal of energy selfsufficiency and the alberta government agreed to 5050 profitsharing arrangement instead of normal royalties for syncrude 30 26 the arc was established in 1921 housed at the university of alberta in edmonton and funded by the provincial government of alberta its mandate was to document albertas mineral and natural resources today the arc is whollyowned subsidiary

barrels per year in 1984 the government of alberta agreed to new royalty structure for oil sands producers coinciding with syncrudes capital expansion plans in 1985 the alberta government announced that existing oil sands operations and new plants would not be taxed on revenues and the petroleum gas revenue tax would be phased out during the same timeframe syncrudes cash operating costs were just under 18 per barrel with total costs over 20 per barrel 33 while the market price of oil fluctuated under 20 per barrel because of huge capital requirements oil sands producers lobbied for continued royalty relief and thought the government should defer tax and royalty revenues until project expansions were completed 34 in 1994 the national oil sands task force an industrygovernment

simultaneously using another horizontal well located below the steam injection well see figure 4 the sagd process has recovery advantage over the css process which only recovers 25 30 of the natural bitumen also the lower steam to oil ratio the measurement of the volume of steam required to extract the bitumen of sagd results in more efficient process that uses less natural gas 42 sagd operations are limited to thick clean sand reservoirs but it is reported by the industry that most of the new insitu projects will use sagd technology43 number of enhanced sagd methods are being tested by the alberta research council they could lead to increased recovery rates greater efficiency and reduced water requirements the emerging vapor extraction process vapex technology operates similarly to sagd but instead of steam ethane butane or propane is injected into the reservoir to mobilize the hydrocarbons towards the production well this process eliminates the cost of steam generators and natural gas this method requires water and processing or recycling and is 25 lower in capital costs than the sagd process operating costs are half that of the sagd process44 fourth technique is cold production suitable for oil sands lighter than those recovered using thermal assisted methods or mining this process involves the coproduction of sand with the bitumen and allows the oil sands to flow to the well bore without heat imperial oil uses this process at its cold lake site oil sand produced using insitu techniques is sold as natural bitumen blended with diluent for pipeline transport 42

for carbon removal or hydrocracking for hydrogen addition see figure 5 coking is common carbon removal technique that cracks the bitumen using heat and catalysts producing light oils natural gas and coke solid carbon byproduct the coking process is highly aromatic and produces low quality product the product must be converted in refinery to lighter gas and distillate hydrocracking also cracks the oil into light oils but produces coke byproduct hydrocracking requires natural gas for conversion to hydrogen hydrocracking used often in canada better handles the aromatics the resulting sco has zero residues which help keep its market value high equivalent to light crude partial upgrading raises the api of the bitumen to 2025 degrees for pipeline quality crude full upgrade would raise the api to between 3043 degreescloser to conventional crude an integrated mining operation includes mining and upgrading many of the mining operations have an onsite upgrading facility including those of suncor and syncrude suncor uses the coking process for upgrading while syncrude uses both coking and hydrocracking and shell uses hydrocracking for the complete oil sands processing chain see figure 6 45

integrate the upgrading with the refinery to cut costs eg linking sagd production with current refinery capabilities longterm processing success of oil sands will depend on how well this integration takes place and how well the industry addresses the following issues cost overruns cost effective upgrading reducing highly aromatic highsulfur sco and dependence on and price of natural gas for hydrogen production originally used because of its low price but now considered by some to be too expensive the wide heavyoillightoil price differential has been an incentive to increase upgrading the

significantly since the 1970s early supply costs were near c35 per barrel in 1970s dollars reductions came as result of two major innovations in the production process first power shovels and energy efficient trucks replaced draglines and bucketwheel reclaimers and second hydrotransport replaced conveyor belts to transport oil sands to the processing plant48 operating costs include removal of overburden mining and hydro transport primary extraction treatment and tailings removal the recovery rate overburden volumes cost of energy transport distances and infrastructure maintenance all have an impact on operating costs supply costs total costs include the operating costs capital costs taxes and royalties plus 10 return on investment roi when compared to conventional new oil production starts an oil sands project may have operating costs over 30 higher than the world average for conventional new starts however its nearly nonexistent royalty and tax charge makes the total cost per barrel of energy significantly less than the conventional oil project the neb in its energy market assessment estimated that between us3035 per ba rrel oil is required to achieve 10 roi 49 operating costs for mining bitumen were timated at around c912 per barrel c2005an increase of up to c4 per barrel since the 2004 neb estimates supply cost of an integrated miningupgrading operation is between c36 and 40 barrel for scoa dramatic increase over the c2228 estimate made in 2004 these supply costs for an integrated miningupgrading operation were expected to decline with improvements in technologies see table 3 however natural gas prices rose 88 and capital costs rose 45 over the past two years operating costs for sagd insitu production in 2005 were about c1014 per barrel of bitumin up from c740 per barrel in 2004 recovery rates are lower than with mining at 4070 and the price of energy needed for production is much larger factor the sagd operations are typically phasedin over time thus are less risky make less of footprint on the landscape than mining operation and require smaller workforce sagd supply cost for athabasca oil sand rose from between c1117barrel bitumen to c1822barrel using the css recovery technique supply costs are estimated higher at between c2024barrel an increase from c13 19barrel cost increasesdecreases for insitu operations are largely dependent on the quality of the reservoir and natural gas prices but as sagd and other new technologies eg vapex become more efficient industry is expecting some cost declines sagd insitu supply costs are less sensitive to capital costs than mining projects because the capital investment is far less natural gas is major input and cost for mining upgrading and in situ recovery mining requires natural gas to generate heat for the hot water extraction process upgraders need it for heat and steam and in situ producers use natural gas to produce steam which is injected underground to induce the flow of bitumen natural gas accounts for 15 of the operating costs in mining operations compared to 60 of operating costs in sagd insitu production the major cost for thermal insitu projects sagd css is for the natural gas that powers the steamproducing generators for sagd projects 1 thousand cubic feet is needed per barrel of bitumen reducing the steamtooil ratio sorthe quantity of steam needed per

specific to oil sands for all new investments or expansions of current projects since then oil sand producers have had to pay 1 minimum royalty based on gross revenue until all capital costs including rate of return are recovered after that the royalty is either 25 of net project revenues or 1 of the gross revenues whichever is greater52 the 1 prepayout royalty rate is in stark contrast to conventional world royalties net project revenues essentially net profits before tax include revenues after project cash costs such as operating costs capital and rd are deducted royalty payments may be based on the value of bitumen or sco if the project includes an upgrader currently 51 of oil sand projects or 75 of production volume under the generic royalty regime are paying the 25 royalty rate two major oil sands producers suncor and syncrude accounting for 49 of bitumen production have crown agreements in place with the province that have allowed the firms to pay royalties based on the value of synthetic crude oil sco production with the option to switch to paying royalties on the value of bitumen beginning as early as 2009 royalties paid on bitumen which is valued much lower than sco would result in less revenue for the government the agreements expire in 2016 50 cos 2004 p 18 51 the generic oil sands royalty regime consists of three parts the lease sale minimum 1 prepayout

and 2005 for example royalties from oil sands were less than 100 million in 1999 then rose to 700 million in 20002001 but fell in 20022003 to about 200 million as production continued to rise royalties from oil sands rose dramatically in 20052006 to 1 billion and the government of alberta forecasts royalties of 25 billion in 20062007 and 18 billion in 2007200853 oil price fluctuations are the primary cause for such swings in royalty revenues the albertan provincial government established royalty review panel in february 2007 to examine whether alberta was receiving its fair share of royalty revenues from the energy sector and to make recommendations if changes are needed in its september 2007 report the panel concluded that albertans do not receive their fair share from energy development54 when the oil sands industry was ranked against other heavy oil and offshore producers such as norway venezuela angola united kingdom and the us gulf of mexico alberta received the smallest government share 55 this is however difficult comparison to make because it is not among oil sand producers only and the fiscal regimes of the various producing countries is dynamic however based on general analysis by td securities typically on average world royalty rates could add as much as 45 to operating costs while the 1 rate may add only 3 to operating costs56 the panel recommended keeping the prepayout postpayout framework intact see footnote 52 which would retain the 1 prepayout royalty rate but in the postpayout phase firms would be required to pay higher net revenue royalty rate of 33 plus continue to pay the 1 base royalty on october 25 2007 the alberta government announced and published its response to the royalty review panels report57 it retained the prepayout postpayout royalty framework but concluded that slidingscale rate structure would best achieve increasing the governments share of revenues from oil sands production the prepayout base rate would start at 1 then increase for every dollar above us55 per barrel using the west texas intermediate or wti price reaching maximum increase of 9 when prices are at or above 120 per barrel in the postpayout phase the net revenue rate will start at 25 then rise for every dollar oil in priced above us55 per barrel reaching maximum of 40 of net revenues when oil is 120 per barrel or higher the new rate structure will take effect in 2009 the government of alberta has initiated negotiations with suncor and syncrude in an attempt to include them under the new oil sands royalty framework by 2009 oil sand firms pay federal and provincial income taxes and some differences exist in the tax treatment of the oil sands and conventional oil industries since the provincial 1996 income tax act both mineable and insitu oil sand deposits are classified as mineral resource for capital cost allowance cca purposes which means mine ral deposits receive higher cost deductions than conventional oil

co 2barrel from oil sands is three times as high as that from conventional oil production66 the industry believes if it can reduce energy use it can reduce its emissions as emissions per barrel of oil from oil sands decline overall the canadian government projects that total ghg emissions will continue to rise through 2020 attributing much of the increase to increased oil sands production67 water supply and waste water disposal are among the most serious concerns because of heavy use of water to extract bitumen from the sands for an oil sands mining operation about 23 barrels of water are used from the athabasca river for each barrel of bitumen produced but when recycled produced water is included 05 barrels of makeup water is required according to the alberta department of energy oil sands projects currently divert 150 million cubic meters of water annually from the athabasca river but are approved to use up to 350 million cubic meters68 concerns however arise over the inadequate flow of the river to maintain healthy ecosystem and meet future needs of the oil sands industry additionally mining operations impact freshwater aquifers by drawing down water to prevent pit flooding the freshwater used for insitu operations is needed to generate steam separate bitumen from the sand hydrotransport the bitumen slurry and upgrade the bitumen to light crude for sagd operations 9095 of all the water used is recycled since some water is lost in the treatment process additional freshwater is needed to minimize the use of new freshwater supplies sagd operators use saline water from deeper underground aquifers the use of saline water however generates huge volumes of solid waste which has posed serious disposal problems wastewater tailings bitumen sand silt and fine clay particles slurry also known as fluid fine tailings are disposed in large ponds until the residue is used to fill minedout pits seepage from the disposal ponds can result from erosion breaching and foundation creep 69 the principal environmental threat is the migration of tails to groundwater system and leaks that might contaminate the soil and surface water70 the tailings are expected to reach 1 billion cubic meters by 2020 impounding the tailings will continue to be an issue even after efforts are made to use alternative extraction technology that minimizes the amount of tails tailings management criteria were established by the alberta energy and utilities boardcanadian environmental assessment agency in june 2005 ongoing extensive research by the canadian oil sands network for research and development conrad is focused on the consolidation of wastewater tailings detoxifying tailings water ponds and reprocessing tailings some rd progress is being made in the areas of the cleanup and reclamation of tailings using bioremediation and electrocoagulation 71 the national research council of canada nrc is conducting research to treat wastewater tailings and recover their

naturally operators however are responsible over the long term to restore the land to its previous potential73 under an alberta energy utility board directive aeub albertas upstream oil and gas reclamation and remediation program has expanded industry liability for reclaiming sites the directive requires sitespecific liability assessment that would estimate the costs to abandon or reclaim

strategically important domestic resource that should be developed to reduce the growing dependence of the united states on politically and economically unstable sources of foreign oil imports 76 the provision also requires that leasing program for oil sands rd be established given us oil sands strategic importance but limited commercial success as discussed above what level of federal investment is appropriate to reach us energy policy goals while an estimated 11 billion barrels of us oil sands may be significant if it were economic it represents small share of the potentially recoverable resource base of unconventional fuels eg 800 billion barrels of potentially recoverable oil from oil shale and another 20 billion barrels of recoverable heavy oil where is the best return on the rd dollar invested for increased domestic energy supply and what are the longterm prospects for commercial application of unconventional fuels technology another important consideration to look at is where the oil industry is investing its capital and rd for oil sands projects in light of the environmental and social problems associated with oil sands development eg water requirements toxic tailings carbon dioxide emissions and skilled labor shortages and given the fact that canada has 175 billion barrels of reserves and total of over 300 billion barrels of potentially recoverable oil sands an attractive investment under current conditions demonstrated by the billions of dollars already committed to canadian development the smaller us oil sands base may not be very attractive
