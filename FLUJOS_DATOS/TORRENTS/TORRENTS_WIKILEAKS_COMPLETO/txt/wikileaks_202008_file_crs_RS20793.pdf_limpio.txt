lending in response to the asian financial crisis and its global aftermath the world bank is the largest mdb as figure 2 indicates it provided more than half of all mdb assistan ce in 2000 it also provided more than 62 of all mdb concessional aid that year see table 1 page 6 concessional loans accounted for about 22 of all mdb assistance see figure 3 nearmarket or commercial rate loans guarantees or equity investments comprised the other 78 mdb nearmarket rate loans accounted for 61 of the total the private sector facilities provided the other 17 organization structure the mdbs are autonomo us interna tional agencies that finance development programs in low and middleincome countries using borrowed money or funds contributed by donor countr ies the international monetary fund is similar body since 1979 it has lent mainly to developing countries its operations affect economic conditions in its borro wer countries however the imf is monetary institution and it does not fund development projects it is not included in this report run by their own manage ment and staffed by international civil servants the mdbs are supervised by boards of governors and boards of executive director s representing their member country governments voting shares are weighted on the basis of countries contributions the governing boards meet annua lly each country has its own governor the executive boards are smaller bodies 22 members in the case of the world bank fewer for some mdbs they meet weekly to consider mdb loan and policy proposals and oversee bank activities the ifad board meets thrice annually the governors have delegated much of their power to the eds for example the executive boards can hire or fire the president of their bank the mdbs do not use money contributed by their donors to fund their operating costs rather these are paid for with income earned from the mdbs reserves or from their loans see crs report rs20413 imf and world bank us contributions and agency

us ida was created to make lowcost loans to the poorest countries ibrd and ida loans require government repayment guarantees the ifc was created in 1955 to make non guaranteed loans to and equity investments in private firms in develop ing countries miga was created in 1988 to encourage investment in developing countries thorough insurance and guarantees protecting foreign investors against noneconomic risk the idb was created in 1959 in response to strong desire by latin american countries for bank that would be attentive to their needs the afdb was created in 1964 and was until 1983 an africanonly institution the afdf was created in the early 1970s to provide concessional loans using contributions from nonregional countries the adb was created in 1966 to promote regional cooperation the ebrd was established in 1991 to promote marketoriented reform in the former communist countries of eastern europe and the former ussr ifad was created in the late 1970s to fight hunger and promote food security the nadb is joint mexicanus agency created by nafta to address border environmental issues and traderelated community adjustment problems except for the ebrd and nadb all mdbs have marketrate and concessional loans windows ifad provides both types of loans through its main account most also provide some of the more specialized forms of assistance the world bank and idb have separate affiliates which provide assistance on commercial terms to private sector firms the adb and ebrd make private sector loans through their marketrate loan windows miga is the only institution focusing on investment insurance and guarantees but several of the banks also make loan guarantees through their main loan windows mdb members and stockholders the world bank is now nearly universal institution only cuba north korea brunei taiwan and some microstates do not belong countries must be members of the imf to join the world bank they need not be imf members to join the regional banks or ifad taiwan is member of the adb north korea has applied to join the adb neither belongs to the imf cuba and north korea are members of ifad as are most other member countries countries must be members of an mdb to borrow from it mdb sectorregional activities the mdbs finance variety of activities in the past two decades the world bank has lent about 25 of its ibrd and ida funds annually for economywide structural adjustment or sectorwide sector adjustment reform programs the afdb and idb now also make adjustment loans these provide balance of payments support to countries conditioned on their governments agreement to undertake major policy reforms most mdb loans fund development projects or programs however the project cycle involved in the preparation of these loans may takehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20793crs4 figure 4 mdb assistance to economic sectors 1999 figure 5 regions receiving mdb assistance 1999several years before proposal is ready for presentation to an mdb executive board after loan is approved full disbursement of the proceeds may take up to eight years or more the mdbs do not release funds to the borrower immediately rather they disburse funds only as the work progresses and approved invoices from suppliers are received mdb loans generally cover about onethird of projects cost goods and services purchased with mdb loans are subject to open international competitive bidding initially the mdbs lent mainly to finance the construction of infrastructure or directly productive activities eg industry or commercial agriculture in the 1970s and 1980s they expanded the share of their aid targeted for poverty alleviation or economic policy reform this trend has continued in the past decade the world bank halved the share of its loans going for infrastructure oil and mining while it more than doubled the share going for social programs with us encouragement it increased 10fold the share allocated for population health or nutrition programs the idb in particular has emulated this trend during the recent international financial crisis while the amount of mdb adjustment lending increased the share going to fund social protection programs which protect vulnerable people and continue social services also increased figure 4 shows the sectoral pattern of mdb assistance in 1999 mid2000 for the world bank overall the mdbs channeled half of their funds into loans guarantees and equity investm ents for infrastructure industry and finance the social sectors received 23 of all mdb funds substantial amounts 18 also went to finance reform of governm ental institutions improvements in the effectiveness of court systems or customs procedures for instance or for economic policy reform about 7 went for agricultural projects major decline from the shares in earlier decades many rural poverty projects are included in the social category the rapid urbanization of many developing countries has brought more mdb emphasis on nonagricultural issues about 3 of mdb assistance went to fund direct environmental projects this does not include the environmental aspect of projects in other sectors table 2 shows the amount which each mdb channeled into each sector that year figure 5 shows the global distribution of mdb assistance in 1999 latin america was the largest recipient of mdb aid south asia and east asia regions which together contain over onehalf the worlds population received 11 and 18 respectively subsaharan africa received the most mdb concessio nal aid with 41 of the total see also table 1 south asia was the next largest recipient with 26 sub saharan africa received 441 per capita for the year south asia received 134 per capita thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20793crs5 per capita gnp of south asia is lower 440 than that for africa 500 east asia got about 14 of all mdb concessional aid while latin america region with much smaller population and higher per capita annual income received 11 of the total proposals for restructuring there have been proposals in recent years that the world bank should be essentially closed and its functions transferred to the regional banks in asia and latin america the regional banks now lend more to regional countries than does the world bank however three issues of concern have been noted first there is regional bank for the middle east the countries of the region seem unready to cooperate in mutual development second the african bank has serious administrative and operational weaknesses though it has made improvements in recent years see crs report rs20329 african development bank and fund most analysts agree that many years will elapse before it is ready to supplant the world bank in africa third the mdbs differ considerably in their loan emphases table 2 shows that the world bank lent 23 of its funds for social programs the idb lent 38 for these activities while the adb lent 18 and the afdb allocated only 13 most experts agree that it is much easier for donor countries to work within global institution to expand its worldwide emphasis on particular activities than it would be for them to seek coordinated action and comparable priorities in the separate regional banks mdb finances loan terms the mdbs lend threequarters of their funds on marketbased terms using money borrowed commercially in world capital markets these are usually variable rate loans charging about onehalf percent more than an mdb pays on the average to borrow funds generally depending on the project loans are repayable over 12 to 25 years the banks can borrow at advantageous terms slightly more than the us government pays to borrow funds because they have the financial backing of the capital subscribed by their member countries part of this often 10 or less is paidin capital the rest is callable payable if as last resort an mdb is bankrupt and needs funds to pay its creditors there has never been call on callable capital except for the afdb most mdbs have substantial reserves mdb concessional loans have long repayment periods up to 40 years and very low interest costs the mdb concessional loan programs are funded with money contributed by their more prosperous member countries debt owed to mdbs cumulatively through 1999 2000 for the world bank the mdbs have made loan commitments totaling 780 billion some 360 billion has been repaid of the rest 315 billion was currently outstanding another 105 billion had been approved but not yet disbursed about 07 of the former some 31 billion was overdue countries that had suffered massive civil conflict the former yugoslavia the former zaire liberia and somalia owed 60 28 billion much of the rest was owed by countries syria iraq and myanmar having major disputes with the international system except for loans to private creditors the mdbs do not reschedule loans or participate in debt restructuring plans if countries fall 6 months behind on payments the mdbs stop disbursing on existing loans or reviewing new proposals recently in response to the debt crisis in heavily indebted poor countries hipcs the world bank is writing off debt owed by 20 hipc countries it is also raising funds to reimburse some regional banks so they can writeoff some virtually unpayable debts owed to them thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20793crs6 2 in tables 1 and 2 figures are in millions of us dollars middle
