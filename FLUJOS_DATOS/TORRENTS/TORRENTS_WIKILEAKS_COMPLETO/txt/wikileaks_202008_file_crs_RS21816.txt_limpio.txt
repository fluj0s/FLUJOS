crs web japans selfdefense forces in iraq motivations constraints and implications for usjapan alliance cooperation richard p cronin specialist in asian affairs foreign affairs defense and trade division httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21816 summary the capture and subsequent release of five japanese civilians in two different hostagetaking situations by islamic terrorist groups in iraq in april 2004 underscored the high stakes for both the japanese government of prime minister junichiro koizumi and for the usled coalition except for the small communist and socialist parties japanese political leaders across the board supported koizumis adamant stance against responding to the hostagetakers demands that japan withdraw its contingent of some 550 troops that were deployed to samawah in southern iraq in early 2004 while this show of resolve by japan has been welcomed by the bush administration the longer term effect of the hostagetaking and the upsurge in anticoalition violence may reinforce the views of many in japan including the main opposition party that agreeing to send japanese troops to iraq was mistake number of japanese commentators and political leaders have suggested that the governments main motive for sending troops was to strengthen usjapan alliance cooperation in the face of perceived security threats from north korea and rising china not because of strong agreement with us policy in iraq from this perspective tokyos steadfastness could have positive influence on other coalition governments who may now be reconsidering their commitments while the withdrawal of japanese forces as many in japan are demanding could cause significant complications for the us effort in iraq and adversely affect broader usjapan alliance relations this report will be updated as news events warrant crisis provoked by the hostage situation the april 8 2004 seizure of three japanese civilian volunteers near the chaotic city of fallujah created the first major test of prime minister junichiro koizumis commitment to noncombat military participation in the usled coalition in iraq the kidnapping in fallujah west of baghdad reportedly was carried out by group calling itself the saraya almujahideen translated as mujahideen brigades according to the aljazeera arab news service the hostagetakers gave the japanese government congressional research service the library of congress crs2 three days to withdraw its troops or the hostages two men and woman would be burnt alive the two men aged 18 and 32 were in iraq as freelance journalists while the woman aged 34 reportedly had worked in an individual capacity for more than year helping iraqi street children and families who had taken shelter in abandoned houses all three were described in the press as pacifists opposed to japans involvement in the war1 the hostage situation the biggest challenge faced by prime minister koizumi since he first took office on april 26 2001 threw the government into crisis mode koizumi and other senior officials immediately vowed not to give in to the terrorists demands the main opposition party the democratic party of japan dpj strongly supported koizumis stance despite its prior and ongoing opposition to the troop deployment on april 11 2004 the japanese government dispatched senior foreign ministry official and special national police agency counterterrorism team to jordan to coordinate information gathering and cooperation with us agencies and special operations forces on possible rescue attempt2 in the end rescue attempt proved unnecessary on april 15 2004 all three hostages were turned over to moderate sunni group the islamic clerics association httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21816 which had been negotiating their release and which then arranged their transfer to the japanese embassy3 the same day two other japanese including freelance journalist reportedly were seized from taxi near the scene of the downing of us army helicopter outside of fallujah these hostages apparently were not threatened and were released to the same clerical group and turned over to the japanese embassy on april 17 for reasons that remain the subject of much comment in japan section of the press the political world mainly in the ruling party and the general public strongly criticized the former hostages for ignoring government calls for civilians to leave iraq jeopardizing the sdf mission in iraq and for having leftist political agenda4 bush administration response senior bush administration officials expressed solidarity with japan in regard to the hostages and us officials in the region gave high priority to cooperation to gain the release of the hostages vice president dick cheney who arrived on previously scheduled visit tokyo on april 10 in the course of weeklong trip to japan china and south korea reportedly gave top priority to urging japan to continue with its commitment regardless of the outcome of the

although this proved unnecessary japanese and us officials reportedly had begun to prepare for possible rescue attempt by us forces6 background to japans role in iraq the north korea factor concern about the near term threat posed by north koreas nuclear weapons program and ballistic missiles as well as longer term concern about rising china has had major influence on how japan views its broader alliance relations with the united states and its own international role including its role in iraq the first indication of shift in japans security outlook was apparent in the koizumi governments unusually assertive support to the united states after the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks in new york and washington among its more important actions the koizumi government pushed controversial legislation through the diet parliament that allowed japan to send small flotilla of the maritime selfdefense forces msdf into the indian ocean to provide fuel and water to us and allied ships supporting operations in afghanistan this naval deployment which was unprecedented since the end of world war ii marked new chapter in usjapan alliance cooperation7 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21816 japans vocal diplomatic support of us policy toward iraq before and during and after the usukled invasion also represented sharp break with tokyos past reticence during highly contentious debate over two days in the security council in february 2003 involving more than 50 countries japan and australia stood alone in their unequivocal support for us and british call for the adoption of security council resolution authorizing the use of force against iraq8 on december 9 2003 despite the devastating bombing of the italian police headquarters in nasiriyah in southern iraq few weeks earlier and the ambush killing of two japanese diplomats on december 1 the koizumi cabinet adopted basic plan for the deployment of up to 1100 japanese troops to iraq in late december 2003 and early 2004 japan deployed its first contingents of some 550 troops to iraq under significantly less constrained rules of engagement than previous japanese international peacekeeping operations9 while explaining his decision to send troops to iraq in terms of japans international obligations prime minister koizumi has made clear that the north korean threat and the 5 us ready to offer allout cooperation on

after announcing that japanese troops would be sent to iraq koizumi told skeptical members of parliamentary committee that japan cannot ensue its peace and safety by itself and thats why it has an alliance with the united states denying that his government was abandoning japans uncentered foreign policy koizumi argued that in the event of crisis involving japanese security the will not deploy forces to fight with japan and prevent an invasion11 some american and japanese analysts also see japans increased support of us global and regional policies as carrying the implied expectation of reciprocity in the form of greater us recognition of japans interests and concerns regarding the korean peninsula12 the most noteworthy aspect of japans logistical support of us and allied warships operating in the indian ocean and its later deployment of noncombat troops to iraq is the extent that these actions stretched what previously had been regarded as clear constitutional constraints article 9 of japans usimposed postworld war ii nowar constitutionrenounces war and the right of belligerence under longstanding finding by cabinet legal office the constitution allows japan to cooperate with the united states militarily for purposes of selfdefense but bars participation in collective defense httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21816 involving third countries these constraints have been viewed widely in japan as stretched to the limit by the deployment of ground troops to iraq especially because it could not rule out that the troops might come under fire by iraqi insurgents as consequence japans main political parties and according to polls as much as 65 of the public now agree that the time has come to consider revising the constitution regardless of their views on japans role in iraq koizumi has charged committee of the ldp with drafting suggested revisions by the end of 200513 japanese response and implications for japans future international role and usjapan alliance cooperation despite the favorable outcome the hostage incidents have had significant impact on both the political and bureaucratic leadership in japan and on public opinion the japanese public which generally did not favor sending troops to iraq nonetheless has appeared recently to be warming to japans enlarged international role in past hostage situations going back to the 1970s japanese policy often has appeared to be motivated primarily by the desire to save the lives of the hostages in this case however editorials press commentary and statements by government officials indicated awareness that the countrys international standing and the usjapan alliance would be seriously damaged 10 following the cabinets action koizumi declared at televised press conference that the time had passed when japan could just write checks and avoid making human contribution because its dangerous rather he said whats being tested is our ideals as nationjapan postpones iraq

more than 70 of the public including some 88 of younger japanese supported this position15 nonetheless the deterioration of the security situation in iraq and the hostagetaking incidents appear generally to have undercut public and political support for the koizumis policy any further incidents of hostagetaking or serious attacks on the sdf troops could seriously weaken prime minister koizumis threeparty coalition government in addition to criticism from the opposition democratic party of japan dpj number of senior ldp politicians including former head of the japan defense agency also have expressed the view that it was mistake to agree to join the usled coalition16 for the bush administration faced with the worst fighting since the fall of bagdad in april 2003 and the withdrawal of forces by spain honduras and the dominican republic japans strong stance has been important to stiffening the resolve of wavering coalition partners the first contingent of spains 1300 troops withdrew from najaf while us marines were battling the almahdi army of the militant shia cleric muqtadaalsadr for control of the city17 some other coalition partners reportedly have httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21816 been considering withdrawing their forces or not replacing them when their current tour of duty ends18 questions remain about the japanese governments staying power basic political weakness of the governments position is that the troops were sent on humanitarian and reconstruction mission and are explicitly forbidden to engage in combat except in self defense this also limits their value to the coalition the sharp upsurge in violence has raised the possibility that japanese troops could be drawn into combat for selfdefense which would jeopardize support for their mission the acting secretary general of the ldp reportedly said in an april 18 2004 talk show interview that the government would 14 the most egregious example occurred in 1997 when members

fullest possible limit20 koizumi must lead his party in elections to the upper house of the japanese diet parliament in june 2004 under what may well be adverse circumstances in lower house elections in november 2003 the ldp lost ten seats and just barely maintained its majority with the help of smaller parties whereas the opposition dpj gained 40 seats21 the opposition dpj has called for separating the issue of not yielding to blackmail from the larger question of the legality of putting troops in what it says cannot be described as noncombat area and the purposes served by japanese forces in iraq22 in any event the dpj can be expected to make criticism of the iraqi deployment major theme its campaign for the upper house elections this june httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21816 following the release of the hostages and continued resurgence of economic growth koizumis popularity rose sharply in midapril 2004 poll conducted by major national daily newspaper some 73 of the respondents said that they wanted koizumi to stay on at least for another year and ldp candidates scored clean sweep in three lower house bielections on april 2623 for number of reasons however the ldps prospects remain clouded koizumis announcement on april 8 that he will not seek reelection after his current term ends in late 2006 may make it easier for him to make hard decisions but will not necessarily help the ldp concerns about japans security and the future of the usjapan alliance would appear to continue to give japan strong interest in maintaining its troops in iraq the japanese defense agency already has announced that replacement contingent of 460 troops was being readied for iraq24 on the other hand the deteriorating security situation in iraq could still reverse japanese policy creating new problems for the bush administration and straining the usjapan alliance also despite sending replacement troops there are indications whether japan will carry out its original intention to send up to 1100 troops to iraq japans commitment to keeping its forces in iraq could also weaken if the koizumi government were to perceive that us policy towards north korea longer was
