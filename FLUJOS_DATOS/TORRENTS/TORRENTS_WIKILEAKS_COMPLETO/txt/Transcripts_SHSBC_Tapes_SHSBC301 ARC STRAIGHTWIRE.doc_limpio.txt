arc straightwire lecture given on 12 june 1963 thank you now lets see this is the what 12th of june audience 12th of june you get an extra lecture this week thats because i just didnt feel like doing anything with blocking out engrams on somebody for an hour and then leaving them to some other auditor it seemed unkind ill give you demonstration on that next week probably but well saint hill special briefing course just so youll know where you are and i want to talk to you now about fundamental subject which i havent discussed at length with you and that is arc straightwire this is very needful material and it may seem very old to some of you because im sure that your earliest introduction to processing in any academy was sitting down and struggling with arc straightwire and having it pointed out that the pc had not cycled to present time but had been left in the middle of the soup and that was why the pc was cross or some such things arc straightwire is the oldest broad process of repetitive nature it is the most ancient and in actual fact although i may be in error on this i think is the first repetitive process youll find the remains of the first version in modern publications of self analysis thats the remains of the first version but this process was based on the arc triangle and the arc triangle was originated in july of 1950 in elizabeth new jersey and was expanded in its understanding that september or november in angeles at the hdrf there now this was very important breakthrough on the field of the mind very important thing to this day there is other single tool of the auditor that invites quite as much use or understanding and so forth as the arc triangle now the best dissertation on the arc triangle itself is to be found in notes on lectures and that is the very best dissertation on that it was rewritten from series of lectures given in angeles in 1950 and frankly has not been bettered as statement now you should realize that the arc triangle comprises in actual fact the most fundamental statement of significance although it apparently is addressed to the subject of matter energy space time and significance and embraces all those things it actually is the most fundamental basis of significance itself it forms you might say bridge between the pure postulate and the significance of mest you can make pure postulate and it doesnt have to have any relationship to the arc triangle but the moment that pure postulate becomes impinged upon matter energy space and time it is immediately involved with this thing called arc and arc is the connecting link between the postulate and matter energy space and time now that matter energy space and time maycould be contained in the time track or it may be contained in the physical universe it doesnt matter what its location is you understand that time track is actually picture record of the physical universe and so in itself contains matter energy space and time now arc of course means affinity reality and communication the first thing we run into cropper on in trying to translate this is the word affinity affinity is so much itself and is so relative that we get into considerable to use texas word hassle in trying to interpret it in an auditing command generally now affinity has been very technically defined and so has reality and so has communication this is not discussion of the arc triangle but for your information the word affinity embraces everything from the know to mystery scale see it embraces the lot andas far as these aspects are concerned but it meansit means the feeling for or the feeling with or the lack of the feeling for or the lack of the feeling with dont you see and it definitely contains this connotation of feeling about you see and its not enough to say emotional response because fellow who feels effortful about effort is still experiencing affinity about effort see his affinity about effort now sympathy empathy all of these things come into this and it becomes one of these very broad subjects and the word affinity is not an adequate word to discuss these things because the word has not existed in actual fact in any language because this concept has not been well embraced by any language were up against the semantics of the situation but if you take the know to mystery scale and substitute it for the word affinity and you use emotion and misemotion and such things as that youre going to find the pc responding to it now some people are only going to respond to the idea of love they dont respond to emotion at all emotion isnt there you see and so forth but nevertheless love this expresses affinity for them you see and now when we say the emotional tone scale were talking about just fraction of the know to mystery scale so everything on the emotional scale is under this head of affinity clear from hide all the way on up and there is your expression now how many words then can be used in any command containing the word affinity thats lot of them isnt it so when we clear this command we have to clear it in an understanding of what we mean by affinity and we have this this is all graphed i mean weve got it thats broadly the know to mystery scale and then part of the know to mystery scale the middle section of course is the whole tone scale so weve got lot of words there that we can clear and well find the pc chronically resident at one or another of these levels and that of course is the level he will respond to in processing now on the word reality reality could obtain in significance alone you knowhis reality is poor and so forthto actual chunks of matter you see reality refers to all of these conditions but reality is normally considered to be considerations about something itllconsiderations about something or somebody moving on up into the more solid concepts of just matter energy space and time you see space is reality and energy is reality and matter is reality and time is reality and so on so in clearing this word you will have less trouble this word tends to clear itself with the pc more or less he can get grip on this word he sort of knows what youre talking about but if you had to vary it and the pc couldnt get grip on this thing it would beit would be much harder to do much harder to do you would have to clear it something on the basis of whether it was matter energy space or time you were talking about or considerations about things if he was totally in thought response level dont you see or evaluations about things or something of that sort harder word to clear but you understand what you would be clearing you could ask somebody you know what space have you rejected see i meanand youre still asking this question ofnumber two question of the arc triangle you should recognize that that is its flexibility now lets take communication and we have the communication formula and we mean any interchange whether its bullet or kiss see we have any interchange with its consequent duplications and so forth its anything that fits under the communication formula so in clearing that you also could move off of the idea of communication to the degree of type or kind of communication this is again less necessary communication is easy to understand but that could also contain the word duplication as well as communication it could contain the word cause as well as communication it could contain the word effect as well as communication you see what youre doing there is substituting various parts of the communication formula into that third auditing command in arc when i speak then of clearing commands it is matter of substituting words in these three arc commands so that the pc level of reality is met by the auditing command and when we say clearing the command we dont mean just does he understand this particular word that we keep hurling at him but what word communicates what were trying to communicate to him where we want to communicate at to you got it so you can do considerable amount of shifting around as long as you continue to hold to the arc formula and dont go shifting the thing around so that you ask the first question twice and the third question once and the first quyou see so that you sayyou say for instance you ask in actual fact two reality questions and one communication question and two reality questions and one communication question because this thing is going to become unbalanced very fast now the fundamental understanding of the arc process was contained in this that those three things together equate to understandingaffinity reality and communication combined in their three selves make understanding and this by the way is something i never committed to paper but i worked it out quite laboriously mathematically and otherwise in the autumn of 1950 and they actually do convert mathematically to understanding its quite interesting there is facet of understanding which falls outside of affinity reality and communication and it takes all three of these things to bring about an understanding when your pc has cognited you possibly are not totally aware of the fact that he has reached point of arc its just as easy as that you see hes reached point of arc and this has expressed by cognition well of course what is cognition but an understanding and the pc suddenly understands something well you have established arc here and having established arc you get cognition that tells you then that youre driving straight at it now oddly enough you wont get cognition if you omit one of the legs you justjust omit the and run nothing but r and c and r and c and r and c and r and c youll find your pc after little while longer comes up with well what do you know thats the whole case there youve unbalanced his understanding that is what tends to make this such powerful process because it brings up one understanding on top of another understanding on top of another understanding you see and arc should also have preserved with itany statement about itthis very very fundamental fact that if you wish to raise c which is stuck in the mud you hit the and the r and if you wish to raise the r which is stuck in the mud you hit the and the c and if you wish to raise the you had better work on the r and c now that is terribly valuable that is terribly valuable and must be preserved in any use of arc processes and the reason i give you this is already the mistake is being made he cant answer the communication question so therefore we will run it session after session after session now what is the error the fellow cant grasp the communication side of it why well he does the r easily you see and he does the other one easily but this one is stuck so youd better do the other two points so any point which is overrun or more difficult will give trouble providing you dont preserve the balance of the three questions now this gives us immediate trouble it says how do you know which one is flat well actually please look at this nonenot one of those questions will ever flatten you get that now only the three questions flatten if anything is ever going to flatten and its very doubtful if you could even flatten the three but if youve got three questions you must flatten the three questions its the three questions you are trying to flatten you are not trying to flatten one question so then dont make too many problems on when do we come off of this when do we come off of this leg dont make too many problems there there are three ways to come off of process three responses of equal length you know of equal comm lag he gives you three responses he replies to it three times at the same interval even if its half an hour each see now thats enough thats enough you can change process on that shady reasoning now thats the most crude method of changing process three responses equal length usually its interpreted to mean he answered it glibly three times so were away see thats usually interpreted to mean that all right your next method i remember in 17th acc i beat this home in lecture and the following day did the unforgivable thing of coming into class and asking the students one after the other what were the three signals which permitted you to leave process and not one of them knew that was terrible loss for i immediately invented the educational processes which havewe havent had much to do with but these three methods of ending process become important to you in running arc because you see youre flattening the triangle youre flattening three questions youre not flattening one the next one is of course by cognition pc has cognition bail out i just saw an auditor get in their mid ruds at the end of session and because there was one more to ask didnt treat the mid ruds as process pc cognited like mad on the session on the next to the last button and the auditor got in the last button the auditor unflattened the process get the idea this is athis is very interesting auditing tool if its sensibly used in other words pc has cognition to all intents and purposes you can consider the thing flat but you have to leave it right then you have to hit the silk with loud geronimo right at that point dont hang around monkeying with the ring right then bail out well how did you do on this process youve had it see pc says what do you know you know youre running communication process on him i hate people well what do you know ive often wondered about this and i really basically hate people iithats what ive suddenly realized you say ill give you this question two more times and end this process if thats all cut your throat man so when you have to use that cognition process end its hit the silk see you say all right as hes going on cogniting and talking about it you say that was the last command of that process see handle it like havingness but when you bail out on cognition you really bail out and dont return the pc to the session because the fastest thing you ever did in your life was unflatten one of these processes you can flatten them and you just took one breath too many on the next command you see you said well all right now were going to ask this question one more time and due to the fact that youve had cognition and are going to ask this question one more and thats it you now have an unflat process see so that ones very delicate thats slippy if youre going to use this one to end process with you end the process with it right now you dont wait around that was the last command all right now were going to take up the first leg of this which is what attitude has been rejected see pc will be perfectly fine just smooth man he wont even notice anything is happening your next one of course is tone arm action now this in running the arc triangle is the least reliable for any leg the least reliable its the most desirable and the least attainable itd be marvelous if the pc would promptly come down at the end of fortyfive minutes of run on one question would come down to exactly the last ten minutes 25 ta division and then you would bail it out and you would do fortyfive minutes on the next leg and it would come down sweetly precisely and obediently to 25 in ten minutes iyoure saying the rule is twenty minutes well in this one you cant afford twenty minutes to hang around and test so youd shorten it down to that much and youre never going to find this condition this is an unrealizable perfection so you say well hes had blowdown so running by blowdown is little more reliable but you cant count on him blowing down at exactly fortyfive minutes either so your ta motion is your least reliable bailout although you would look at it mechanically as your most reliable your ta is terribly valuable because you cant come off the process until its not producing tone arm reaction but the process is three questions now youre running in auditing and therunning the three questions in auditing and one of these legs oh man it goes on up to 42 and it comes down and so forth and the other two dont seem to be producing much action but this reality boy that goes up and it comes down and you just better continue your process youve got two that are apparently flat but the third is not flat you cant come off of that or actually alter the amount of time given to each leg until you get that process flat the way to flatten that process on reality is to continue to equally run with reality affinity and communication see your trick just because he wasnt flat on reality dont go beating reality to death because whats going to raise it is going to be affinity and communication legs all of this isseems rather elementary for to be talking this way i started out with very good academic approach and all of sudden come off to very fast and factual processing tips but these are the things which are going to give you the trouble with the process these little adjudications whawhatwhat uh whatwhathuh uh huh what do i do now he says he absolutely hates this communication leg he runs this reality leg like hot butter inevitably it would seem to mean that you had to flatten the communication leg when as matter of fact the thing thatll get him out of it is running the reality and the affinity and the communication leg equally so therefore we have process which can be handled in numerous ways but which has very firm beginnings and has never really departed from our roster the first thing i ever foundto get back to an historical dissertation on thisfirst thing i ever found this process doing was breaking neurosis and thats the old one thats registered in self analysis i think thats quite interesting you can take somebody who is strictly fruitcake you could pour champagne on him or brandy on him and light him up for christmas you know and hed do all right and run that process for relatively short space of time if its going to produce this type of reaction that process is going to produce it right now its going to produce it fast and you run it for short space of time on him and all of sudden why hes bright and smiling and quite sane and not worried about something now ive seen it do that and therefore the process has very firm grounding as far as im concerned and the only cases i have ever had trouble with the old process on were cases that just got the same answers over and over and over and never made breakthrough they never broke through into anything else they apparently just go on getting the same answers now thats the liability of the positive process of 1950 that on many cases it simply grinds down to finite number of answers and that is it now whats the matter why does it do that well youre not heading in the direction that that case heads youre heading toward positive arc and their moments of positive arc are so few as to be countable on the commands of one auditor see very brief period of time and they quickly run out of these things because youre in actual fact running if you want to know the truth of it pleasure moments of some kind or another and they wont flatten so you just run the same ones over and over and over so you have to run the reverse side of it ive paid attention to this process and have revived it and done things with it and fooled about with it from time to time and now and then youll see records of it as it goes along over the years but about 1958 we ran into period there when i was suddenly colliding with some implants and didnt know quite what to do about it were running great deal of reach and withdraw type of thing and so forth and raising iq of people rather easily and so forth allyou want to raise somebodys iq you know theres standard process for it just as little interjection here just say what could you withhold thank you what could you withhold what could you withhold what could you withhold what could you withhold what could you withhold what could you withhold what could you withhold what could you withhold give them another iq test and their iq will have gone up about twenty five fifty points they wont be any better but their iq will be higher quite interesting thats funny phenomenon for you also plunge them into an engram run it halfway through and give them another iq test and theyll be smarter that works im not kidding you thatit works why well apparently it has something to do with mass and people who think only on the mass which they have to think with see can get mechanical responses required in iq tests you understand i said it was an iq test that you were trying to raise youre not trying to make him any smarter see and they always get better iq test its its quite interesting now the upsets that you run into however on case are not the cases pleasure moments you run up in the upsets on case of times when they were knocked away from being part of things the separateness or individuation or were forced to be part of things they wanted nothing to do with in other words you had power of choice or of connect and disconnect and that power of choice is overthrown and when that power of choice is overthrown you get what you call an arc break he was there but didnt want to be there he wanted to be there but couldnt be there now those are causes of arc breaks in their most fundamental form it actually is an overwhelm of the persons power of choice pc wantsyou can get an arc break pc wants to go earlier on the track and you send him later on the track well that in itself causes an arc break regardless of any charge or mechanics or anything else youve overwhelmed his power of choice so you have an arc break this is the most fundamental of arc breaks and i wondered in 1958 whether or not you couldnt just run straightwire on quote arc breaks well the scientologist knows what an arc break is he sort of feels it in his bones doesnt have to have it designed or described to him any other way than that and you just ask the question recall an arc break recall an arc break recall an arc break recall an arc break now if you were to move on down the line with that process on anybody that could run it you would find him sittingand i did on my experiments at that timefind him sitting square in the middle of implants so an implant was the biggest arc break he was being held in place where he didnt want to be being told things and you see that he didnt want to hear so this overthrew his power of choice and for numerous other reasons it went against his grain but this was the most fundamental overthrow of the power of choice and this 1958 processrecall an arc break is the exact processdoes some rather interesting things so when we got into the helatrobus implants here recently i did hasty review of all arc processes andit wasnt very hasty i fooled around with it for couple of weeks looking over this material and so forthand finally exhumed the original version reversed and worked it out mechanically and mathematically to fit up to the exact situation of what i knew about these things and i got quite bit of information about these things which isnt only confined to that which works dont you see i know lots of things that dont work and thats very valuable too so i knew these had always worked so i decided to throw together these processes in some sort of form where they would clip directly into and saw out ofsaw out pieces of an implant we needed process which was senior to any other process we were doing which was repetitive process that was our demand we also needed process to cut through those cases which were at the lower levels of the reality scale and therefore couldnt be directly run on ris and things of this particular character what are you going to do just abandon these people what are you going to do with somebody who is terribly misrun and mishandled and i made an interesting discovery at this time that the big mid ruds or the 18button prepcheck but mainly the big mid ruds run on an engram mushed it it turned it into so much porridge messed it up it tended to spoil the record not eradicate it thats interesting isnt it an engram frays around the edges and starts turning into pure energy and that sort of thing but without returning to the pc as far as i could tellalthough i could revise my opinion of thiswithout returning to the pc any memory of what did happen quite interesting in other words this demonstrated that if you were going to use to great extent big mid ruds and big prepchecks onbig lists of buttons on pcs who are stuck in engrams you werent going to unstick him out of engrams youre going to brighten them up and polish it off and straighten up sessions and doing lot but this tool is light tool its light tool its theits the kids sand shovel see and what we had to have there was that great big caterpillar tractortread steam shovel and it had to be powerful enough so that it wouldnt buck just because you shoved it into rocky ledge that thing had to go on through well the most there to go through is an implant and the only thing i knew that would cut through implants is the arc type process and so i reevolved these processes and we came up with the negative arc processes thats what these really are and they call for moments when there wasnt any or there was minimal affinity reality and communication then i made further discovery about these things and i found out that pc was operating on entanglements with the physical universe and all that and considerations and postulates and all that sort of thing and it was one thing to bail him out of his intricate entanglements with matter energy space and time and considerations but that there was something else operating which was his consideration of his entanglement see and that was the other factor well ill give you some reality on that we walk out here and we find porter and this porters working in this windy miserable dustridden sootdrenched station see oh my god i mean its mess you see and gusts of london breeze are blowing through the places and throwing the coal dust into everybodys eyes and the tips are very poor and the stationmaster is bum thats always coming down on the porters and you know its allits all very bad and we find this bird there and hes happily picking up peoples valises and throwing them on trains and walking around and he doesnt seem to have much of care in the world about it and then we turn around and we find another guy right alongside of him and my god anybody asks him to pick up one corner of trunk hwaa majesty has been insulted if you gave him tenpound tip he still would have been undertipped you see he is what you might characterize as unhappy with where he is well here are two fellows in the same environment same pay same situation same everything dont you see and they have two different attitudes about what theyre doing all right we go over to the ritz biltmore and we find two bellboys and actually labor relations in that place are so smooth they have been taken care of by the union delegates so well and so forth that even theeven the assistant night clerk who is the most important man in the place as everybody knows has to say sir to the bellhops you see the tips my godnobody walks into this place you see without dropping fiver in somebodys paw you see and its nothing nothing there they get all the chow they want they get everything they want they have beautiful uniforms girls whistle at them everything is fine you see you get two blokes there and one of these fellows why hes just happy as clam to be there and the other fellow every time you hand him fivepound note he goes back of pillar or something like that and practically spits his teeth out with rage well you know that these conditions exist and you know that peopleyou may haveyou may believe at first glance that if the surroundings are bad the people are unhappy and if the surroundings are good people are happy theres many people get caught in this and the most people who get caught in it are by the way youryour sociologists they have never apparently learned this the united statesthe united states is having an awful happy time right now pouring billions into foreign aid so these dirty filthy flyridden grass huts in baloogaugaugastan can all be torn down and they can put in nice sevenbedroom ranch houses with hot and cold running politicians throughout and theyre just having ball and nobody is more surprised or will be more surprised than the united states government at the end of period of time to find out that the exact proportion of hate the united states government and love the united states government exists as before they might even have gone over toward hate it before to the degree that they actually enforced people to live in these sevenbedroom ranch houses see because you talk to boy in bloogaugaugaugastan and hes liable to tell you something on this order ah nice house yeah nice house yeah reeds reeds nice reeds side of river nice reeds wife there to raise some yams and so forth and nice reeds very thin walls so you say what do you mean very thin walls hes kept crooning over this idea of these thin reeds you know and youit doesnt sound like this guys very smart and he looks at you like youre crazy and he says well of course very thin reeds yeah but what about these reeds oh man he says you can go out that wall that wall or that wall thats his idea of house now that factor that wild weird factor that keeps rattling around all over the place gets into the machinery and cogwheels of more social planning and messes up more great schemes and so forth than any other single factor in fact it is the only factor that does mess up these things and thats just power of choice now you could call it preference or you could call it this or call it that but it just happens to be the fellows attitude toward where he is and whats happening its his preference i use the word attitude carelessly there its either all right or it isnt all right and to that degree its whether he understands it or doesnt understand it dont you see itsalso could go under the heading of whether he wants it or doesnt want it and so forth but in actual fact all of these factors however you express it are incomplete statements until you express it completely as affinity reality and communication now thats complete statement of this and the pc has had all those things present with regard to all these circumstances all up and down the track and thats an adequate statement of power of choice and its not packaged statement that can be stated in one brief word that has to be stated in terms of affinity reality and communication and if you try to overstate it on one of those corners of the triangle youre going to mess up the other two corners and youre going to overthrow power of choice dont you see its quite interesting it brings up this is there such thing as an ideal state i dont mean an ideal nation i mean an ideal condition of beingness is there such thing as an ideal state well i was quite amazed i was quite amazed in looking over the whole track to find out that there was some awful unhappy big thetans on the backtrack they were bored they didnt have anything to do that sort of thing youd say well that fellow was in an ideal state he wasnt in an ideal state and neither was anybody else and the faintest possibility of anybody ever achieving an ideal state exists in scientology and has never before existed in this universe thats an interestingly broad and fantastically exclamatory statement but yet is true what will we mean by an ideal state state somebody wanted to be in over which he had full power of choice see that would be an ideal state well of course unless an individuals power of choice is adjustable and his control of his environment is considerable he could therefore never reach it wouldnt matter what his fundamental basic condition was if this other condition was out why itd be terrible so its all right to erase the thetans whole time track so he can live in palace and so forth but if you leave untouched the idea that his ideal state is to exist as some sort of being who can just wreck the works you know this is his ideal state he must be in some kind of condition where he can wreck the works at any given moment whyno matter how youve adjusted his mest you havent touched on this one factor and he will be unhappy so the attainment of happiness for pc is parallel road to attaining clear i know that sounds very very odd but if you recognize that we have two factors at work here all will become very plain to you about lot of things in life its the environment and situation and conditions of the individual as they exist the for real conditions of the individual thats one channel thats one channel and nobody can get away from that channel that is the channel only trouble is your sociologist and other people trying to adjust that channel do not achieve at the same time any alteration in this other channel and this other channel has remained unknown in this universe it has merely been growled about suspected and reviled and chewed at but nobody has ever been able to do anything with it because nobodys ever really made fundamental statement concerning it and that is quite new to this universe although you could state all these things and everybody knows them it happens that its not simple statement it happens to be complex statement its his affinity reality and his communication with regard to the matter energy space time and postulates of his conditions now you say well isnt this arc arent these things borne out of his postulates not necessarily these are borne out of an interplay between his postulates and the experiences netted were still on an interactive basis between postulates you see and conditions and experiences we still have this other thing this other nebulous thing this power of choice only if you say power of choice of course that makes dictator very right he says well i know what right is its what i say is right see this is the total logic back of the napoleons and hitlers of history he knows what right is he knows whats wrong see he didnt say it so its wrong elementary my dear watson and so this whole subject has become perverted in actual fact its the persons affinity reality and communication with regard to set of circumstances existences or environments so youve got this second channel youre walking up all the time and its not been hidden from us as scientologists but we frankly dont pay quite enough attention to it in processing but we needed some big beefy process to match upand you remember your reality programing your programing matters also depended on the auditor didnt it there was one of those scales had the auditor as one of the factors in programing case well we needed process that somebody could just sit there and grind out they could just do it by the hour and something fantastic would happen with the case now it unfortunately is not an endall its not an endall it wont go the whole line it wont go the whole route well why because its not actually directly handling the conditions of the pc its handling the pcs attitudes toward those conditions or hishispardon his attitudes realities and communication powers with regard to those conditions is what its handling but it handles them enough so that it can cut away these lower levels of caseat levels 4 of some use levels 5 very usefulthats the dubin dubin of dubinvaluable and evaluation starting to get bit questionable but still of some use and unconscious of use at all person who is totally unaware has use for them at all but he will have as soon as you bring him up to where he can consult his own evaluations see then theresthat minimal use sets in and he can be moved on up pretty weird that case can be booted up by shifting that but youre going to run into point of return on almost any case sooner or later if you dont eventuallyi mean you wont get him to ot because this is not powerful enough to kick up through the last two strata it only kicks it through the lower strata you could put up case with this and some other little touches and polishingsup and so forth you can put case up to point where hes got his time track and is running it and you cant then use the process to finish off the whole case on up to ot because theres always that upper strata and now we arent so much worried about power of choice because the fellow believes now that his power of choice is alterable and that he can do something about it and about his conditions youve got to put him into handling the actual stuff which has aberrated him sooner or later hes got to handle this stuff see but right up to that point you can put him into situation where he can get close enough to it to handle it dont you see and thats the use of this particular process now just because i said its process can be ground out endlessly dont get the idea that its processdont go overboard and decide that it requires skill to use it because you will be any one of you will be setting up some auditor to run this regardless of your own auditing of it and setting up one or more auditors under you to run this youre going to discover to your horror that they can dream up more wrong ways to do this than you could easily count up in single morning they can dream up more questions that dont mean anything and youll have hard time catching up with it so there is right way to do it fortunately that right way is easily stated now i told you about the arc triangle has to be kept in balance well thats about the first error they will make ive already covered that preclears having an awful time with the communication leg therefore you should run it three sessions and run the other two two sessions you see ow youve got to keep these legs in balance next thing youre going to learn is although cases at level 3 on that programing scale are quite capable of running three questions bopbopbop bopbopbop bopbopbop see question one question two question three you know three questions three types of question although theyre quite capable of doing that you actually produce more tone arm action if you do them one at time one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one to place where we can change and then two two two two two two two two two two to place where we can change then three three three three to place where we can change now thats happy thing because it only runs that way on the lower cases so there is reason to preserve the onetwothree onetwothree onetwothree sequence at all there is reason to run it that way at all it can be run that way but theres reason to run it that way because the case that could run it that wayfirst place he doesnt need the processruns better if you run it one one one one one two two two two two three three three three three see he runs better if you run it that way so the better way to run it is always one leg at time until it is flat whats flat already covered it how long well let give you some kind of an idea of the mistakes you could use by laying down an arbitrary we say well one hour for each leg thats fine divide it up by time by all means because thats the easiest way to divide it up the easiest way to take it off an auditors report but youve gotyouve got something standing in your road the pc takes half an hour per answer on leg one and answers rapidly on the other two legs all right so somebody asks you for an adjudication well run it equal numbers of questions run each one seventyfive questions that seems like pretty good idea mark my words somebodys going to defeat you on that one too theyll find some way to defeat you on that particular thing im an old hand at this they will get the pc up to four just before the blowdown and leave the process inevitably something like that you see the pcs just drawing breath just gets misty look in his eye oh hes about to cognite and thats the seventyfifth question dont you see so you go back to one on the next one im afraid that you will develop far greater cynicism on this subject than i have its better to understand what you are trying to achieve youre trying to achieve similar amount of run for each one of these legs and not favor the one that is hardest but handle it by getting the other two now i noticed on an auditors report just short time ago that somebody had made mistake on this coaudit folders that are just done just few minutes ago somebody had found out that reality was not producing much tone arm action and so had run very short period of reality very very short period of reality compared to the next period of communication which was producing tone arm action and then gave it practically the rest of the session now that defeats the purpose of it and youll find the pc is going to get wildly out of balance how often do you change the process well thats how often there is answer dont you see how often do you shift process its the same answer how long does it take to flatten the process on each leg this is one you play by ear man it changes from pc to pc this pcthis pc grinds away just splendidly as long as you dont leave them more than about fifteen minutes on each leg that pc just does fine and this other one real grindtype case just doesnt do well that way at all theyre just beginning to find out what process it is at the end of fifteen minutes so again this idea of cognition monitored against an equivalency of time you see now hes having lots of cognitions but you know that youre going to run this on this particular pc you know youre going to try to get through all three questions in the one session that is your hope see so when youre coming up toward the end of the period youve allocated for that first one to be finished off your ear just comes up like rabbits you see listening for that communication that is cognition pc says well i think im getting pretty well along with oh you are well thank you very much that was the last command of the process it was jushuh huh huh thats cutting it awfully thin isnt it but youll find out your pc will be happy there now an arbitrary run exactly against the stopwatch will not find your pc happy the pc does live does think is living breathing being all right how many variations are there to the process well ive given you clearing the command of the process but you would just be fascinated at how many variations there could be of this process the best stunt is to get the person to run the most fundamental that you can get them to run always try to get them to run the most fundamental statement of the question you can get them to run that they will run dont go out on the order of get the fanciest variation in the question that they can run try to get the simplest thing try to argue them through attitude seems to communicate all right on the subject of affinity see affinity doesnt communicate attitude seems to see thats fine so you got attitude and they seem to respond all right to rejected so thats what attitude has been rejected thats good fundamental statement now when or what havent you really eared to love somebody thats about as fancy as you could get see well if you had to choose between those two you would take what attitude has been rejected see and that would bring you through because the less you change the auditing command the happier your pc is going to be and thats another rule because when you change the auditing command too much you run into the old rule of too many processes each one is slightly different process therefore you never really get chance to flatten any of the processes so constant shifts of this process are very poor so try to settle it down for the long run try to settle it down for the long run very early and if you find the pc is makingis having difficulty trying to wrap his or her wits around one of the legs as question if youre going to change it change it early change it soon and then keep it you want this one set up for the long haul so therefore get it changed early if youre going to change it at all preferably in the first session that its run dont let it drift for four sessions and then change it its better to run wrong question pretty near that has been run for long time than to change it then dont you see pc eventually will get so he can live with it now theresthere are some of the rules of guidance on this process and whats the next one the keynote of it is muzzled it is always muzzled process someone shouldnt be feeling that he is being treated as an amateur because he is told to run it muzzled its almost the same statement asrun the arc break process and run the process muzzled are practically synonymous statements because you dont run it any other way there is nothing to pick up there is nothing to straighten out there is nothing to do anything with or about once youve got it in the run the auditors sole concern is understanding and acknowledging what the pc has said sole concern the pc comes up with and says you know ive got an incident here thats 8765 trillion billion squillion years ago and im lying here and so forth and so on well the answer to that is okay now the only variation comes on this is the pc going to blow his brains out when he asks you or requests you to please date it find out where he is now theres where the question takes place do you refuse to date it and arc break the pc or date it and arc break the pc by eventually messing up his arc process see well thats the little questions that you the auditor have to live with there are so many of these questionstheres so many of these questions that to attempt to give you solution to every existing condition which exists at that order of magnitude in the session is not only impossible but itd be idiotable now your situation then with this process is that it is muzzled process it is definitely muzzled process but sometimes if you dont talk with the pc pc will arc break but you start offering the pc any auditor code break type evaluations and invalidations and that sort of thing and youll wish to god you never had the pc comes up with still picture this is one of the traps some auditorsstill picture pssww the devil with the routine see we dont care what routine were running pc says ive got picture here and its still the auditorbang hes right in there man he cant stay out of it for some reason or other it acts just like pole trap to him i actually have seen some auditortried and tried to break them of this habit because of course you cant audit still picture death and dynamite to touch one of the things but for some reason or other they would pc comes up and hes just answered this and by god he says you know for the last half hour ive had this picture and its just wide plain and theres nothing happening at all well of course your basic impulse is to help him out blow your brains out man if you open your yeep and bust the routine then because youre asking to plow him straight into the track on light process you see youre not running engrams and this process if you really restimulated an engram you know by handling it and then fell off back to this process again youve had it because this process wont handle the engram thats been otherwise handled see so you say just to be agreeable oh wide still plain now all right okay yeah okay all right now heres the next question but if the process didnt do something to move him on the track id start to get suspicious as to what he was doing with the process i wouldnt wrack him around id bring him up to some halting point and then as though its the most natural thing in the world i would put in the big mid ruds on the arc process its very interesting that we can rehabilitate process with the big mid ruds we could actually prepcheck this process and get some interesting ways now this process does not mush an engram itll actually push an engram around itll open it up it wont run it but itll shotgun engrams it hits one part of chain and another part of chain and another part of chain and starts taking selective chunks out of various portions of the engram chain this doesnt do any harm because its only picking up those pieces of it that belong to other chains anyhow perfectly all right nothing disastrous can happen with this process providing you dont think yourself too much now if you tried to run this process as cyclic process until the pc is on present timein present time on every leg you have set yourself up problem that i dont think anybody could ever solve anyhow and whats this passion for getting the pc in present time he hasnt been in present time for trillennia probably the best way to handle this sort of situationyouve been chewing away at it and youve run him this and run him that and he wasnt in pt on this leg and he wasnt in pt on that leg and he doesnt get into pt on another leg and the three legs are parked at different portions of the track this sounds very complicated but it isnt going to hurt him any and you decide that the best thing you could possibly do is get him to present time and make him little more comfortable why you get him to present time but how do you do that you just tell him to move to the date of the session month date and year or move to june 12th 1963 thank you you dont say are you there did you move did the somatic strip work well what do you know i didnt think it would thats not done thats the best way to say come to present time these days by the way you can move him to present time at the end of the session it doesnt matter now the next time you pick it up youre going to find him parked exactly where you left him on each leg anyhow so who cares theoretically he would only get to present time on this process when the process was flat well when is this process flat when its flat actually now your meter means something the process is flat when all rudiments being in on the process the process run produces tone arm departure from the clear read of the pc thats how flat thats on any leg that process is flat tone arm departuremid ruds being in on the process the tone arm does not depart from clear read on any one of its legs now when i said does not depart i meant does not depart it doesnt go to 35 to 30 thats all over now the one other thing that you probably have to know about thisthat is actually as far as you can state when is the process flat and when is theshould the pc be in present time well the pc should have the process flat and be in present time at that point you actually are not really trying to achieve this by running the arc process youre trying to get some part of this achieved youre trying to get the best part of it achieved that you can youre trying to do the most you can with the arc process in the time of auditing which you have and all thatsthatsyouve gone as far as you could go but remember that because the tone arm isnt operating early in running the process is signal that the process is flat because tone arm action on pc particularly who cant be run on any other process and particularly pc who has to be carefully grooved in and theyre very particular about this meaning and that meaning oh watch it man because that pcs going to start in maybe the pcs chronic tone arm position might be 30 see and you grind away on leg one and that takes you well i dont know half session to get it anyplace still sitting there at 30 your next leg still sitting here at 30 your next leg moves to 30 you can see sometimes auditors in desperation start to decimalize tone arm reads you see out to the third or fourth place you know 3147 you know it looks good you know 3147 and then it moved back then you go another couple of sessions on the thing and youll find its going to 35 and back few sessions later this pc will be winding the thing all the way around the dial now the greatest tone arm action ive seen is produced by engram running on case that can run engrams thats the greatest tone arm action but dont think this arc process wont produce tone arm action but that action has to be run in to the process and then out of it on cases that really have to have it oh its sticky you know it runs up here at 425 all you have to do is get to reality and it goes to 425 or get to communication it goes tothe other two are running flat see action to amount to anything the second you get to this one of the legs maybe its affinity you see it will be one of the legs all of sudden bzzzzzz and there it stays for that third of session youre going to run this see there it goes there it is and it varies around it it goes from 428 to 4193 thats the variation of it see and the second you get back on in the next leg boump itll be running from 278 to 279 youll watch them and that will be one of the phenomena one of the manifestations youll see on your auditors report and one leg is making it going up and stick it well then second leg all of sudden will start sticking it then thatstarts to look like this case is getting in lots of trouble this is the time an auditor who doesnthasnt been through the jumps on this starts sweating one made it go up and stick one leg you see now two of the legs make it go up and stick i hope the third one wont take off see and you realize unless youve got all three of them up and stuck it doesnt free to an arc and all of sudden the third one goes up and sticks and the one that was up originally goes to 6 well your main questions are is the pc answering the auditing command thats your mainyour main worry now does he understand the auditing command and that has to all be done very early on and after that can we keep it smoothly enough balanced up that we can get him plowed through and bring him out the other end now all of those questions are in that order of importance is he answering the auditing command now it doesnt do to hound the pc too much but you can add rudiment that takes care of this its the old rudiment but specialize it has any command been not answered you see in this session have you failed to answer any question or command you know and you should think that is pretty goodpretty good thing to throw in there so you want to make sure that he stays clean on those answers because if he starts omitting answering auditing commands hell wreck the process and thats the only thing that can wreck the process he starts lying to you about having answered it and he starts hedging he starts squirming off on you and that sort of thing well theres something has gone wrong here that youll have to put right early and is frankly about all the trouble you have with the process and you see thats fairly rare but if you do have any real trouble with process the pc isnt answering the auditing command the other phenomena which show up are just meaningless theyre just the phenomena of processing if you dont expect change on the ta what you processing him for see ta will do all kinds of wild things you can take these low tone arm cases and this will crack low tone arm case up and itll also back the low tone arm case clear through 70 this process will do some remarkable things the process itself should be run however very nicely very neatly in good balance and so forth about the only other thing i can tell you about this arc process that might prove valuable to you is that it can be prefixed by any combination of words prefixed by anything you can say in marriage in auditing on your job some personyoure running in auditing and all of sudden you find out this persons been d of p and that sort of thing lot and they had lot to do with cases and so forth or an instructor and its not in auditing its on auditing your variation of your statement dont you see then brings this out to tremendous broad usages and it is much more powerful than problems intensive ever dreamed of being when used selectively that way now to do it that way you dont necessarily have to do an assessment but you could do an assessment of the various sections of persons life if you wanted to use this very finitely on sort of an assist basis whats he do he has job and he has this and he does that and so forth and we finally get it narrowed down to what really worries him we kind of do an analysis on the case you see and we say what really worries this bird is transportation really worries him see look at it fall here we tell himwe ask him whats youwhats your life consist of and he says oh driving to work and eating and well theres being married and theres my children and theresand well my job and theres this and theres that and we assess this long list see driving to work psssww well lets make statement of this driving to work that we can use and probably the statement that embraces it is on transportation something like that but that statement has to read see transportation has to read as well as driving to work or we dont use it see now we could cut into this thing and wed say on transportation and each question is preceded by that you can cut yourself right straight back right into the helatrobus implants or something like that this guys hair would be standing on end in time but youd get away with it theres the general permissive use of it is what you will have most use for the greatest uses of this thing will be in auditing and just the general question what now let call to your attention the fact that the helatrobus implants do contain words such as remember and therefore you do very well to avoid those in your auditing commands just like you wouldnt ask anybody have you ever absolutably gotten drunk see you just wouldnt use an auditing command that repeated this confounded word see because you know youll practically spin in the pc after while so you dont even bring anything thats close to that goal to remember which is present on every case which is recall or something now theres probably goals about think and so forth because ive run into tremendous numbers of pcs who didnt dare think think is the great antipathy over here in the uk on putting processes together you say think of or something you have to change it to get the idea of well its odd that youd change it so there must be some type of implant sitting around that has the word think in it otherwise pcs would be able to answer this auditing command so keep that type of word out of these arc breakstraightwire see just keep that type of word out you say recall something you have gone out of affinity with lets always make simpler statement out of it what have you gone out of affinity with see see omit those words that refer to the mind and think and so forth from your auditing commands and youll be away now this process as simple as it is in your hands actually delivers the rougher cases that you have been worrying about because theyre always very happy to run it they dont have to know anything they dont have to have any evaluations you dont have to do anything with the case the case will just sit there and run it theyll be quite happy to run it now with little children and that sort of thing youve really got to bend these questions around the corner theyve got to get awful simple in fact theyve got to get so simple that theyre liable to become meaningless you know you cant quite make them simple enough so the kid can get them and so forth but this all comes under the heading of clearing questions and you just remember that youve got to clear the question much more carefully with child if youre going to run this type of process and when you start case running on this sort of thing give him enough of run on it so he gets some benefit out of it and he will be very happy about it now there are those cases which cannot recall cannot remember cannot do this cannot do that to whom the track is totally blocked off recognize that you are dealing with 7 or 8 level case and what they need is reach and withdraw on the awarenessthe unaware case and on evaluation they undoubtedly will need some cchs because it just wont bite wont bite well theres just nothing there to bite see now you can use however the same principles of this on discussing whether they want to be here or not you get the idea discussing whether or not they like you or not discussing whether or not they wish to talk to you or not youre running present time version of it arent you so dont avoid the fact that you can make discussing twoway comm out of these processes right in present time without asking the case to recall at all and that might prove to you valuable weapon at one time or another you can talk about present time and youre not asking the person to remember or to think or to go backtrack and they very often will gradually and gracefully curve into being able to go backtrack see case has tremendous value for altering case state state of case alters very rapidly with this all right well i didnt want to beat the process to death but i did want to give you good review of the process because you will be using it and because its very valuable process therell be bulletins out on this subject but i doubt they will contain much more than what ive given you in this lecture thank you very much
