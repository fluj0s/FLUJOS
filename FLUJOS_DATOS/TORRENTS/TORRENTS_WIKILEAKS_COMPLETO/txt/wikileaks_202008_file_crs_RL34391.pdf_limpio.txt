polar icebreakers can operate in the extreme conditions of and break through the thick ice found in the arctic ocean nd the waters surrounding antarctica of the coast guards three polar icebreakers two polar star and polar sea have exceeded their intended 30year service lives the polar star is not operational and has been caretaker status since july 1 20061 the coast guards third polar icebreaker healy is much younger and in operational c ondition but has less icebreaking capability than the other two ships 2007 report from the national resear ch council nrc on the us polar icebreaking fleet states that over the last decade some routine maintenance on polar star and polar sea has been deferre d due to lack of funds and major life extension program has been planned as consequence us polar icebreaking capability is now at risk of being unable to support national intere sts in the north and the south2 on july 16 2008 admiral thad allen the commandant of the coast guard testified that today our nation is at crossroads with coast guard domestic and international icebreaking capabilities we have important decisions to make and i believe we must address our icebreaking needs now to ensure we will continue to prosper in the years and decades to come whether on the great lakes the critical waterways of the east coast or the rsh operating environments of

in an annual mission to break through the antarctic ice so as to resupply mcmurdo station th large us antarctic research station located on the shore of mucmur do sound near the ross ice shelf although polar ice is melting due to clima change observers generally expect that this development will not eliminate the need for us polar icebreakers and in some respects might increase mission demands for them even with the melting of polar ice there are still significant icecovered areas in the polar regions melting of polar ice could lead in coming years to increased commercial ship cruise ship and naval surface ship operations as well as increased exploration for oil and other resources in and through the polar regions activities that could require increased levels of support from polar icebreakers changing ice conditions in antarctic waters have made the mcmurdo resupply mission more challenging since 20008httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34391crs5 9 the designation wagb means

intended 30year service life the ship currently is not in operational condition due to worn out electric motors and ot her problems the coast guard placed the ship in caretaker st atus on july 1 2006 it is tied up at pier in seattle11 under caretaker status the coast guard is retaining the ship as non operational asset with potential for being reactivated the ship is assigned reduced crew of 34 that keeps the ship clean and painted and tests the ships machinery on periodic basis but the sh ip is not moved and the ships major mechanical problems are not being repaired keeping the ship in caretaker status the coast guard states costs about 3 million per year12 as discussed later in this report the ship would require millions of dollars of maintenance and repair work to be returned to

operations and maintenance since fy2006 costs for operating and ma intaining the coast guards polar icebreakers have been funded in the nsf s budget rather than the coast guards budget the transfer of polar icebreaker operation and maintena nce funding from the coast guards budget to the nsfs budget was requested by the administration as part of its fy2006 budget submission and appr oved by congress as part of its action on the fy2006 coast guard and nsf budgets th transfer was made in view of the fact that large portion of the coast guards polar icebreaking operations are conducted in support of nsf re search activities the fundi ng arrangement is covered by 2005 memorandum of agreement moa between the coast guard and nsf some observers have ques tioned whether it is appropr iate for the operation and maintenance of coast guard polar icebreak ers to be funded through the nsf budget the 2007 nrc report for example states that the arrangement has increased management difficulties by spreading management decisions related to the polar icebreakers across two agencies that t he nsf is now fiscally responsible and making decisions for missions outside its core mission and expertise and that the us coast guard has been put in situa tion in which it has the role of operating ship for which it does not have fu ll budget and management control16 the issue was discussed at the july 16 2008 hearing on coast guard icebreaker needs for additional discussion see appendix march 24 2008 press report stated the coast guard splits responsibility for its icebreakers with the national science foundation which under 2006 law pays to run and maintain the ships albeit with coast guard crews after they were designated as primarily for research purposes but starting next ye ar

conduct comprehensive study of the role of coast guard icebreakers in suppor ting united states operations in the antarctic and the arctic the study should include different scenarios for continuing those operations including service life extension or replacement of existing coast guard icebreakers and alternative methods that do not use coast guard icebreakers the study should so address changes in the roles and missions of coast guard icebreakers in s upport of future marine operations in the arctic that may develop due to envir onmental change including the amount and kind of icebreaking support that may be required in the future to support marine operations in the northern sea route and the northwest passage the suitability of the polar class icebreakers for these new roles and appropriate changes in existing laws governing coast guard iceb reaking operations and the potential for new operating regimes the study should be submitted to the committee later than september 30

makes the following conclusions and recommendations the study committee finds that both operations and maintenance of the polar icebreaker fleet have been underf unded for many years and the capabilities of the nations icebreaking fleet have diminished substantially deferred longterm maintenance and failure to execute plan for replacement or refurbishment of the nations icebreakin g ships have placed national interests in the polar regions at risk the nation needs the capability to operate in both polar regions reliably and at will specifically the committee recommends the following the united states should continue to project an active and influential presence in the arctic to support its interests this requires us government polar icebreaking capability to ensure yearround access throughout the region the united states should continue to project an active and influential presence in the antarctic to support its interests the nation should reliably control sufficient icebreaking capability to break channel into and ensure the maritime resupply of mcmurdo station the united states should maintain leadership in polar research this requires icebreaking capability to provid access to the deep arctic and the icecovered waters of the antarctic national interests in the polar regions require that the united states immediately program budget design nd construct two new polar icebreakers to be operated by the us coast guard to provide continuity of us icebreaking capabilities the polar sea should remain mission capable and the polar star should remain available for reactivation until the new polar icebreakers enter service the us coast guard should be provided sufficient operations and maintenance budget to support an increased regular and influential presence in the arctic other agencies should reimbur incremental cost s associated with directed mission tasking polar icebreakers are essential instruments of us national policy in the changing polar regions to ensure ade quate national icebreaking capability into the future presidential decision direc tive should be issued to clearly align agency responsibilities and budgetary authorities20 coast guard perspective the coast guard states it generally supports the nrc report and that the coast guard is working closely with interagency partners to determine way forward with national polar policy that identifies broad us interests and priorities in the arctic and antarctic that will ensure adequate maritime presence to further these interests identification and prioritization of us national interests in these regions shoul d drive development of associated uscg us coast guard capability and resource requirements the coast guard alsohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34391crs11 21 source coast

capability gaps in coast guard mission performance in the high latitudes regions22 march 24 2008 press report states coast guard commanders in alaska plan to conduct an unprecedented expedition to the

replacement ships the coast guard estimated in february 2008 that new replacement ships for the polar star and polar sea might cost between 800 million and 925 million per ship in 2008 dollars to procure the coast guard said that this estimatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34391crs12 25 the coast guard states further that the estim ate is based on the procurement cost of the mackinaw wagb30 great lakes icebreaker that was procured few years ago and commissioned into service with the coast gu ard in june 2006 the mackinaw is 240 feet long displaces 3500 tons and can break ice up to 2 feet 8 inches thick at speeds of 3 knots which is suitable for great lakes icebreaking the coast guard says it scaled up the procurement cost for the mackinaw in proporti on to its size compared to that of polar icebreaker and then adjusted the resulting figure to account for the abovedescribed capabilities of the notional replacement ship and r ecent construction costs at us gulf coast shipyards 26

estimate of th cost of section 917 of s 1892 the coast guard authorization act for fy2008 as re ported in the senate has estimated that the coast guard would spend about 14 billi on over the next five years to purchase two icebreakers26 25year service life extensions one alternative to procuring new replacement ships would be to extend the service lives of polar star and polar sea the coast guard stated in february 2008 th at performing the extensive maintenance repair and modernization work needed to extend the service lives of the two ships by 25 years might cost roughly 400 million per ship this figure the coast guard said is based on assessments made by independent cont ractors for the coast guard in 2004 the service life extension work the coast guard said would improve the two icebreakers installed systems in cer tain areas although the work would be intended to permit the ships to operate for another 25 years it would not return the cutters to new condition reactivate polar star for 7 to 10 years the coast guard estimated in february 2008 that it would cost 566 million to perform the maintenance and repair work needed to reactivate polar star and extend its service

an additional cost would be incurred to create and train full 134person crew for the ship us shipbuilding industrial base the status of the us shipbuilding indus trial base pa rticularly the part that builds military ships for the us government has been concern in congress and elsewhere since the early 1990s following the end of the cold war when the rate of navy shipbuilding declined substantially concern has focused on among other things whether the total amount of work be ing received by shipyards is sufficient to maintain their financial health and to preserve key design and construction skills 30 other things held equal c onstruction of one or more ne w polar icebreakers for the coast guard could increase workloads at the yard or yards involved in their construction for period of few

guard deepwater continuednumber and capabilities of future polar icebreakers one potential policy issue for congress c oncerns how many polar icebreakers with what capabilities the coast guard will need in the future specific questions within this issue include the following will the coast guard need two polar icebreakers the number it currently has in opera tional condition three polar icebreakers the number it currently has in invent ory or some higher number should new icebreakers be designed to cut through ice up to six feet thick like polar star and polar sea or less than six feet thick like healy and many foreign icebreakers or more than six feet thick like certain russian icebreakers31 should new icebreakers be designed with the scientific research capabilities less than greater than or about equal to those of healy in assessing this issue factors that congress may consider include but are not limited to the following current and projected mission demands for coast guard polar icebreakers including an assessment of how those demands might be affected in coming years by changing ice conditions and by future nsf decisions on how to acquire i cebreaking services to support its research activities the potential for various mission mands not just those conducted in support of nsf research activitie s to be met by noncoast guard icebreakers including leases or charters of icebreakers owned by foreign governments or private firms and the coast guards overall missions vsresources situation which includes the coast guards require ments to perform many nonpolar missions and the coast guards desire to fund programs such as the deepwater acquisition program for performing these nonpolar missions32httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34391crs15 32 continued program background oversight i ssues and options for congress by ronald orourke 33 the potential for using leased ships and the possible limitations of this option are discussed at several points in the 2007 nrc repor t the report argues among other things that the availability of icebreakers for lease in coming years is open to question that leased ships are not optimal for performing sovereignt yrelated operations and that some foreign icebreakers might be capable of performing the mcmurdo resupply missi on see for example pages 8081 of the nrc reportregarding the first factor above the ns f states that although coast guard polar icebreakers are very capable the nsf is mandated by presidential directive to perform its research activities in the most costeffective way possible and that it can be more expensive for nsf to support its research activities with coast guard polar icebreakers than with charters of iceb reakers crewed by contractor personnel although coast guard polar icebreakers in the past have performed the annual mcmurdo breakin mission the nsf in r ecent years has chartered russian and swedish contractoroperated icebreakers to perform the mission with coast guard polar icebreaker standing ready to assist if needed the nsf has also noted that healy though very capable in supporting ar ctic research opera tes at sea for about 200 days year as opposed to about 300 days year for foreign contractoroperated polar icebreakers for additiona l discussion of the issue see appendix b regarding the cond factor above issues to consider would include among other things the potential availability of ships for lease leasing costs regulatory issues relating to longterm leases of capital assets for the us government and the ability of leased ships to perform the ssions in question including the mission of defending us sovereignty in arctic waters north of alaska the challenging mcmurdo resupply mission or missions th at emerge suddenly in response to unexpected events33 advocates of coast guard polar icebreaker fleet that included two ships that is healy and one other ship might argue that the coast guard has been able to operate with such force since the polar star went into caretaker status on july 1 2006 and that force with healy and one ot her ship would cost less than larger icebreaker fleet and thereby permit the coast guard to better fund programs for performing its various nonpolar missions advocates of coast guard fleet that included three ships healy and two other icebreakers might argue that the current force of healy and one other operational ship has made it more difficult for the coast guard to perform the mcmurdo resupply mission using its own assets that force that included healy and two other ships would provide the coast guard with more flexibility for responding to contingencies or dealing with mechanical problems on one of the icebreakers and that it would still be sufficiently affordable to permit the coast guard to adequately fund programs for performing nonpolar missions advocates of coast guard fleet that included healy and three or more other icebreakers might argue that such fleet would provide additional capability for responding to potentially increased commerc ial and military activitie s in the arctichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34391crs16 and more strongly signal us commitment to defending its sovereignty and other interests in the region they might argu that although this option would be more expensive than smaller fleet the added inve stment would be justified in light of the growing focus on us polar interests the 2007 nrc report provided one perspective on the issue of required numbers and capabilities for us polar icebreakers stating based on the current and future needs for icebreaking capabilities the study committee concludes that the nation continues to require polar icebreaking fleet that includes minimu m of three multimission ships like the coast guards three current polar icebr eakers and one singlemission research ship like palmer the committee finds that although the demand for icebreaking capability is predicted to in crease fleet of three multimission and one singlemission icebreakers can meet the nations future polar icebreaking needs through the application of the late st technology creative crewing models wise management of ice conditions and mo re efficient use of the icebreaker fleet and other assets the nation should imme diately begin to program design and construct two new polar icebreakers to replace the polar star and polar sea building only one new polar icebreaker is insufficient for several reasons first single ship cannot be in more than one location at time matter how technologically advanced or efficiently operated single polar icebreaker can operate in the polar regions for only tion of any year an icebreaker requires regular maintenance and technical support from shipyards and industrial facilities must reprovision regularly nd has to effect periodic crew changeouts single icebreaker theref ore could not meet any reasonable standard of active and influential presence and reliable atwill access throughout the polar regions second consideration is the potential risk of failure in the harsh conditions of polar operations despite th eir intrinsic robustness damage and system failure are always risk and th us fleet must have enough depth to provide backup assistance having only single icebreaker would necessarily require the ship to accept more conservative operating profile avoiding more challenging ice conditions because reliable assistance would not be available second capable icebreaker either opera ting elsewhere or in homeport would provide ensured backup assistance and allow for more robust operations by the other ship from strategic longerterm perspective two new polar class icebreakers will far better position the nation for the increasing challenges emerging in both polar regions second new ship would allow the us coast guard to reestablish an active patrol presence in us waters north of alaska to meet statutory responsibilities that will inevitably derive from increased human activity economic development and environmental change it would allow response to emergencies such as searchandrescue cases pollution incidents and assistance to ships threatened with grounding or damage by ice moreover second new ship will leverage the possibilities for simultaneous operations in widely disparate geographic areas eg c oncurrent operations in the arctic and antarctic provide more flexibility for conducting antarctic logistics as either the primary or the secondary ship for the mcmurdo breakin allow safer multipleship operations in the most demanding ice conditions and increase opportunities for international expeditions finally an upfront decision to buildhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34391crs17 34 national research council polar icebreakers in c hanging world an assessment of us needs washington 2007 p 2two new polar icebreakers will allow economies in the design and construction process and provide predictable cost reduction for the second ship34 the position expressed in the nrc report which is consistent with the reports recommendations is one perspective on this issue other persp ectives are possible as mentioned earlier the coast guard while generally agreeing with the nrc report is currently studying requirements for future polar icebreakers it is possible that the coast guards eventual position on required numbers and capabilities of coast guard polar icebreakers will differ in some respects from those of the nrc report it is also possible that third parties might come to positions that differ from those of both the nrc report and the coast guard new construction vs modernization second potential policy issue for cong ress is whether requirements for polar icebreakers over the next 25 to 30 years should be met by building new ships by extending the service lives of the polar star and polar sea or by pursuing some combination of these options in assessing this question factors to consider include the relative costs of these options the cap abilities that each option would provide the longterm supportability of older ships whos service lives have been extended and industrialbase impacts regarding relative costs as discussed in the background section the coast guard estimates that new icebreakers with 30year design life might cost 800 million to 925 million per ship while 25year service life extension of polar star and polar sea might cost about 400 million per ship these estimates however should be compared with caution as disc ussed earlier the estimate for building new ships depends in part on the capabilities that were assumed for those ships while the estimate for the servicelifeextension op tion dates to 2004 and might consequently need to be reassessed estimates for servicelife extension work moreover can be very uncertain due to the potential for discovering new things about ships condition once the ship is opened up for repair work regarding capabilities provided by each option the newconstruction option would provide entirely new ships with exte nsive use of new technology while the servicelifeextension option would provide ships that although modernized and reconditioned would not be entirely new nd would likely make less extensive use of new technologies among other things newconstruction ship s might be able to make more extensive use of new technolog ies for reducing crew size which is significant factor in ships life cycle operating and support costs regarding longterm supportability of older ships the coast guard has expressed concern about the ability to s upport ships whose service lives have beenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34391crs18 35 source crs discussion with coas t guard officials january 30 2008extended after fy2014 because some contract s that currently provide that support are scheduled to end that year35 regarding potential impact on the industrial base 25year service life extensions would likely provide shipyards and supplier firms with less work and also exercise smaller set of shipyard construction skills than would building new ships acceleration of current schedule third potential policy option for congress if it is determined that one or more new ships should be built is whether to accelerate the coast guards current schedule for building those ships one option for accelerating the schedule would be to shorten the current phase for study ing the requirements for the new ships and move directly to procurement of the fi rst new ship another acceleration option if the coast guard contemplates procuring two or more replacement ships would be to fund second ship and any subsequent ships sooner than the coast guard might propose both of these options could be combined in the case of twoship procurement for example one highly accelerated profile would be to procure both ships as part of the fy2009 budget rather than the first ship in year after fy2009 and the second ship one or more years after that advocates of accelerated procurement might argue the following it could reduce the total cost over the next several years of operating the polar sea and maintaining the polar star in caretaker status by reducing the number of years that those costs would be incurred before the replacement ships enter service accelerating procurement of at least the first replacement ship to fy2009 would ensure that at leas t one replacement ship would be funded prior to the approaching change in administration an event advocates might argue that could lead to delays in acquisition programs for which major procur ement funding has not yet been provided shortening the period for studying requirements for new icebreakers would be acceptable because these requirements are already well underst ood due to extensive past operational experience an understanding of current mission demands and studies on current and potential future demands such as the 2007 nrc report any remaining uncertainties about required capabilities such as perhaps the extent of the new ships scientific research facilities could be addressed in an accelerated program by reserving space and weight in the design for accommodating such facilitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34391crs19 accelerating the procurement of th second ship and any subsequent ships could reduce the total proc urement cost of the ships by allowing contractors to achieve better economies of scale in terms of things like ordering material s manufacturing components and achieving optimal learningcurve benefits in moving from one ship to the next opponents of this option might argue the following the cost over the next several years for operating the polar sea and maintaining the polar star in caretaker status is relatively modest so shortening the period during which these costs are incurred by year or two will consequently produce only modest savings these modest savings are not worth the risk that shortened period for studying new requirements might overlook important issues or considerations that if left unaddressed could lead to the construction of new icebreakers th at are less operationally effective or costeffective than they could be the best way to ensure that the icebreaker modernization program is not delayed by the approaching change in administration is to show that the issue has been thoroughly studied and that the recommended course of ac tion is thus wellfounded although past operational experien ce an understanding of current mission demands and previous studi can inform an understanding of future mission requirements that understanding might not be complete particularly given ch anging conditions in the polar regions future nsf decisions on how to acquire icebreaking services to support its research ac tivities and the need to take the views of us government agencies other than the coast guard into account uncertainties about the ships required capabilities cannot be completely mitigated by reserv ing space and weight for certain features and reserving such space and weight might result in design that is larger and more expensive than needed accelerating the program is not necessary to achieve procurement profile that permits the ships to be constructed in an efficient and manner nuclear power fourth potential policy option for congress if it is determined that one or more new ships should be built is whethe r those ships should be nuclearpoweredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34391crs20 36 source national research council polar icebreakers in changing world an assessment of us needs washington 2007 p 59 table 64 these figures include nuclearpowered icebreaker named 50 let pobe dy that reportedly entered service in early 2007 and two conventionally powered russian icebreakers that at the time of the 2007 nrc study were leased to the netherlands 37 crs report rl33946 navy nuclearpowered surface ships background issues and options for congress by ronald orourkeas are 7 of russias 20 polar or baltic icebreakers36 some interest has been expressed in congress in using nuclear pow er on wider array of us navy surface ships in the future and section 1012 of the fy2008 defense authorization act hr 4986pl 110181 makes it us policy to build certain futu re classes of us navy surface combatants with nuclear power unless the secretary of defense submits notification to congress that using nuclear power for given new ship class is not in the national interest the issue of nuclear power for us navy surface ships is discussed in detail in another crs report37 advocates of building new coast guard polar icebreakers with nuclear power might argue the following nuclear power would provide th icebreakers with operational advantages in terms of virtually unlimited cruising endurance at any speed such endurance could permit the ships for example to make highspeed sprints from one polar region to the other so as to respond to sudden contingencies without needing to stop or slow down along the way to be refuel ed these operational advantages are one reason why russia has built some of its polar icebreakers with nuclear power if oil costs in the future remain relatively high and if the icebreakers consume significant total amounts of energy over their 30year lives to perform their missions then much or perhaps even all of the additional procurement cost of nuc lear power could be offset over the ships lives by avoided fossilfuel costs building icebreakers with nuclear power could improve economies of scale in the production of nuc lear propulsion components for us navy nuclearpowered ships reducin g the costs of those navy ships which would further offset from national standpoint the additional procurement cost of nuc lear power for the icebreakers due to the additional upfront costs and increased operational capabilities of building ship with nuclear power building us nuclearpowered icebreakers could send strong signal to russia or other countries of us commitment to defending its polar interests particularly in the arctic opponents of building new coast guard polar icebreakers with nuclear power might argue the followinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34391crs21 38 as discussed in crs report rl33946 th 2006 navy report concluded among other things that in constant fy2007 dollars bu ilding navy surface combatant or amphibious ship with nuclear power rather than conv entional power would add roughly 600 million to 800 million to its procurement cost nuclear power plant for polar icebreaker might be smaller and consequently cost somewhat less than the nuclear power plant in the navy surface combatant 39 for more on the nsf whose budget is normally funded through the annual commerce justice science and related agencies appropriations bill see crs report 95307 us continuedalthough nuclear power provides ope rational advantages in terms of unrefueled cruising endurance conventional pow er has proven sufficient for performing us polar icebreaker missions russias requirements for its icebreakers di ffer from us requirements for its icebreakers so russias decision to build some of its icebreakers with nuclear power does not necessarily imply that the united states should do the same based on data in 2006 navy re port to congress on nuclear power for navy surface ships building us icebreaker with nuclear power rather than conventi onal power might increase its procurement cost by veral hundred million dollars38 t h t additional cost might not loom very large for navy surface combatant that might cost 2 billion to 3 billion even when conventionally powered but it might increase by as much as two thirds the procurement cost of an icebreaker that might otherwise cost 800 million to 925 million to procure in situation of constrained budget resources such an increase in procurement cost could easily result in the procurement of one replacement icebreaker rather than two single icebreaker even one with nuclear power might not be enough to meet future us needs the coast guard has not operate d nuclearpowered ships and consequently does not ve maintenance or training infrastructure in place to support the operation of such ships the coast guard would need to either create this infrastructure which would require time and money or pay the navy to use its infrastructure the us can send sufficiently strong signal of its commitment to defending its polar interests by building new highly capable conventionally powered polar icebreakers funding ships in coast guard budget or elsewhere fifth potential policy option for congress if it is determined that one or more new icebreakers should be built is whether the acquisition cost of those ships should be

managing shipbuilding programs opponents might argue that funding new icebreakers in the scn account or the ndsf might put pressure on these other two accounts at time when the navy and dod are facing challenges funding their own shipbuilding and other priorities they might also argue that having the navy manage the coast guards icebreaker program would add complexity to the acquisition effort and

2009 budget nsf will longer provide funds to maintain th uscgc polar star in caretaker status because nsf does not envision current or future use of this vessel in support of its mission due to the changing environmental conditions and increased activity in the polar regions as well as the coast guards multimission responsibilities in the polar regions that are not science related the committee includes statutory language maki ng an additional 4000000 available to maintain the uscgc polar star in caretaker status the committee also notes that the forthcoming report on coast guard polar mission requirements will address the sustainability of the current operations and maintenance cost sharing arrangement between the coast guard nd the nsf to support both current and projected polar

climate models predicting an icefree arctic summer in the future more international expeditions will be headed to the region to examine newly revealed oil and gas reserves and other natural resources canada russia and other countries will begin to compete with the united states over jurisdiction and without strong polar icebreaker fleet our nation will suffer severe disadvantage recent 2007 report by the national academy of sciences found that the united states needs to maintain polar icebreaking capacity and construct at least two new polar icebreaker s this provision follows those recommendations page 29 in presenting the cbos estimate of the cost of section 917 of s 1892 as reported the report states assuming appropriation of the necessa ry amounts cbo estimates that the uscg would spend about 14 billion over the next five years to purchase two icebreakers costs to operate and maintain the two new vessels would total about 50 million year beginning in 2013 we estimate that an additional 50 million would be spent over the 20082010 period to recondition an existing uscg icebreaker which is currently out of operation operating and maintaining that vessel would cost about 10 m illion in 2010 and about 25 million annually thereafter this estimate is based on information provided by the coast guard regarding the cost of constructing ope rating and maintaining such vessels to agency specifications page 8 see also pages 6 and 7 fy2008 consolidated appropriations act hr 2764pl 110161 fy2008 funding for the department of homeland security dhs which includes the

conference report for the bill states the following in its discussion of division the fy2008 dhs appropriations act national interests in the polar regions the committees on appropriations ar concerned about coast guards ability to meet its polar operations mission requirements and provide the united states with the capability to support nationa l interests in the polar regions these mission requirements include but are not limited to global reach to the north and south poles monitoring of usbound vessel traffic transiting international waterways in the far north support of the international ice patrol and support of other governmental and scientific organizations in pursuit of marine and atmospheric science activities in the polar regions the committees on appropriations are specifically concer ned whether coast guards aging polar icebreaking fleet can meet current ssion performance goals and whether this fleet and the services small cadre of specialized polar operations personnel are capable of meeting projected mission performance goals in light of changing environmental conditions and increased activity in the polar regions the national academy of sciences made several recommendations in this regard inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34391crs29 september 2006 but the administration s taken action to implement those recommendations therefore the commandant is directed to submit comprehensive polar operations report that fully assesses the co ast guards ability to meet current and projected polar mission requirements and includes an evaluation of how coast guards current capabilities and resources must be adapted or enhanced to account for changing environmental c onditions and increased activity in the polar regions this report is to include an analysis of the need for any permanent forward operating presence in the polar regions in order to meet mission requirements and an assessment of the coast guards ability to meet the requirements of partner agencies operating in the polar regions such as the national science foundation nsf and the departments of commerce and defense under current and projected environmental conditions finally this report should include an appraisal of th sustainability of the current operations and maintenance cost sharing arrangement between the coast guard and nsf to support both

ppappendix funding arrangement with nsf this appendix presents additional disc ussion of the current arrangement under which the nsf funds the operation nd maintenance of coast guard polar icebreakers excerpts from 2007 nrc report43 the 2007 nrc report discusses the orig ins and features of the funding arrangement as follows budget base transfers in the 1970s and 1980s placed annual funding resources in the budgets of agencies with programs benefiting from icebreaker support in that era including the department of defense national science foundation and maritime administration memoranda of agreement moas implemented these budget transfers to the us coast guard by providing for incremental reimbursement of deploymentr elated expenses primarily fuel and other consumables back to the us coast guard although the us coast guard retained budget base for icebreak er crews maintenance training and other support to ensure that ships were ready for operations it did not have budget authority to specifically deploy icebreakers in support of us coast guard mission responsibilities changes in programs and levels of user agency funding resulted in the decommissioning of older icebreakers in the late 1980s and some changes were made in the reimbursement formula but the general concept of agencies buying operational icebreaker days continued until 2005 in preparing the presidents budget for fiscal year 2006 the office of management and budget omb transf erred budget authority for the polar icebreakers from the us coast guard to the national science foundation nsf while the us coast guard was to retain custody of the polar icebreakers and continue to operate and maintain this fleet congress enacted this onetime transfer of 48 million from the us coast guard to nsf which was intended to offset all direct costs associated w ith the polar icebreaking program including personnel training operation and maintenance these funds constitute the us coast guards entire noncapital budget fo r polar icebreakers this amount however was essentially less than twothirds of the 65 million to 75 million that the us coast guard estimated it woul d cost to maintain the ships congress finalized the transfer of funds in c onference report hr 109272 between the house and senate appropriations subco mmittees that are responsible for nsf according to briefings received from omb budget examiners october 7 2005 this action was based on the fact that the vast majority of icebreaker ship time has been employed for scientific re search the availability and readiness of the polar icebreakers to address other national needs such as law enforcement marine pollution response search and rescue providing us presence and defense operations was not cited as factor in the decision to transfer the ships to nsfhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34391crs31 44 ibid pp 1415 bracketed ma terial as in originalwith this transfer nsf assumed cont rol of the polar icebreaker program and an moa between the us coast guard and nsf regarding polar icebreaker support and reimbursement was established in august 2005 the purpose of this moa is to implement the then proposed budget base transfer for use of the us coast guard icebreakers for scientific and operational support for all planned us coast guard ope rations for fy 2006 and beyond under the 2005 moa nsf agrees to c onsider all national priorities and maintenance requirements when allocating the limited budget in addition nsf will identify icebreaker mission needs for the succeeding fiscal year to the us coast guard the responsibilities of the us coast guard under this agreement are scheduled on an annual basis by nsf the us coast guard has agreed to provide support staff and services necessary to operate and maintain the polar icebreaker fleet and to inform nsf of secondary polar icebreaker missions as they occur these missions include the traditional us coast guard missions of the polar icebreakers search and rescue enforcement of laws and treaties that were conducted as needed and funded from the base funding under this agreement the us coast guard will continue to perform these missions as needed and nsf will continue to fund these missions from the program base that was transferred to nsf in fy 2006 in addition if situation arises that requires longterm polar icebreaker in volvement major marine pollution or humanitarian relief efforts then f unding and scheduling impacts will be coordinated between the us coast guard and nsf44 in commenting on this funding arrang ement and making recommendations for the future the report states the recent transfer of budget authority fo r the polar icebreaking program by the office of management and budget omb from the us coast guard to nsf did not address the basic problem of underfundi ng routine maintenance or providing funds for us coast guard nonscience icebreaker missions the transfer has increased management difficulties by spreading management decisions related to the polar icebreakers across two agencies the nsf now has fiscal control over ll direct costs associated with the polar icebreaking program including personnel training operation and maintenance costs under memorandum of agreement negotiated between the us coast guard and nsf the us coast guard must submit yearly plan for approval by the nsf the nsf is now fiscally responsible and making decisions for missions outside its core mission and expertise without budget authority the us coast guard has been put in situation in which it has the role of operating ship for which it does not have full budget and management control the committee believes that the total t of us coast guard icebreaking missions transcends the mission of support to science despite the fact that the majority of icebreaker usage at the current time is to support research the us coast guard should have the funds and authority to perform the full range of mission responsibilities in icecovered waters of the arctic there is strong evidence that national need for polar iceb reaking in the arctic will increase over the next several decades orders for co mmercial icestrengthened tankers willhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34391crs32 45 ibid pp 101102 similar passages appear on pages 10 and 111double the worldwide fleet of these vessels most are slated to operate in the western arctic along the northern route but expans ion of hydrocarbon development activities to the alaskan north slope and canadian beaufort sea is proceeding with this added human presence robust us coast guard polar icebreaker fleet will be needed for regular patrols of our coastal waters to increase us presence in internati onal arctic waters this will require resumption of regular patrols of coastal waters and an increased us presence in international arctic waters by the nations multimission icebreaker fleet it is not sufficient to provide funds to only maintain the fleet it is necessary to provide funds to operate it effectively the committee strongly believes that management responsibility should be aligned with management accountability when nsf noaa or another user agency employs us coast guard icebreaker to support some directed ac tivity the user agency should pay only incremental costs associated with direct mission tasking this arrangement has worked well for decades although it would be useful for the financial arrangement to be clarified and reasserted by the administration if the us coast guard is funded to operate vessel then direct tasking reimbursement would typically include the cost of fuel for extended transit beyond patrol and onship engineering and habitation costs that derive from research activities the committee distinguishes between direct mission tasking of science voyage and science of opportunity where scientists or educators are aboard at the invitation of the us coast guard on voyages pla nned for coast guard patrol missions the committee encourages the us coast guard to invite researchers and educators on planned patrols to conduct science of opportunity only direct tasking should result in reimbursement to the us coast guard above its congressionally appropriated operational funds recommendation 6 the us coast guar d should be provided sufficient operations and maintenance budget to support an increased regular and influential presence in the arctic other agencies should reimburse incremental costs associated with directed mission tasking45 excerpts from july 16 2008 hearing coast guard testimony the

safety and security we are working closely with nsf and the administration to ensure preservation and efficacy of our nati ons critical icebreaking capabilities and competencies to prepare for the impacts of changing arctic conditions on multiple agencies and their missions the administration has undertaken an arctic policy review in which the coast guard is an active participant46 during the questionandanswer porti on of admiral allens testimony the following exchange occurred representative latourette relative to the polar icebreakers and this issue of the national science foundation and again in my opening remarks i mentioned the contract that theyve entered into with the swedes did you have an observation or an opinion as to what the impact of having the national science foundation basically have the budget authority for the icebreakers does to the service relative to dollar impact administration running of the ships admiral allen well ive said on several occasions and in prior hearings and i will restate it here the current situation while wellintended when it was created is somewhat dysfunctional in regards to how we have to manage this because it puts huge enormous management burden on the national science foundation that puts almost an evidentiary responsibility on the coast guard to demonstrate what we intend to do with the vessels so they can certify what the funds are being used for and theyre adequately being spent and i dont begrudge them bit for doing that but it is very very cumbersome representative latourette if they in fact had not entered into the agreement with the swedes for the use of an icebreaker would those have been funds available to the coast guard for the use of your assets admiral allen at the start of every year we come up with an operating plan and theres certain base amount of money that is provided in the national science foundation budget and ill let dr bement speak to that we provide them plan they approve the plan and th at is the source of the funds that are transferred from the national science foundation to the coast guard and it varies from year to year based on the amount of operations were conducting and the maintenance required on the ships representative latourette and do those funds in that budget that you lay out at the beginning of the year are those funds always sufficient to the cost incurred by the coast guard for those missionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34391crs34 47 source transcript of hearingadmiral allen well theres been an ongoing issue about whether or not as ships get older and this is not just to do with icebreakers it could be any ship youre talking about they become more expensive as they get older there probably is an added issue of an inflation factor and the ability to keep up with the demands for maintenance on the ships47 later in the questionandanswer portio n of admiral allens testimony the following exchange occurred representative larsen i understand that polar sea completed deployment to the waters in april and may primarily for the purpose of renewing the crews qualifications can you tell us what sort of missions the polar sea performed what it accomplished and whether or not the crew was able to fully renew their qualifications admiral allen sir we moved out into the through the gulf of alaska through the aleutian chain up into the beri ng sea we did fisheries patrols did what we would call arctic domain awareness just up there sensing whats going on an idea for the amount of vessel traffic we did science of opportunity we did some got into the very very light ice areas there it was good we needed to do it im glad we did it i appreciate the national science foundation support on doing that i wish we could have done more i wish we could have got deeper into the ice and spent longer time there because these competencies atrophy over time and i am concerned that at certain point there wont be baseline level of competency to operate these ships which were going to need to do in the future but there are constraints put on the operation of polar sea by the agreements with the national scie nce foundation we did what we could representative larsen what constraints are on it admiral allen well we prenegotiate how much were going to use the ship theres matter of risk if you get into the ice and you have some wear and tear or you have issue with the propeller or things that need to be done number one that increases cost or the risk that the vessel might not be available next year when its going to be in standby for th contracted icebreaker for the mcmurdo breakout representative larsen so then when the crews not able to fully renew their qualifications in your view admiral allen well they atrophy at time were ok right now but thats the reason im trying to press fo rward with sense of urgency we kind of have to get this resolved otherwise were going to lose our seed cornhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34391crs35 48 source transcript of hearingrepresentative larsen and so it sounds to like they werent able to fully renew their qualifications admiral allen we would have liked to have done more yes sir representative larsen so what does it take to do more admiral allen well i think we need to continue to work on the management issues associated with it and arrive on consensus on how we can sustain the current fleet and the competencies in the coast guard and still meet the requirements of the national science foundation its going to have to be collaborative effort sir representative allen it sounds like you need collaborative effort but it also sounds like those limitations are preventing you from achieving your mission admiral allen im concerned about our r eadiness eroding yes sir48 still later in the questionandanswer tion of admiral allens testimony the following exchange occurred representative coble as i understand it mr chairman in 2006 congress transferred budget authority fo r polar icebreaking to the national science foundation and they in turn re imburse the coast guard for operations it is furthermore my understanding that the nsf has begun to contract with foreign icebreaking companies to fulfill th eir needs in the arctic and i want to ask you couple of questions in just minute admiral but to conclude mr chairman and my colleagues i have keen interest in icebreaking and im subjectively involved because i used to be stationed aboard coast guard cutter im sure admiral shes long been decommissioned i dont know where she is now but i would like to encourage our committee mr chairman to continue to review the shared responsibilities between the national science foundation and the coast guard with regard to polar icebreaking while i support the mission of both agencies i question wh ether the current funding mechanisms best fit the respective needs of the two organizations and admiral allen what i want to do i want to put threepart question to you and im going to probably have to abruptly leave to go back to judiciary but my questions to you admiral are has this procedure that i just described affected your operations and readiness of the polar icebreaking fleet b does the current funding arrangement with the national science foundation allow for adequate maintenan ce of the polar icebreaker fleet bhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34391crs36 49 source transcript of hearingand c what are the longterm imp lications of continuing this funding arrangement admiral allen there is an issue with current readiness and its not let say it up front here i have all the respect in the world for dr bement of the nsf and were good friends and were colleagues i think were both in really tough situation here any time you have one of the three icebreakers that this country operates through the coast guard that have been validated by an external study by the national research council in commission special status you have readiness problem so is there readiness problem yes there is sirthat vessel polar star is tied up its got caretaker crew on it were making sure the machinery could be brought back in year or so if it was needed but weve had divers down looking at the hull we have problems with the zinc anodes that are on there that protect against corrosi on theres marine growth on it so even the readiness of the vessel that s laid up continues to be an issue with us is this adequate in the long term obviously its not we need three polar icebreakers to operate in this country and one is laid up and in the long term my goal is to stabilize whats going on right now and make sure we keep the polar star where its at pending the policy resolutions that will lead us to longterm solution but our readiness now is not what it should be i dont believe its adequate and we have to have longterm fix sir 49 still later in the questionandanswer tion of admiral allens testimony the following exchange occurred representative cummings and so when you say long range you said maybe we ought to have longrange plan i guess what im trying to get to is that in the short range right now we do have problem then representative allen yes sir and its because the effort and the money thats being transferred is sized to support the science mission not all the missions we need to do sir representative cummings i see andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34391crs37 50 source transcript of hearing 51 source transcript of hearingadmiral allen i think dr bement would tell you were just fine where were at and i understand where he sits on that but ive got other things i have to do out there representative cummings youd rather not be sharing any efforts with the national science foundation admiral allen id rather be supporting them completely without any money transfers representative cummings right admiral allen and giving him what he needs and then with the capacity that i have in addition to the science be creating presence where we need to based on the evolving mission sir50 still later in the questionandanswer portion of admiral allens testimony representative richardson asked admiral allen if he agreed with certain findings of the 2007 nrc report when representativ richardson asked whether he agreed with finding that the us coast gu ard should be provided sufficient operations and maintenance budget to support an increas in regular and influential presence in the arctic admiral allen replied well thats twopart question because currently the maintenance money resides with the national science foundation without prejudice i believe the money should be in the coast guard base budget and we should operate it but thats policy decision to be made51 nsf and us arctic commission testimony the july 16 2008 hearing on coast guard icebreaker needs also included testimony from dr arden bement jr director of the nsf mead treadwell chair of the us arctic commission and james weakley president of the lake carriers association and vice president of the great lakes maritime task force during the questionand answer portion of their testimony which followed admiral allens testimony the following exchange occurred representative cummings i want to first of all go to you mr bement and to you mr treadwell regarding the polar seas most recent mission to the arctic can either of you comment on why the vessel did not go further north than it did dr bement yes our procedure in working with the coast guard to allocate the or not to exceed budget th at we get from the congress which this past year was of the order of 54 million is that we provide to the coast guard set of requirements operating requirements they in turn take those requirement s and give us an operating plan plus costs for om operation and maintenance costs as well as normal operatinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34391crs38 52 source transcript of hearingcosts we negotiate that plan and finally come up with settlement which then gets transferred to the coast guard for operations in the case of the polar sea and operating in the arctic most of those operations were to requalify crewmen for certification for operations we felt at the time of our negotiations with the coast guard and we came to agreement that taking the pola r sea into deep ice was risky because of the possibility of serious damage so that it seemed to be more prudent to transfer crewmen who needed to be cer tified for ice operations to the healy since the healy was operating in deep ice those crewmen did achieve their service on the healy they did get certified so as an alternative set of conditions that seemed to be the best decision we could arrive at at that time representative cummings so the basically because the polar sea is old you were concerned dr bement well we usually have the polar sea for backup service and in many cases you need two ships because its hard enough from season to season how thick the ice is going to be and if the ice is sufficiently thick you need backup vessel also if one of the ships gets damaged you need the backup vessel to take over the operation if the polar sea operating on its own in the arctic had gone into deep ice and had undergone serious damage that required lengthy maintenance that would almost knock out all capability for icebreak ing in the antarctic for another year or perhaps longer so weve been trying to not only depl oy our assets but also to protect our assets in the most prudent way by not putting them in risk where other alternatives would serve so that was the basis for our decision representative cummings did you have comment mr treadwell mr treadwell i weve talked to the coast guard and weve talked to the national science foundation and i ve contradiction with what dr bement has said what i will say is that if were in situation where we cant put our polar class icebreaker into the ice because we re afraid well break it thats probably prima facie evidence that we need new icebreaker and because we probably should have two backing it up i think that particular episode is very good piece of evidence for congress to take action on this issue52httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34391crs39 appendix b nsf use of coast guard vs other polar icebreakers this appendix presents excerpts from the july 16 2008 hearing on coast guard icebreaking needs that relate to the question of the nsfs use of coast guard polar icebreakers versus other polar icebreakers to suppor t its research activities excerpts from nsf statement for july 16 2008 hearing the prepared statement of dr arden beme nt jr director of the nsf for the july 16 2008 hearing on coast guard icebreaker needs stated in part nsf responsibilities in the arctic and in antarctica take somewhat different forms and with the committees indulgence ill explain briefly how they differ with respect to icebreaker requirements but in both cases the question of how best to meet those responsibilities boils down to consideration of three factors cost performance and policy nsf requirements in the arctic nsf supports research on the arctic ocean atmosphere and land areas including marine and terrestrial ecosystems and their relationships to the wellbeing of local populations in addition to research in individual disciplines support is provided for interdisciplinar approaches to understanding the arctic region including its role in global clim ate over the last decade changes have been measured in the distribution of pol ar ice cover in atmospheric composition arctic ocean conditions some terrestrial parameters as well as in northern ecosystems residents of the north are seeing these environmental changes affect their lives it is important to determin whether these changes correlate to shortterm shift in regional atmospheric or ocean processes or whether they are the result of longerterm global change in the arctic science on land and in coastal areas tends to be based at few sparsely distributed remote outposts and in many cases access by ship is the most advantageous means even for projects that are not inherently oceanographic in its few years of service the coast guard icebreaker healy has supported research in variety of area s including biology sea ice marine geology and geophysics cartography phy sical and chemical oceanography and atmospheric science as research has advanced and become more technologically sophisticated nsf has increasingly relied on coordinated international multiship expeditions to access the arctic region and laborator facilities for example while the uscgc healy does have the capability to work alone in the deep arctic during summer any vessel by itself is more risky making multiship arrangements necessary in lieu of an icebreaker research platform with more robust capabilities the uscg polar sea and polar star have sufficient icebreaking capability to operate in the deep arctic but they have limited research capabilities by design and have been needed in the antarctic international collaborations also have become necessary as the demands for research aboard the healy have intensified recent international partnerships with sweden involving their icebreaker the oden and with germany and their icebreaker thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34391crs40 polarstern have been highly successful as have collaborations by nsf national oceanic and atmospheric administra tion noaa and othe r agencies with various canadian chinese russian and other ships arctic requirements ship cost and reliability according to information provided by the coast guard over the past decade nsf has typically used approximately 90 percent of the 185200 days current uscg deployment standards allow healy to spend at sea science programs are limited by the ship time available on the uscgc healy and also by the number of berths available for science healy can accommodate up to 50 scientific personnel in addition to its operational coast guard crew of about 80 other nations research icebreakers with comparable icebreaking capability typically operate with crews half the size of healys with comparably greater numbers of scientist berths the healy also faces limitations in its icebreaking capacity especially during the spring when the ice coverage north of alaska has been thick enough in some years 2004 2005 to beset the ship for several days under the current arrangement nsf is responsible for funding healy operations and maintenance while the coast guard is responsible for operating the ship and carrying out its maintenan ce program coordination between the two agencies is arranged under an moa in which nsf provides the coast guard with set of operational requirements annually based on an interagency call for icebreaker needs and the coast guard re sponds with an operational plan and cost estimate based on those requirements to tal healy costs are approximately 24 million annually or about 130000 per day at sea in 2007 i will return to the issues of co st availability and policy shortly plans have been underway for several years to construct new icestrengthened ship that could support scientific studies in the waters around alaska nsf has assigned high priority to building this ship the alaska region research vessel arrv and constr uction funds were included in the presidents fy08 budget request for acquis ition planning it is estimated that it will take 25 years to construct and deploy the ship once shipyard contract has been issued the ship will be operated by the universitynational oceanographic laboratory system unols which operates number of research vessels the arrv which will replace the alpha helix will be designed to work in up to 3 feet of ice the arrv will thus be ab to conduct research cruises year round in the gulf of alaska and the southern bering sea and in the summer as far north as the chukchi and beaufort seas during minimum ice cover during heavy ice periods in the bering sea the rrv would probably need the assistance of the healy estimated operating costs are about 20k 30kday arctic sea ice has diminished significantly since the arrv design was established and thus arrvs reach now extends farther into the arctic ocean than had been anticipated making the ship even more valuable to the research community finally we need better access to the d eep ocean in the arctic options for supporting research in the deep arctic should be integral to any study of future icebreaker needshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34391crs41 in conclusion the healy is capable and relatively new ship that can be the mainstay of us arctic ocean research for years to come however under the current operational model the operating costs are significantly higher than nonmilitary research icebreakers and its capability as an allseasons deep arctic research platform is also limited nsf requirements in antarctica nsf provides approximately 85 percent of the us funding for fundamental research in the antarctic and the southern ocean this research addresses wide array of topics across many disciplines for instance researchers are studying topics as wide ranging as the evolution of the ozone hole the impact of extreme environmen ts on gene expression the effects of ultraviolet radiation on living organisms the relationship between changes in the ice sheet and global sea level global weather climate and ocean circulation the role of antarctica in global tectonics nd the evolution of life through geologic time and the early evolution of our unive rse as well as its current composition this research requires access to ships serving two quite different functions multipurpose icebreakers that can operate in the southern ocean as research platforms that also resupply our co astal palmer station on the antarctic peninsula and heavyduty icebreakers th at can open resupply channel through fast ice to mcmurdo station from mcmu rdo supplies are transferred to the us research station at the south pole and to temporary remote field stations at various points on the continent these tw requirements are met in quite different ways antarctic shipbased research platforms ship cost availability and policy us antarctic program shipbased re search and palmer station resupply depend primarily on two privatelyowned vessels the laurence m gould lmg and the nathaniel b palmer nbp the nbp is leased by nsfs prime contractor currently raytheon polar services company rpsc from the loui sianabased shipping company edison chouest offshore eco the vessel was built to specifications developed on the basis of input from the science community the ship is an abs a2 icebreaker capable of breaking 3 feet of level ice continuously at 3 knots with 13000 shaft horsepower and displacement of 6800 long tons it is outfitted with all of the winches and aframes necessary for deploying and retrieving oceanographic instrumentation the vessel is fully outfitted with onboard oceanographic instrumentation and networked computer suite including multibeam sonar and has 5900 ft2 of lab space and 4076 ft2 of open deck space for oceanographic work and staging and helicopter pad and hanger the nbp averages 300 days year underway in support of scienceas is the case for the nbp the laurence m gould is leased by raytheon from edison chouest offshor eco also like the nbp the vessel was designed and built on the basis of input from the science community the ship is smaller than the nbp and has less ice breaking capability as it was designed to operate in the more benign ice regions surrounding the antarctic peninsula the ship is an abs a1 icestrengthen ed vessel with 4600 shaft horsepower andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34391crs42 displacement of 3400 long tons and can break one foot of level ice at continuous 3 knots it is fully instrumented with onboard oceanographic instruments and networked computer suite the lmg has the dual purpose of supporting oceanographic science and prov iding resupply to palmer station located on the antarctic peninsula it should be noted however that the lmg will soon be at the end of its service contract nsf recently issued request for proposals to procure replacement for the lmg the lmg averages 320 days year underway in support of scientific research and associated logistics annual costs for the npb and lmg in 2007 were 163m and 75m respectively resulting in respective day costs of 543k and 234k for these ships antarctic station resupply ship cost reliability and policy as noted above the resupply of the mcmurdo and south pole stations as well as of temporary remote field stations in antarctica depends on gaining access to the mcmurdo pier through the ice in mcmurdo sound since 1988 the channel was opened by one us coast guard polar class vessel either the polar star or the polar sea but more recently two icebreaking vessels have been needed due to extreme ice conditions nd concerns about the reliability of the aging polar class vessels after opening the channel the icebreaker escorts two resupply vessels governmentowned tanker and chartere d freighter to and from the ice pier at mcmurdo these resupply vessels are icestrengthened vessels under the operational control of us tran sportation commands ustranscom component command military sealift command military sealift command utilizes commercial contracts for construction maintenance and staffing of vessels as result msc operates fleet of cargo ships and tankers that are contractorowned and operated or gove rnmentowned and contractoroperated in fy05 acting on advice from the coast guard that second icebreaker should be brought in to assist the polar star due to extreme ice conditions in mcmurdo sound nsf chartered the russian icebreaker krasin for the purpose the coast guards polar sea was undergoing repairs and other us icebreakers were available as the healy was needed in the arctic to support research italso lacks both the maneuverability and performance for the mcmurdo break in in fy06 the polar sea was undergoing extensive repair nsf again chartered the russian icebreaker krasin and held polar star in reserve and eventually brought it in to assist in the final stages of the breakin the situation was similar in fy07 polar sea was ready for duty but the coast guard recommended that backup vessel again be employed due to continuing extreme ice conditions nsf therefore arranged to use swedish research icebreaker the oden under the auspices of the us sweden st agreement both to open the channel to mcmurdo station and to host joint us swedish research expedition aboard the ship in the southern ocean polar sea assisted with the final stages of the mcmurdo break in based on the excellent performance of oden in fy07 and the success of the joint re search program nsf elected to use the oden again in fy08 this time as the primary icebreaker holding the polar sea in reserve where it could also respond to any needs for its services in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34391crs43 arctic the polar sea deployed to the arctic in fy08 in order to maintain crew proficiency the uscg has performed its icebreaking mission in antarctica with distinction for many decades but with increasing difficulty in r ecent years its two polar class icebreakers are nearing the end of their estimated service lives and are becoming increasingly difficult and costly to keep in service according to the uscg there are several years of service life in the polar sea but the polar star has now been placed in caretaker status per agreement with uscg in view of the decreasing need for her servic and the high cost of putting her back into service the need to rely first on the krasin and then on the oden has already been mentioned as has the need to keep the polar sea available to meet the needs in the arctic and perhaps as occasional backup for the annual mcmurdo station breakin given this stat of affairs nsf has given careful consideration to how best to meet the ne eds of the scientific community over the longterm under the current arrangement between nsf and the coast guard nsf provides all the funding for uscg icebreaker operations and maintenance in support of scientific research and the co ast guard carries out those duties nsf provided just under 54m for operation of the uscg polar class icebreakers in 2007 in addition nsf provided approximately 75 million out of its base budget for fuel and charter of oden when chartering commercial vessels such as the krasin and the oden nsf pays only for the time that the ships are under charter use of commercial ships and modelsmodes of operation as noted above nsf has met the research communitys need for research platforms in the southern ocean through longterm contracts with private firms for icestrengthened ships and icebreaker s and through partnerships that provide access to other countrys research vessels for resupply of mcmurdo and south pole stations nsf has depended until recently entirely on us coast guard icebreakers secured through reimbursement arrangements and on chartered military sealift command capabilities more recently nsf has had to arrange for chartered vessels to complement us cg capabilities in the arctic nsf has relied on the coast guards healy and on partnerships w ith other countries once constructed and commissioned the arctic regional research vessel arrv will significantly increase the capacity for shipbased research in the coastal arctic regions and where ice cover is relatively thin variety of models have been and are being used by the us and other countries for meeting polar icebreaker needs the us coast guard and the chilean and argentinean navies operate their icebreakers using military personnel some countries build their sh ips to meet military specifications and others do not the german research icebreaker the polarstern is owned by the government but operated by private contractor the swedish governments operational arrangements for the oden are similar to the german model both the oden and the polarstern are able to operate more than 300 days annually as consequence of ship design and mode of operation the arctic regional research vessel arrv will be operated by civilian crews under contract to the universitynational oceanographic laboratory systems unolshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34391crs44 as noted above nsf employs contr actor to operate and maintain the privatelyowned laurence m gould and nathanial b palmer the ships were built under longterm lease agreement between the shipowners and the federal government such that the construction costs are partially amortized over the duration of the lease with the ship reve rting to the owner at the governments option at the end of the lease these ships also operate more than 300 days annually finally and as noted previously the military sealift command meets its needs and those of nsfs for transport to mcmurdo station either through commercial charters for ships and cr ews or through governmentowned contractoroperated arrangements meeting future needs international cooperation to provide icebreaker research platforms is expected to increase both in arrangin g multiship expeditions and in sharing platforms certainly as germany and th european community move forward in constructing the planned aurora borealis nsf will work to establish mutually beneficial partnerships nsfs commitment to polar research and its responsibility for management of the us antarctic program remains constant and therefore perpetuates the need for an icebreaker to open the shipping channel through the ross sea to enable resupply of the mcmurdo and sout h pole stations because opening the channel to mcmurdo requires only fraction of the time modern icebreaker can operate annually there may be interest among shi pbuilders in providing icebreaker services to nsf under ct in which the builder can lease the ship to others other countries or privat firms during the remainder of the year an interagency working group coled by the department of state and the national security council is currently reviewing us arctic policy and icebreaking needs will likely figure into the new policy clearly the economics and efficiencies of the various acquis ition and operating models merit further study and will depend on the suite of va lidated requirements put forth in the policy review for research in the arctic the healy should be mainstay for many years to come though its utility is restricted by its 200day operational limitation the healys inability to access the deep arctic during periods of heavy ice cover is another limitation th limitations combined with military deployment mode make the healy as currently operated very expensive way to meet the needs of the research community and as noted above once in service the arrv will be valuable additional resource for arctic research for antarctic research the issues are different the two existing coast guard polar class ships are at or close to the end of their service life the polar star is in caretaker status and the polar sea is expensive to maintain relative to the costs for the use of foreign nonmilitary ice breakers over the past several years such as the russian krasin and swedish oden the overriding question is how to open the channel through the ice to mcmurdo station so that yearround operation of the nations mcmurdo and s outh pole stations can continue this yearround occupation is central to demonstrating the active and influential presence which is the cornerstone of u s policy in antarctica as articulated inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34391crs45 53 testimony of dr arden l bement jr director national science foundation before the house committee on transportation and in frastructure subcommittee on coast guard and maritime transportation july 16 2 008 pp 28 italics as in original this excerpt constitutes the majority of dr ardens 8page prepared statementpresidential memorandum 6646 on us antarctic policy and programs february 5 1982 other factors contribu ting to this presence are the 600 days annually that nsfs research vessels the lm gould and the nb palmer operate in antarctic waters the approximately twenty c17 air force flights annually that fly passengers and cargo between new zealand and mcmurdo and the more than 400 air national guard lc130 flight s annually that provide transportation for people and equipment throughout the continent furthermore noaa charters the russian rv yuzhmorgeologiya approximately 100 sea days per year in support of its antarctic program this program focuses on living marine resources at the antarctic peninsula in support of us interests at the commission for the conservation of antarctic marine living resources ccamlr to which the united states is signatory in considering how best to insure the continued annual resupply of mcmurdo station and to meet our res ponsibility for the tire us antarctic program nsf operates in accordance with us policy and the instructions contained in presidential memorandum 6646 that every effort shall be made to manage the program in manner that maximizes cost effectiveness and return on investment the arctic policy review will certai nly help inform future icebreaker discussions but even if decision were made today to build or refurbish an icebreaker it would be years before the ship got underway accordingly to meet its ongoing requirements in costeffective means nsf has made arrangements to lease an icebreaker from sweden nsf signed 5year agreement with sweden for joint research program in the southern ocean with sweden additionally providing break in services for the usap nsf sees need to keep the uscgc polar sea available to meet needs in the arctic and perhaps as occasional backup for the breakin to mcmurdo sound this however is clearly only shortterm solution with an eye looking to the longterm and after consultations with officials in ostp and omb i wrote on may 31 2006 to the chair of the nasnrc icebreaker study dr anita jones as follows given the rapidly escalating costs of government pr oviders for icebreaking services and the uncertain availability of uscg icebreakers beyond the next two years it is nsfs intention to seek competitive bids for icebreaking services that support the broad goals of the usap this competition will be open to commercial government and international service providers the request for proposals will not be for ships but rather for services and we would expect the service providers to use their ships for ot her purposes when not in service to meet nsf needs thus the cost to the f oundation could be substantially reduced53 nsf spoken testimony at july 16 2008 hearing during the questionandanswer porti on of dr bements testimony the following exchange occurred representative cummings mr bement are the vessels currently available to the national science foundation from the contract community andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34391crs46 from foreign sources capable of handling current ice europe agencies current icebreaking needs to support research in the polar regions dr bement we believe so but we havent fully tested that two years ago we put out request for information rfi and as matter of fact it was through these rfis that brought us the krasin from russia and the oden from sweden and i should point out parenthetically these are not agreements between the national scienc foundation and private contractor its governmenttogovernment agreement and in the case of the swedish oden it also carries with it science agreement its science exchange because the oden is capable of doing science and theres very active colla borative activity between us scientists and swedish scientists in working the southern ocean and so the oden while its deployed in the southern ocean is also there for science as well as breakin i think that if we were to put out an rfi and ask those questions based on the responses we got in the past we w ould probably find expre ssions of interest even private interest that would buildto lease icebreaker services over period of time representative cummings so is it fair to say that nsf doesnt care where it gets its icebreaking services dr bement our only our only mandate by presidential directive is to operate in the antarctic and in the logistics support of the antarctica program in the most costeffective way possible and of course the most costeffective way carries with it lot of conditions and lot of options so we explore all those options in determining how we can operate under least cost representative cummings but you mentioned sweden and russia did you say dr bement yes representative cummings were they were they cheaper dr bement four years ago we did have the problem where the polar sea was out of operation as matter of fact since that time we have invested 29 million in extraordinary maintenance in order to get the polar sea back into operation and thats why we call it fragile resource now at that time it was agreed by the coast guard that we needed backup vessel and it was then that we put out an rfi and discovered that the krasin was available and so we contracted with russia the krasin is goco vessel its governmentowned contractoroperated as is the oden the oden is also goco its government owned contractoroperated so for two seasons we backed up th coast guard with the krasin and then two years ago we shifted to the oden because there was an expression of interest on the part of sweden to enter into usswedish science exchange inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34391crs47 54 source transcript of hearingreturn for also using the icebreaker fo r breakin services and that was very generous offer that we took advantage of so that gave us the adequate primary breakin capability and it allowed us to use the coast guard as the backup and so thats the way weve operated for the last two seasons representative cummings before we go to mr oberstar let just ask you this is the you said you spent 29 million and over how much over what course of time dr bement its over four years representative cummings how long dr bement four years representative cummings four years dr bement about four or five years but i can give you more detailed information for the record to give you all the details but if you go back about 45 years ago the polar star was operational the polar sea was not fully operational it required extensive maintenance so we invested in getting the polar s ea back into operational capability and at that time the polar star th underwent some damage and so it was then that we put polar star in ca retaker status and it was the expectation based on the repairs that we had made in the polar sea that it was good for another seven or eight years as long as we used the resource prudently representative cummings and would you deem it prudent to contribute capital costs for the building of new icebreaker dr bement i think at this point based on my understanding of the mission space that the coast guard has especially with the opening up of the arctic over time that it would be prudent course of action but my estimate or judgment would be that even if the funds were approved tomorrow itd take about eight years to complete the construction of the vessel and make it operational and we still have to we still have to plan our course of action for the next eight years and thats where we need flexibility54 later in the questionandanswer tion of dr bements testimony the following exchange occurred representative oberstar the finns built the first nuclearpowered icebreaker they had to give it to the soviet union as war reparations after world war ii and then they continued to build the class of vessels and theyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34391crs48 also build standard that is nonnuclear vessel the most powerful of which is the urho built at the wartsila shipyards in helsinki and that had that has its still in operation 65000 shaft horsepower capability and they also developed the air skin around the vessel to slip more readily through the ice and the ability to ship 400 500 tons of water from one side to another to roll through and crush as well as break ice did you give any consideration to working with the finns on dr bement well let representative oberstar icebreaking needs dr bement thank you for bringing up that information it turns out that the oden was built by the finns so it could be sister ship to the one youre describing representative oberstar oh oh well very good theyre the master ship icebreaker dr bement thats right representative oberstar icebreaking ship builders dr bement the difference major difference between the oden and the polar sea and the polar star for th at matter is that the oden can use fresh water for ballast the polar sea uses fuel for ballast that fuel has to come out of our mcmurdo stock whenever the sea or the star operates in mcmurdo so theres million gallons and with the price of fuel even at the pump thats 4 million and you can use your imagination what fuel costs after you get it all the way down to mcmurdo and thats an incremental cost that we pay to the coast guard thats over and above the appropriated funds that we provide them for readiness to serve and for operation and maintenance so thats where the difference really comes in in using the oden versus the polar sea or the polar star the other big difference is that because the coast guard icebreakers are military ships and have multiple missions they have much larger crew strength their manning is about 134 crew officer s and crew compared with 18 on the oden and its important to keep in mind that as contractoroperated vessel these people are career icebreakers theyve served for years so they are highly professional and thats in comparison with the crew on the polar sea where the coast guard has to spend an enormous amount of time and effort to continually requalify crew because of the turnover in the manning of the icebreakerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34391crs49 55 source transcript of hearingnow there are many other differences that make the oden very good bet for the taxpayer first of all it has much more scientific berthing for scientists and it also has abundant laboratory space and full instrumentation for oceanographic research and thats reason why its of great interest to us as science vessel so we not only get the service of the oden on fixedprice basis incidentally if anything breaks on that ship or any maintenance has to be done or if there are any other operating expenses that werent anticipated its all covered under the fixed price under the contract we dont have to pay that additional cost representative oberstar what youre really saying is you dont really need to have an nsfowned icebreaker its probably lower cost and more efficient dr bement well the only representative oberstar to inaudible with the current arrangement dr bement the current arrangement is good one because were only paying for the time we use in other words if its only in use for two months we only pay for two months of the use of the vessel thats much better than owning vessel for short season down in the antarctic and thats reason why having flexibility to look at various types of icebreaking providers and in many cases well have to fall back on the coast guard theres doubt about it if the need arises and we cant get other bidders but when we can get other bidders it its much better than the current arrangement where we have to pay for the entire year for the vessel for the maintenance the crew costs the operation i mean the training of the crew the readiness to serve when were only using it for relatively short season55 still later in the questionandanswer portion of dr bements testimony the following exchange occurred representative richardson id like to build little bit upon what our chairman oberstar was just referencin g regarding the foreignflagged ships you know someone taught an old saying they said if you have to make decision do the oldfashioned ben franklin and do positive and negative and i was just little curious of why were we supporting really another countrys being able to build up their flee t and have as mr oberstar has shared you know can do it all when we clearly have fleet that is not adequate why wouldnt we be putting the money into our own fleethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34391crs50 dr bement well im very sensitive to that point of view and i dont take any issue with the question i just dont have very good answer for it representative richardson well id like to suggest that we may want to consider when i was referencing the kind of ben franklin pros and cons the contractor idea you know sure you might save few bucks but for the plus and minuses for the coast guard number one we have better security because from what i understand on our ship s we have more people who are actually on the vessel and by having the coast guard theyre not only doing the icebreaking but theyre taking care of other tasks and if we were to pay for those inde pendently and you include the cost of icebreaking it actually ends up costing us more the second point is jobs i mean if were actually building thesethird would be faster response if we have national disaster this gentleman just talked about the fact that you know it was said help is coming well ive got to tell you if someone in finland or sweden has to choose between their issue and ours and we have national disaster theyre going to their home first theyre not coming to us and then the whole building and ma intenance of our own fleet we need to maintain some of our own independe nce because god forbid we dont want to be stuck with having fleet or fleet thats not really appropriate if we unfortunately come into time of war and maybe now we longer have that relationship and theyre not willing to work with us so mr chairman i would just like to really push back that as we consider and ive been listening to the thoug hts of the discussion of the hearing thus far today it seems like there is will to have these additional fleets on our end but id just like to really push the point for the reasons that i just gave we need to be more selfdependent independent ourselves and not relying upon some other country to bail us out i dont think that thats what america is about and i dont think if you had choice that would be probabl where you would want to go do you have comment on that dr bement well i think again thats matter of national policy and the national science foundation is probably the last agency that ought to be involved in those kind of determinations our focus is to carry on frontier science and to do it in the most costeffective way possible and i think you rightly pointed out th at the mission space for icebreaking is suddenly expanded if i look at the congressional research service report they had five particular missions five specific missions for icebreaking andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34391crs51 56 james weakley president of the lake carriers association and vice president of the great lakes maritime task force who was another witness at the hearing 57 source transcript of hearingwe were bullet number one but there we re four bullets underneath and those are totally out of the scope of the national science foundation so thats the only way i could answ er your question but again im very sympathetic to your point of view representative richardson well not only sympathetic we might make little money because then we could contract ourselves that would be novel idea for us dr bement and i might point out incidentally representative richardson im sorry dr bement and i might point out incidentally that the national science foundation is not the only federal agen cy leasing ships from the swedish representative richardson oh i understand dr bement the department of defense is leasing theyve leased submarine and theyre leasing merchant vessel from the swedes to help in their operations in the middle east so its you know the military inservice sealift command is also involved in leasing vessels from other countries in the world and representative richardson sir ive down to 30 seconds i didnt mean to insinuate that youre not the only agency thats doing it its just its something i dont particularly happen to agree with and would prefer to see us doing less of mr chairman would you allow 30 seconds to hear mr weakleys comments on that question representative cummings yes representative richardson thank you sir mr weakley 56 may i theres question i represent american sailors i think we have proud tradition we have proud tradition not just of going to sea but i think we build the finest ship s in the world i think the us merchant marine and our shipbuilding capability won world war ii id be happy to take that mission i think the labor unions that i work with sitting behind would welcome the opportunity to man those ships if its mission that the coast guard cant handle and its seen as more of private sector were ready to step up and meet that challenge57httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34391crs52 58 memorandum for chairman joint chiefs of staff from cdr uspacom cdr ustranscom cdr usnothcom

strategic and economic interests in the arctic and antarctic in the north the united states is an arctic nation with broad and fundamental national security interests in addition to the essential requirements for homeland security and maritime domain awareness the effects of climate change and increasing economic activity require more active presence in this maritime domain in the south the united states maintains three scientific stations while the mission of th stations is largely scientific their presence secures the united states infl uential role in the antarctic treaty decision making process and maintains the balance necessary to maintain our position on antarctic sovereignty 2 to assert our interests in these regions the united states needs assured access with reliable icebreaking ships today however two of the three coast guard icebreakers are nearing the end of their service lives with one relegated to caretaker status over the past 10 years some routine maintenance has been deferred and there is service life extension program for these ships as result the nations icebreaking capability has diminished substantially and is at risk of being unable to support our national interests in the arctic regions an example of our reduced icebreaking capab ility is last seasons mcmurdo station resupply mission where usns gianella spent 50 hours in packice awaiting escort from leased swedish icebreaker 3 in summary icebreakers are essential instruments of united states policy in the polar regions we therefore recommend joint chiefs of staff support for the following program for the construction of ne w polar icebreakers to be operated by the coast guard coast guard funding to keep existin g icebreakers viable until the new ships enter service
