standard armoured personnel carrier apc issued to mechanised infantry mech inf battalions bns in place of saxon which will be withdrawn from general service1 the bulldog will stay in service with the mech inf until replaced by the future rapid effects system fres2 on entering service the bulldog will be deployed to the op telic theatre in addition to bulldog mastif protected transport vehicle3 and vector protected patrol vehicle will enter service over the same period4 2 the three mech inf bns will be equipped with bulldog and additional cvrt armoured vehicles sultan and spartan these bns will typically fight in concert with armour armoured infantry ai and light forces however in stability operations mech inf will be expected to operate independently in localised areas the bulldog is an apc affording protection and mobility for the infantry compared to ai mech inf is characterised by high levels of protection and mobility with limited firepower enabling lesser tempo of operations it must be emphasised that mech inf demonstrates reduced offensive capabilities with clear emphasis on enabling dismounted close combat dcc 3 the mech inf is an important element of the m edium force medium forces are strategically and operationally more deployable than heavy forces and may be among the first elements to deploy into theatre they are less capable than heavy forces with reduced protection and firepower but are more capable than light forces in many circumstances they thus form an intermediate step between heavy and light forces 4 to further place mech inf in context it is worth comparing the basic attributes of armoured mechanized and light infantry ai is characterised by high levels of firepower protection and mobility enabling high tempo of operations these inherent capabilities make ai responsive to shifting priorities and allow the option to fight mounted or dismounted b mech inf is characterised by high levels of protection and mobility with limited firepower enabling lesser tempo of operations when compared to ai the reduced offensive capabilities of mech inf lead to an emphasis on enabling dcc c light inf is characterised by high levels of strategic and operational mobility but is otherwise constrained in terms of firepower prot ection and tactical mobility ideally suited for operations in complex terrain the utility of light inf in all operational environments grows with increasing levels of support from cs and css elements 1 1 bulldog isd sep 06 2 fres isd 2018 tbc 3 d jt cap protected mobility defence vehicle nomenclature and definitions final review dated 13 jul 06 4 mastif isd nov 06 vector isd jan 07 restricted restricted 5 definition of mech inf is as part of the combined arms battle group mechanised infantry offer high levels of protection and mobility but with limited mounted firepower to enable dismounted close combat dcc with wide utility across the spectrum of conflict though with reduced offensive capabilities mech inf bgs are capable of rapid manoeuvre and demonstrate moderate levels of tempo transitioning from one activity to another when in contact aim 6 the aim of this dn is to provide guidance to commanders on the employment of the afv 430 mk3 bulldog assumptions 7 this dn has been drafted using the following assumptions to establish start state and provide clear direction for associated lines of development protection the protection afforded by bulldog is modular and can be changed to reflect theatre specific threats the base line assumptions are protection levels are equivalent to warrior bulldog will always deploy with appliqué armour packs the level of protection will be increased with the addition of mounted weapon systems the threat to bulldog is 360 and threedimensional the users tactics standard operating procedures sops level of training and rules of engagement roe are factors that will affect protection bulldog will be able to operate independently not in concert with other arms when deployed on demanding stability operations the physical protection levels afforded will not defeat every threat therefore it is recognised that protection will be afforded through combination of technical means and the use of tactics techniques and procedures ttps electronic counter measures ecm will be fitted to bulldog b mobility the mobility assumptions pertaining to bulldog are due to the retention of the 430 mk2 suspension system the bulldog has reduced tactical cross country mobility compared to warrior bulldog has high levels of operational mobility due to the size and signature of bulldog it has greater trafficability or use in complex urban terrain when compared to warrior currently bulldog lacks credible tactic night driving capability this will be developed with the addition of drivers night sight strategic and operational mobility trials will be conducted to provide clearance and planning guidance for road rail sea and air transport operational and strategic lift c firepower the firepower of bulldog is achieved by the mounting of self defence weapon sdw sdw will be fitted 2 restricted restricted the sdw capability will enable bulldog to operate within the current mech inf brigade role and within the future medium force concept 24 hour surveillance and target acquisition sta will be required with the sdw system d employment bulldog enhances the utility of the mech inf across the spectrum of conflict the primary function of bulldog is to enable dcc due to enhanced protection levels bulldog can be employed in number of additional tasks that include casevac resupply reinforce and exploit the employment of bulldog will be developed through dynamic lessons learned process capacity the capacity of bulldog is based on the original fv430

can carry an eight man inf section in fighting order the vehicle is capable of sustaining the vehicle crew and inf section for 48 hour battlefield mission f posture bulldog provides commanders with an increased range of escalation measures towards specific threats when compared to warrior bulldogs high protection levels but reduced firepower provides an intermediate posture level between warrior and current ppvs snatch and vector g command inform as an vehicle suitably qualified and experienced commander must command bulldog this includes tactical situations when the inf section has dismounted and is operating away from the vehicle h training the training assumptions cover individual and collective training the commander and driver of bulldog must be correctly trained at ratio of 15 personnel per vehicle operational redundancy the mech inf units will require sufficient annual ammunition allocations to conduct individual gunnery live firing iglf mech inf units will require trained fleet managers at pl coy and bn level career structures for bulldog qualified personnel will be reviewed collective training standards will be the same as those for ai bns the armoured

that all users understand the correct stowage locations the effectiveness of the appliqué armour packs will be much reduced if equipment is stowed on or stuffed behind these armour packs j combat service support the combat service support assumptions are bulldog equipped mech inf units will require greater combat service support css resources including materiel lift and fuel resupply than they are currently established to hold equipment support elements ideally require the same levels of protection and mobility if this is not achieved this critical vulnerability will need to be planned for

theatre of operations imminently to support this deployment the threat paragraph in this dn will cover the asymmetric threat associated with current counter insurgency operations in the middle east 16 the operating environment insurgents may include military trained personnel and untrained civilians who are less lethal and arguably more unpredictable the insurgent will favour the environment that offers them the most protection be it urban or rural in either case insurgents will conduct planned and opportunist attacks targeting any soldiers be they combat combat support or combat service

insurgents is varied and unpredictable even the most primitive device can prove lethal but the technical expertise and sophistication of insurgents should not be underestimated and complex multiple devices are not uncommon however analysis of attacks on security forces can reveal trends th at will shape the way bulldog is employed the following should be considered rpgs and small arms sa can be fired from multiple angles upwards downwards sideon headon and from the rear and often simultaneously all round observation mutual support and dismounting for close inprotection and deterrence must be considered b whilst single rpg rounds may have limited effect against bulldog armour the enemys use of coordinated volley fire poses greater threat maintenance of offensive spirit and hence the rapid regaining of the initiative from the attacking enemy is key this will require close coordination between all elements of the unit under attack including dismounts and other vehicles or personnel in the area c sa fire is of little concern to bulldog itself although well directed heavy machine gun hmg poses greater threat bulldogs initial configuration will leave top cover tc10 sentries vulnerable to incoming fire and situational awareness will be critical to mitigate against this threat d improvised explosive devices ieds11 pose high threat as they are difficult to detect and can have significant blast and fragmentation effect commanders and drivers must balance the advantages of remaining openedup to achieve greater observation and situational awareness against their increased vulnerability they must also ensure that ecm equipment is fitted and used properly mines also pose threat as they too are difficult to detect insurgents have been known to hide mines in tyres potholes and other debris left on the road drivers in particular should be briefed on the mine threat and scan accordingly pintel mounted weapons can be used to disrupt the mines but risk collateral damage and the secondary effects of this method are likely to negative more considered approach such as the tasking of appropriate agencies is likely to have better effect f bulldog crews and top cover tc sentries are susceptible to petrol bombs however tc sentries equipped with federal riot guns frgs and commanders and drivers armed with pistols can deter petrol bomb attacks considerations for the employment of tc sentries are covered in annex g one of the greatest threats to bulldog is combination of devices for example an ambush initiated by an ied with covering small arms fire to mitigate this threat commanders must be fully aware of combat indicators see paragraph 17 and have well rehearsed drills to react to such attacks including casevac vehicle recovery and vehicle denial 10 the role of tc sentries is to provide 3600 observation and firepower for offensive and defensive purposes in support of the bulldog commander 6 11 notably remote controlled ieds rcieds command wire ieds

techniques to attack the uk forces commanders should consider the following in the urban environment the insurgent will exploit alleys windows roofs disused buildings ruined structures as cover from view andor fire in opportune or prepared positions b typical ranges of sa and rpg attacks are 50200m hence once an attack has been launched by an insurgent the initiative can be quickly regained by friendly forces through an offensive spirit typically the hard and fast followup into depth through and beyond possible firing points c insurgents may use civilians including children as human shields and dickers12 to move arms and ammunition their intent may be to obstruct engagement and put doubt in the mind of commanders and soldiers d bulldog appliqué armour protects vulnerable areas13 but drivers and commanders must weigh the advantages and disadvantages of operating closeddown versus opened up commanders generally operate headup due to the limitation of bulldog vision blocks this affords better all round observation and situational awareness streets overlooked by highrise buildings provide insurgents with topattack shoots increasing the vulnerability of tc sentries f choke points at the entry and exit to urban areas bridges intersections and narrow streets provide excellent engagement areas for the insurgent 19 combat indicators combat indicators may be the only warning of an imminent attack they can also help distinguish the curious civilian from the insurgent with hostile intent troops must be constantly aware of the absence of the normal andor the presence of the abnormal in the environment around them these indicators may include some of the following presence of heightened sense of anticipation agitation or excitement amongst the civilian population dickers cars flashing headlights to show the position of security forces and to dazzle drivers and commanders controllers on the streets sometimes identifiable by being better dressed and with mobile phones obstructions on roads to canalise movement b absence of crowds at gathering places such as markets or outside municipal buildings normal pattern of life eg children playing in the streets or lack of vehicles during normally busy times 12 person who passes information to insurgents for the purpose of monitoring movement identifying patterns of activity or cueing an attack on security forces 7 13

situational awareness battle procedure cooperation with other arms battle discipline out of contact combat service support tactical employment 21 employment bulldog offers far higher levels of protection and tactical mobility than saxon and its introduction has enhanced the utility of the mech inf significantly modifications that have improved its reliability and availability should enable operational moves that could be achieved with saxon despite bulldog being tracked vehicle due to its strategic and operational mobility in conjunction with its moderate posture bulld og can be considered part of the medium force whilst mech inf bn will still fundamentally fight dismounted its ability to achieve tactical surprise and generate tempo through manoeuvre will be greatly enhanced mech inf is capable of contributing effectively in all types of land tactical activities see table below14 key bulldog not optimised for this type of operation without combined arms augmentation bulldog has utility in this type of operation bulldog is optimised for this type of operation 22 warfighting operations in warfighting operations the mech inf will normally have other forces grouped with it in order to conduct offensive or defensive operations or enabling activities the mech inf can operate in concert with heavy medium and light combat cs and css elements including reconnaissance forces the mech inf force does not have the same firepower as ai and bulldog is 14 figure 18 amended from adp land ops 8 restricted restricted not designed as fighting vehicle but given the correct groupings the mech inf force can provide an attack function for specific operations armour ed and field engineers and air defence forces may also be grouped with the bg it is likely to be supported by

fitter section will deploy to repair or recover the vehicle the reme fitter section vehicle must have the same protection and mobility characteristics as the f echelon vehicles if the mech inf reme fitter sections are not equipped with bulldog reme variant this will expose critical vulnerability the chain of command will need to plan for and mitigated against repair and recovery operations with additional force protection assets and alternative recovery plans beyond platoon level selfrecovery lessons learned process 31 the urgent requirement for bulldog on current operations has meant that the introduction of the capability has not followed the normal equipment acquisition process where all the lines of development lod and system development iss ues are planned funded and managed in

annex to dn 06 bulldog non specific ttps general 1 dismounting and mounting drills both vehicle and dismounts are extremely vulnerable at the moment of dismounting so execution must be rapid1 there is hard and fast rule as to which side of bulldog to debuss in coin operations having dismounted the critical factor is to establish and maintain communications between the dismounts and those manning the vehicles weapons in order to send target information interference from civilian radio users notably taxis and ecm can disrupt communications therefore rehearsals and the structure of the plcoy must allow for linkmen in case radio communications verbal orders or hand signals fail 2 topcover tc tc should be used intelligently commanders must balance the risk to tc sentries with the enhanced protection and surveillance t hey provide tc is most effective at deterring shortrange attacks at low speeds eg grenades petrol bombs short range cwieds and rcieds rpgs and close quarter shoots the deployment of tc sentries should be based on the commanders assessment of the threat the environment and the options for dismounting key points to note are be alert to overhead wires wire cutters should be mounted on vehicles b think deception unpredictable jack in the box techniques are often the best way to deter the threat while minimising risk c do not leave tc up unless there is need for it if the insurgent sees that tc is routine he will target it d tc has little effect when moving at speed tc should not be up when entering or leaving sf bases f coordinate tc with white light at

civili an vehicles pulling in between vehicles when static i avoid setting patterns 4 stowage bulldog is designed to carry sufficient combat supplies and equipment to enable the section to operate for 48 hours without replenishment however in coin operations additional items such as po equipment may need to be carried increasing the overall stowed load individual units should detail stowage plans within sois to achieve commonality between companies points for consideration are availability of foam fire extinguishers to fight fires caused by petrol bombs and armour penetration bcf extinguishers can be used but be aware of the inhalation hazard b stowage of magazines and grenades ensuring easy access c limiting kit stowed in external bins as they are difficult to access and vulnerable stowing mission essential equipment internally d use of fridges or cool boxes for water storage medical pack location and content f the requirement to carry additional medics interpreters and media both routinely and for specific operations g ensuring all equipment is stored securely in case the vehicle is rolled or blown over patrolling 5 general the techniques and principles3 of patrolling described in sect b afm vol 1 pt 9 remain applicable to the use of bulldog in addition the bulldog can deliver troops into and from hostile environment and support with firepower but commanders should remember that armour loses its value as an escalation measure if overused for routine tasks or deterrence 2 the colloquial term for walking down the middle of road 2 3 mutual support deception all round defence communications and deception restricted restricted operations in addition bulldog has the potential to damage civil infrastructure and generally antagonise the civilian population 6 patrol planning the factors below are typical to all patrol planning but are particularly relevant when considering the use of bulldog use of operational analysis oa to identify attack trends time of day locations type of attack oa staff are usually attached to the formation hq b terrain analysis to identify suitable routes choke points vulnerable points building type along routes and possible siting of barricades c deception measures d climatic conditions and what effect these may have on dismounts and drivers when closed down and the associated problems of restricted fields of view manoeuvre support to facilitate obstacle crossing f identification of suitable lyingup positions lups and harbours g assessment of current threat levels to assist in determining the requirement for tc sentries h reserves and their roles i recovery planners should consider the recovery of one or more vehicles in and out of contact 7 patrol posture patrol posture will be dictated by the mission and the threat but remains the decision of the local and patrol commander some of the factors to consider are armour can be used decisively against tactically naive enemy but still needs the protection of dismounts in close urban terrain b there are both advantages and disadvantages of employing tc sentries tc sentries can act as deterrent to potential attackers provide 3600 surveillance and firepower but are vulnerable to blast fragmentation munitions petro l bombs as well as sa fire as enemy firing positions are extremely difficult to identify even with tc sentries deployed mutual support between vehicles is essential the commander on the ground should decide how to use the tc sentries by assessing the prevailing threat and risk of their use c dismounts should walk the vehicle through vps in urban areas in order to dominate the ground better however dependant on the threat vehicles could be driven through vps at speed not least so as to vary the tactics em ployed and hence cause uncertainty in the mind of the enemy in rural areas the requirement to dismount is reduced by the longer and wider fields of viewfire d whilst speed may reduce the chance of being hit by rpg offroute mines and ieds less haste allows for better scanning of the ground ahead and hence more considered move 3 restricted restricted scanning an area through vehicle or weapon sights can be perceived by the local population as provocative commanders and individuals should be aware of this when using weapon sights in particular4 8 patrol techniques bulldog should normally patrol in pairs and multiples using their speed protection firepower and mobility to augment the overall patrol plan and create uncertainty in the mind of the insurgent patrolling in bulldog will be more restricted than foot or lr borne patrols as far as routing is concerned although when multiples are employed more than one route can be used 9 patrol equipment5 the commander will decide on what equipment is to be carried for patrol dependant on the task and environment unit sois should outline that equipment and state how it is to stored in vehicle stressing that all equipment must be secured whilst in transit to reduce casualties during an ied attack or rta it is recommended that vehicles carry the following as minimum vehicle recovery and select emergency ces equipment b medical pack c fire fighting equipment for

10 postpatrol activity patrol reports are essential in order to inform commanders critical information requirements and record events and observations in order to establish the modus operandi of insurgents learning accounts should be initiated in accordance with landso 3207 when appropriate of particular importance to bulldog patrols is the requirement to report strikes on vehicle armour in order to initiate weapon intelligence section wis report it is essential that the wis inspect the strike as soon as possible and gat her as much evidence to assist analysis of the munition and weapon system and its effect deliberate offensive operations 11 the types of deliberate operations that bulldog subunit or battlegroup may undertake could include find fix strike defeat seize deter extract and interdict missions these will usually be part of larger combined arms operation that might also include airborne surveillance and strike 12 company level operation would usually be commanded by the oc from his tac hq operating with another bulldog as protection the company second in command 2ic should control and coordinate the operation from the operations cell however it is important that there are rehearsed alternative command arrangements normally platoon commander assuming command until the 2ic can deploy 4 this only really applies if bull dog is fitted with selfdefence system akin

blocks and vehicle check points vcps play an important role in interdicting insurgent activity as well as complementing other security measures in coin operations again section b to afm vol 1 pt 97 covers the general techniques and procedures for establishing and conducting road blocks and check points further considerations for this type of operation include employment 1 using bulldog as roadblock to prevent vbied 2 deploying bulldog to establish snap vc p away from suspected target to aid deception 3 using bulldog as chicane to slow traffic 4 using dismounts to provide local security

bulldog protection of convoys and the provision of escorts 17 bulldog can be used in conjunction with ot her vehicles including aviation to provide protection to convoys this is likely to be routine acti vity when the threat state is high normally there will be minimum of 2 protection vehicles to scort every 8 convoy v ehicles and convoys may be military andor civilian vehicles inevitably co mmand and control of large convoys and their escorts can be problematic as with any other operation detailed planning and rehearsals for the whole convoy should be conducted 18 in providing protection

teams and providing them with local protection b delivering and reinforcing the cordon c dominating the ground d assisting in the extraction of the detainees andor the find extracting the cordon f provision of qrf combat service support 21 casevac the immediate response to any type of attack should be suppression of the immediate threat by vehicle weapons and dismounts having achieved this and initiated first aid consideration can be given to evacuating casualties drills must be rehearsed for the extraction of personnel from any position in the vehicle the ex traction of an injured driver requires particular consideration whilst evacuation rearwards and out through the backdoor is recommended it is accepted that sometimes this is impossible to ac hieve and the driver must be extracted through his hatch additional points for consideration include extraction of crewmen should be conducted under the protection of other vehicles fig 2 illustrates how this might be achieved however commanders must be prepared to exercise tactical judgment and balance the risk of concentrating bulldog in an actual or potential killing zone with the need for timely casevac b all crew members

exchange point or hls outside the contact zone the availability of armoured vehicles for this purpose must be considered in the planning of both routine and specific operations d heat injury can be

it might be inappropriate to use bulldog to deal with peaceful demonstration or minor disturbances bulldog can be used to breakup large and violent crowd commanders must assess the crowd dynamics and the environment in order to decide their course of action 2 tactics and techniques have been developed to use bulldog on po operations and suggested method is described in detail at annex 3 considerations for bulldog crews conducting po operations include provision of dedicated fire extinguishers for the driver and vehicle commander b actions on weapon being fired from within the crowd c fitting dismounts their personal equipment and po kit inside bulldog d robust method of communicating between vehicles and dismounts is required as personal role radio prr may be drowned out by the noise of the crowd petrol bombs etc use of frg by vehicle crews as permitted by roe f use of warning shots g risk of crushing demonstrators or soldiers when manoeuvring b 1 restricted restricted

section 2 tactical handling of bulldog in po fundamentals 1 level of operation the lowest level of operation in the po environment is the po coy deploying single po platoons should be avoided pls even when equipped with bulldog are vulnerable to encirclement and their lack of numbers may actually encourage the crowd to escalate the level of violence 2 drills all bulldog tactics and techniques used in po should be treated as drills they require considerable amount of rehearsal to be effective 3 operating environment the techniques outlined below are based on the assumption that bulldog is likely to be deployed to po situations where there is high ri sk of attack by small arms as po situations may either be come on for an ambush not just as manifestation of genuine anger on the part of the crowd b judgement will have to be applied by the coy comd to identify the nature of the situation he faces and the appropriate level of force required surveillance of the riot area either by troops in overwatch or from aviation will be cr itical the deployment of bulldog will place both physical and psychological barrier between the troops and the crowd notwithstanding the lethal threat this barrier must not prevent commanders from observing the crowd and adjusting their tactics accordingly 4 use of bulldog bulldog provides significant psychological presence and an effective shield against small arms attack bulldog should be pushed forward of dismounts leading advances in line abreast where the ground allows in order to encourage the crowd to disperse this requires good communication between the chain of command and the vehicles commander and driver as well as considerable driver skill and practice in driving close to crowds b where bulldog is used in conjunction with shield teams the vehicle should usually be pushed to the flanks to provide central area that can either be filled by the more manoeuvrable snatch or kept clear for shield ams to conduct rapid advancesmake arrests 5 balance balance must be struck between maintaining the momentum of the advance through the aggressive use of bulldog and overextending and risking encirclement of isolated callsigns withdrawal or redeployment in particular need to be carefully managed to retain balance tactics and techniques 6 command and control platoon command and control the close quarter nature of po operations the requirement to issue drill commands to shield teams whilst simultaneously coordinating the manoeuvre of vehicles places unusual pressures on command and control at pl level 1 the pl comd dismounts and commands the platoon the pl sgt also dismounts and controls the vehicles in support of the pl comd the pl sgt on the ground will control b 4 restricted restricted rearward movement of the vehicles as bulldog sgts vehicle commanders will be unsighted of troops close to the vehicle 2 prr can be highly effective but multiple radio nets at pl level should be avoided shieldmen should use prr on receive only b company command and control coys require robust command structure that allows for failure of radio communications coy 2i cs should deploy with the company wherever possible employed as rear link to bg hq andor link man to relay commands from the coy comd to pl comds the csm and the bulldog snco should also be used as linkmen to assist with the rapid forward movement of reserve callsigns and traffic control 7 deployment troops in po equipment are highly vulnerable to lethal attack overwatch and the bulldogs in close support must be capable of using lethal force and be deployed before baselines dismount b commander may decide to keep his troops mounted and use the bulldog alone to disperse the crowd however dismounting shield teams in close proximity to the crowd should be avoided if initial attempts to use the bulldog to disperse the crowd fail it will be necessary for those vehicles to push on through the crowd or withdraw to safe area where dismounts can be deployed c any deployment should make maximum use of the protection afforded by bulldog d proposed deployment drill for dismounting troops under cover is shown below 1 the sniper screen moves in and assumes positions of overwatch taking care not to become involved with the crowd once overwatch established lead pls move rapidly to secure debus line and dismount fv 430 mk3s provide cover debus in

20 10 holding line static baseline is extremely vulnerable to grenade or small arms attack containment operations should therefore be avoided where possible however there may be periods when line does have to be held either to protect specified location for period of time or to permit rebalancing in such cases there will be requirement to ensure that aggressive elements of the crowd are not permitted to close with the baseline in all cases overwatch will be required to protect the baseline from lethal attack the following diagrams show drill for maintaining gap between static troops and the crowd overwatch established dominating high ground either side of baseline location pl pushes bulldog to flanks snatch used to fill gap in centre dismounts use vehicles for shelter b if the crowd starts to close pl comd initiates reaction drill pl sgt directs centre vehicles to withdraw once gap available shield lines rapidly advance to push crowd back b 8 restricted restricted c as soon as shield line reaches its stop line it starts to withdraw back behind the vehicles gap then plugged again by vehicles where there is requirement to hold on broad frontage these manoeuvres can be conducted with 2 or even 3 pls up 11 withdrawal reembussing drills need to be practised thoroughly so that troops can embark with their po equipment quickly it is essential that space is cleared by an aggressive shield team rapid advances or vehicle manoeuvre before attempting to mount up b once gap between the crowd and troops is created baton gunners from bulldog team deploy forward to cover those teams embussing into snatch b 9 restricted restricted c as soon as snatch teams are mounted snatch withdraws to position where they can use aggressive manoeuvre to cover the reembussing of bulldog teams the last man to mount the bulldog should be the baton gunner who is being covered by tc armed with sa80a2 andor additional frgs as well as by other vehicles if in position to do so d if the crowd advances bulldog can advance to reassert the gap and permit the snatch to break clean as soon as snatch is clear the bulldog could then reverse back to point when they are clear of the crowd to turn and evacuate to the rv the overwatch screen should be the last element to withdraw again reforming at an rv though this order of march might be affected by the ground and situation b 10
