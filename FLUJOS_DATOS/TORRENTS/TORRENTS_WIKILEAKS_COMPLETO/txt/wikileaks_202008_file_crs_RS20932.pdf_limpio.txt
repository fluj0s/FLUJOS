government and finance division summary this short report describes and analyzes three provisions included in pl 10716 two of the three provisions will likely induce more taxexempt bond financing for public school capital investment through loosening arbitrage bond rules for some issuers and expanding the list of otherwise private facilities that are still eligible for taxexempt financi ng specifically section 421 of pl 10716 modifies rules on arbitrage rebate bonds and sec 422 expands the definition of private activity bonds the third provision lower marginal tax rates section 101 will decrease the demand for taxexempt bonds the total effect of pl 10716 on the taxexempt bond market may be generally higher taxexempt bond interest rates this report will be updated if new information becomes available introduction state and local governments can issue taxexempt government bonds for school construction and other purposes however to maintain taxexempt status the bonds must comply with internal revenue service regulations governing the use and purposes of tax exempt bonds the 2001 tax cut bill pl 10716 had two provisions designed to make it easier for state and local governments to comply with these rules1 this short report provides background information on the two types of bonds affected by the legislation and describes the new taxexempt bond provisions and their likely effects on public school construction and interest rateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20932crs2 2 in 1998 the interest rate difference between highgrade corporate bonds and taxexempt municipals was 141 and the total debt outstanding was 13 trillion source of debt outstanding is the us census census of governments division at the following web site httpwwwcensusgovgovsestimate9800ushtml 3 26 irc section 148abackground individual and corporate investors who buy federally taxexempt state and local government bonds do not have to pay federal income taxes on the interest payments from the issuer this tax exclusion enables the issuers to sell bonds with lower interest rate than if the bonds were taxable rough approximation of the size of the federal subsidy is the difference between the taxable bond interest rate and the taxexempt bond interest rate multiplied by outstanding taxexempt state and local debt according to this calculation the subsidy was about 181 billion in fy19982 however the subsidy to state and local government does not necessarily equate to the federal revenue loss the reason for this is that the federal revenue loss is dependent on the marginal tax bracket of the bondholder for example exempting 100 of interest income for an individual in the 28 brack et costs the federal government 28 for corporation in the 35 bracket it costs the federal government 35 thus the revenue loss changes depending on marginal tax rates generally and indirectly on the income of tax exempt bondholders the joint committee on taxation estimates that the federal revenue loss from exempting interest on state and local government bonds will be 237 billion in fy2001 pl 10716 expanded the subsidy and the federal revenue loss through two provisions the first section 421 modifies the definition of small issuer with regard to arbitrage bonds the second section 422 modifies the definition of what qualifies as taxexempt facility private activity bond following is an explanation of arbitrage bonds and private activity bonds arbitrage bonds bonds are called taxable arbitrage bonds if governmental unit in violation of the arbitrage restrictions in the tax code invests substantial portion of the proceeds to acquire higher yielding investments or to replace funds which were used directly or indirectly to acquire higher yielding investments3 if state and local governments had unlimited capacity to issue debt at low interest rates and use the bond proceeds to buy higheryielding taxable debt instruments state and local governments could substitute arbitrage earnings for general tax revenue congress decided in the late 1960s that such arbitrage activit is unacceptable and that taxexempt bond proceeds must be used as quickly as possible to pay contractors for the construction of capital facilities for which the bonds were issued since it is impossible for bonds to be sold precisely when contractors must be paid for their services the tax law does provide twoyear period for state and local governments to spenddown bond proceeds bond issues that have unspent proceeds in excess of the allowed amounts during this twoyear spenddown schedule must rebate any arbitrage earnings to the us department of the treasuryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20932crs3 4 exempt facility bonds are discussed further on page 4private activity bonds bonds are considered to be for public purpose if they satisfy either of two criteria less than 10 of the proceeds are used directly or indirectly by nongovernmental entity or less than 10 of the bond proceeds are secured directly or indirectly by property used in trade or business bonds that satisfy either of these tests are termed governmental bonds and can be issued without federal limit bonds that fail both of these tests are termed privateactivity bonds because they provide significant benefits to private individuals or businesses in general these projects and facilities are ineligible for taxexempt financ ing however some federally designated facilities and projects that fail the governmental purpose test can qualify for taxexempt financing these bonds are called taxexempt private activity bonds under current law the amount of taxexempt private activity bonds that each state can issue in any one year is limited to the greater of 6250 per resident or 1875 million in 2001 in 2002 the limit increases to the greater of 75 per resident or 225 million beginning in 2003 the limit is adjusted for inflation private activities qualify for tax exempt bond financing if they are in section 141e of the intern revenue code the bonds for those private activities are classified as see table 1 for the volume of bonds for each type of activity exempt facility

facilities 6 solid waste disposal facilities 7 continuedthe large portion of carryforward or unused bond capacity may be misleading many states save bond capacity for large projects that would exceed the annual limit if the project were financed in single year or some states may wish to wait for more favorable market conditions to sell their bonds thus even though it may appear the volume cap is not restricting most states eventually use most of their capacity the amount of abandon capacity was just 6 of total available capacity in 2000 details of taxexempt bond provisions in pl 10716 section 421 additional increase in arbitrage rebate exception for governmental bonds used to finance educational facilities before enactment of pl 10716 excess arbitrage earnings from taxexempt bonds were required to be rebated to the federal government however bonds issued by qualified small governmental units were exempt from arbitrage rebate constraints before enactment of pl 10716 qualified small governmental unit was one that issued less than 10 million of debt per year and at least 5 million of the debt was used for public school construction if the governmental units do not have school construction debt they could have issued up to 5 million and still qualify as small issuer the new law which goes into effect for bonds issued after december 31 2001 increases the limit to 15 million and the school construction portion increases from 5 million to 10 million thus governmental unit with 15 million annual debt issuance at least 10 million of which is for school construction will now qualify as small issuer the newly qualified small issuers will avoid the arbitrage rebate requirement analysis doubling the arbitrage rebate exception for school construction from 5 million will allow more small issuers to bring bond issues to market and increase arbitrage profits in addition because monitoring arbitrage rule compliance can be costly for the issuing government allowing more issuers to sell their bonds without worrying about arbitrage compliance should allow those issuers to sell their bonds at lower interest rate the intent of the arbitrage restrictions is to limit the federal revenue loss resulting from state and local government issuance of taxexempt bonds loosening the arbitrage restrictions exposes the federal gove rnment to potentially greater revenue losses however proponents of the legislation cite the administrative burden the arbitrage restrictions impose on small issuers and the relatively small revenue loss potential presented by small issuers proponents contend that loosening arbitrage restrictions for small issuers and lowering their borrowing costs more than outwei gh the anticipated increase in the federal revenue loss section 422 treatment of qualified public educational facility bonds as exempt facility bonds this provision expands the definition of an exempt facili ty bond to include bonds issued for qualified public educational facilities the qualified public educational facilities are in addition to the existing 12 types of exempt facilities5 exempt facilities are typically large public works such as solid waste disposalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20932crs5 5 continued qualified residential rental projects 8 facilities for the local furnishing of electric energy or gas 9 local district heating or cooling facilities 10 qualified hazardous waste facilities 11 highspeed rail facilities and 12 environmental enhancements of hydroelectric generating facilities 6 section 422b of pl 10716 or 26 usc section 142k1 7 section 422b of pl 10716 or 26 usc section 142k3 8 before enactment of pl 10716 three of the 12 types of exempt facilities were not subject to the cap airports docks and wharves and environmental enhancements of hydroelectric generating facilities fourth highspeed rail facilities is partially exempt from the volume capfacilities and water furnishing facilities which often receive some mix of private investment and public assistance the new bonds for public educational facilities share this partnership feature with existi ng exempt facility bonds qualified public educational facility is defined in the act as any school facility which is part of public elementary school or public secondary school and b owned by private forprofit corporation pursuant to publicprivate partnershi p agreement with state or local educational agency lea6 satisfactory publicprivate partnership agreement is one where the private entity agrees to do one or more of the following construct rehabilitate refurbish or equip school facility at the end of the agreement the private entity must transfer the school facility to the lea for additional consideration school facility is any school building any functionally related and subordinate facility and land with respect to such buildin g including any stadium or other facility primarily used for school events7 this broad definition of school or educational facility allows the proceeds of the bonds to be used for nearly any schoolrelated capital investment including sports stadiums unlike most other exemptfacility bonds bonds issued for qualified educational facilities are not counted against states private activity volume cap however the qualified public educational facility bonds have their own volume capacity limit equal to the greater of 10 multiplied by the state population or 5 million since nearly all states are better off with the 10 per capita limit the potential new debt would have been approximately 28 billion in 2001 based on 2000 population in 2000 exempt facilities subject to the limit consumed 75 of the private activity volume cap or 14 billion see table 18 thus the new public educational facilities bonds could significantly increase the volume of taxexempt debt that falls outside of the capacity limit analysis the expansion of taxexempt bond financing to include public educational facilit ies and creating an independent volume cap will lead to larger loss of federal revenue from taxexempt financing however the loss in federal revenue is not the only consequence of the new law the new law will also induce shift from other investments to those financed with taxexemp t bonds and will lead to an increase in supply of tax exempt bonds generally in addition other components of pl 10716 not directly related to taxexempt bonds will influence the bond markethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20932crs6 taxexempt bonds by their nature and intent shift investment from nontaxfavored activities to those financed with taxfavored bonds in theory investors choose the investment with the highest relative return before the new legislation became law capital investment in public schools owned and operated by private corporations was apparently unattractive relative to other investment options leading to relative underinvestment in public school infrastructure privately owned and operated schools likely borrowed at the taxable rate and perhaps paid an interest rate premium to reflect the greater risk of the private entity defaulting on their bonds some private entities are allowed to issue tax exempt bonds for school construction such as qualified 501c3 organizations these entities will not be directly affected by the new legislation after the new law takes effect some of these private issuers will be able to sell tax exempt bonds investment in the now more attractive public educational facility bonds will likely come at the expense of other types of bond investment options for example if the perceived risk of default is greater for the existing 501c3 bonds than for the new public educational facility bonds which are both taxexem pt investors will shift away from 501c3 bonds to the safer public educational facility bonds more generally the increase in the supply of taxexempt bonds will likely lead to an increase in the interest rate of all taxexempt bonds in markets when the supply of any product increases without change in price suppliers in that market will try to make their product more attractive to the buyer for commodities the price is lowered for bonds the interest rate is increased or the purchase price falls below face value ie the bond sells at discount thus when the supply of bonds increases the interest rate also increases all else equal higher interest rates make debt finance more costly sect ion 101 reduction in income tax rates for individuals finally another component of pl 10716 that affects the taxexempt bond market is the across the board reduction of marginal income tax rates lower marginal income tax rates are expected to reduce the demand for taxexempt bonds because the benefit derived from sheltering income from taxes is not as attractive when marginal income tax rates are lower for example exempting 100 of interest income for an individual in the 28 bracket is worth 28 to the taxpayer if the marginal income tax rate drops to 25 the benefit is worth only 25 analysis the potential drop in demand for taxexempt bonds would likely lead to upward pressure on taxexempt bond interest rates returning to the market example if the demand for any product declines the seller would likely lower prices to make the product more attractive to potential buyers again in the bond market sellers would increase the interest rate to make the bonds more attractive concluding observation in theory the increase in supply and drop in demand for taxexempt bonds induced by pl 10716 will together lead to upward pressure on taxexempt bond interest rates the increase in interest rates may then raise the cost of taxexempt bond financing for state and local governments in general however the cost of financing school construction in particular may decline relatively andor absolutely
