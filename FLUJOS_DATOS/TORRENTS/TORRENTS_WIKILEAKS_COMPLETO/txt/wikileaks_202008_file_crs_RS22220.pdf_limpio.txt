gained during this waiting period ssdi benefits ca nnot be paid it is important to note that this waiting period begins at the onset of the disabling conditi on and is not affected by the date worker applies for ssdi benefits workers are encouraged by the social security administration ssa to apply for benefits at the onset of th eir disability the first month counted as part of the waiting period can be more than 17 months before the month of application and thus retroactive benefits are limited to 12 months from the date of application retroactive benefits section 223 of the act 42 usc 423

86 778 legislative history of the ssdi waiting period waiting period from the onset of disability to eligibility for benefits has been part of the ssdi program from its inception the social security amendments of 1954 pl 83761 made the first provisions for loss of wo rk due to disability and included language that exempted period of disability from being c ounted when determining retirementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22220crs3 5 this measure found in the 1954 amendments is commonly referred to as the disability freeze for more information see edward d berkowitz supporting

ssdi benefits to persons over the age of 50 after sixmonth waiting period th age requirement was removed in 1960 congressional reasoning fo r the waiting period in 1955 the house committee on ways and means report recommending passage of the proposed social security amendments discussed the rationale for sixmonth waiting period between the onset of disability and eligibility for federal benefits this report cited the unique nature of the federal definition of di sability and called its requirement that disabling condition be expected to result in either death or long duration more exacting then the disability definitions commonly used by commercial insurance carriers at the time many of which had their own sixmonth waiting periods in addition th committee felt that the six month waiting period was long enough to permit most temporar conditions to be corrected or to show definite signs of pr obably recovery and would be of sufficient length to make it unpr ofitable for person who can work not to do so6 changes to the ssdi waiting period two significant changes to the original sixmonth waiting period have been passed as part of the creation of the ssdi program the first change the social security am endments of 1960 pl 86778 eliminated the waiting period for disabled workers who were previous ssdi recipients or who had previous disabling condition in the five years prior to the onset of their current disability in order to be exempted from the waiting period the previous disabling condition must have met the statutory definition of disability as provided in title ii of the act in their reports to the house and senate on the 1960 amendments the ways and means and finance committees saw the sixmonth waiting period for those with previous disabilities as possible barrier to return to work efforts stating most disability insurance beneficiaries w ho return to work do so despite severe impairments where disabled person be comes employed without any improvement of his condition more or less slight change in his situation can result in the loss of his job and make him once again eligible for disability insurance benefits other disabled persons whose medical conditi ons may improve sufficiently to require termination of benefits may subsequently grow worse again and become reentitled to benefits new sixmonth qualifying period during which they receive neither earnings nor benefits imposes hardship on them and their families and may be real bar to any further work attempts7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22220crs4 8 us congress house committee on ways and means

provisions of title xiv and title xvi of the act these benefits are administered by th department of health and human servicesthe second change to the ssdi waiting pe riod reduced the waiting period from six to five months as part of the social security amendments of 1972 pl 92603 the intent of this change was to reduce the financial burden on applicants and in its report the committee on ways and means wrote that reducing the waiting period from six months to five months would diminish the financia l hardships faced by those workers who have little or savings or other resources to fall back on during the early months of longterm disability8 the senate finance committee went further than the house and recommended reducing the waiting period to four months9 the ssa is in the process of implementin g several demonstrati on projects that will alter the benefit struct ure of the ssdi program10 however none of these demonstration projects will change the existing fivemonth waiting period between the onset of disability and eligibility for ssdi benefits potential income supports during the fivemonth waiting period supplemental security income title xvi of the act authorizes supplemental security income ssi benefits for individuals that meet the statutory test of disability or are over the age of 65 and who fall below specific income and asset thresholds11 ssi beneficiaries need not have any prior work history or meet the in surance requirements of ssdi and there is waiting period between the onset of disability and eligibility for ssi benefits12 thus ssi can be used by some disabled workers to lessen the economic hardship faced by the lack of earnings nd benefits during the ssdi waiting period ssi benefits are not available to residents of puerto rico

were covered by longterm disability insurance 19 it is estimated that up to 20 of ssdi beneficiaries received payments from private disab ility insurance policies before being eligible for federal benefits20 impact of the fivemonth ssdi waiting period the fivemonth waiting period between the onset of disability and eligibility for ssdi may have negative impact on the income of those seeking to enter the program during this waiting period persons with disab ilities are either not working or earning less than sga in addition they are either not receiving monthly benefits to replace lost wages or are receiving only ssi benefits whic h are usually lower than ssdi benefits one impact that may not be as clear however is the role the waiting period plays in discouraging possible beneficiar ies from applying for benef its this waiting period and its accompanying loss of income lessen the overall generosity of the ssdi benefit one study estimates that eliminating the waiting period would have the same positive effect on the number of ssdi applications as 10 increase in the level of benefits21 legislative activity in the 110th congress three bills have been introduced in the 110th congress that would alter or eliminate the current fivemonth ssdi waiting period hr 69 disability fairness act of 2007 would eliminate the fivemonth waiting period hr 2713 joseph h seall act of 2007 would
