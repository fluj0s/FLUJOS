stravinskas sunshine 8 comments sorry adb this site is longer yours the school isnt yours the school and this site belong to us the students it belongs to the students who are here now i am hijacking this site it is now the leelanau students place to speak our minds the old site adbs site was about fighting subversively to get what you want what we want better system but now this site wont be about fuck the school they made take piss test theyre invading my privacy its not about fuck the school heres how you can piss them off hack its longer about fuck the school look what they did the new site is about news whats going on and how we can fix the problems the new site is by students for students and about students i would like to kick off the new leelanau talk with this update i have been going to leelanau for 2 years now and i am very pleased with the way my education has been shaped and effected by the school that being said there are some issues i want to bring forth these are all issues i have brought up in student council as the senior class representative issue 1 cameras the school i suppose over the summer installed 2 cameras in the kac this is to deter students from misbehaving pulling pranks and most of all having sex in the kac this issue has been talked about at almost every meeting and we are thinking about making petition against these cameras the other issue involving cameras is that another camera has been put out on the beach this is assumed to be about catching smokers one is quite sure who is watching these cameras and who looks at the tapes if there are any tapes at all i have heard that the cameras feed into mr beggs office which has yet to be confirmed please talk about this issue and help raise awareness issue 2 ms sunshines new discipline policy after mr sonnenberg left his role as assistant to residence life and as the disciplinary goto guy he went on to become the schools gym teacher which i am told he enjoys very much the school has put ms smithbell as the new disciplinary leader she remade lot of the policies and her explanation for the new title miss sunshine can be read on her office door the new discipline system is hard to read at best it is even harder to describe but the idea is to come up with individual punishments for different individuals while i believe her heart is in the right place and anything is better than last years system there are huge flaws in this new system for one there is more dorming ms smithbell has told that it makes her feel like she doing the old go to your room which we all went through when we were young the problem is that there are ideas of other punishments that seem to work we have tried giving apologies to the student body at quiet period we have tried snow shoveling the newest idea both of which are deterrent but most students just refuse to do these things i met with ms smithbell today regarding my lack of attendance to first hour class which i will admit is problem and she told she was getting tired of students disrespecting her i would have to agree that some students are being very disrespectful but what she told next was just too much she said that if students continued to miss classes skip classes or not sign in to morning sign in these students would not be asked to come back next semester she also told that some students were already chosen to not come back this is not the leelanau school way and i ask you all to write or talk to her about this new direction i have not had chance to bring this up in student council but i will come the next meeting issue 3 breadcereal bar if you havent noticed the leelanau cafeteria has recently made the decision to remove the bread bar and the cereal bar during lunch and dinner this im told is because certain students are eating straight carbohydrate diet which is extremely unhealthy this goes back to the issue the school has forgive if im being too preachy here of simply removing something when it would be better to educate the problem students and leave everyone else alone theyre using sword were they should be using scalpel if you hadnt guessed who was writing this you probably know now this is an issue i have been on top of since it became an issue i have made the decision to not eat in the cafeteria until the bread bar and cereal bar are brought back as peaceful protest and i invite anyone who wants to help out to do the same i love jims cooking and i hated to miss the thanksgiving feast which im told was amazing but i need to do this for myself and for my fellow classmates those are the issues i can think of right now as more arise i will post them when i can usually weekends at the coffee shop thanks for the new domain adb but this site is ours now contact if you want to get involved in making real difference dan stravinskas senior class rep 09 welcome to the leelanau talk blog november 19th 2008 tags analysis censorship friley leelanau school speech stir comments wow i took the site down for maintenance for few days and in doing so i have caused quite stir i posted note to the site explaining some of my current thoughts misgivings etc about my time at leelanau and the time i have put into leelanau talk there was some good discussion from all sides which leads to why leelanau talk was started in the first place i had two goals when i started leelanau talk the first was to foster an uncensorable discussion about the leelanau school what had happened in the past where it was going and what people should be doing in the meantime my plan was to do this by releasing previously censored speech providing safe place for it and supporting those at leelanau who were under attack for their thoughts and words there is theory across most of the industrialized world that the mere existence of good idea would cause it to perpetuate itself the typical thinking of the hippieera in the 1960s was that by raising consciousness and by spreading ideas we could change the world in the third world its clear that people think about things differently one could spend endless hours debating whether this is because lives are at stake or that these people think about change differently regardless this leads into my second goal of starting leelanau talk which was to promote radical thinking among students and staff support those who thought about the school situation in revolutionary terms and use the evidence i had gathered to support my own arguments i dont mean radical as enforcing an anarchistmarxistetc perspective but radical in the sense that i was asking people to think outside the box of what they took for granted and to attack the roots of the problems they saw through direct action over the past few months i have had lot of time to think about my own philosophy the things i have been doing the things i have been working with and what it all means leelanau talk never became quite what i wanted it to be because i didnt put the energy into it that i had originally planned and because i was disillusioned when i took down the site i put up little note which talked about certain people and the groups those people belonged to i think some people who read this also read into deeper meaning which was that i saw little of myself in all of those groups during my time at leelanau my political ideology was challenged proven correct proven incorrect and changed quite bit i was hardcore communist when i came to leelanau but when i left i had turned into fledgling anarchist they seem the same to most mainstreamers but theyre actually opposite ends of the spectrum i think the main thing that happened to my ideology at leelanau was that it was hardened while this was good for getting through my last year of boarding school it wasnt so great in the real world mr friley said something to towards the end of the year that i think really sums up something important and it went along the lines of black and white decisions are easy to make its the decisions in the grey area that are hard and it is those decisions that ultimately decide our character i absolutely agree and that quote says much more than is originally apparent his words analyze the individual but they also apply to social interactions and systems diversity is what makes us unique challenges are what happens when those diversities meet the results of those challenges are varied and depending on the outcome beautiful doesnt it then make sense that we would want to foster diversity and create safe environments for those challenges to occur yes but thats not what i was doing here at leelanau talk after having put some of my ideas about liberation into action i wanted to help others do the same i got really excited about the prospect of helping organize radical thought on campus being able to finally speak my mind and helping others with their own liberation as often happens to people who are really excited about cause i tried to micromanage everything as people who checked the site regularly can tell you i made lot of comments and also corrected lot of people when i saw them saying something i didnt agree with this was not only beautiful display of my closedmindedness caused by the hardening of my ideology but also of my desire to micromanage everything ideologies are like living things they grow and try new things and explore and sometimes make mistakes by constantly pointing out what i saw as mistakes and trying to guide ideologies i ended up messing up that process you could say the same thing of how people grow up its all process of trying new things challenging yourself and learning from your mistakes this isnt to say that having third party analyze your thoughts about the world isnt helpful but that the best things happen when that third party steps aside and you have an opportunity to do it yourself that being said after having much time to think about my own ideology and its practice i have decided to take new approach to leelanau talk of course the cycle will continue and while down the road ill probably try something different until then ill try to stay out of discussions in the way that id been placing myself in them previously ill still be here to support those on campus who are persecuted for their views whatever they might be ill still write occasional articles keep an eye on the leelanau school and try and bring publicity to the cause and maybe ill finally get around to sending some of those care packages adb the leelanau school caught censoring wikipedia november 16th 2008 tags leelanau odell richard school wikipedia 1486 comments well looks like the leelanau school is at it again silencing its critics this time theyve been editing the schools wikipedia entry how do we know its the leelanau school well because the ip address that made the changes 711368126 is the school webcam try going to http711368126 and see what you get the editor obviously working for the school when confronted about the edits said the leelanau schools headmaster rich odell can answer any questions regarding changes made to this website 2313345800 he gave school president richard odells number out once this persons edits were seen wikipedia editor cleaned them up saying that wikipedia is not marketing pamphlet so what exactly did the school try and remove from the wikipedia entry well quite bit heres all the things they didnt like people knowing about the school 1 the school has had fluctuating enrollment between 60 and roughly 100 the latter being its nominal capacity over the last 20 years during the last few years the school has suffered declining enrollment and resulting increasing encumbrance on its financial structure challenges facing the school include lack of legacy students students whose parents also attended leelanau and severe shortfall in charitable giving 2 in response to these challenges the school has undertaken realignment of its core competency choosing to emphasize learning differences and has boosted tuition levels to in excess of 40000 annually the success of this realignment in stabilizing the schools fiscal status is yet to be determined 3 an organization called the leelanau alumni organization was formed in late 2005 by alumni concerned over the lack of alumni contributions to the school and the potential of closure this organization is independent from the school and intends to serve alumni interests and hopes to facilitate the schools growth as well the school employee also removed links to sites that had negative reviews of the leelanau school and the leelanau alumni organization now i know what the schools going to say about this theyll say that they were cleaning up factual inaccuracies in the entry fair enough lets check the facts number one and two can be confirmed by tax reports released by the leelanau school and available in the download section for number three you dont have to look any farther than the leelanau alumni site the schools wikipedia editor also added quite bit to the wikipedia entry making the page sound more like promotional video than an encyclopedia entry he added too much to list here but heres just sample of his unbaised view of leelanau the leelanau school is the experiencebased fivesenses learning community where students in grades 9 through 12 live and discover together on lake michigans wooded shore we build on each students learning strengths creatively using handson projects and our dramatic natural setting to help students gain fresh new sense of independence engagement and capability beyond textbooks through experience toward college with whole new sense of whats possible the leelanau experience is engaging unique memorable and life changing the leelanau staff carefully assesses the strengths of each student and builds program that pays attention to each individuals educational social physical and emotional development in todays society with all of the pressure for youth to succeed the leelanau experience allows students to significantly improve their confidence and selfesteem luckily there are people on wikipedia who want you to have the facts instead of bunch of promotional hot air unfortunately the school didnt stop at just vandalizing their own page the author continued on editing the page on charles darwin to say that darwin hated with the passion of thousand suns one and only one and that was marie curie because she stole her husbands ideas and won bunch of prizes now how do we know that these edits arent just done by students messing around online simple because when you edit wikipedia from school thats not the ip address that shows up this is one of the external ip addresses from the school staff network ive edited things on wikipedia from school and they dont show up under that ip and i know im not the only person who has edited things i have attached zip file where i saved copies of all of the page edits seeing as to how the leelanau school might see it fit to go delete those off of wikipedia as well see the downloads section to the right for honesty adb 75 bucks for thumbtacks what november 16th 2008 tags johndavis ridiculous thumbtacks 3 comments ok ive been at leelanau for most of my high school career and i love the school it is byfar the best high school i have ever attended that being said there are obvious problems that need to be discussed here and in person thats why i am posting as the site says because we need safe place to speak at the end of the 0708 year i was charged for damage to my walls there wouldnt be anything wrong with that if the reason was different like if there was graffiti like in other rooms or if there was gum or something else like that stuck all over there wasnt the reason i was charged was because according to the bill damage from posters being put on my wall i was charged 75 dollars 75 dollars for hanging posters with thumbtacks thumbtack has point of about 710 mm so what would the damage look like you wouldnt see it if you were not looking for it so the staff member who filled out the form was looking for things to charge with and he found it another problem with them charging 75 dollars is that they cant do anything to fix the damage with that money it goes straight to the bank and who knows where that goes the walls in the dorm were made of wood which would be very expensive to fix and 75 dollars wouldnt cover it i would say that 150 might be start thats 75 dollars from and my roommate but only i was charged only i was charged even though my roommate and i used the exact same thumbtacks the same thumbtacks from the same box i called up our suitemates and neither of them was charged even though they used thumbtacks also why is this big deal because there is obviously bias in this story the staff member who filled out the form has tried to charge for other things despite my repeated maintenance request forms for various other issues and 75 dollars might not seem like much for typical student at leelanau who are mainly high income families but i come from lowermiddle class family and we dont have that kind of money so there it is my first post if you have similar story please post it here i feel that the school discriminates against lower income families more because they have possibility of not returning the favor of good education through monetary means basically youre more likely to be harassed if you wont donate later how to beat the filter november 16th 2008 tags filter fortiguard leelanau school proxies proxy tor 4 comments its unfortunate that this guide ever had to be written that we ever had to use proxies in the first place that anybody ever thought we werent smart enough to decide for ourselves what was right and wrong and that somebody ever thought censorship was good idea unfortunately the world we currently live in has found it acceptable to censor internet access to kids because we arent smart or responsible enough to use it this guide will debunk some popular myths about web filters and show you how to get past them id like to take some time to quickly destroy some arguments that people use to install filters on internet 1 filters only block bad sites this is absolutely not true and anybody who has ever been behind filter can tell you that filters block thousands and thousands of legitimate academic sites while i was at leelanau i ran into multiple sites day that i needed for school some of which i was able to get unblocked 2 filters stop kids from seeing bad content this is also absolutely not true as anybody under the age of 35 can tell you filters are easy to get past and only serve as an inconvenience to people trying to use the internet everybodys definition of bad is different so this isnt really good point to argue on 3 there are places out there on the internet that tell kids how to do bad things we have to stop them well the good thing is that you cant if you really think its good idea to censor the internet then you should also stick to your word and censor mail books and all communications between people we dont do that because its incredibly orwellian and an infringement on numerous human rights for some reason people think the internet is an exception laws that have tried to implement web filtering on national scale such as copa have been shot down by courts as unconstitutional there might be things on the internet that you find offensive in fact there are certainly things you would find offensive if you see something offensive you just move on as if you has heard somebody on the street saying offensive things chances are if you find something offensive your kids will find it offensive too i dont think nazi hate sites are cool either but they have their free speech rights one of the main reason that hate groups are able to flourish is that information is so tightly regulated if people were able to look at different sources and see the facts nobody would be duped into those kinds of beliefs 4 theyre my kids i should be able to control what they see online the problem is that your kids are human beings which means they have human rights these rights include the right to free speech if you wont let them see things theyll go and get those things from friends etc and friends arent always the most reliable source of information if you want your kids to be able to say to those bad things on the internet the best course of action is to show your kids why those things are bad if you cant make an argument to prove this maybe you need to reconsider why you think those things are bad 5 if we dont censor myspace my kids will get abducted by pedophiles again youd have to censor mail telephone calls and conversations if you truly believed that the internet is tool just like the written word or any other tool and it can be used responsibly or irresponsibly kids these days are very aware of the risks of giving out their personally identifiable information thanks to lot of education on this topic so there isnt lot to worry about instead of shutting down the site or making your kids turn blind eye to it have conversation with them about how to protect themselves online and why they shouldnt give out their information 6 isnt the school required by law to put filters on the internet there is law that requires them to do that although installing them does earn the school some fancy tax breaks remember as thomas jefferson said freedom requires eternal vigilance 7 isnt it illegal to give out these proxies isnt it illegal to bypass filters not unless your hacking into the school mainframe and elevating your user account to administrator you can do illegal things with proxies like watching porn before you turn 18 or hacking but proxies arent illegal on their own this is like how you could run over somebody with car illegal or go to the grocery store with your car not illegal 8 the blocklists used by filters are reviewed by humans so theyre 100 accurate ok now think about this if human beings really added all those sites to the filter then theres way they could block even half of the bad content on the internet these filters are mainly created by machines which is why you have thousands of false postitives 9 but kids will use facebookmyspace to harass each other ive seen it happen as long as there are stupid people they will do stupid things during the middle ages we probably harassed people with wax tablets now we do it online or in newspapers or by word of mouth for one if they do it online theres clear record that they did it and its easy to get them in trouble if they whispered it to somebody theres way to prove that so consider internet harassment to be blessing in reality though people can harass others with any tool available at their disposal such as their voice their writing their facebook and even their hand signals facebook clearly isnt the culprit here the culprit is the person doing the harassing 10 if filter wrongly blocks something why dont you just tell the school that can sometimes work as ive gotten dozens of sites unblocked but its an incredible inconvenience this thefilterisperfect assumption doesnt work and ends up leaving your network admin with dizzying list of sites to look at and unblock its much easier to just use proxies doing this also allows the school to build profile of the sites your looking at they already do this through logging and in all reality 99 of it isnt their business it only becomes their business when you break the law on their internet connection peacefire group that distributes proxies for students also has wonderful piece on whey we shouldnt censor kids at school at httppeacefireorginfowhyshtml there are three different types of filters that you will encounter called whitelists blacklists and keyword filters whitelist filters have list of sites that the filter provider school fortiguard etc have determined to be acceptable for you to view by design whitelist filters block the majority of the internet as well as all new sites the leelanau school moved from blacklist filter to whitelist filter in 2007 blacklist filters have list of sites that have been deemed bad these like all filters also block tons of academic sites everything that hasnt been blocked is automatically unblocked keyword filters usually have blacklist in them but they operate by inspecting the pages you view for keywords such as proxy pipe bomb porn etc as i said earlier the school uses whitelist filter which is probably the most restrictive type as anybody who has spent five minutes on the school internet can tell you its almost worthless because of the vast number of sites that it blocks beating the filter web proxies this is probably the most common way to beat filters you visit site such as httpwwwstupidcensorshipcom where you type in the name of the site you want to visit such as httpwwwmyspacecom and then it lets you through these work by obscuring your traffic web surfing so the filter cant see whats going on the web filter thinks youre just connecting to httpwwwstupidcensorshipcom instead of httpwwwmyspacecom these can get blocked meaning you have to find new ones all the time which can be really difficult if all of yours get blocked at once if you use this method its good to have one or two backups in case they block one of yours i suggest you subscribe to the mailing list at httpwwwpeacefireorg which will send you new proxies fairly regularly right to your email httpwwwproxyorg also has fairly exhaustive list of proxies available beating the filter tor this is the best way to beat filters tor is program that has huge list of proxies it can send you through it goes through this list until it finds some that are unblocked and then it send you through them automatically some of these proxies are in other countries so you might end up at the german google but youll get used to that fairly quickly it can also be slow at times but it works 99 of the time you can get tor by going to httpswwwtorprojectorg click on the download tab go down to tor browser bundle and download the latest version run the file you downloaded follow the instructions on screen and youre set you can even install it to flash drive and take it with you its important to remember that using these programs or bypassing the filter is usually violation of your schools computer use policy i dont know anybody at leelanau who has gotten in trouble specifically and only for bypassing the filter but i guess theres first time for everything everybody does it so theyd have to get everybody in trouble how to pass your drug test november 16th 2008 tags drug tests guides howtos print this shit everywhere weed 11 comments the leelanau school has an extremely invasive policy when it comes to drug testing last year they even started to implement drug testing on random basis even to kids who were model students find out how to pass your drug test what causes false positives and your rights when it comes to testing why is drug testing wrong because what you do with your body and what you put into it is your business not anybody elses regardless of what you consented to in your applications it doesnt change the morality of the issue if youre using drugs it doesnt matter what drugs youre using or when youre using them as long as you dont hurt anybody in the process its none of their business drug testing is also wrong because its extremely invasive getting tested can be an embarrassing situation even if youre just taking baseline testing can reveal number of things about you that you dont want revealed such as what medications you take or whether you are having issues peeing on command for somebody who does taking these tests is never fun it can also be embarrassing if you are singled out for drug test if you take pride in staying abstinent it doesnt look good when you get pulled in for test especially when the school doesnt tell you if you pass they dont tell you if you pass only if you fail drug testing is not even used for its proclaimed purposes its mainly used as scare tactic in order to perpetuate culture of fear every time we are subjected to testing it reinforces the idea that we are sujects of the school and that our free will is limited for example drug testing is brought up in situations like quiet period and before prom where administrators threaten kids with drug tests in order to stop kids from doing drugs again their business the school says that theyll be screening more or screening everybody if drug testing were really to detect members of the community who used drugs it would be applied on regular consistent basis as opposed to the haphazard schedule it has been on in the past the school also targets students who skip class or act up for more drug tests than regular this basically subjects students to embarrassing situations when they arent acting perfectly like making them walk down the hall in embarrassing clothes the geneva convention has long outlawed embarrassing prisoners shouldnt we apply the same standards to our students if youre acting up in class asking questions or bringing up controversial topics you might just be singled out for additional testing my question is if your drug use isnt disrupting the learning environment or causing problems why should the school even care in other words if they cant tell why does it matter why drug testing doesnt work drug tests can prove that you used or were in the vicinity of people using drugs but they dont prove when that occurred what if you were around people using drugs on fall or spring break the test assumes you have done drugs while in school and you are punished according to that assumption if youre dealing with drugs like weed whose active chemical thc is fatsoluble you may have used it long time ago thc is stored in fat cells when it is used and if you gain weight after using it then that thc can be stored in your body for months and months if you start losing weight you might just start failing your drug tests drug tests are also subject to numerous false positives false positive is when the drug tester says your urine sample contained drug when it did not here is an incomplete list of things that might cause false positives on your drug test if you fail drug test and can prove you have taken any of these things or can come up with an even semiplausible story bring it up with school administrators thc weed dronabinol marinol ibuprofen advil nuprin motrin excedrin ib etc ketoprofen orudis kt

received baseline testing upon enrollment if student failed baseline test heshe would be subject to random or planned testing from then on as decided by an administrator if student failed test and tested positive for hard drugs such as heroin or unusually high amounts of drugs such as weed you would be subject to forced counseling and put on random screening program the school could also screen people at random or when they were suspected of using drugs ie skipping class acting funny asking questions etc what are my rights as student i am not lawyer but i do know lot of law if youre seriously considering doing something about being forced to be tested then be sure to contact lawyer when you enroll in the leelanau school you agree to be subject to drug testing under certain conditions random if they have reason to believe you have been using drugs etc if you are forced to take tests for reasons not covered by that release you have grounds to take legal action if the school forces you to take drug test through coercion such as physical violence or physically forcing you into the testing room threatening you etc then you have grounds for legal action all the drug testing release form does is insure that you cant sue because they required you to take test for enrollmentgraduation medical decisions are yours to make and the school may not force you to take drug test they can encourage you by subjecting you to dorming suspension etc but they may not use force to make you take one there are certain conditions under which school may refuse you diploma and im not sure if refusing drug test is one of them id need to research that little more if you refuse to take drug test the school cant take any type of legal action against you as patient it is your right or your guardians depending on your age and the situation youre in to refuse any type of medical treatment on any ground if the school punishes you for exercising your rights as patient there might be grounds for legal action also courts and the media tend to be sympathetic to kids when they assert their rights as patients even when it is technically the decision of their parents how long will it stay in my system for occasional healthy users weed will stay in your system for 710 days as for other drugs im not so sure how to pass the condom method if you know you have drug test coming up this is the safest option since the school does not physically watch you pee this works some schools do this however its extremely invasive and many times borders on sexual harassment you didnt agree to let them watch you so they have right to what youll need condom regular nothing fun or good tasting or anything it might mess up the test safety pin some clean urine urine from somebody who hasnt done drugs recently the school cant trace this back to them hand warmers available at minimarts etc something to keep the condom attached to you tape pocket etc 1 find somebody with clean urine have them fill up the condom with urine and tie it off 2 if you have test coming up anything after this second wrap hand warmers around the condom to keep it warm you can also tape it to the inside of your leg but it wont stay quite warm enough and youll have to spend some time warming it up before you give it to the nurse 3 right before the test or whenever possible conceal the condom you can put it in pocket tape it to your leg etc 4 once youre in the bathroom shut the door take out your safety pin and poke the end of the condom letting the urine stream into the sample cup 5 wash off the urine around the cup to make sure you dont get the nurses hands all dirty if they say its too cold say its because you washed it off because you figured they didnt want to get their hands dirty there have been situations where the nurses have refused samples because they were too cold and made students give another one 6 walk away knowing youve passed your drug test if your friend who gave you the urine was honest with you if youll need to pass lots of drug tests this method is bit easier what you need catheter two pairs of boxes rubber tubing needle and thread and some hand warmers 1 cut square piece out of one of the pairs of boxers 2 sew the piece you cut out onto the fly zone ie the area where your penis goes through this makes an area to put the catheter 3 cut rubber tube to few inches and attach it to the end of the catheter 4 fill the catheter with clean urine and put hand warmer next to it in the pouch 5 when you take the test flip the lever and pass how to pass the niacin method warning i am not doctor taking niacin can be dangerous i suggest that you talk to doctor before taking niacin and follow all instructions on the package if you have liver damage history of liver problems in your family diabetes or anything that could make you more likely to experience liver failure do not take niacin taking niacin can be dangerous some people say niacin helps flush you out so youll pass your drug test from what i understand it only helps you pass drug tests if youve been using fatsoluble drugs like weed ive always taken niacin before tests but im not actually sure how much it helps i know it does something because i have noticed that it delays the effect of drugs in this case dramamine for up to eight hours i hear from people who are experienced in faking drug tests that its hit or miss and from others that its surefire youre more likely to pass the test if its been while since you used drugs and everything is out of your bloodstream niacin is available at drug stores meijers and grocery stores its expensive so split the cost with somebody you know if you have liver problems youll want to ask doctor before taking it whatever you do dont buy the flush free niacin its completely worthless taking niacin for extended periods of time or in large amounts can cause liver damage so please be careful when using it remember overdosing on niacin is dangerous duh see this article for more information i hear that you should take one niacin pill at least one hour before your test and then it will last for eight hours supposedly it opens up your capillaries so that more blood can pass through them making the likelihood that thc will end up in your bloodstreamfat higher and the likelihood that it will end up in your urine lower depending on how much water youve had your weight etc you will experience varying levels of sideeffects if youre low on water it will give your skin burningcrawling sensation which is just horrible for this reason and to help dilute your urine drink lots and lots of water before and during the niacin dose it will also make you look flushed blotchy etc to make yourself feel better it can help to take cool shower whatever you do dont itch move around lot or wear lots of clothes as this will only make it worse even better take it naked i swear it helps keep peeing until your test and then hope for the best if anybody has any experience with niacin i would appreciate hearing their stories so i can make this section more accurate how to pass dilution there are several ways to do the dilution method it relies on the principle that the more diluted ie the more water your urine has it is the sample is the less drugs will be present in it method one dilution via external sources sometimes when you take your drug test they will put tablet in the toilet that makes the water blue this totally defeats this method if theres tablet then pee into the toilet and then put the urine from the toilet in your cup you can also fill the sample cup about halfway with water and then fill the rest with your own urine pretty simple make sure that the urine is yellow enough or they might make you take the test again the school has been known to keep kids in the bathroom for over an hour who ran out of urine so be wise method two dilution via drinking drinking lots of water dilutes your urine if you drink tons of water the week leading up to your test but none the day of it wont do much for you you have to be wellhydrated at the time of the test good way to check how hydrated you are if the colour of your urine clear urine indicates you have been drinking lot of water if you drink enough and its been long enough since you took the drugs in question youll pass the test pretty simple how to pass breaking the test if youre really desperate ie you will test positive for high levels of heroin or something along those lines you can botch the test by putting some bleach in it this will show up as an invalid test but it might buy you some time how to pass general tips its often best to combine several techniques to help you pass drug tests for instance dilution and niacin eat well and exercise before your test this will help your body clean itself out especially with fatsolube drugs like weed drink and drink lots this can not be overemphasized if you have test coming up be sure to drink lots and lots of water this helps everything in your body run smoothly which is good for you and helps your body expel toxins and drugs it also dilutes your urine so the drugs in it are less concentrated if you feel like youre getting sick from drinking too much then stop as this might be sign you have had too much its better to drink lots consistently than to binge use common sense when peeing into the sample cup make sure the urine in the sample cup comes from midstream never use the start or the end of your urine stream as your sample as drugs tend to be concentrated in higher amounts there in order to make your urine more yellow take some vitamins in accordance with their labels bvitamins are the ones that give it the most yellow colour but all of them help you cant just put yellow food colouring in some water and call it good the testing facility will notice that the ph is off and say the sample is bad you will also be subject to an interesting array of questions from administrators the thinner and healthier you are the faster drugs will pass through your system people with high metabolisms benefit when it comes to drug tests as you use drug more often you become less and less likely to pass as it takes these drugs longer to get out of your system most of the flushdetox kits available out there dont do anything except mess up your body chemistry they can be dangerous so just stay away from them why publish our secrets because if they stay secrets were fucked some people might read this and ask why were publishing this after all cant the school read this and update their drug testing policies to defeat these measures not really lot of these things cant be defeated unless the school moved up to hair tests which would never work especially considering how costly those are one might ask as emmett grogan demanded of abbie hoffman upon the publication of steal this book whether it has occurred to us that making all these secret methods public knowledge might hurry them into obsolescence in limited cases this might be true though weve made an effort to slant the content so that it wont be quickly outdated when these methods become outdated well then well have to come up with new methods at any rate our answer to this charge is that these skills and the struggle for which they are useful must both be extended to much broader circles or else they are doomed to obsolescence anyway the small group of people who already know this information is too small to make us all pass our drug tests for massive change to be possible everybody who has become victim of drug testing policies must learn how to defeat them in limited cases yes the powers that be will be able to use our advice to prepare themselves for our efforts to contest their control but we hope that this drawback will be outweighed by the ways in which this work can help equip new generations to strike blows for freedom from unexpected directions and in unpredictable ways in short why give away our secrets because if they stay secrets were fucked if you associate yourself with the struggle for better world consider how you can do your part to get these tools into unlikely hands talk without action only sets precedent for more of the same actions themselves can be eloquent on the other hand in ways that words rarely can all the best in all the beautiful dangerous ventures youre involved in already friends may your every dream come true and may you never fail drug test again mr begg caught red handed threatening students november 14th 2008 tags 1 comment update nov 14 2008 this article was changed bit for formattingsearch engine reasons should be easier to read now update leelanau talk sent letter to charter communications asking them to investigate the incident the letter is attached while ago mr patrick begg soon to be president of the leelanau school sent this letter to winston over at the lup during the walkout i brought this up with mr jarvis and he claimed i was making an unfounded accusation heres the original letter i have added bold and italics for emphasis so that this stuff is easier to sift through dear mr pornographer i assume you are pornographer as you are trying to help minors endrun around our content filter here at leelanau which is in place to protect the students from psychologically damaging material your style of pornography is even worse than exploitive picturesit is blatant hate i wonder if you have violated the federal internet child protection acts as it relates to schools we are going to find out anyways sincerely patrick begg technology manager as i said earlier the school said this email was never sent but right here i have the evidence that mr begg did in fact send this and other letters to the lup whenever an email is sent from one server to another record of its travel is attached to it most email programs dont show this by default but they all have some type of way to view it its too big to include it all in this post but you can download it here what i can show you is the part that shows it was actually from patrick begg in bold from pbeggleelanauorg mon 5 mar 2007 103226 0500 received from rimonsafemailnet 1921681368 by tapuzsafemailnet with smlocal smtas 12 mon 5 mar 2007 103301 0500 domainkeystatus notsigned failedgetpolicy xsmtests g00nmpcilb0ar00 received from 711368126staticaldlmichartercom 711368126 helomailleelanauorg in response winston as usual sent thought out and welldocumented response dear mr begg this is the last email we will send you until you agree to enter rational discussion with the leelanau underground press and the student body we are not pornographers and the email you sent us is simple libel the leelanau underground press does not distribute hate pornography or any other content that could be legally deemed harmful to minors we havent violated the laws you stated in case you havent read them we have produced small summary for you 1 schools must filter internet access and block content harmful to minors if they want to receive erate funding harmful to minors is legally defined as 1 the average person applying contemporary community standards would find taken as whole and with respect to minors appeals to prurient interest in nudity sex or excretion and 2 the average person applying contemporary community standards would find depicts describes or represents in patently offensive way with respect to what is suitable for minors ultimate sexual acts normal or perverted actual or simulated sadomasochistic sexual acts or abuse or lewd exhibitions of the genitals pubic area buttocks or postpubertal female breast and 3 reasonable person would find taken as whole lacks serious literary artistic political or scientific value for minors therefore the cipa does not apply to the leelanau underground press in addition the school has chosen to apply for taxbreaks and funding instead of making the ethical choice to abstain from using blocking software similar acts to cipa such as copa have been ruled unconstitutional blockingfiltering software is inherently flawed as numerous reports from it professionals and congressional testimony have shown because 1 blocking software is restriction on free speech and access to it 2 blocking software cant block access to such speech if proxies are used 3 blacklisting is not the solution because new sites will always be on the internet before they are blacklisted 4 blocking software has been shown multiple times to blacklist thousands of legitimate sites since you have taken this opportunity to attack our credibility we will do the same for you the difference between your letter and ours is that ours is backed up by fact and logic whereas yours is not you do not properly administer the school networks website filtering is inconsistent between dorms and areas of the school it took you week to fix the daylight savings bug on the wireless networks and you make false statements about how networks function during quiet period you responded to student complaints about internet speed by saying they were using too much bandwidth and they should lay off the youtube in addition you said blocking sites would be counterproductive so at least you got that right as network administrator you should know how networks function but you obviously dont because of the incompetency you demonstrate in administering the networks and the false statements you make about them in 80211bg wireless ethernet network like the ones at school each users requests are given the same priority for example lets say we have 500kbs of bandwidth if one user requests youtube video and one user requests their email then 250kbs of bandwidth will be given to each user we can take this example and apply it to somewhere like the netgear routers you have situated throughout the school and show that bunch of people downloading videos wont stop internet access to users who are not the issue here is that when an entire dorm is on the internet each users receives about 2kbs of bandwidth on the leelanau website and informational pamphlets the school advertises high speed however this is obviously not the case as users are receiving speeds below the speed of 288k or 56k modem so perhaps you instead of us are violating the laws see false advertising laws perhaps you should consider your words carefully before sending them to us next time and use logic instead of primitive emotional responses to attack us we are willing to engage you and the leelanau school in logical open and rational forum about this issue however you have not given us the opportunity which is why we had to start the lup in the first place sincerely winston smith senior editor soon after the lup sent an email out to staff at the leelanau school as follows dear recipients this is winston smith of the leelanau underground press despite continuing threats pressure and false statements directed at and about us the leelanau underground press is back and fighting you probably want to read it so check out our site at leelanauundergroundorg our comrades have been oppressed for too long and we all know major change is coming are you ready to cope with it or will you ride this bike until the wheels fall off im sure you have plenty of work to do in order to combat this problem so i wont keep you for much longer perhaps you should consider opening rational open and democratic discussion with our constituents so we can stop all this monkey business the revolution is near i can taste it can you fear it winston smith leelanau underground press and despite his horrible defeat earlier mr begg decided to try and counter the lup again like his previous message the same inciminating headers were attached dear leelanau underground i write you not as an employee of the leelanau school but as recipient of your poison email and we all know who you are given the happenings in virginia tech this week i take you seriously as such i feel you have made physical threat against personally i grew up in the inner city and i still remember how we dealt with bastards like you at home and i am acting accordingly you cowardly prick most sincerely patrick begg winston fired back almost immediately with one of his classic logicfilled responses dear patrick begg we said we wouldnt engage you in discussion until you provided the students an ample and righteous platform to speak and we still hold true to that promise however you did respond with leelanau address and your letters seem to represent the opinions of other administrators on our work we find it sickening that you would try and use the tragedy at virginia tech for your own political gain we are an organization that operates legally and find killing innocent civilians to be morally reprehensible despite what you seem to be telling people we have not made any direct or indirect threats against you if you can find some specific statements from the lup or its members we would gladly dispel any misconceptions you have about them please stop the name calling and libelous comments its unprofessional as you have probably noticed copy of this message has been sent to mr odell so that he can deal appropriately with your libelous comments and actions sincerely winston smith senior editor leelanau underground press leelanauundergroundorg mr begg the hypocrite that he is responded with his own threat after criticising the lup for sending one bold added for emphasis dear leelanau underground i write you not as an employee of the leelanau school but as recipient of your poison email and we all know who you are given the happenings in virginia tech this week i take you seriously as such i feel you have made physical threat against personally i grew up in the inner city and i still remember how we dealt with bastards like you at home and i am acting accordingly you cowardly prick most sincerely patrick begg whoah did you see that mr begg threatened to deal with the lup like they used to deal with kids in the inner city perhaps he has some innocent idea here maybe they used to deal with them using nerf guns but to the average person the inner city brings up images of guns violence and curbstomping thank you winston and especially mr begg for giving us all good laugh on serious note the school should really consider whether they want somebody like mr begg to be speaking on their behalf i mean he did break the law by making threats we wont pursue it and winston because of his apparent need for anonymity probably wont either but the school should wink wink mr mcnutt wink the school could also have their internet service terminated for sending mail like this as it is violation of charters terms of service i have attached the original emails with full headers thanks winston for forwarding these on to threats against journalists just another thing to add to leelanaus list of crimes adb ps boarding schools in michigan such as the leelanau school often censor students live dangerously my prefect resignation letter november 14th 2008 tags leelanau school letter prefect 10 comments near the start of third quarter i quietly resigned from my position of prefecture why because i realized that by being prefect i was putting myself above others the school had made it very clear to that i was not to cause any more disturbances or engage in politics so i didnt make big deal out of it or publish the letters while i think i did my duties well i didnt want to be doing them at all i wasnt member of the kindel dorm anymore and it wasnt my right to go around telling people to do their areas especially when other prefects were getting paid to let kids off the hook even before it wasnt my right when i joined the prefecture program part of my goal was to make it more equitable which i think i did by doing areas when the guys in my group did them often doing more than them i hope this set an example for future prefects to ms semanco head of prefecture program mr friley director of resedential life mr sonnenberg kindel head of house from alex bryan i appreciate the opportunity you have given to be prefect this year and for maintaining my status as prefect despite political differences as you know i have given up my life of political activism and i am now only engaging in political activity outside of school i do not believe that i adequately fill the roll as prefect i am writing this letter to tell you that i have decided to give up my status as prefect staring second semester since i left kindel i have quickly become alienated from it and my status as prefect is often confusing to the residents of kindel prefects are meant to be respected members of the dorm community who naturally fall into leadership roles i am longer member of the kindel community and i believe my status as prefect dilutes the programs original intentions students need person who they live with and i just cant bring that to the prefect program i have heard that there will be new prefect installed in algonquin and that joe has been groomed for the position because of the mixture of students placed in this dorm it has become hightension area and i constantly am aware of it due to my rooms proximity to the common area my last action as prefect and therefore informal representative of students is to strongly urge you not to make joe prefect in algonquin i do not think joe would be good prefect because he does not have the respect of the other members of the dorm the main issue i feel and observe is that joe does not give the same respect to other residents that he already expects and would expect more of if he were to be chosen as prefect at the prefect orientation meeting this year we were told that things would be different and they have the prefect title carries weight among students and longer means somebody who can get away with things because they played their cards right the previous year i was also told at the meeting that prefects were not to be administrators pets the community watch or anything along those lines but rather members of the community that naturally fell into leadership roles whom other dorm residents respected by setting good examples students would start to look up to prefects and take on leadership roles as well to joe would be that extension of the staff that many prefecture programs in other schools have i believe the community member model is much more effective and helps foster bonds between dorm members these bonds lead to working collaboratively and mutual respect other students may tell different story to you and i hope that you will listen to everybodys views and make the best decision possible i do not know who to suggest for prefecture or even if algonquin needs prefect however i do believe that algonquin needs dorm meetings for algonquinonly issues if prefect is to be chosen for algonquin then i believe john wilt is good candidate he has the respect of the other members of the dorm because of the way he treats them and handles dorm life i do not know how well he does with leadership roles or if he is interested in the position that is for you to evaluate i hope this letter has come soon enough for you to find replacement for and that prefecture continues to represent what it has represented this year to myself and other students this year i am willing to sit down and discuss things with you individually or as group if need be sincerely alex after i sent the letter not single word was spoken to about the prefecture program prefects get away with hell of lot so its good position to be in but its not right to make others do work against their will
