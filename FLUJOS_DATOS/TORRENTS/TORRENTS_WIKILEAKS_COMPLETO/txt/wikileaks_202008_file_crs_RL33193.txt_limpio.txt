expression in public schools 7 free exercise cases 8 the law of church and state opinions of judge samuel alito establishment clause cases the establishment clause1 cases before the third circuit for which judge alito wrote opinions primarily address two areas the public display of religious symbols and religious expression in public schools in addressing each of these areas judge alito appears to have consistently applied supreme court precedent public display of religious symbols the supreme court addressed the issue of public holiday displays in two separate cases in the 1980s in lynch v donnelly the court applying the lemon test2 held that citys holiday display did not violate the establishment clause3 the display in question located in park owned by nonprofit organization in the heart of the shopping district was erected by the city and included santa claus house reindeer pulling santas sleigh candystriped poles christmas tree carolers cutout figures representing such characters as clown an elephant and teddy bear hundreds of colored lights large banner that read seasons greetings and creche or nativity scene4 the court concluded that the city had not impermissibly advanced religion by erecting the display and including the creche had not created excessive entanglement between religion and government5 in later case county of allegheny v american civil liberties union the court did strike down the display of creche in city and county owned building finding because it was located in prominent position on the grand staircase of the building and was not included in larger display reasonable observer would likely infer that it 1 the first amendment to the united states constitution reads as follows congress shall make law respecting an establishment of

grievances us const amd 1 the first clause is often referred to as the establishment clause and has been interpreted by the supreme court to generally prohibit what may be deemed governmental

the display of menorah and christmas tree with sign saluting liberty outside the building noting that these display items had secular as well as religious significance and could not therefore be construed as endorsing either religion7 in 1999 judge alito writing for the third circuit held that jersey city holiday display was indistinguishable in any constitutionally significant respect from the displays upheld by the supreme court in lynch and allegheny8 judge alito noted that the jersey city display resembled the display upheld in lynch in several important respects among them the inclusion of religious and secular symbols and secular signs or banners9 the only notable difference in the two displays was that the display upheld in lynch was on private property while the jersey city display was on public land judge alito found that the supreme court did not attribute constitutional significance to the fact that the display in lynch was on private property therefore the fact that the jersey city display was on public land does not in itself provide valid basis for holding the display to be unconstitutional10 similar case before the court two years later was vacated and remanded after judge alito writing for the court found that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the display11 the opinion did not address the merits of the case religious expression in public schools with respect to religious expression in public schools the supreme court has addressed number of specific scenarios without addressing the issue in broader terms consistently stating that these types of cases are very fact specific judge alitos written opinion in this area concerned the distribution of materials from religiousbased organization by the school along with materials from nonreligious organizations the supreme court has not addressed this issue specifically but has held that students have legal right to meet together in school facilities for religious purposes on the same basis as they may meet together for other noncurricular purposes12 and that outside religious groups cannot be discriminated against in the afterschool use of school facilities where 6 429 us 573

104 107 justice oconnor did cite the location of one display invalidated in the allegheny case as being of some significance but distinguished that display located inside the courthouse on the grand staircase from the constitutionally valid display outside the courthouse on the basis of the content of the display rather than the location see also van orden v perry 125 s ct 2854 2005 mccreary

westside community schools v mergens 496 us 226 1990 crs3 the school allows such facilities be used by outside groups13 in rosenberger v rector and visitors of the university of virginia the court addressed another issue regarding student religious speech namely the constitutionality of excluding student religious publication from college program subsidizing the printing costs of all other student publications the court held that the exclusion of the student religious publication from the subsidy program amounted to viewpoint discrimination in violation of the free speech clause of the first amendment14 the court also found that including the religious publication would not violate the establishment clause15 in 2004 judge alito writing for the third circuit issued an opinion rejecting school districts argument that it prohibited religiousbased organization from distributing written materials at the school due to concerns about violating the establishment clause16 judge alito rejected the school districts contention that the materials being distributed would be considered school or government speech noting that the supreme court in rosenberger held that when school or other government body facilitates the expression of diversity of views from private speakers the resulting expression is private17 judge alito noted that while the supreme court has not settled the question whether concern about possible establishment clause violation can justify viewpoint discrimination the court has rejected the position that the establishment clause even justifies much less requires refusal to extend free speech rights to religious speakers who participate in broadreaching government programs neutral in design18 judge alito also applied supreme court precedent regarding the endorsement test favored by justice oconnor the lemon test used in number of establishment clause cases and the coercion test favored in cases involving prayer in public schools19 under all of these tests judge alito determined that allowing the organizations flyers to be distributed by the school would not violate the establishment clause 13 see lambs chapel v center moriches union free

opinions generally address religious exemptions to generally applicable laws when other exemptions are provided as with the establishment clause cases judge alito appears to consistently apply supreme court precedent in this area in employment division v smith21 the supreme court held that the free exercise clause was not violated when state denied unemployment benefits to person who for religious reasons violated state ban on use of the drug peyote22 the court held that the clause was not violated when the burden placed on religious practice was not the governments objective but an incidental effect of neutral and generally applicable law23 the court stated that the mere possession of religious convictions which contradict the relevant concerns of political society does not relieve the citizen from the discharge of political responsibilities24 thus the court concluded such general laws will not be subject to strict scrutiny under the free exercise clause25 however in so doing the court did not overrule prior precedent regarding the applicability of strict scrutiny analysis in other types of case26 after smith there are three types of cases where the court still requires compelling interest government actions that intentionally discriminate against religion denials of unemployment compensation to persons who lost their job due to conflict between their faith and requirements of their job and in hybrid cases where free exercise claim is joined with another constitutional claim27 the court expanded on this application of presmith precedent in church of lukumi babalu aye v city of hialeah where it invalidated city ordinance that specifically targeted certain 20 see supra n 1 the second clause of the first amendment to the united states constitution is often referred to as the free exercise clause and has been interpreted by the supreme court to secure religious liberty in the individual by prohibiting any invasions there by civil authority by prohibiting the misuse of secular governmental programs to impede the observance of one or all religions or to discriminate invidiously between religions even though the burden may be characterized as being only

reiterated that compelling interest is required where laws fail to satisfy the smith requirements of neutrality and general applicability29 in 1999 the third circuit considered case regarding the constitutionality of newark police department policy prohibiting the wearing of beards by police officers absent medical condition that makes shaving painful30 judge alito writing for the court found that the policy violated the free exercise clause of the first amendment because while the department made exemptions for medical reasons it did not provide justification for refusing to provide exemptions for religious reasons31 in his opinion judge alito discussed the supreme courts decisions in smith and lukumi and determined that the departments refusal to make religious exemptions should be reviewed under strict scrutiny32 judge alito cited passage from lukumi where the court stated that in circumstances in which individualized exemptions from general requirement are available the government may not refuse to extend that system to cases of religious hardship without compelling reason33 the department argued that it had to allow medical exemptions under the americans with disabilities act but contended that religious exemptions were not required by law judge alito rejected this position noting that title vii34 imposed on employers duty to accommodate religious practices and found that the department failed to offer any interest in defense of its policy that is able to withstand any form of heightened scrutiny35 in 2004 judge alito wrote another opinion regarding religious exemptions from generally applicable laws in blackhawk v commonwealth of pennsylvania judge alito agreed with lower federal court in finding that blackhawks free exercise rights were violated when the commonwealth of pennsylvania refused to exempt religiously motivated activities from the permit fee required by law to keep wildlife in captivity36 judge alito determined that since the commonwealth provided exemptions for certain 28 508 us 520 1993 29 508 us at 531532 30 fraternal order of police v city of newark 170 f3d 359 3rd cir 1999 31 170 f3d at 360 32 id at 364 33 id citing lukumi 508 us at 53738 34 title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 provides that it shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer 1 to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation terms conditions or privileges of employment because of such individuals race color religion sex or national origin or 2 to limit segregate or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee because of such individuals race color religion sex or national origin 42 usc 2000e2 35 id at 366 36 381 f3d 202 3rd cir 2004 crs6 nonreligious activities its refusal to provide an exemption for religious activities involving wild animals would be subject to strict scrutiny analysis the commonwealth offered as justification an interest in reducing the number of wild animals held in captivity arguing that keeping such animals captive is inconsistent with state wildlife policy unless doing so provides tangible benefit for the states wild animals37 the court rejected this justification finding that the commonwealth had failed to define what constituted tangible benefit and thus determined that the commonwealth failed to provide sufficiently compelling justification for its refusal38 judge alito writing for the court determined that even if the commonwealths asserted interests were compelling the fee scheme was not narrowly tailored to further those interests since the policy in place does not categorically disfavor the keeping of wild animals in captivity39 opinions joined by judge alito the third circuit considered several other cases regarding the religion clauses of the first amendment while judge alito was on the bench these cases are briefly summarized below judge alito joined the majoritys opinion unless otherwise noted none of the opinions discussed below was written by judge alito and for that reason may not accurately reflect his analysis of the issue before the court rights of institutionalized persons in dehart v horn the third circuit reversed the district courts granting of summary judgment for the pennsylvania state correctional institute in case involving an inmates claim that his free exercise rights had been violated by the institutes failure to provide him with vegetarian diet40 in so doing the third circuit used the supreme courts turner analysis to determine that the plaintiff could have cognizable constitutional claim and remanded the case for further proceedings41 the third circuit again reversed the district courts grant of summary judgment in case regarding the burden of proof an inmate must overcome when alleging that prison officials have retaliated against him for exercising his constitutional rights in rauser v horn the court determined that reasonable jury could determine that rausers protected conduct was motivating factor in the department of corrections decision to 37 381 f3d at 210 38 id 39 381 f3d at 210 214 40 227 f3d 47 3rd cir 2000 41 id at 51 60 in turner v safley the supreme court articulated the standard for reviewing prison regulation challenged on constitutional grounds and requires the reviewing court to balance the inmates constitutional claims with the administrative and security concerns of the prison see 482 us 78 1987 crs7 transfer him cut his wages and deny him parole and remanded the case for further proceedings42 the district courts grant of summary judgment was upheld in subsequent case addressing prison restrictions on the wearing of certain religious apparel in ashbey v fauntleroy the third circuit in per curiam opinion held that the prisons restrictions were reasonably related to legitimate penological interests and did not impose substantial burden on religious exercise43 in nelson v horn the third circuit in per curiam opinion vacated the district courts dismissal of an inmates retaliation and free exercise claims44 the court found that nelson should be allowed to go forward with his claims which were based on the parole boards requirement that he participate in religiousbased drug treatment program and subsequent denial of his parole when he refused to participate in such program religious expression in public schools in case involving the equal access act45 the third circuit found that the defendant board of education violated the act by refusing to certify the plaintiffs bible club as student organization and accord it equal treatment with other student groups46 the court found that east brunswick failed to close its limited open forum which it had created by allowing noncurriculum related student groups to meet on school premises since the school created such forum it could not discriminate against clubs based on the religious content of the speech at their meetings and was therefore required to recognize the plaintiffs bible club and accord it equal treatment47 in american civil liberties union of new jersey v black horse pike regional board of education the third circuit invalidated policy adopted by the board that allowed vote of the senior class to determine if prayer will be included in high school graduation ceremonies as violative of the establishment clause of the first amendment48 judge alito joined the dissent authored by judge mansmann which argued that the 42 241 f3d 330 334 3rd cir 2001 43 27 fed appx 135 3rd cir 2002 44 138 fed appx 411 3rd cir 2005 45 20 usc

based on the religious or other contentbased nature of the speech at their proposed meetings public secondary school has limited open forum whenever such school grants an offering to or opportunity for one or more noncurriculum related student groups to meet on school premises during noninstructional time 46 pope v east brunswick board of education 12 f3d 1244 3rd cir 1993 47 12 f3d at 1251 1253

establishment clause claims should have been examined in conjunction with the free exercise clause49 judge mansmanns dissent argued that the graduates free exercise and free speech rights should be balanced against any compelling state interest which might otherwise justify impinging these guarantees50 based upon this argument mansmann found that the free exercise and free expression rights of the graduating class must prevail51 free exercise cases in abundant life ministries v borough of mahaffey the third circuit reversed the district courts grant of summary judgment in favor of the borough on the plaintiffs free exercise claims52 the plaintiff argued that the borough violated its free exercise rights by intentionally impeding access to its tent revival meetings the court determined that the district court improperly granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants by focusing on the wrong issue specifically the court did not consider whether there was sufficient evidence to create material issue of fact regarding whether the defendants intentionally impeded the plaintiffs religious activity53 in an employment discrimination case the third circuit upheld the decision of the district court regarding whether state hospital had reasonably accommodated the religious beliefs and practices of staff nurse54 the nurse refused to participate in any procedure which she perceived to directly or indirectly end the life of fetus and was terminated after refusing to participate in two such procedures the court found that the hospital had attempted to accommodate the nurses religious beliefs and that her refusal to cooperate in the hospitals attempt was unjustified55 the court also rejected the nurses free exercise and viewpoint discrimination claims56 49 84 f3d
