eight separate occasions has established commission to develop suitable plans for celebrating the centennial or other major anniversary of the birth of an american president or first lady the statutory responsibilities membership and funding of these commemorative commissions have varied significantly reflecting both the wishes of congress as expressed in the commissions legislative charters and the vast differences which distinguished the men and woman being honored on two other occasions congress established special joint committee on arrangements to coordinate events planned in congress to commemorate the centennial of the birth of president with those being arranged by nongovernmental committees for one commemoration congress adopted neither of these approaches but instead directed executive agencies to organize and coordinate the appropriate activities at the honorees birthplace1 and provided grants to an existing institution named in his memory2 this approach is beyond the scope of the present survey the membership of statutory commemorative commissions has included mix of members of congress occupants of specified positions ex officio and private citizens members of congress are usually selected by the leadership of both partieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30980crs2 or because of position they hold on pertinent committees the ex officio positions have included congressional leaders government officials and officers of private institutions in some instances the enabling act called for the private citizens to be appointed by congressional leaders in other cases by the president and sometimes by both also there has on occasion been requirement that the private citizens appointed exhibit particular qualifications or experience funding for commemorative commissions as well as their statutory objectives and organizational structure have varied widely it is clear from an examination of the final reports of the commemorative commissions that substantial preparation organization commitment and reasonable amount of lead time are required to bring to fruition the level of commemoration envisioned and allow for the congressional intent to be fully realized the accomplishments of these commemorative commissions and joint committees are as diverse as the individuals being honored prominent among the activities and events planned organized coordinated encouraged and supported by these commissions and committees have been acquiring and preserving artifacts addresses conferences and symposia both in the united states and abroad

american history congressional recognition of the contributions of the nations presidents has also been expressed through broad range of commemorative legislation these statutory gestures have embraced historic sites such as birthplaces homes burial plots and locations of special significance libraries memorials and monuments numismatic issues and special commemorative commissions basic to each of these actions has been desire to develop greater appreciation among the american people of the efforts of those being honored today many of the commemorative enactments honoring former presidents continue as permanent and tangible reminders of another time and era much of the work of commemorative commissions and special joint committees on commemorative arrangements is on the other hand often recorded only in report to congress or in the congressio nal record and frequently retains only nostalgic value for the participants at the time of their occurrence the purpose of this report is to capture at least the essence of the work of these commemorative bodies during the past half century it provides an overview of each commissions or committees membership funding objectives

deal of preparatory work had already been completed by conrad l wirth director of the national park service who served as the commissions executive officer and the staff of the park service much of this work was done by the park services branch of history headed by herbert kahler its chief historian the commissions organization was completed during its early meetings the first of which took place in may 1955 number of special committees were appointed by the chairman to explore certain specific areas of possible commission activity the most important organizational step however was the establishment of an executive committee since the members of the commission were also heavily engaged in their regular pursuits and many of them lived at distance from washington the seat of the commissions headquarte rs it became clear quite early that it would not be practicable to call frequent meetings of the full membership7 to facilitate the commissions work the chairman was accordingly authorized to appoint small committee of general competence that could meet frequently consider numerous policy questions and act promptly on behalf of the commission this group while it in sense superseded the commission as wholeindeed all commission members were invited to attend its sessions and its actions were fully reported to the parent bodyserved as the active and continuous policy arm of the commission8 from the summer of 1955 until early in 1957 the executive committee met once month in washington to plan the broad outlines of the commissions activities professional staff for most of the commissions life the staff consisted of two employees edmund c gass the secretary of the commission and an office secretary periodically when it was deemed necessary clerktypist and writer were also retained given the difficulty in finding competent persons who were willing to sever their established ties in order to work for an agency with relatively short life the commission entrusted its public relations work to the firm of edward k moss9 projects and activities quite early the commission decided against placing major emphasis on directly planning and producing its own commemorative

theirs as the only organization with sufficient authority and prestige to give the centennial year an official character of national scope the commission considered its primary responsibility was to enable all americans to have part in the centennial to achieve this end the commission concentrated most of its energies and resources on 1 seeking to enlist the active participation of the entire nation in the various wilson centennial celebrations and 2 working closely with the organizations and groups responsible for these activities10 commission publications the principal publications used by the commission to reach the general public and stimulate participation were an illustrated handbook of information and suggestions and woodrow wilson centennial newsletter during the course of the centennial year the commission issued 28 news releases to some 5000 publications in december 1956 the commission encouraged more than 200 major newspapers to carry editorials commemorating wilson on december 28 the centennial of his birth approximately 90 of the newspapers solicited responded favorably11 role as coordinator of centennial activities nationwide specific projects successfully undertak by the commission resulted in the issuance of woodrow wilson commemorative stamp12 legislation designating the woodrow wilson bridge as physical memorial to the late president13 nationwide

encouraged the mayors of all cities having population of 5000 or more to appoint committees to plan and coordinate activities in their localities and sent letters to the officers and leaders of citizens groups at both the local and national level encouraging them to participate in these activities similar letters were also sent to state and local school administrators religious organizations

ceremonies at the washington national cathedral on february 3 and november 11 195616 major research project one of the commissions most important enterprises had nothing to do with centennial ceremonies and celebration programs but was considered by the commission to have unique commemorative value far beyond the centennial year this was its work looking toward the preparation of comprehensive and scholarly edition of woodrow wilsons writings including his letters although the commission never planned to edit or publish the wilson papers its members were eager to encourage such project when an initial study made by the secretary clearly demonstrated the need for it 17 to achieve this end the commission authorized survey of nearly 90 libraries and other depositories known or thought to contain wilson manuscripts once the survey was completed copies of report summarizing the results were distributed to those scholars and organizations that were keenly interested in the survey as one of its last official acts the commission requested the woodrow wilson foundation to further this phase of its work and the foundations board of directors generously agreed to do so18 assistance in the preparation of the greatness of woodrow wilson 18561956 included among the various cooperative activities of the commission was an interested support of mrs elm bowles alsops

both in the united states and abroad was twofold to strengthen the american people in the struggle for the survival of freedom in the world by lifting the vision of the responsibilities and the challenge of citizenship in republic to the level on which theodore roosevelt worked and fought and to give the free world in the form of theodore roosevelts simple and easily comprehensible code of

part of the commissions preparations for the centennial during the next 12 months focused on encouraging participation by the library of congress and number of executive agencies the state department department of defense department of the interior united states information agency and national archives each planned special programs for the centennial and the post office department issued suitable

between key bridge and memorial bridge to see theodore roosevelt island officially dedicated under the glare of the nations biggest fourth of july fireworks display38 other centennial celebrations were held in san francisco and new bedford massachusetts and in virtually every state in the union washington dc alaska hawaii guam and the panama canal zone each developed its own program depending on the federal commission mainly for printed material which the staff prepared and sent on request in kits of dozen pieces or more each39 state proved more enthusiastic or more thorough than north dakota the state in which roosevelt grew to manhood while multiplicity of centennial activities was also held in new york state where the late president had been born commemorative activities abroad the centennial was also observed in 25 foreign countries the cuban government issued two commemorative stamps great britain marked the centennial with special lectures at oxford and cambridge

theodore roosevelt memorial park at medora north dakota41 the commission was unable to gain final approval for the development of theodore roosevelt island the park service in 1958 actually had funds available to prepare the ground for the erection of the memorial structure that was proposed by the theodore roosevelt association adopted by the commission and approved by the national park service the national commission of fine arts and the national capital planning commission congress however failed to approve legislation that would have authorized the secretary of interior to erect the

objectives were set to stimulate lincoln observances throughout the year by public and private bodies at home and abroad if possible to encourage and to itself undertake contributions of lasting value

historical societies national civic fraternal educational religious and media groups trade associations labor unions the press and the broadcasting media motion pictures clubs societies business and industry associations and interested individuals throughout the country53 commission publications at one of its first meetings the commission adopted the thematic slogan lincoln symbol of the free man

important dates in lincolns life brief biographical sketch in lincolns own handwriting list of special commission projects famous lincoln quotations and selected bibliography another booklet the lincoln ideals through the use of lincolns own words provided an insight into his personality and life third major publication of the commission was its official newsletter the lincoln sesquicentennial intelligencer 54 role as coordinator of sesquicentennial activities nationwide through consultation with the us office of education and the national education association and its many affiliated groups the commission also was able to create program for participation in the sesquicentennial observance by americas youth55 one of the most gratifying developments of the sesquicentennial year was the enthusiasm and sentiment with which state historical societies devoted themselves to the observance and the additional establishment of state lincoln sesquicentennial commissions56 in many states governors issued special proclamations to which additional proclamations were added by local mayors additional support was provided by number of individual government agencies within each state as well as several state boards of education although kentucky where lincoln was born indiana where he grew up and illinois where he spent his adult life were the first to plan extensive commemorative programs numerous other states followed suit celebrations commemorative programs and other sesquicentennial activities held throughout the country were legion57

religious womens youth media club society business and industry association or other organizations of national scope in some way took note of the sesquicentennial and joined in honoring the memory of abraham lincoln58 by securing the cooperation of the national association of broadcasters and national advertising council and networks the commission was able to gain the support of practically every radio and television station in the united states news accounts of the sesquice ntennial were widely reported and special programs commem orating lincoln were carried on all major networks and on hundreds of independent stations59 also the commission was able to secure the cooperation of the newspaper and magazine publications to an extraordinary degree press coverage of both national and

important resulted from its desire to accomplish some scholarly and important project that would be of lasting value and endure over the years as an aid to scholars and researchers working in the lincoln field after considerable discussion of various projects that might be undertaken and consultation with lincoln scholars the commission determined that the greatest contribution could be made by providing for one largely scholarly projecta daybyday chronology of the life of abraham lincolnwhich would serve as major historical guide to researchers writers and lincoln scholars62 the last of
