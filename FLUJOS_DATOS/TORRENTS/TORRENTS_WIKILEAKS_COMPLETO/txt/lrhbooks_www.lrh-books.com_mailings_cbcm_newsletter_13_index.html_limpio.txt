clear body clear mind newsletter date program used by over 250000 to think clearly we were at breaking point and were considering having him sent to prison before he hurt himself four years ago robert came home from marine training very quiet and withdrawn with interest in work or play normal drive to find his way in the world he seemed to become worse by the week very listless and depressed being very naive i never thought drugs to be the problem after many visits to doctors and clinics the doctors settled on prescribing the mindbending drug ritalin to improve his way of thinking this drug being federally controlled was supposed to help him in getting started on normal way of thinking and doing things other normal people do robert became addicted to this drug to the extent of hundreds of pills each week even though the drug was supposedly controlled unscrupulous doctors prescribed the medication he became legal dope addict in my state of mind i called up these doctors and threatened legal action but robert would just find another doctor who was anxious to make fast dollar and get more medication he became so hard to live with and so mean that he would steal from us and lie to and threaten his mother i finally had him arrested for grand theft just to get him out of the house and in the hope of shocking him into reality the judge let him out on probation and he went on taking ritalin we were at breaking point and were considering having him sent to prison before he hurt himself or i hurt him god forbid i was watching television one morning and saw two young men

someone again i was scared as i realized that i was not the same person i had been before drugs i was not as sharp my mind was fog i was bitter and untrusting if there was one part of my life that i wanted to change it was the fact that i had done drugs there was not day that went by that i did not worry about this this only heightened my despair as i knew that i couldnt turn back time even after quitting drugs entirely i remained aware of the fact that i was not the same person that i had been before the guilt bitterness and sorrow was staggering then i did l ron hubbards program i have now handled the effects of drugs that i had taken i got my energy back and i am longer walking around in fog i can think clearly and my mind is quick and decisive again i have my drive back and im part of

brought out of it as well as oriented to my present environment by the program it really undercut everything i mean these were such very simple actions to do but powerful insofar as the results and gains i had both objectively and subjectively the program has changed my life my physical wellbeing and my attitude towards much better existence of survival i longer have to look over my shoulder for the enemy which wasnt there or walk carefully through any grassy areas looking for land mines which dont exist so that i can live another day it has opened door for mea door through which i can

introverted sometimes with disastrous results in my work so despite the marked improvement in my life overall i was still suffering from many of the manifestations of someone on drugs although i had stopped using them at this point l ron hubbard released the program within few weeks i started it while i was on the program i experienced many sensations such as nausea headaches and dizziness i

stop and go to bed i was convinced i was physically ill this went on for three days and i just stuck it outthe best thing to do when drug is coming out of the system while on the program i recalled
