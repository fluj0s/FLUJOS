in lending act tila to provide new consumer protections for certain high cost loans basically the law defines high cost loan as loan secured by the principal residence of the borrower but which is not used for the purchase of the residence and which meets one of the following conditions 1 the annual percentage rate on the loan exceeds the rate on comparable treasury securities by more than 10 percentage points or 2 the total points and fees paid by the borrower at or before loan closing exceed the greater of 465 or 8 of the total loan amount current law does not prohibit high interest rates and high fees but the law requires special disclosures when such rates and fees are present all five bills would approach the problem by amending tila to redefine high cost loans such that the special disclosures would be triggered at lower interest rates the proposed legislation would have amended current law to make existing prohibitions stronger or create additional prohibitions for example under present law mortgages with 5year terms or more may not be written such that large payment is due at the loan term balloon mortgages all the bills except hr 4213 would have prohibited all balloon mortgages s 2405 would have prohibited lenders from charging points and fees on high cost mortgage which is being used to refinance high cost mortgage from the same lender s 2405 would have

sidebyside summary of the bills 5httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30885predatory lending background on the issue and overview of legislation in the 106th congress introduction the market for mortgage loans may be considered as dual mortgage market borrowers with fair to good credit ratings may be able to obtain loans on the prime mortgage market they are able to obtain the loans with the lowest interest rates and costs borrowers with blem ished credit histories obtain mortgage loans on the subprime mortgage market and obtain the loans with higher interest rates and loan fees than are obtainable in the prime market the problem is that some subprime lenders have been making loans on terms that are regarded as predatory while existing laws have addressed some of the problems of predatory lending many issues remain this issue was the subject of legislation introduced in the 106th congress and is one of the issues listed in the oversight plan for the house committee on financial services for the 107th congress current law in 1993 testimony before the congress indicated that some communities which lacked access to traditional lending institutions were being victimized by second mortgage lenders home improvement contractors and finance companies who peddled high interest rate home equity loans with high loan fees to cashpoor homeowners it was suggested that homeowners were offered home improvement loans and credit consolidation loans borrowers who may not have fully understood the terms of the loans and who may not have been offered adequate disclosures of the loan terms often had to struggle to meet overwhelming mortgage payments and too often they ultimately lost their homes through foreclosure congress decided that legislation was needed to address the issue and protect such homeowners the issue was addressed in subtitle b of title i of the riegle community development and regulatory improvement act of 1994 pl 103325 the subtitle is cited as the home ownership and equity protection act of 1994 this subtitle amended the truth in lending act tila to provide new consumer protections for certain high cost loans basically the law defines high cost loan as loan secured by the principal residence of the borrower but which is not used for the purchase of the residence and which meets one of the following conditions 1 the annual percentage rate on the loan exceeds the rate on comparable treasury securities by more than 10httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30885crs2 1a figure of 400 was enacted but the federal reserve adjusts that number annually based on the annual percentage change reflected in the consumer price index that is in effect on june 1st of given year and the adjusted amount will become effective on january 1st of the next year for 2001 the adjusted dollar amount is 465percentage points or 2 the total points and fees paid by the borrower at or before loan closing exceed the greater of 465 or 8 of the total loan amount1 the law does not limit the interest rate and loan fees that lenders may charge limits are placed on the provisions that may be included in high cost loans and the loans must meet certain disclosure requirements at least 3 business days before completing the transaction borrower must be given special disclosures this gives the borrower 3day cooling off period before becoming obligated under the loan this is in addition to the 3day coolingoff period during which the borrower may cancel the loan after completing the transaction one disclosure must contain the following statement you are not required to complete this transaction merely because you have received these disclosures or have signed loan application if you obtain this loan the lender will have mortgage on your home you could lose your home and any money you have put into it if you do not meet your obligations under the loan for loans with terms of less than 5 years the payment schedule must be such that the loan is completely repaid at the end of the loan term the loan may not have payment schedule which would cause the loan balance to increase and there may not be penalty for paying off the loan prior to its maturity date lender may not engage in the practice of extending mortgage loans without regard to the borrowers ability to make the scheduled payments and borrower has the right to rescind the loan if the lender fails to furnish the required disclosures or if the loan documents include one or more of the prohibited terms the hudtreasury report in addition to legislation proposed in the 106th congress recommendations to curb predatory lending were detailed in joint report released last year by the department of housing and urban development hud and the department of the treasury the national task force on predatory lending convened in march 2000 was chaired by andrew cuomo who was secretary of hud and cochaired by lawrence summers who was secretary of the treasury members of the task force included wide range of parties intereste d in and affected by the predatory lending issue between april and may 2000 the task force held five forums around the country for task force members and each forum had specific theme atlanta ga the impact of predatory lending on minorities angeles ca the elderly and predatory lending new york ny funding sources for predatory lending baltimore md httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30885crs3 the role of other key nonlender players and chicago il state and local initiatives to curb predatory lending in june 2000 the task force released report detailing recommendations for legislative regulatory and other steps that would help curb predatory lending practices the report curbing predatory home mortgage lending proposes fourpoint plan to address predatory lending practices improve consumer literacy and disclosures the report proposes that lenders be required to recommend that applicants for highcost loans avail themselves of home mortgage counseling that lenders disclose credit scores to all borrowers upon request and that lenders give borrowers more timely and more accurate information on loan costs and terms prohibit harmfu l sales practices in the mortgage market the report recommends the banning of practices such as loan flipping and lending to borrowers without regard to their ability to repay the loan it is also suggested that new requirements be imposed on mortgage brokers to document the appropriateness of highcost loan for certain applicants and that lenders who report to credit bureaus should be required to provide fullfile payment history for their mortgage customers restrict abusive terms and conditions on highcost loans the report recommends that congress increase the number of borrowers in the subprime market covered by legislative protections further restrict balloon payments on highcost loans restrict prepayment penalties and the financing of points and fees prohibit mandatory arbitration agreements on highcost loans and ban lumpsum credit life insurance and similar products improve market structure the report recommends the award of community reinvestment act cra credit to lenders that promote borrowers from the subprime to prime mortgage market and the denial of cra credit to lenders for the origination or purchase of loans that violate applicable lending laws it is recommended that lenders disclose the incidence of high cost loans in pools of mortgagebacked securities and that the incidence of such loans be disclosed in the offering documents for the securities the report recommends that congress enact legislation which clarifies the authority of hud and the federal housing finance board to issue regulations which prohibit the federal national mortgage association the federal home loan mortgage corporation and the federal home loan banks from purchasing loans with predatory features several of the task force recommendations were included in legislation introduced in the 106th congress and described in this report legislation introduced in the 106th congress as noted above current law does not prohibit high interest rates and high fees but the law requires special disclosures when such rates and fees are present some argue that the rates and fees are so high under current law that lenders can charge rates and fees which are less than those levels and the loans may still be regarded as predatory all five bills that were proposed in the 106th congress would have approached the problem by amending the truth in lending act tila to redefinehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30885crs4 high cost loans such that the special disclosures would be triggered at lower interest rates some consumer groups would welcome the proposed changes but might argue that what is really needed is return to usury legislation restricting the rate of interest that may be charged it is likely that such an approach would be resisted by lenders and their representatives as introduced in the 106th congress the proposed legislation would have amended current law to make existing prohib itions stronger or create additional prohibitions for example under present law mortgages with 5year terms or more may not be written such that large payment is due at the loan term balloon mortgages all the bills except hr 4213 would have prohibited all balloon mortgages s 2405 would have prohibited lenders from charging points and fees on high cost mortgage which is being used to refinance high cost mortgage from the same lender it has been argued by consumer groups that predatory lenders take advantage of the financial ignorance of the target market so s 2405 would have prohibited high cost mortgages unless the lender has received certification that the prospective borrower had received counseling from an approved agency while hr 4250 and s 2415 would have required the lender to provide the borrower with disclosure statement recommending such counseling as well as the contact information for certified counseling agencies consumer groups also argue that borrowers have incomplete legal protection from predatory lending enforcement authority would have been increased under s 2405 by several means in addition to existing penalties under current law predatory lenders would be subject to penalties contained in the bank holding company act of 1956 thus the company and individual officers could be subject to fines and incarceration the bill would have provided that certain violations would be deemed as unfair and deceptive practices under the federal trade commission act high cost loans would not count towards meeting the lending needs of the community under the community reinvestment act this would remove the incentive to make certain loans hr 3901 would have amended the home mortgage disclosure act to require lenders to report information on the interest rates charged on loans this would enable regulators to track and identify high interest rate loans and lenders with high costs hr 4213 would have amended the real estate settlement procedures act to add additional disclosure requirements hr 4250 would have
