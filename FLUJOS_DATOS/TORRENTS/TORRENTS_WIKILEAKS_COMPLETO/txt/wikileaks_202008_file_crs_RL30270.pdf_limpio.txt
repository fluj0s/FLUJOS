3 1999 will launch new round of trade negotiations president clinton in his state of the union address on january 19 1999 called for an ambitious round focusing on agriculture services industrial tariffs intellectual property and government procurement he also proposed that negotiations should result in early agreements and should be concluded in far less time than the seven years that the uruguay round took the united states and the other wto countries are beginning the process of developing goals and procedures for the negotiations if negotiations lead to multilateral agreements that require changes in us law legislation will be needed for implementation foreign countries are often unwilling to negotiate unless the president has fasttrack authority which he currently does not have should the congress decide to act on fasttrack legislation it can influence the negotiations through specifying the negotiating objectives and by consulting with the administration before and during the negotiations likely issue in any debate is the extent that labor and environmental questions are addressed as of july 1999 the scope of future negotiations is still to be decided all that is known for certain is that negotiations will include agriculture and services since the uruguay round agreement clearly specified that negotiations on these issues must begin by the year 2000 agriculture and services are seen by many policymakers as important because of remaining trade barriers only relatively small amount of trade liberalization occurred in the uruguay round moreover agriculture and services trade is very important to the us economy for example in 1997 about 20 of the value of us agricultural production was exported and the united states is the largest exporter and second largest importer of services wto working groups are studying the relationship between trade and investment and between trade and competition policy countries disagree considerably on whether or not these issues are ripe for negotiation and on the possible benefits of negotiations the european union supports and the united states opposes beginning negotiations on these issues developing countries generally oppose wto discussions on foreign direct investment rules and competition policy including labor and environmental issues in trade agreements is highly controversial both within the united states and among the wto members for example environmentalists and labor unions argue that labor and environmental standards should be negotiating goal for humanitarian and environmental protection reasons many economists and the business community maintain that more effective way to increase standards abroad is through trade liberalization and increased economic growth abroad the administration supports discussions of environment and labor in the wto while the congress is divided on the issue some other industrial countries support wto discussions while the developing countries are strongly

in his state of the union address on january 19 1999 called for an ambitious round focusing on agriculture services industrial tariffs intellectual property and government procurement he also proposed that negotiations should result in early agreements and should be concluded in far less time than the seven years that the uruguay round agreement took the uruguay round the eighth series of negotiations under the auspices of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt was unique in several ways for the first time agriculture services intellectual property rights traderelated investment measures and textiles and apparel trade were brought under the discipline of multilateral rules the uruguay round also established the world trade organizat ion wto and strengthened the dispute settlement procedure more traditionally it also reduced tariffs further and clarified and expanded rules on subsidies antidumping and safeguards the uruguay round agreement ura requires further negotiations by the year 2000 in agriculture and services where many trade barriers remain agriculture and services negotiations are often referred to as the builtinagenda preparations for the negotiations are currently underway by the wto in geneva in addition to the builtinagenda items there are many proposals to negotiate other issues perhaps the most contentious of these are investment and competition policy and the relationship between trade and the environment consensus exists among wto members regarding the extent to which these issues should be included in the negotiations if negotiations lead to multilateral agreements that require changes in us law implementing legislation will be needed either through the regular legislative process or through fasttrack procedures1 number of foreign countries have expressed their unwillingness to negotiate unless the president has fasttrack authority without such authority it is argued congress can amend an agreement or not vote on it at all and the us negotiating position might lack credibility according to deputy ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30270crs2 2fisher says round can be launched without fasttrack authority inside us

settle disputes among nations it also monitors national trade policies and provides technical assistance and training for developing countries multilateral rules and principles for trade agreed on by member countries play significant role in encouraging trade and economic activity the most important principle underlying the wto is nondiscrimination the mostfavored nation mfn principle requires each member country to grant each other member country treatment at least as favorable as it grants to its mostfavored trade partner the national treatment principle obligates each country not to discriminate between domestic and foreign products once an imported product has entered country the product must be treated less favorably than like product produced domestically major wto decisions are made by the member countries as whole usually by consensus the highest authority is the ministerial conference which is required to be held at least every two years the first conference held in singapore in december 1996 reviewed the implementation of the uruguay round agreement and considered proposals for new issues to be addressed in the future the second ministerial conference held in

from june 1820 19993 in the communique issued at the conclusion of the summit the g8 countries called for among other things new round of broadbased and ambitious global trade negotiations to be

market access single undertaking or early harvest under the auspices of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt trade negotiations occurred in rounds where wide array of issues could be and were negotiated each round had specific beginning and ending date which could be extended decided on by the member countries between rounds the gatt secretariat focused on implementing the trade agreements but was not forum for actual negotiations this procedure reflected the nature of the gatt it was not an institution or an organization but basically trade agreement which had secretariat for administrative purposes one of the functions of the wto however is to provide permanent forum for continuing multilateral trade negotiations strictly speaking rounds are longer needed member countries could decide to negotiate on specific issues at any time for example negotiations in several service sectors basic telecommunications and financial services have been successfully concluded since 1995 when the wto went into effect another sectoral agreement was the information technology agreement ita finalized in march 1997 which reduces trade barriers on broad range of products such as semiconductors computers telecommunications equipment and software6 the business community in the industrial countries proposed an ita in 1995 with us information technology firms providing strong support under the ita tariffs will be reduced in four equal stages and will be eliminated by january 1 2000 currently another information technology agreement ita2 further liberalizing trade is being negotiated since the more recent negotiating rounds have been long and often contentious some analysts argue that future negotiations should be on specific issues the success of the telecommunications financial services and ita negotiations suggests to many that sectoral negotiations can succeed others maintain that substantial progress in negotiations occurs only when crosssector tradeoffs are

countries was linked with reform in textiles important to the developing countries the success of the negotiations in basic telecommunications and financial services were it is argued special cases because it was widely recognized that they were important to the infrastructure of the global economy and some maintain that the successful conclusion of the information technology agreement required side deal on distilled spirits7 as of july 1999 it is not clear how the negotiations will be structured the us administration generally favors continuous negotiations under the auspices of the wto not new round arguing that recent rounds were too long the uruguay round took seven years and the continuing emergence of new issues as result of technological change makes round less feasible in this approach when negotiations on an issue are completed an agreement would be signed and implemented this is also referred to as an early harvest approach the european union and japan support new comprehensive round of trade negotiations in which all agreements would be concluded at the same time recently the united states appears to be open to consideration of this single undertaking approach

until we know the full scope of the agenda contemplated8 it is possible that compromise will be reached in which some negotiations will be concluded early within the context of single undertaking9 consensus appears to have emerged on the length of the proposed negotiations most countries agree that negotiations should last longer than three years it is argued that the upcoming negotiations will focus on extending and consolidating the uruguay round agreement ura and therefore three years will be adequate to achieve this goal10 the builtin agenda the agriculture and services agreements in the ura are similar in two respects first they both began the process of liberalizing trade in new areas but left much to be done in the future second in both cases progress in multinational negotiations

domestic policy changes since countries are less willing to retract past reforms when they have committed to them in an international agreement many economists argue that multilateral negotiations are necessary to continue the process of opening markets and also to reinforce previous policy changes and stimulate further domestic reform agriculture the uruguay round agreement on agriculture established for the first time multilateral rules on market access export subsidies and domestic support for agriculture11 agreement was possible after long difficult negotiations because the major countries were reforming their domestic agricultural programs the developed countries realized the high costs of most domestic support programs especially amid strong efforts to reduce government budget deficits furthermore efforts to reduce the governments role in agriculture were consistent with and part of broad economic policy changes in number of countries improving the efficiency and the global competitiveness of agriculture was an underlying motivation for both domestic reforms and trade liberalization although developing multilateral rules was an historic accomplishment relatively little immediate trade liberalization and increased market access was achieved countries agreed to replace nontariff import measures with tariffs called tariffication an important step but the rates at which tariffs were bound are very high agricultural tariffs in the industrial countries average more than 40 compared with 510 in manufactured goods moreover tariffs for some specific products are much higher for example canadian tariffs on dairy and poultry products are over 20012 the ura imposed limits on export subsidies and prohibited new export subsidies the agreement also imposed limits on spending for domestic agricultural subsidies but since both us and eu domestic support were well below spending levels allowed these limits are not expected to have any practical effect in the ura implementation period 19952001 further negotiations in agriculture are important for several reasons first the uruguay round agreement on agriculture was only first albeit significant step and much remains to be done second agricultural exports are very important to the united states in 1997 about 20 of the value of us agricultural output was exported and for some products the proportion was much higher for example 43 for wheat and 36 for soybeans13 looked at in another way in 1997 agriculturalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30270crs7 14testimony of ambassador peter l scher special trade

ministerial conference release 019698 p 1 16in the ura some nontariff barriers were converted to tariff rate quotas trqs in which tarifffree imports are permitted up to certain level exports accounted for about 30 of gross cash farm receipts14 it is expected that in the future productivity in us agriculture will continue to grow faster than domestic consumer demand at the same time foreign demand for us agricultural products likely will be strong reflecting both rapid population growth and increasing consumer incomes abroad thus unrestricted access to foreign markets may help to prevent domestic farm surpluses from occurring third it is argued further agricultural trade liberalization would improve the efficiency of the us and other economies lower prices for consumers and provide wider variety and higher quality of products finally trade liberalization is seen by some as being an impetus to further domestic agricultural reform in the developing countries especially those in asia and helping to make permanent reforms that have already occurred in the developed countries within the united states most agricultural organizations support wto negotiations they maintain that greater market access abroad is necessary especially now with declining us farm incomes some agricultural organizations representing small farmers however are opposed arguing that more domestic support programs not trade liberalization are needed the administration is currently collecting information from the public on agricultural trade barriers in anticipation of the upcoming negotiations although formal agenda for agriculture negotiations has not yet been determined department of agriculture officials have announced the following goals15 eliminate export subsidies reduce tariffs on

construction architecture engineering commun ications health education information and legal business professional and technical services unlike merchandise which is usually shipped across border services can be delivered in four main ways the service provider can travel to the country of the recipient such as an opera singer or the service recipient can travel to the country of the provider eg tourist services can be sent abroad by mail telephone facsimile or computer network finally services can be provided through foreign direct investment as when firm establishes branch or subsidiary abroad barriers to services trade often take the form of government regulations which may limit the provider of the service such as restrictions on foreign professionals entering country or on the type of investment that can be done by foreign subsidiary world trade in services has grown rapidly over the past several decades and now accounts for about 20 of global merchandise and services trade for example of total world exports of 62 trillion in 1995 12 trillion was in services17 not only is services trade large and growing rapidly but it is an important part of the infrastructure of the world economy much economic activity in the goods sector depends on services such as banking accounting and professional services and computer networks thus reducing trade barriers in services is seen by many as crucial to future economic growth in most countries moreover the united states is the largest exporter and second largest importer of services in 1995 us services exports and imports were 16 and 11 respectively of global services exports and imports18 the general agreement on trade in services gats one of the uruguay round agreements is the first multilateral agreement on services trade19 conceptually the gats can be thought of as having two main components the first part is system of multilateral rules and principles for trade in services which are less comprehensive than those applying to merchandise trade in the gatt the second part contains the schedules of specific commitments in which each country listed the service sectors for which it would provide market access andor national treatment while the multilateral rules were significant achievement any immediate reduction in trade barriers from the gats would occur via the specific commitments one criticism of the gats is that it is complex and difficult document to read and interpret the schedules of commitments lack transparency and make future liberalization more difficult another concern is that very little

countries scheduled commitments in large number of service sectors these commitments cover relative small proportion of actual service production21 one contemplate d goal for future negotiations then is to expand the market access commitments incorporated in the national schedules22 another goal might be to reform regulations that restrict competition in services which as noted earlier are one of the major services barriers also the way in which the schedules of commitments were designed could be reviewed with the aim of increasing transparency and making future liberalization easier finally since services are often delivered via foreign direct investment multilateral rules for foreign direct investment might also improve market access for services23 it should be noted that negotiations in number of services sectors were continued after the gats went into effect in 1995 an agreement liberalizing trade in basic telecommunications was announced in february 199724 in financial services 102 countries reached an agreement in december 1997 to open up banking insurance securities and other financial service markets to foreign service providers the gats also required continued negotiati ons on government procurement subsidies and emergency safeguards in the first few years after 1995 these have not been concluded and will likely be part of the services agenda in the year 2000 one new services issue that has attracted considerable attention is electronic commerce ecommerce which can be defined as commercial transactions by electron ic means especially over the internet it would include for example sales and purchases of goods and services over the internet ecommerce was not even an issue when the uruguay round was negotiated since the internet was not widely used at that time it is significant development however since it makes purchases and sales by consumers andor suppliers in remote locations much quicker and cheaper at the geneva ministerial the wto members agreed not to impose tariffs on electronic transactions for one year and to begin work program to examine trade related aspects of ecommerce the us administration favors reaching agreement at the seattle

of further negotiations in services generally services negotiations are not controversial issue in the united states most recognize the benefits such negotiations might bring the industrial countries are the prime motivators for services negotiations although developing countries recognize to some extent the benefits an improved infrastructure can bring to their economies new issues the two issues discussed in this section rules for foreign direct investment and competition policy are controversial both within the united states and among the wto members countries disagree considerably on whether or not these issues are ripe for negotiation and on the possible benefits of negotiations generally the european union favors and the united states opposes beginning negotiati ons on investment and competition policy to some extent bilateral and regional agreements already include the new issues as does the wto furthermore article 9 of the uruguay round agreement on traderelated investment measures trims requires that by the year 2000 the wto shall consider whether the trims should be complemented with provisions on investment policy and competition policy these issues were discussed at the singapore ministerial in december 1996 which established working groups to study the relationship between trade and investment and between trade and competition policy the working groups which exchange information and undertake analysis began meeting in mid1997 investment and competition policy are in one way an extension of the more traditional trade issues tariffs and import quotas the goals of reducing tariffs or of establishing rules for investment and competition policy are generally the same to improve the efficiency of the world economy raise living standards lower prices for consumer goods and increase the variety and quality of consumer goods rules for foreign direct investment foreign direct investment fdi is very important to the world economy and to the

subsidiary abroad to distribute its exports or substitute for trade when firm produces abroad to sell abroad instead of exporting both fdi and trade are widely seen as improving the efficiency of the economy by allocating scarce resources more effectively and allowing firms to benefit from economies of scale moreover foreign direct investment is seen by many economists as an important way in which technology is transferred from the investor to the recipient country many of the barriers to foreign direct investment have been reduced or eliminated partly as result of existing agreements at number of levels the numerous bilateral treaties usually include mostfavored nation and national treatment clauses as well as provisions insuring the protection and security of investment the north american free trade agreement nafta among the united states canada and mexico includes investment rules in the wto investment provisions are included in the gats the agreement on traderelated aspects of intellectual property rights trips and the trims28 the oecd began negotiations towards multilateral agreement on investment mai in 1995 but after intense opposition ceased all negotiations in december 199829 nevertheless the need for comprehensive multilateral rules is being discussed in the trade policy and business communities given the importance of fdi in the world economy it can be argued that foreign direct investment should be subject to multilateral rules and disciplines just as trade is all 134 wto member countries would participate in the negotiations in the wto not just the oecd countries as is the case in the mai thus wto agreement might gain the support of the developing countries negotiations might focus on developing rules on the right of establishment for firms national

business community emphasize its economic benefits to both the home and host countries domestic opposition to the mai by labor unions environmental organizations and the general public was very vocal major criticism is that foreign investment is motivated primarily by lower labor costs abroad which causes loss of us jobs all agree that in specific instances this can happen most economists however respond with data showing that in the aggregate this is not the case for example at the end of 1996 more than 81 of us direct investment abroad was in highincome countries and 18 in middle income countries only 1 was in lowincome nations31 suggesting that the primary motivation could not be lower labor costs moreover these economists argue that the data suggest that us direct investment abroad is associated with change in the domestic composition of jobs more hightechnology jobs and fewer unskilled jobs not loss of jobs competition policy competition policy refers to laws that regulate traderestricting practices by private firms such practices include cartels agreements to fix prices and control output predatory pricing selling at belowcost prices to drive out competitors price fixing vertical or horizontal integration abuse of dominant power and mergers and acquisitions if they result in trade restriction about 70 countries including most major industrial countries have competition or antitrust laws but in some cases the laws contain number of exemptions and in other cases the laws are not adequately enforced32 significant number of countries have competition laws at all in recent years traderestricting practices by private firms have attracted attention for several reasons first as government barriers to trade eg tariffs and import quotas have been reduced in previous gattwto negotiations other types of barriers have become more visible when high tariffs were restricting trade little thought was given to private business practices that inhibit trade but such practices are now viewed by some as major barrier facing multinational firms second the rapid increase in foreign direct investment abroad and trade in services have made competition problems more of an issue third competition policy is being addressed in regional agreements and in specific instances in the wto for example chapter 15 competition policy monopolies and state enterprises of

each country to impose some specific disciplines on its monopolies in the wto both the gats and the trips contain provisions on government actions regarding private business practices that restrict competition for example one provision of the gats requires wto governments to supervise the behavior of firms they designate as monopolies furthermore the recent wto telecommunications agreement included procompetitive regulatory principles finally several disputes involving private restrictive business practices have received considerable publicity and suggest that multilateral rules might be helpful in 1995 the united states brought case to the wto dispute settlement process in which it argued that japanese automakers dealt exclusively with japanese firms when purchasing auto parts more recently the kodakfuji film case was partly about an exclusive relationship between fuji and the four largest wholesale distributors of photographic film products in japan33 in another issue the boeingmcdonnell douglas merger illustrated how the extraterritorial application of competition law can lead to disputes devising multilateral rules for competition policy might be difficult since the issue is quite complex for example in some cases business practices that are anti competitive may actually improve economic welfare this might be true of mergers where firm benefits from economies of scale wide variety of approaches have been discussed by economists to address competition policy at one extreme supranational authority might be established to make rules for competition policy at the other extreme cooperation among national competition authorities which already exists to some extent might be enhanced there are many options in between for example an agreement could focus on specific goals such as controlling cartels or requiring notification of proposed mergers and acquisitions that affect other countries even though competition policy is included in specific instances in the wto some argue that more comprehensive wto rules are now needed34 in the united states multinational firms support broader wto rules for competition policy the administration recently suggested exploring the possibility of including pro competitive regulatory principles in services negotiations35 the european union which has supranational competition authority supports wto negotiations on competition policy developing countries generally oppose such discussionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30270crs14 36clinton administration committed to laborenvironment link in wto international trade

proposals which environmental issues are included in the principal continuedsocial dimensions of trade policy environmental and labor concerns and their relationship to trade differ from the other issues discussed in this report including the environment and labor rights in trade negotiations is not aimed at improving economic efficiency and at raising productivity instead the goals supported by various groups and countries are to insure that trade liberalization does not come about at cost to the environment and contributes toward higher environmental and labor standards in other words the goals focus on sustainable development health and improving working conditions for labor while most agree that these are important goals opinions vary widely as to whether or not multilateral trade negotiations are the most effective way of achieving them one reason these issues are being discussed in the wto is that there are broad environmental or labor organizations with powers to enforce their agreements number of multilateral environmental treaties have been negotiated covering specific issues such as endangered species but enforcement generally relies on trade sanctions the international labor organization the traditional multinational forum for labor issues has enforcement mechanism some precedents exist for including labor and the environment in the wto the nafta is accompanied by side agreements which focus on improving labor standards and environmental cooperation the wto already allows for some exceptions to the trade rules as long as they are not arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination among countries and are not disguised barriers to trade for example the environment is addressed indirectly in article xx which permits measures necessary to protect human animal or plant life or health and measures relating to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources another provision of article xx allows measures relating to the products of prison labor environment and labor are controversial issues in the united states historically linking environmental and labor issues to trade agreements was supported by environmentalists and labor unions and growing segment of the public and opposed by economists and much of the business community the clinton administration continues to support linking labor and the environment to trade negotiations36 in the congress difference of opinion over the extent to which environmental and labor standards should be negotiated in trade agreements was the main reason the fasttrack bill was withdrawn before the house vote in the fall of 1997 in both hr 2621 and s 1269 the use of the fasttrack process would have been limited to provisions that were either necessary to implement trade agreement or were directly related to trade37 as resulthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30270crs15 37continued negotiating objectives by arlene wilson 38see crs report 97291 enr nafta related environmental issues and initiatives by mary tiemann provisions that are aimed primarily at improving the environment would have been ineligible for implementation via the fasttrack process substantial number of members who supported environmen tal and labor provisions in trade agreements opposed the bills while those who argued against such provisions supported the bills since it appeared the house bill would not pass the vote was postponed in november 1997 as mentioned earlier hr 2621 was rejected by house vote on september 25 1998 including environment and labor in trade agreements is also divisive among the wto members generally the united states and few industrial countries support discussions in the wto while the developing countries are opposed environment the relationship between the environment and trade is complex and involves number of issues one question is the relationship between the wto and multilateral environmental agreements meas that include trade sanctions governments have negotiated several meas that rely on trade sanctions as means to enforce environmental agreements second issue is ecolabeling the process of attaching label to product providing consumers with environmental information if well designed ecolabels can be an effective instrument of environmental policy some are concerned that trade sanctions to enforce meas or ecolabeling might be used as disguised barriers to trade environmental standards raise several questions if domestic health safety and environmental product and produce standards are stricter than those of foreign countries could federal or state standards be weakened if trade rules oblige parties to harmonize and adopt international standards would stricter standards be successfully challenged in the wto dispute settlement procedure as nontariff trade barriers could lower foreign environmental standards or lax enforcement provide competitive advantage and implicit subsidy to foreign investment analysts respond that each country has the right in the wto to establish its own standards provided they are not used as disguised barriers to trade moreover many trade proponents believe that allowing each country to take advantage of its comparative advantage in which they include lower standards will raise world income and ultimately lead to higher standards in foreign countries environmental concerns were important during the negotiations for both nafta and the uruguay round agreement after much discussion and compromise the nafta and side agreement addressed issues such as enforcement of environmental standards in the three nafta countries safeguarding stricter us standards and addressing border pollution38httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30270crs16 39see crs report 97272 worker rights and us trade policy wto singapore ministerial and fasttrack extension by mary jane bolle 40singapore ministerial declaration adopted on 13 december 1996 wto focus january 1997 p 7 although the uruguay round agreement addressed few environmental concerns the major issues were referred to wto committee on trade and the environment established in january 1995 the committee has been meeting periodically to address the ten items on its agenda including transparency of trade measures used for environmental purposes exports of domestically prohibited goods ecolabeling and trade sanctions to enforce meas the committee issued report in november 1996 summarizing its discussions and analysis but made major recommendations the singapore ministerial declaration stated that the committee on trade and environment has made an important contribution towards fulfilling its mandate and directed the committee to continue its work under the existing terms of reference labor standards major argument for including labor standards in trade agreements is humanitarian some argue that workers in all countries deserve to work under conditions that protect their health and safety which might be better achieved if trade agreements required basic labor standards others however maintain that the best way to raise labor standards is to allow developing countries to produce and export more thereby raising incomes and ultimately leading to higher wages and improved worker rights another argument is that multinational firms will shift production to those countries with lower labor standards which it is argued is unfair competition not only would this hurt domestic workers it is suggested but it might force countries with higher standards to lower their standards in order to compete as mentioned earlier the data suggest that lower labor or environmental standards abroad are not major motivation for multinational firms decisions on plant location the link between trade and labor was the most controversial issue discussed during the singapore ministerial39 the united states and few other industrial countries supported the establishment of working group to discuss labor rights in the wto developing countries were strongly opposed arguing that such working group might lead to inclusion of labor rights in trade agreements that in turn would weaken their ability to export by reducing their comparative advantage in production of goods whose labor costs are low moreover it was argued that labor rights might be used as protectionist tools the singapore ministerial declaration supported the observance of internationally recognized core labor standards but stated that the ilo is the competent body to set and deal with those standards additionally the ministers believe that economic growth and development fostered by increased trade and further trade liberalization contribute to the promotion of these standards40 nohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30270crs17 working group was established to discuss labor rights in the wto but the declaration noted that cooperation between the wto and the ilo will continue implications for congress fasttrack negotiatin g authority is important for multilateral negotiations on agriculture services and the other agenda items since foreign countries are unlikely to make the necessary compromises without such authority also rules for foreign direct investment and competition policy now being studied by wto working groups may be topic for negotiations in the nottoodistant future some observers believe the united states has much to gain from reaching agreement on all of these issues should the congress decide to act on fasttrack legislation it would be able to influence the negotiations in several ways first congress could participate in setting the agenda for negotiations through the objectives specified in fasttrack legislation for example in hr 2621 and s 2400 the principal negotiating objectives included reducing specified barriers in services foreign investment intellectual property and agriculture second the fasttrack process requires that the administration consult with the congress at number of points in the negotiating process before negotiations begin during the negotiations and before the administration enters into an agreement congress can request consultations frequently if desired if the administration fails to consult adequately with congress either house of congress may pass resolution denying use of the fasttrack procedures to an implementing bill submitted with trade agreement proponents of fasttrack legislation may seek compromise on the extent to which labor and the environment are the subject of negotiations in both hr 2621 and s 2400 the principal negotiating objectives included the following to ensure that foreign governmen ts do not lower or waive existing environmental and labor standards to gain competitive advantage in trade or investment and to require that us negotiators take into account us domestic objectives including protection of legitimate health safety environmental consumer and employment opportunity interests the 1998 rejection of fasttrack in the house shows the diversity of views on the environmental and labor objectives fasttrack bills in the 105th congress were not successful partly because these principal negotiating objectives were not strong enough to satisfy the goals of labor and to lesser extent environmentalistshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30270
