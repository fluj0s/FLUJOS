eligible expense for their federal funds 3 fixedguideway refers to systems whose vehi cles operate only on rightofway dedicated to that purpose eg heavy rail subways light rail commuter rail bus rapid transit systems that operate on dedicated lanes separated from other traffic lanes are included under this definition 4 in practice all of the bus and bus facilities funding is earmarked each yearfederal transit program curre nt structure and financing current structure federal transit programs are overseen by the federal transit administration fta of the department of transportation dot the majority of federal transit funding is pr ovided through two programs the urbanized areas formula program and the capital investment grants and loans program the urbanized areas formula program provides funding to urbanized areas ie areas defined by the census bureau with populations over 50000 distri buted according to formula which may beused for capital expenses2 the capital investment gran ts and loans program has three component programs new starts which funds new fixedguideway3 transit lines or extensions to existing lines through meritbased recommenda tion process fixed guideway modernization which distributes funds by formula for the upkeep of fixed guideway lines that are over seven years old and bus and bus facilities which provides funds on discretionary basis for the purchas of buses and constr uction of bus facilities4 customarily the capital inves tment grants and loans progra m funding has been divided among these three programs on 404020 rati though in the past few years the share going to the new starts program has grown there are also number of smaller transit programs that provide funding for other activ ities including planning rural transit service and service for the elderly and disabled but the urbanized areas formula program and the capital investment grants and loan program represent around 90 of ftas annual funding financing funding for the transit program comes from combination of trust funds and general funds the mass trans it account within the highway trust fund receives 2 84 cents of th 184 cents per gallon federal excise tax on gasoline and 244 cents per gallon tax on diesel fuel reve nue from the mass transit account customarily provides around 80 of annual transit f unding the remain ing 20 comes from appropriations from the general fund not only is the overall transit program financed by combination of trust funds and general funds but so are most of the indivi dual transit programs under the fta under federal budgetary rules this results in mo rerapid depletion of the mass transit account than would be the case if individual programs were funded entirely from either the trust fund or general fund alone the congressiona l budget office has estimated that the mass transit account will be entirely depleted by fy2007 if the current financing structure of ftas programs is not changed both the h ouse and the senate vers ion of hr 3 would prevent this by funding most if not all tr ansit programs entirely from one or the other source this change would forestall the pletion of the mass transit account for the foreseeable futurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22176crs3 5 provisions in tea21 and similar provisions in both versions of hr 3 guarantee that the highway and transit programs will receive their au thorized level of funding by in part making it out of order to approve an appropriations bill providing less than the authorized funding level 6 the house bill includes authorization figures for fy2004fy2009 the senate bill provides authorization figures for fy2005fy2009 the fy 2004 transit appropriation figure has been added to the senate total for purposes of comparison 7 the majority of federal transit funding is used for capital expenditures as result federal funding represents significant share of total national transit capital funding but small share of total transit operating funding over the period fy1998fy2002 federal funding accounted for 46 of total capital expenditures for tran sit 234 billion of 507 b illion but only 4 of total operating expenditures for tr ansit 51 billion of 1195 billion however this distinction has been made less clear by provision in tea 21 defining preventive maintenance expenses an operational cost as an eligible capital expe nse combining both categories federal funding represented 17 of total tr ansit funding during fy1998fy2002 8 both the house and senate bills continue the current flexibility that states have to transfer flex highway funding to transit projects and vi ce versa in practice states have transferred considerably more funding from highway to trans it projects than from transit to highway projectsfinancing issues transit finance issues in reauthorization include transits total funding its share of overall surface transportation funding the sh are of transit funding derived from the general fund the division of funding among the components of the capital grants and loans program and the share of tr ansit funding going to rural areas total transit funding the house bill would authorize 524 billion in guaranteed5 funding for transit over the peri od fy2004fy2009 the senate bill would authorize the equivalent of 538 billion in guaranteed funding6 these funds are important to state and local governments becau federal funding re presents nearly half of annual total na tional capital expenditures for transit7 transits share of authorized surface transportation funding the major obstacle to surface transportation reaut horization has been th level of funding to be authorized the house nd senate leadership has s upported the administrations limit of 284 billion over six years while majority in the senate has sought more funding one of the tradeoffs authorizers have struggl ed with is the division of funding between highway and transit programs under tea 21 transits share of the overall guaranteed surface transportation authorization was 1829 while the sena bill provides 14 billion more for transit than the house bill the house bill provides slightly higher share of overall funding to transit 1866 co mpared to 1848 in the senate bill8 transit funding from the ge neral fund as noted above around 20 of federal transit funding cust omarily comes from the general fund the house bill stays closer to that division than does the senate bill drawing 1890 of transit funding from the general fund compared to the senates 1565 the policy rationale for drawing portion of transits funding fro m the general fund is that transit benefits the public including people who do not use transit by pr oviding slight reductions in auto usage and thus traffic congestion and air pollution reducing the share of general fund moneys going to transit provides more flexibility in annual appropriations b ills since the generalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22176crs4 9 jennifer l dorn fta administrator budget briefing remarks february 3 2003 transit dependent population is defined in the study from which this statistic was taken the status of rural public transportation 2000 prepared for fta by the community transportation association of america as pe rsons in households whose household income is below the poverty level persons with mobility impairment or persons age 65 and older 10 rural areas also receive some f unding from other transit programsfund moneys for transit count against th discretionary allo cations provided to appropriations subcommittees while the f unds coming from the mass transit account do not division of funding within the tr ansit capital grants and loans program the senate bill would alter the cu stomary 404020 split in funding for the components of the capital grants and an program new starts fixed guideway modification and bus and bus facilities the senate bill would increase the share going to new starts to 43 propone nts of increasing the share going to new starts argue that the share for new starts should be increased because the demand for new starts funding far exceeds the available level of funding bu t that change requires reducing the share of funding going to one or both of the other components of the cap ital grants and loans program opponents of reducing the share go ing to fixedguideway modification argue that as more new fixedguideway systems ar built more funding needs to be provided to maintain those systems since with each passing year the number of projects qualifying for funding under the fixedguideway m odification formula program increases opponents of reducing the share going to the bus and bus facilities program note that most transit service is provided by buses rath er than by fixed guideways the house bill retains the customary 404020 fundi ng split between these programs transit funding for rural areas transit funding is concentrated in urban areas where usage is highest yet rural ar eas have populations of older and less affluent people who may lack mobility and who might use transit service the administration has estimated that 40 of rural c ounties have transit service and in the 60 of rural counties that do provide public transit onethird of the ri ders are transitdependent9 both the house and senate bills would increase the share of federal transit funding going to support transit service in rural areas u nder tea21 the nonurbanized area formula program section 5311 received 12 billion 32 of total tr ansit funding the house bill would provide 21 billion 40 of total transit funding the senate bill 22 billion 40 of total transit f unding for that program10 program changes program changes proposed in the house bill the senate bill or both include new small starts program within the new starts capital program to assist the development of lesscostly transit systems highinten sity small urbanized area program to reward small communities that provide high level of transit service new freedom initiative to assist persons with disa bilities with transportation acce ss to employment opportunities and changing the job access and revers commute program from discretionary program to formula programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22176crs5 11 the administration in proposing this program claimed that 70 of persons with disabilities are unemployed in part due to difficulties with transportationsmall starts both the house and senate bills would create new program small starts within the existing new star ts program which funds new fixedguideway lines or extensions to existing lines under current law new starts projects are evaluated by fta at several stages of development and must receive recommendation from fta to proceed to the next stage projects requesting less than 25 million in federal funding are currently exempted from the approval requi rement the small starts program would provide simpler evaluation process with fe wer review stages and fewer justification requirements for projects re questing less than 75 million in federal funding the senate bill would eliminate the existing exception for projects under 25 million the house bill would retain it the small starts progra m would include bus rapid transit projects as eligible projects depending on their design bus rapid trans it projects may not be eligible for funding under the existing new starts program highintensity small urbanized area program both the house and senate bills would create new highintensity small urbanized area program within the framework of the urbanized area formula prog ram this program responds to an issue regarding the formula for apportioni ng funds to co mmunities under 200000 in population for communities larger than that the apportionment formula includes several measures of transit activity but fo r communities under 200000 the apportionment formula considers only population size and p opulation density as result the current formula does not reward small communities that provide higher than average level of transit service this new program woul d provide additional resources to those communities it does not however change the existing formula for the small communities tier under the urbanized area formula program new freedom initiative both the house and senate bills would create new freedom initiative program this program w ould increase availability of transportation services to persons with disabilities the house bill reflects the emphasis of the administrations proposal for this program which was to help pe rsons with disabilities get and keep jobs by improving their transportation options11 this program would be in addition to the existing elderly and persons with disabilities formula program the senate bill replaces the existing elderly nd persons with disabilities formula program with new freedom initiative program and emphasizes assistance with transportation to health care rather than to employment job access and reverse commute program this program is designed to increase access to jobs for lowincome pers ons and to increase access to suburban work sites for all riders the house bill would change the existing job access and reverse commute program from discretionary program to formula program the senate bill does not propose such change in recent ears the programs funding has been entirely earmarked in the annual appropriations process
