wake of the 911 terrorist attacks the pentagon has expanded its counterterrorism intelligence activities as part of what the bush administration terms the global war on terror some observers have asserted that the department of defense dod may be conducting certain kinds of counte rterrorism intelligence activities that would statutorily qualify as covert actions and thus require presidential finding and the notification of the congressional intelligence committees defense officials assert that none of dods current counterterrorist intelligence activities constitute covert action as defined under the law and therefore do not require presidential finding and the notification of the intelligence committees rather they contend that dod conducts only clandestine activities although the term is not defined by statute these officials characterize such activities as constituting actions that are conducted in secret but which constitute passive intelligence information gathering by comparison covert action they contend is active in that its aim is to elicit change in the political economic military or diplomatic behavior of target some of dods activities have been variously described publicly as efforts to collect intelligence on terrorists that will aid in planning counterterrorism missions to prepare for potential missions to disrupt capture or kill them and to help local militaries conduct counterterrorism missions of their own senior us intelligence community officials have conceded that the line separating central intelligence agency cia and dod intelligence activities has blurred making it more difficult to distinguish between the traditional secret intelligence missions carried out by each they also have acknowledged that the us intelligence community confronts major challenge in clarifying the roles and responsibilities of various intelligence agencies with regard to clandestine activities some pentagon officials have appeared to indicate that dods activities should be limited to clandestine or passive activities pointing out that if such operations are discovered or are inadvertently revealed the us government would be able to preserve the option of acknowledging such activity thus assuring th military personnel who are involved some safeguards that are afforded under the geneva conventions covert actions by contrast constitute activities in which the role of the us government is not intended to be apparent or to be acknowledged publicly those who participate in such activities could jeopardize any rights they may have under the geneva conventions according to these officials this report examines the statutory procedures governing covert action and associated questions to consider this report will be updated as warranted

assert that since 911 the pentagon has begun to conduct certain types of counterterrorism intelligence activities that may meet the statutory definition of covert action the pentagon while stating that it has attempted to improve the quality of its intelligence program in the wake of 911 contends that it does not conduct covert actions congress in 1990 toughened procedures governing intelligence covert actions in the wake of the irancontra affair after it was discovered that the reagan administration had secretly sold arms to iran an avowed enemy that had it branded as terrorist and used the proceeds to fund the nicaraguan democratic resistance also referred to by some as contras in response congress adopted several statutory changes including enacting several restrictions on the conduct of covert actions and establishing new procedures by which congress is notified of covert action programs in an important change congress for the first time statutorily defined covert action to mean an activity or activities of the united states government to influence political economic or military conditions abroad where it is intended that the role of the united states government will not be apparent or acknowledged publicly1 the 1991 statutory changes remain in effect today this report examines the legislative background surrounding covert action and poses several related policy questions g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 in 1974 congress asserted statutory control over covert actions in response to revelations about covert military operations in southeast asia and other intelligence activities it approved the hughesryan amendment to the foreign assistance act of 1961 requiring that appropriated funds could be expended by the cia for covert actions unless and until the president found that each such operation was important to national security and provided the appropriate committees of congress with description and scope of each operation in timely fashion 2 the phrase timely fashion was not defined in statute in 1980 congress endeavored to provide the two new congressional intelligence committees with more comprehensive statutory framework under which to conduct oversight3 as part of this effort congress repealed the hughesryan amendment and replaced it with statutory requirement that the executive branch limit its reporting on covert actions to the two intelligence committees and established certain procedures for notifying congress prior to the implementation of such operations specifically the statute stipulates that if the president determines it is essential to limit prior notice to meet extraordinary circumstances affecting the vital interests of the united states the president may limit prior notice to the chairmen and ranking minority members of the intelligence committees the speaker and minority leader of the 1 sec 503e of the national security act of 1947 50 usc 413b 2 pl 93559 1974 the appropriate committees of congress was interpreted to include the committees on armed services foreign relations senate and foreign affairs house and appropriations of each house of congress total of six committees 3 the senate select committee on intelligence was established in 1976 the house permanent select committee on intelligence was established in 1977

formulation that has become known as the gang of eight if prior notice is withheld the president is required to inform the committees in timely fashion and provide statement of the reasons for not giving prior notice4 in 1984 in the wake of the mining of nicaraguan harbors in support of the nicaraguan democratic resistance the chairman and vice chairman of the senate select committee on intelligence signed an informal agreementwhich became known as the casey accordswith thendirector of central intelligence dci william casey establishing certain procedures that would govern the reporting of covert actions to congress in 1986 the committees principals and the dci signed an addendum to the earlier agreement stipulating that the committee would receive prior notice if significant military equipment actually is to be supplied for the first time in an ongoing operation even if there is requirement for separate higher authority or presidential approval this agreement reportedly was reached several months after president reagan signed the january 17 1986 iran finding whic h authorized the secret transfer of certain missiles to iran 5 following the irancontra revelations president ronald reagan in 1987 issued national security decision directive 286 prohibiting retroactive findings and requiring that findings be written the executive branch without congressional consent can revise or revoke such national security directives in 1988 acting on recommendation made by the congressional irancontra committee the senate approved bipartisan legislation that would have required that the president notify the congressional intelligence committees within 48 hours of the implementation of covert action if prior notice had not been provided the house did not vote on the measure still concerned by the fallout from the irancontra affair congress in 1990 attempted to tighten its oversight of covert action the senate intelligence committee approved new set of statutory reporting requirements citing the ambiguous confusing and incomplete congressional mandate governing covert actions under the thencurrent law after the bill was modified in conference congress approved the changes 6 president george hw bush pocketvetoed the 1990 legislation citing several concerns including conference report language indicating congressional intent that the intelligence committees be notified within few days wh prior notice of covert action was not provided and that prior notice could only be withheld in exigent circumstances7 the legislation also contained language stipulating that us government request of foreign government or private citizen to conduct covert action would constitute covert action in 1991 after asserting in new conference language its intent as to the meaning of timely fashion and eliminating any reference to thirdparty covert action requests congress approved and the president signed into law the new measures 8

expanded intelligence counterterrorism efforts some lawmakers reportedly have expressed concern that the pentagon is creating parallel intelligence capability independent from the cia or other american authorities and one that encroaches on the cias realm 10 it has been suggested that the pentagon has adopted broad definition of its current authority to conduct traditional military activities and prepare the battlefield11 senior defense department officials reportedly have responded that the pentagons need for intelligence to support ground troops after 911 requires more extensive pentagon intelligence operation and they suggest that any difference in dods approach is due more to the amount of intelligence gathering that is necessarily being carried out rather than to any difference in the activity it is conducting12 these same officials however also reportedly contend that american troops were now more likely to be working with indigenous forces in countries like iraq or afghanistan to combat stateless terrorist organizations and need as much flexibility as possible 13 recent media reports have stated that the us military since 2004 has used broad secret authority to carry out nearly dozen previously undisclosed attacks against qaeda and other militants in syria pakistan and elsewhere14 according to other media reports dod is paying 9 although the covert action statute has remained virtually unchanged congress has addressed some related concerns the fy2004 defense authorization law pl 108136 included provision requiring the secretary of defense to report to congress on the special operations forces changing role in counterterrorism and on the implications of those changes if any on the special operations command also included was provision requiring that any special operations commandled missions be authorized by the pres ident or the secretary of defense in the 2004 intelligence authorization law conferees reaffirmed the functional definition of covert action and cited the critical importance to the requirements for covert action approval and notification contained in the 1991 intelligence authorization law for more detailed discussion of these and related issues see helen fessenden cq weekly intelligence hills oversight role at risk march 27 2004 p 734 in the fy2009 duncan hunter national defense authorization act congress increased from 25 to 35 million the amount of annually authorized funds available to the secretary of defense with the concurrence of the relevant ambassador to provid support to foreign forces irregular forces groups or individuals supporting or facilitating ongoing military operati ons by united states special operations forces to combat terrorism congress also extended the defense secretarys authority to spend such funds through fiscal year 2011 under previously existing law the secr etary of defense was required to notify the congressional defense committees expeditiously and in any event in not less than 48 hours of the use of such authority with respect to that operation under the new law the secretary is required to notify the co mmittees within 48 hours of the use of such authority congress reaffirmed that the secretarys authority does not constitute the authority to conduct covert action see section 1208 pl 110417 10 eric schmitt new york times clash forseen

to dod and cia mission differences cia director michael hayden reportedly has stated that it has become more difficult to distinguish between traditional secret intelligence missions carried out by the military and those by the cia and that any problems resulting from overlapping missions will be resolved casebycase 16 more recently general james r clapper jr the pentagons under secretary of defense for intelligence testified before the senate armed services committee that within the statutory context of the meaning of covert action covert activities are normally not conducted by uniformed military forces17 in written responses to questions posed by the senate armed services committee in advance of the hearing general clapper asserted that it was his understanding that military forces are not conducting covert action but are instead confining their actions to clandestine activities18 although testifying that the term clandestine activities is not defined by statute he characterized such activity as consisting of those actions that are conducted in secret but which constitute passive intelligence information gathering by contrast covert action he suggested is active in that its aim is to elicit change in the political economic military or diplomatic behavior of target19 in comments before the committee he further noted that clandestine activity can be conducted in support of covert activity20 he also distinguished between covert action in which the governments participation is unacknowledged and clandestine activity which although intended to be secret can be publicly acknowledged if it is discovered or inadvertently revealed21 being able to publicly acknowledge such an activity provides the military personnel who are involved certain protections under the geneva conventions according to general clapper who suggested that those who participate in covert actions could jeopardize any rights they may have under the geneva conventions he recommended that to the maximum extent possible there needs to be line drawn between clandestine and covert activities from an oversight perspective and as well sic as risk perspective 22 some observers suggest that congress needs to increase its oversight of military activities that some contend may not meet the definition of co vert action and may therefore be exempt from 15 see karen deyoung and walter pincus washington post us to fund proamerican publicity in iraqi media october 3 2008 p a1 16 ibid the department of defense makes the following distinction between clandestine operation and covert action clandestine operation is an operation sponsored or conducted by governmental departments or agencies in such way as to assure secrecy or concealment such an operation differs from covert action in that emphasis is placed on concealment of the operation rather than on the concealment of the identity of the s ponsor according to dod in special operations an activity may be both cove rt and clandestine and may focus equally on operational considerations and intelligencerelated activities see department of defense dictionary of military and associated terms joint

and they stated that covert action does not apply to acknowledged us government activities which are intended to influence public opinion or governmental attitudes in foreign countries to mislead or

g3g140g157g146g152g151g561 in approving statutory definition of covert action congress also statutorily stipulated four categories of activities which would not constitute covert action they are 1 activities the primary purpose of which is to acquire intelligence traditional counterintelligence activities traditional activities to improve or maintain the operational security of us government programs or administrative activities 2 traditional diplomatic or military activities or routine support to such activities 3 traditional law enforcement activities conducted by us government law enforcement agencies or routine support to such activities 4 activities to provide routine support to the overt activities other than activities described in the first three categories of other us government agencies abroad 28 this report addresses the second category of activitiestraditional military activities and routine support to those activities

military activities include activities by military personnel under the direction and control of united states military commander whether or not the us sponsorship of such activities is apparent or later to be acknowledged preceding and related to hostilities which are either anticipated meaning approval has been given by the national command authorities for the activities and or operational planning for hostilities to involve us military forces or where such hostilities involving united states military forces are ongoing and where the fact of the us role in the overall operation is apparent or to be acknowledged publicly in this regard the conferees intend to draw line between activities that are and are not under the direction and control of the military commander activities that are not under the direction and control of military commander should not be considered as traditional military activities 29 27 ibid 28 ibid 29 joint explanatory statement of the committee of

conferees further stated that whether or not activities undertaken well in advance of possible or eventual us military operation constitute covert action will depend in most cases upon whether they constitute routine support and referenced the report accompanying the senate bill for an explanation of the term30 the report accompanying the senate bill31 states the committee considers as routine support unila teral us activities to provide or arrange for logistical or other support for us military forces in the event of military operation that is to be publicly acknowledged examples include caching communications equipment or weapons the lease or purchase from unwitting sources of residential or commercial property to support an aspect of an operation or obtaining currency or documentation for possible operational uses if the operation as whole is to be publicly acknowledged the report goes on to state the committee would regard as otherthanroutine support activities undertaken in another country which involve other than unilateral activities examples of such activity include clandestine attempts to recruit or train forei gn nationals with access to the target country to support us forces in the event of military operation clandestine efforts to influence foreign nationals of the target country concerned to take certain actions in the event of us military operation clandestine efforts to influence and effect sic public opinion in the country concerned where us sponsorship of such efforts is concealed and clandestine efforts to influence foreign officials in third countries to take certain actions without the knowledge or approval of their government in the event of us military operation as the congressional conferees declared in 1991 timing of such activitieswhether proximate to military operation or well in advancedoes not define otherthanroutine support of military activities rather whether such activities constitute otherthanroutine support and thus constitute covert action will depend in most cases on whether such an activity is unilateral in nature that is whether us government personnel conduct the activity or whether they enlist the assistance of foreign nationals

mission and authorities with regard to covert action are less than clear the lack of clarity raises number of policy questions for the 111 th congress including the following far from exclusive list how should congress define its oversight role which committees should be involved can the us military improve the effectiveness of its intelligence operations without at some point enlisting the support of foreign nationals in such way that 30 ibid 31 srept 10285 s 1325 102nd congress 1st session 1991

military activities that is covert action is it appropriate to view us counterterrorism efforts in the context of global battlefield and to view the military as having the authority to prepare that battlefield and can anticipated military action precede the onset of hostilities by months or years is it appropriate to view the military as being involved in war against terrorists and thus its activities as constituting traditional military activities as it wages that war by asserting that its activities do not constitute covert actions is the pentagon trying to avoid the statutory requirements governing covert action including signed presidential finding congressional notification and oversight by the congressional intelligence committees or as pentagon officials suggest is dod in the wake of 911 fulfilling greater number of intelligence needs associated with combating terrorism that are sanctioned in statute and do not fall under the statutory definition of covert action since 1991 when congress last comprehensively addressed the issue of covert action has the environment in which the us military operates changed sufficiently to warrant review of the statute that applies to covert actions in his 1991 signing statement president george hw bush argued that congresss definition of covert action was unnecessary he went on to state that in determining whether particular military activities constitute covert actions he would continue to bear in mind the historic missions of the armed forces to protect the united states and its interests influence foreign capabilities and intentions and conduct activities preparatory to the execution of operations g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561
