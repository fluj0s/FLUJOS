from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to tom wigley wigleyucaredu subject re ncdc data date mon oct 5 123537 2009 cc ben santer santer1llnlgov tom i cant see why the data become ersstv3b b seems all that you can download i reviewed the 2008 paper the version that i reviewed had something in for the problem of sst data now re drifters and ships but they pulled that section i recall saying it needed to be watertight and they needed to explain the spatial pattern to the ship minus drifter field maybe that version was i was never that keen on their infilling it biases the values before the 1920s when you infill with anomalies that are nearer to zero you can see this in their fig6 this version is better than their previous one i always assumed they still had gaps as it would be impossible to infill the antarctic and some parts of the southern oceans have you tried looking at their antarctic average 6590s for example their globe should be one domain so not nhsh2 but for an infilled dataset this shouldnt make any difference i wonder if they downweight the infilled values in some way they have their error field the 2008 paper doesnt say how they compute global and nh and sh are nh and sh the same as you get cheers phil at 0656 05102009 tom wigley wrote phil ben have you looked at the latest ncdc global data it seems odd the data on their site is ersstv3 smith et 2008 as far as i know this is an infilled data set with gaps as such nhsh2 should be the same as their global mean for monthly data this is not the case there are actually some big differences even recently any idea why tom prof phil jones climatic research unit telephone 44 0 1603 592090 school of environmental sciences fax 44 0 1603 507784 university of east anglia norwich email pjonesueaacuk nr4 7tj uk
