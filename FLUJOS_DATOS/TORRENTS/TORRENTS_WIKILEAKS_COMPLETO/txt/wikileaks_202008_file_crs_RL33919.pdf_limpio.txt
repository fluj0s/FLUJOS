in their capacity for selfcare due to physical cognitive or mental disability or conditi on that results in functiona l impairment and dependence on others for an extended period of time the need for longterm care affects people of all ages children born with disab ling conditions workingage adults with inherited or acquired disabling conditions and the elde rly with chronic conditions or illnesses the need for longterm care services is generally measured irrespective of age and diagnosis by persons inability to perform basic activities necessary to live independently while the likelihood of needing longterm car assistance occurs more frequently with increasing age advances in medical care are enabling people of all ages with disabilities to live longer about 94 million adults or 5 of the dult population receive longterm care services in the community or in institutions about 11 million children living in the community have longterm care limitations while the lifetime risk of individuals using longterm care services varies greatly team of researchers has estimated that 69 of people turning age 65 in 2005 with moderate level of need will use some care before they die 31 will not need any care regardless of age people receiving longterm care assistance are more likely to live at home and in community settings rather than in institutions adults with longterm care limitations are more likely to live in poverty than people without limitations most care received by people w ith disabilities is provided by informal providers family and friends who give care without compensation formal care providers range from institutional settings and other residential care facilities to variety of organizations that provide wide array of home and communitybased services accessing and arranging formal care services delivered through multiple providers can be complex and confusing for individuals and their families national spending on longterm care in 2005 is estimated at 2066 billion medicaid is by far the largest public progra m that covers longterm care paying for almost half of the nations longterm care services primarily institutional care medicare covers postacute services in skilled nursing facilities and in the home for certain medicare beneficiaries in add ition the older americans act oaa and the social services block grant ssbg s upport wide range of home and community based longterm care services each of these federal programs has differing characteristics program goals eligibility requirements and covered services which often results in an uncoordinated service delivery system for individuals and families seeking assistance in order to assist congress in future policy deliberations about longterm care services

services and support refer to broad range of health and social services needed by people who are limited in their capacity for selfcare due to physical cognitive or mental disability or condition that results in functional impairment and dependence on others for an extended period of time the need for longterm care affects persons of all ages children born with disabling conditions such as mental retardation or cerebral pa lsy workingage adults with inherited or acquired disabling conditions such as mental illness or traumatic brain injuries and the elderly with chronic conditions or illnesses such as severe cardiovascular disease or alzheimers disease while the like lihood of needing longterm care assistance increases with advancing age advances in medical care are enabling persons of all ages with disabilities to live longer changing the way longterm care serv ices and supports are financed and delivered has drawn congressional attention for more than two decades despite significant spending the nation lacks comprehensive policy on the financing of longterm care number of factors cau concern among federal and state policymakers among other things these include the large personal financial liability many people with disabilities face in paying for longterm care services sometimes resulting in impoverishment the high pr oportion of public longterm care spending devoted to institutional care predicted increased demand for services as result of the aging of the population and comple x delivery system composed of multiple services funded through myriad of fede ral programs often re sulting in fragmented and uncoordinated care total us spending on longterm care is significant component of all health care spending of the 16 trillion sp ent on personal health care in 2005 an estimated 2066 billion or 124 was spent on longterm care services longterm care spending includes payment for services in institutional settings primarily nursing homes and intermediate care facilities for people with mental retardation and wide range of home and communitybas ed services such as home health care personal care and adult day care the dominant payer of longterm care expenditures is the medicaid program in 2005 medicaid paid for nearly half of longterm care spending 489 or 1011 billion medicare and outofpocket spe nding by individuals and families accounted for about 204 and 181 respectively of total spending private insurance andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33919crs2 1 national spending for longterm care fact sheet georgetown university longterm care financing

includi ng wide range of grants to states for longterm care systems change and home and communitybased services other public and private sources paid for the balance of spending 72 and 53 respectively1 despite the large public commitment to financing care most care received by persons with disabilities is provided by informal sources family and friends who provide care without compensation many policymakers are concerned about the impact that the aging of the popula tion and increasing longevity of younger persons with disabilities will have on the ability of informal caregivers to continue their caregiving roles in the future although previous congresse s have considered proposal s to address issues in longterm care financing and service delivery consensus has not been reached on what policy directions shoul d be taken to overhaul th system congress made systemic change in federal longter m care policy in 1981 when it created the medicaid section 1915c home and commun itybased waiver program for persons with disabilities the last time that congress comprehensively reviewed policy options for longterm care reform was in 1990 under the us bipartisan commission on comprehensive health ca re known as the pepper commission in 1999 the us supreme court ruled on landmark case for people with disabilities olmstead v lc 2 the court held that institutionalization of people who could be cared for in community settings was violation of title ii of the americans with disabilities act ada th is case and subsequent fede ral and state legislation as well as activities conducted by the bush administration3 have encouraged efforts to provide expanded home and commun itybased services for people with disabilities more recently in the ficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 congress approved new optiona l medicaid benefit that allo ws states to cover home and communitybased longterm care services for people with disabilities the 109th congress also approved the lifespan re spite care act of 2006 p l 109 442 to provide grants to states to expand respite care services to family caregivers in order to assist congress in future policy deliberations about longterm care services and supports this report presents selected characteristic s of longterm care consumers and providers it then discusse s federal programs that finance longterm carehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33919crs3 defining longterm care as stated in the introduction longterm care services and s upports refer to broad range of health and social services needed by people who lack the capacity for selfcare due to physical cognitive or ntal disability or condition that results in functional impairment and dependence on others for an extended period of time services to assist people with longterm care needs as result of functional and cognitive impairments can range from helping frail elderly person bathe dress eat and use the bathroom to skills training and medication management for cognitively impaired person to use of special equipm ent or devices by physically impaired person to nursing care for ventilatordepe ndent child services may be provided in various settings including ones home and community in residential setting or in an institution longterm care services va ry widely in their intensity and cost depending on an individuals underlying c onditions the severity of his or her disabilities and the location in which services are provided the need for longterm care services is generally measured irrespective of age and diagnosis by the presence of limitations in the ability to perform basic personal care known as activities of daily living adls or by the need for supervision or guidance with adls because of mental or cognitive impairments adls generally refer to the following activities eating bathing and showering using the toilet dressing walking across small room and transferring getting in or out of bed or chair an additional set of criteria that assess activities other than basic personal care known as instrumental activities of daily living iadls measure persons ability to live independently in the community iadls include preparing meals managing money shopping for grocerie s or personal items performing housework using tele phone doing laundry getting around outside the home and taking medications references to persons need for longterm care assistance as measured by adls and iadls are used thr oughout this report some state long term care programs for people with mental retardation or developmental disabilities define eligibility for services based on specific diagnosis sometimes in combination with other factors such as functional limitations federal and state longterm care programs as well as many legislative proposals and private longterm care insuran ce often base eligibility for longterm care assistance on persons need for assistance with prescribed number of adl limitations or similar level of disability or the need for supervision in adls as result of cognitive impairment the number of people potentially eligible for assistance and therefore program cost will be affected by whether program or proposal targets those with fo r example one or more two or more or three or more limitations in adls generally people who need adl assistance also need assistance with iadls however eligibility for longterm care assistance through major public programs such as medicaid or through private longterm care insurance is not generally defined by the need for iadl assistance alonehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33919crs4 4 outside the scope of this report are data on those who need longterm care but do not receive care or do not receive sufficient care to meet their needs the data on unmet need for care are limited but some studies have ddressed the issues for example see harriet komisar et unmet longterm care needs an nalysis of medicaremedicaid dual

population receive longterm care services and supports while the likelihood of needing longterm care assistance occurs more frequently in older ages the need for longterm care affects people of all ages of all adults receiving longterm care assistance 58 are age 65 and older and 42 are age 1864 regardless of age people receivi ng longterm care assistance are more likely to reside at home and in community settings rather than in institutions more than threequarters of adults receiving long term care assistance reside at home and in community settings and many have fairly significant limitations most people who have intensive longterm care limitations that is have two or more limitations in adls have lower incomes and are more likely to live in poverty than people without limitations among the elderly people at the oldest ages ie 85 and older those most likely to need longterm care assistance have the lowest incomes selected demogra phic characteristics of longterm care consumers this section presents national survey mmary data on the number of adults and children who receive longterm care assistance4 the section then presents selected characteristics of adult consumers of longterm care identifying the longterm care population is challenging nd estimates of its size and characteristics vary widely there are many underlying causes for the inconsistent estimates provided through national data these include varying definitions of receipt of care how long receipt of care is evident whether person recei ves personal assistance from another person or is simply under supervision with an adl or iadl or whether the person uses assistive devices or equipment as result of disability see appendix forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33919crs5 5 crs calculations

longterm care affects individuals of all ages including children born with di sabling conditions and workingage adults children few nationally representative surveys to collect information on children with longterm care needs have been conducted results from one assessment the national health intervie w survey nhis suggested that 21 of children age 517 years living in the co mmunity in 2000 had limitations in their ability to walk to care for themselves or perform other activities not including special education services this transl ates to about 11 million children in this age range5 this calculation likely underestimates the number of children with longterm care needs as it excludes both children under age 5 and children who reside in facilities estimates for children are not discussed in greater detail in this report because the nhis definition of disability fo r children differs significantly from the definitions used that used to identif adults with longterm care needs adults table 1 provides broad estima tes of the number of adults who receive longterm care services because single nationally representative data set provides estimates in all of the major adult age

data and estimates of risk of using care estimating the potential future need for longterm care assistance either paid formal services or informal care provided by family mbers is complex and dependent upon many factors these include estimates of disability rates among the adult population as well as breakthroughs in medicine that might prevent or treat disabling conditions significant medical breakthroughs and more attention to treatment of diseases earlier in life could of course also lead to l onger age spans and therefore more people surviving to older ages need for longterm care is not an inevitable consequence of aging indeed as shown earlier almost onethird of people who live past 65 never need longterm care evidence accumulated over the past two decades shows people age 65 and older are living longer and healthier lives with the potential for working longer and postponing medical care needs16 possible decline in disability rates at older ages was first identified in the 1982 to 1989 waves of the national longterm care survey nltcs more recent evidence from the nltcs has confirmed this trend and indicates that the rate of declin has continued through the 20042005 period17 although the evidence is sometimes conflic ting subsequent wellpublicized studies using other data sets18 have suggested that rates of disability severe cognitive impairment and functional limitations have declined substantially in the elderly population the results of these studies have helped to establish that the disability decline may reflect real improvements in

home population medical care v 41 1 2003whether such improvements extend to all verity levels and types of disabling conditions remains unclear some evidence suggests that larger declines are due to improvements at the lower levels of disability specifically at the iadl levels the decline in disability as result of limitations in iadls has been attributed in part to increased use of assistive technology19 these improvements may have decreased individuals reliance on the need for pers onal assistance from another person recent results analyzing data from the 20042005 nltc s have also shown significant rates of disability decline among those with more severe impairments20 the longterm implications of disab ility decline among the population age 65 and older depend in large part on whether the trend continues and at what pace at this time however there is consensus about the likelihood of continued future disability decline among the elderly declines in disability may perhaps be affected by expected improvements in the economic status and educati onal attainment among the elderly the availability and effectiveness of assistive devices and the treatment or prevention of conditions that lead to disability may also contribute to improvements at the same time disability among th current cohorts of workingage americans who will soon be the future elde rly has been increasing over the past few decades some research has shown that people under 65 are experiencing fewer disabilityfree years this research has poi nted to increasing rates of disability in people at age 30 and at age 45 as result of certain conditions i ncluding respiratory disease congestive heart diseas and obesity among others21 lakdawalla and colleagues22 suggest that todays young cohorts will have higher ra tes and levels of institutionalization than their older counter parts because of rising disability among the younger cohorts that are beginning to pproach old age they project that the nursing home population will be 1025 higher than would be suggested by simple extrapolation of past declines in disability of course rates of institutionalization will also be affected by any changes in policies regarding use of various types of care specifically increased incentives for us of home and communitybased care despite uncertainty about tr ends in disability rates an increase in

projected demand for longterm car as the baby boom population ages is likely to affect service delivery patterns in the future these patterns will be affected by many factors including future av ailability of family mbers to provide uncompensated care the disposable income and assets individuals and families have to pay for services they want and change s in public policies that might affect what types of services will predominate while nursing home care has been the principal type of formal care recent federal nd state policy initiatives have emphasized greater use of home and communitybased services these initiatives have been undertaken in response to public preferen ce for home and communitybased services as well as to federal and state litigation that has called for expansion of care in such settings23 initiatives have included programs to divert people from using nursing homes as well as to transition people fro m nursing homes once they have entered many believe that an expansion of form home and communitybased services is needed to assist family caregivers who provide the bulk of care some research has also shown that even though the very old those 85 years and older have the highest rate of nursing home use their use of nursing homes is declining this has been attributed in part to declining rates of disability among this age group as well as improved financial resources to pay for services they want outside of nursing homes such as home nd communitybased services and assisted living facilities24 if these trends continue the na ture of the service system could change in future years with less reliance on nursing homes and more reliance on care in home and communitybased and alternative residential care settings for those people whose needs can be met in these settings others whose needs are more intensive may continue to rely on nursing home care indeed successive national surveys of nursing home residents have shown that over

of private care management providers who assist them in finding and arranging services while many people needing longterm care services receive assistance through agencybased care management and

allow for some fraction of the death benefit to be paid in advance to cover longterm care services82 despite the growth in the number of policies private longterm care insurance currently covers very small portion of all longterm care expenditures compared to other payers the national measure for pr ivate insurance spending the private insurance category of the national health accounts data includes spending by long term care insurance products as well as variety of other in surance products such as supplemental medicare coverage medig ap traditional health insurance and certain types of life insurance83 the national health ccounts data indicates that private insurance covered 149 billion 72 of the nations longterm care spending in in 2005 see figure 12 private longterm care insurance products cover certain longterm care services for policyholders who pay premiums and who meet the functional eg limitations in adls or behavioral eligibility criteria or the need for supervision based on cognitive impairments benefit features of these policies vary widely and care may be covered in variety of settings such as nursing facilities assisted living facilities or the individuals own home services that may be covered in homebased settings can include home health respite for caregivers homemaker and chore services and medical equipment among others84 according to survey of 5407 individual policies sold in 2000 77 c overed comprehensive benef its including nursing home and home care up from 37 in 1990 based on 14440 individual policies sold85 generally speaking buyers of

income or assets fo r spouse or passing on their wealth to their children others may be willing to take the ch ance of spending down their assets to qualify for medicaid if necessary 87 once policy is purchased premiums must remain fixed throughout the policyholders lifetime unless carrier receives approval fro m state insurance commissioner to raise rates for all policyholders in particular class premium increases of policies already sold may also vary by state some states may be more likely to approve insurers requests to increase rates than others states approval decisi ons are based in large part on the standards adopted by each statecostly with premiums depending greatly on the benefit packages purchased and the age of individuals at the time of purchase generally the older the individual the higher the premiums87 price is one of the reasons ma ny people in this demographic group do not buy longterm care insurance most people would find this product too expensive if they started considering pur chase when already retired others may not be able to afford it even while still working other reasons for the relatively low purchasing numbers may include lack of awareness of the risks of needing care lack of awareness of the costs of care and who pays for these costs and belief that ther is adequate public coverage through such programs as medicare retiree health insu rance or other health insurance products conclusion the need for longterm care affects people of all ages and the risk of needing longterm care at older ages can be substan tial despite significant spending on long term care through public s ources primarily medicaid mo st care provided to people with longterm care needs is provide d by families who provide care without compensation the aging of society w ill exacerbate demands on family caregivers for people with disabilities of all ages not only for the elderly in addition the increasing longevity of younger people w ith disabilities as well as evidence of increasing disability among the workingag populations may lead to more stress on family caregiving to assist families in their caregiving roles and to prepare for the aging of the baby boom population most obs ervers believe that expanded efforts to assist families may be warranted the vast majority of adults regardless of age over 80 receive care in home and community settings not in nursing homes or other institutions yet the major payer for longterm care the medi caid program principally has financed institutional care recent trends show howev er that this is changing with greater public resources directed at home and co mmunitybased care which is preferred by most individuals and families the ability of the service delivery system to keep up with demand for increased home and communitybased services may require continuing monitoring by policymakers challenges include uneven availability of home and communitybased services across and within states and an uncoordinatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33919crs45 service delivery system that is funded by many sources with differing eligibility requirements and serv ice requirements many people believe that planning for l ongterm care expenses is an essential part of financial planning but to date most families do not plan and are sometimes faced with bewildering array of formal care services some observers argue that the complexity of longterm care financin g for diverse groups of individuals with disabilities children and workingage persons with disabilities as well as the elderly with differing types and severity of impairments necessitates multi pronged strategy of financing and livery reform because of the diverse characteristics of the population in need one approach to financing may not fit all people defining the public and private sector roles in financing and delivery of longterm care for these groups may need to account for their differing needs and financial abilities to pay for the cost of care httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33919crs46 88 data refer to medicare enrollees nltcs tabulations 2005 appendix background on the national longterm care survey national health interview survey and medical expenditure panel survey data on persons age 65 and older estimates of the size and characteristics of the longterm care popul ation age 65 and older are based on the national long term care survey nltcs the nltcs is longitudinal survey designed to study changes in the health nd functional status of older americans it also tracks health expenditures medicare service use and the availability of personal family and community resources for care giving the survey began in 1982 and followup surveys were conducted in 1984 1989 1994 1999 and 2004 the surveys are funded through cooperativ agreement between the us national institute on aging nia and duke universitys center for demographic studies the analyses presented in this report are based on unpublished tabulations of 1999 data from the nltcs team at duke university88 results from the 2004 susrvey are not yet available users of longterm care are defined as all persons who are institutionalized plus persons with chronic disabilities expected to last 90 days or longer who reside at home and receive assistance to perform at least one activity of daily living adls or instrumental activities of daily living iadls six adls are included bathing dressing getting in or out of bed getting around inside using the toilet and eating nine iadls are included light housework heavy housework laundry meal preparation grocery shopping getting ar ound outside the home managing money taking medications and lephoning persons are considered to have an adl disability if they report receiving help or supervision or report using equipment to perform the activity or if they do not perform the activity at all because of their health or disability persons have an iadl disability if they report receiving help to perform the activity or report that they are unable to do the activity because of their health or disability benefits of using the nltcs data to ascertain the characteristics of the long term care population include that 1 th sampling frame is broad and includes persons living at home and in other community settings and in facilities 2 special efforts are made to oversam ple populations of particular interest including the oldestold and minorities 3 the data set allows analysis of the characteristics of the longterm care population by disability status age gender race marital status and other variables of interest 4 to the gree possible survey questions are asked of the person who has longterm care needs ra ther than of the head of household or home health aide 5 its results are for the population age 65 years and older which generally has greater longterm care need s than the younger population and 6 its results are broadly consistent with that of the few

assisted living and characteristics of facilities and residents washington dc dhhsaspe nov 2002a disadvantage of the survey is that because its sampling frame is drawn from medicare rolls it is representative of dicare beneficiaries only not of the underlying us population this is nor issue because about 95 of older americans are enrolled in medicare89 second issue is that some variables of interest are not collected at all and the results are unreliable for small number of policyrelevant variables for example policymakers are interested in the wealth and income profile of persons with longterm care needs because the provision of such services is expensive the nltcs coll ects data on income but not on wealth data on workingage persons the national health interview survey nhis is household sample survey conducted annually by interviewers of the us census bureau for the centers for diseas control and preventions cdc national center for health statistics nchs the most recent year for which these communitylevel results are available is 2003 however we utilize the older 1994 data from the nhis disability supplement the supplement data are more detailed and were specifically collected to better understand disability in the united states in addition there are number of c oncerns about the later 2003 data first the questionnaire is inconsistent with the other sources utilized in this report it asks about the need for rather than the actual receipt of help to perform subset of the adls need the help of other persons with personal care needs such as eating bathing dressing or getting around inside the home and iadls such as doing business shopping or getting around for other purposes second the questions are asked of the head of the household rather than of the person with the longterm care needs the medical expenditure panel survey meps is series of national probability surveys conducted by the agency for healthcare research and quality ahrq on the

care population identifying the longterm care population is challenging and timates of its size and characteristics vary widely data from the national long term care survey nltcs nationallyrepresentative sample of medicare enrollees ages 65 years and older illustrates how widely estimates of the number of older persons with long term care needs could vary depending upon the defi nition employed as seen in table b 1 about 71 million older persons had l ong term care needs in 1999 if all persons with adl or iadl disabilities plus all persons in institutions are counted if however one excludes persons who receive assistance with only iadls the estimate falls to 56 llion persons if persons who i ndependently manage their own disabilities through the use of assistive devices or other equipment are also excluded the estimate falls to 38 million older pe rsons large number of additional technically correct estimates are also possible if one utilizes different combinations of the data available table b1 illustration how different definitions of disability affect estimates of the number of longterm care recipients age 65 and over united states 1999 in

on set of tasks 91 different policy questions require different types of supporting data for instance the data required to project future nursing home us age by persons with three or more adls will

research and quality ahrq publication 000049 sept 2000 hereinafter sp ector and colleagues 2000there are many underlying causes for the inconsistent estimates of the longterm care population first most definitions of the need for longterm care are based on recipients underlying disability but there is gene rally agreed upon definition of disability while frequently measured by the selfreported90 longterm need for assistance to perform adls or iadls program and survey definitions appropriately91 vary widely even if an adl or iadl definition is employed enumeration of the population with disabilities varies across multiple dimensions including specification of the adliadl tasks included whether the survey question asks if the respondent has difficulty needs help receives help or is incapable of performing task the nature of help received by the person with disability whether direct human assistance standby help or the use of equipment assistive technolog to perform personal care activities whether the survey question uses the preamble because of ahealth or emotional problem the frame of reference does the person have the disabilityat the present time had the problem during the past month or ever whether the disability is chronic eg the respondent had thelimitation for at least 90 days who responded to the questionna ire actual respondent or proxy family member home health aide etc second national efforts to collect statis tical information on the longterm care population are fragmentary resulting in in complete and some times inconsistent information for instance the disab ility supplement to the national health interview survey nhisd92 provides the most compre hensive information to date about the prevalence of disabilities in th us populati on living in the community and the health and demographic char acteristics of the community population receiving longterm care93 however it collected information only about communitydwelling noninstitutionalized adults the national longterm carehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33919crs50 94 see httpnltcscdsdukeedu visited jan 27 2005 95 see httpwwwcdcgovnchsaboutmajornnhsdnnhsdhtm visited jan 27 2005survey nltcs94 has collected data for both community and institutionalized persons since 1984 but only for the population ages 65 and older and the national nursing home survey95 collects data only about pe rsons who reside in nursing homes third some surveys are facilitybased but the range of potential longterm care options for instance continuing care retirement communities assisted living nursing homes etc has expanded greatly over the past decade many facility based data collection efforts fail to capture the full range of longterm care providers or recipients in addition they usually do not capture persons with longterm care needs who reside at home fourth much statistical information has become outofdate for instance while the national health interview survey collects data annually its supplement on disability was last collected in 1994httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33919crs51 appendix c medicaid home and communitybased waiver services below is list of the wide array of
