structure also in this section trends in overall defense spending are shown including figures on the growth and decline of defense spending over time defense outlays as share of total federal expenditures and defense outlays as share of gross domestic product table of military spending by foreign nations is also included part iii defines key defense budget terms the significance of longterm defense spending trends depends to large extent on how budgetary data are interpreted for example while defense outlays are at historically low levels as percentage of total federal outlays this trend is more reflection of increases in federal entitlement programs most notably the escalating costs of medicare and social security than decreases in defense spending also while defense outlays as percentage of gdp are at their lowest levels since world war ii in constant dollar terms they remain comparable to average peacetime defense outlays during the cold war these data do not include funds from the fy2001 emergency appropriations act for recovery from and response to terrorist attack on the united states hr 2888 which provides 40 billion in emergency spending to be allocated by the administration in consultation with congress the funds are to be spent for the following purposes federal state and local preparedness for relief from and for responding to the attack

outlay numbers are higher in this table than the reported dod outlay numbers in the rest of the report the difference in the outlay numbers in this table and the others is military retired pay these estimates are based on purchasing power parity ppp estimates ppps measure the relative purchasing power of difference currencies over equivalent goods and services proponents of this method argue that it better accounts for the substantial differences in relative prices for defense goods these data were estimated by iiss and not based on reported data from the individual country rank ordering is as
