in global health foreign affairs defense and trade division tuberculosis international efforts and issues for congress summary infectious diseases are estimated to cause more than 25 of all deaths around the world number of infectious disease outbreaks over the past decade such as h5n1 avian influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars have heightened concerns about how infectious diseases might threaten global security international air travel and trade have complicated efforts to detect and contain infectious diseases people could cross borders carrying highly contagious disease before an infectious agent causes symptoms nonhealth officials are becoming increasingly aware of the threat that infectious diseases pose an event that illuminated the issue occurred in may 2007 when man known to be carrying drugresistant form of tuberculosis tb crossed number of international borders unabated the world health organization who estimates that someone contracts tb every second and that about onethird of all people in the world carry tb most of these cases however are latent in 2006 an estimated 144 million people were living with tb globally including 92 million who contracted the disease that year about 17 million people carrying tb died in 2006 including 200000 people coinfected with hivaids about 80 of all estimated new tb cases arising in the world each year occur in 22 highburden countries hbcs who indicates that the global incidence of tb per capita peaked around 2003 and since then incidence per 100000 population stabilized in europe and declined in all five who regions although the absolute number of new cases increased between 2005 and 2006 in africa the middle east europe and southeast asia in subsaharan africa weak health systems minimal access to health facilities insufficient staffing and little human resource development illequipped and substandard laboratories and human immunodeficiency virusacquired immunodeficiency syndrome hivaids coinfection have limited countries ability to contain tb in fy2008 congress funded us global tb operations at unprecedented levels through fy2008 consolidated appropriations congress provided 1622 million to international tb programs and an additional 8403 million for us contribution to the global fund to fight hivaids tb and malaria global fund the house passed and the senate foreign relations committees reported out companion tb bills stop tb now act hr 1567 and s 968 to support global tb efforts and authorize 330 million in fy2008 and 450 million in fy2009 they also authorized 70 million and 100 million for antitb programs at the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc in fy2008 and fy2009 respectively although congress voted to increase support for global tb efforts some members expressed concern that the additional funds might be provided at the expense of other global health programs the administration requested 971 million for fy2009 global tb efforts some 55 million less than appropriated in fy2008 this report which will be updated periodically discusses some key issues congress might consider as debate ensues about the proper level and use of

council nic released report asserting that new and reemerging infectious diseases will pose rising threat to us and global security over the next 20 years these diseases will endanger us citizens at home and abroad threaten us armed forces deployed overseas and exacerbate social and political instability in key countries and regions in which the united states has significant interests1 nic cited number of factors that heighten the infectious diseases threat including increasing drug resistance slow development of new antibiotics urban sprawl environmental degradation and the growing ease and frequency of crossborder movements over the past decade there has been considerable debate about countries abilities to contain and prevent infectious disease outbreaks in 2002 the international community struggled to identify an unknown infectious disease that rapidly spread across 31 countries infected more than 8400 people and killed 813 of those who contracted it in 2003 when the disease was ultimately contained scientists called the agent severe acute respiratory syndrome sars2 that same year influenza ah5n1 bird flu reemerged and spread to more than 50 countries as of april 17 2008 381 people have contracted h5n1 240 of whom died3 about 63 of those who contracted the disease have died tuberculosis tb is one of the most widespread infectious diseases in the world the world health organization who estimates that someone contracts tb every second and that about onethird of all people in the world are currently infected with tb most 1 national intelligence council the global

contagious disease that spreads through the air when infectious people cough sneeze talk or spit people with tb are only infectious when the bacteria is active those with active tb who do not receive treatment and are not properly quarantined infect on average between 10 and 15 people every year5 tb can lie dormant in an infected person for years and may not cause any symptoms or illness the tb bacteria most often becomes active and causes sickness when ones immune system is weakened such as with human immunodeficiency virusacquired immunodeficiency syndrome hivaids global tb statistics6 although tb is curable who estimates that in 2006 the year for which the most current data are available there were 144 million prevalent cases of tb including some 92 million people who contracted the disease that year7 about 80 of annual tb cases occur in 22 highburden countries see figure 1 in the appendix8 all but two of those highburden countries were in africa or asia9 more than 50 of all new tb cases occurred in five countries in descending order of tb cases india china indonesia south africa and nigeria the disease killed an estimated 17 million people in 2006 including 230857 who were also infected with hivaids see table 1 in the appendix although southeast asia had the highest number of new tb cases incidence and mortality per capita rates were considerably higher in subsaharan africa among the 15 countries with the highest estimated tb incidence rates 13 were in africa due in part to relatively high rates of hiv coinfection see table 2 in the appendix10 in 2006 about 310 million people in southeast asia were newly infected with tb 109 per 100000 people and about 281 million in subsaharan africa 363 per 100000 the actual number of tbrelated deaths and the mortality per capita rates were higher in subsaharan africa than in southeast asia about 514699 people 4 people who have latent tb infection do not feel sick do not have any symptoms and cannot spread tb to others latent tb becomes active when the host becomes infectious and begins to feel ill 5 information in this paragraph was summarized from whos fact sheet on tuberculosis at

httpwwwwhointtbpublicationsglobal_report2008pdffullreportpdf 7 the incidence of disease is the number of new cases arising within given time period such as year the prevalence is the total number of cases that exist within given time period prevalence is sometimes referred to as burden prevalence and burden are used interchangeably in this report 8 the 22 highburden countries in descending order of absolute tb case numbers were india china indonesia south africa nigeria bangladesh ethiopia pakistan philippines democratic republic of congo russia vietnam kenya tanzania uganda brazil mozambique thailand burma zimbabwe cambodia and afghanistan 9 of the high burdencountries brazil and russia are not in africa or asia 10 the 15 countries with the highest tb incidence per capita rates in order from highest to lowest rates were swaziland south africa djibouti namibia lesotho zimbabwe east timor zambia botswana sierra leone cambodia mozambique cote divoire congo and rwanda crs3 died of tb in southeast asia 30 per 100000 infected while some 639089 people died of tb in subsaharan africa 83 per 100000 infected who asserts that number of factors contribute to africas relatively high per capita rate key factors include weak health systems low quality health care poor access to health facilities insufficient staffing and other human resource constraints illequipped and substandard laboratory services and little collaboration between tb and hiv programs hivaids and tb in areas with significant hivaids prevalence the virus is contributing to rising tb prevalence11 people living with hivaids are at greater risk of contracting tb because of their weakened immunity each disease accelerates the advancement of the other tb considerably shortens the survival of people with hivaids and quickens the progression of hiv into aids meanwhile hivaids is the most potent risk factor for converting latent tb into active tb many people infected with hivaids in developing countries develop tb as the first manifestation of aids the two diseases represent deadly combination since they are more destructive together than either disease alone other key facts about hivaidstb coinfection include in hivpositive people tb is harder to diagnose progresses faster is almost always fatal if undiagnosed or left untreated and kills up to half of all aids patients worldwide people with hivaids are up to 50 times more likely to develop tb in given year than hivnegative people and about 90 of people living with hivaids die within four to twelve months of contracting tb if they are not treated for tb in subsaharan africa hivaids and tb coinfection is becoming growing problem in 2006 about 85 of all hivpositive people with tb were found in africa12 that year an estimated 709000 people were coinfected with hivaids and tb some 606000 of whom were african about 205000 of the 231000 co infected patients who died from tb were african representing 89 of those deaths in countries with high hivaids prevalence hivtb coinfection poses significant health challenge in swaziland for example 75 of tb patients were hivpositive13 south africa with 07 of the worlds population and the most number of people living with hivaids had 28 of all hivtb coinfection cases and 33 of hivpositive cases in subsaharan africa in many highburden countries particularly in subsaharan africa tb patients are not yet routinely tested for hiv and hiv patients are not yet routinely tested for 11 information in this paragraph was compiled by crs from who frequently asked questions about tb and hivaids

global_report2008pdffullreportpdf 13 who 2007 global tuberculosis control surveillance planning financing at httpwwwwhointtbpublicationsglobal_reportenindexhtml crs4 tb14 hiv testing for tb patients has increased however between 2002 and 2006 in 2002 nine countries reported testing 21806 tb cases for hiv representing less than 1 of notified tb cases by 2006 112 countries had reported testing 687174 patients for hiv equivalent to about 12 of notified tb cases in africa 287945 patients were tested for hiv some 22 of all notified tb cases in africa hiv testing of tb patients increased from 75 to 35 from 2004 to 2006 the testing increase was driven primarily by kenya and south africa in spite of improvements in hiv testing in africa the region still lagged behind other countries on average 56 of tb patients were tested for hiv outside of africa drug resistance to tb treatments multidrug resistant tb mdrtb mdrtb are tb organisms that do not respond to at least two firstline drugs15 drug resistance mostly arises from poor treatment adherence or incorrect drug usage adherence means taking accurately prescribed drugs in the right amounts at the correct time if the wrong drugs or the wrong combinations of drugs are prescribed providers fail to ensure that they are taken correctly on schedule or patients do not take their medicine for the full term tb may become resistant to the drugs the development of mdrtb is particularly troubling to scientists because mdrtb carriers can transmit resistant forms of tb to others mdrtb is transmissible even among those who have never had tb research has indicated that patients are less likely to complete regimens for treatmentresistant forms of tb in part because resistant forms take longer to cure nonresistant forms of tb take between six and nine months to cure while mdrtb takes about two years to cure mdrtb treatments are also more toxic more expensive often of limited availability in resourcelimited settings and generally less effective especially among hivpositive people if patients adhere to treatment regimens cure rates for nonresistant tb range between 80 and 95 cure rates for mdrtb range between 50 and 60 who advises that health care providers treat mdrtb patients in separate facilities than those with hivaids separating mdrtb patients from hivaids 14 information in this paragraph was compiled by crs from who 2008 global tuberculosis control report p 48 at httpwwwwhointtbpublicationsglobal_report 2008pdffullreportpdf 15 unless otherwise specified data on mdrtb was compiled by crs from who

httpwwwwhointentitytbpublications 2008drs_report4_26feb08pdf general tb statistics included throughout this report were mostly taken from whos 2007 global tuberculosis control report data in this paragraph may vary slightly from those as they were taken from whos 2008 report anti tuberculosis in the world which included more recent statistics on drug resistance but did not provide analysis on tb generally crs5 patients can be particularly challenging in resourcelimited settings where hospitals are frequently overcrowded illequipped and unable to house individuals for the entire treatment term in areas with high hivprevalence efforts to care for mdr tb patients separately from hivaids patients are often complicated by the high proportion of hospital beds filled with hivaids patients in february 2008 who released report on tb drug resistance that summarized findings from surveys conducted between 2002 and 2006 in 81 countries16 based on those surveys who estimates that almost 490000 mdrtb cases emerged in 2006 representing about 5 of all new tb cases though mdr tb rates varied widely from 0 in some western european countries to over 35 in some former soviet states among the 490000 mdrtb cases 285718 were new cases and 203230 had been previously treated who estimated that of the countries for which adequate data exist china india and russia are estimated to have the highest number of mdrtb cases china and india hold about 50 of all mdrtb cases and russia comprises another 7 russia has the greatest proportion of mdrtb cases among new ones however about 13 of all new tb cases were mdrtb 19 of all tb cases were mdrtb and almost 50 of previously treated tb cases were identified as mdrtb17 although other hbc reported equally high mdrtb rates number of eastern european countries are estimated to have greater proportion of mdrttb prevalent rates who has identified 27 countries which together account for about 86 of all global mdrtb cases 15 of them are in eastern europe see figure 1 and table 3 in the appendix although whos report provided greater insight into the prevalence of drug resistant forms of tb little is known about resistance in africa the findings included in the report were estimated to have measured about onehalf of all drug resistant tb cases because the surveys were conducted only in those countries with the capacity to conduct drug resistance surveys such capacity remains limited in africa findings from six countries in subsaharan africa were included in the analysis cote divoire ethiopia madagascar rwanda senegal and tanzania data from south africa were included in the illustrations and tables throughout the report but not in the analysis because who used different methodology to analyze data previously collected from south africa based on available data who estimates that in 2006 some 2 of all tb cases were mdrtb in africa 7 in the western pacific region and 19 in eastern europe see table 4 in the appendix who asserts that although it can use available data to approximate the global burden of mdrtb it cannot detect global changes in mdrtb prevalence because data in many highburden countries are unavailable incomplete andor have only recently begun to be compiled the organization can however extrapolate trends in key areas who found that mdr tb cases declined in china and the united states were stable in thailand some 16 unless otherwise indicated data included in this section was taken from who anti tuberculosis in the world 2008 pp 73 and 82 17 who 2008 global tuberculosis control report p51 crs6 parts of vietnam and three baltic countries and increased in the republic of korea and peru in peru decline in tb notification rates suggests weaknesses in tb control in korea the tb burden is shifting to the elderly and the number of mdr tb cases among new tb cases is increasing two regions in the russian federation are showing increases in the proportion of mdrtb among new cases at very rapid rate while the tb notification rate in those regions is falling slowly who has indicated that similar outbreaks of drug resistance with associated high mortality are likely occurring in other african countries but are going undetected because of insufficient laboratory capacity18 mdrtb patients are not yet routinely checked for hivaids in africa though they are extremely susceptible to the disease botswana mozambique and south africa are reportedly the only countries in subsaharan africa that routinely test drugresistant tb cases for hiv19 according to the latest available data in 2006 almost 90 of new mdrtb cases that occurred in the three countries were found in high hivprevalent settings extensive drug resistant xdrtb mdrtb is considered xdrtb when it becomes resistant to three or more of the six classes of secondline drugs in highquality health facilities xdrtb treatment is successful in 30 of the cases in lowresource settings xdrtb is almost always fatal who is uncertain about the extent of xdrtb prevalence in large part because drug resistance testing to secondline drugs is not available in most highburden countries20 the majority of countries that reported xdrtb cases to who were lowburden countries and do not reflect the global magnitude of the phenomenon who estimates that xdrtb is widespread with 45 countries having reported at least one case survey conducted by who and the centers for disease control and prevention cdc on data from 20002004 found that xdrtb occurs in all regions of the world but most frequently in the countries of the former soviet union and asia21 in the united states 4 of mdrtb cases met the criteria for xdrtb in latvia country with one of the highest rates of mdrtb 19 of mdrtb cases met the xdrtb criteria 18 unless

at httpwwwwhointmediacentrenewsnotes2006 np23enindexhtml crs7 concern about the spread of xdrtb rose in may 2006 when an outbreak caused several deaths in kwazulunatal south africa many health experts were alarmed by the high mortality rates south african officials invited cdc and who to assess the situation five hundred fortyfour patients were studied 221 were diagnosed with mdrtb including 53 cases determined to be xdrtb fortyfour of the 53 xdrtb cases were tested for hivaids all were hivaidspositive only one of the 53 patients with xdrtb survived on average the 52 patients died within 25 days including those who received antiretroviral drugs who has indicated that similar outbreaks of drug resistance with associated high mortality are taking place in other african countries but going undetected because of insufficient laboratory capacity22 hivaids patients are not yet routinely checked for tb in africa except in botswana mozambique and south africa though they are extremely susceptible to the disease according to latest estimates 996 of 17615 mdrtb cases in south africa were identified as xdrtb representing some 56 of all mdrtb cases xdrtb cases were considerably higher in kwazulunatal with some 14 656 cases of all mdrtb cases identified as xdrtb some observers believe more undetected cases may exist in the country asserting that testing results are often inaccurate testing methods are outdated and many patients die before they are diagnosed on january 16 2008 the government of botswana confirmed that 100 people were diagnosed with mdrtb and an additional two were diagnosed with xdr tb23 botswanas ministry of health officials are urging those with chronic coughs and all who have been exposed to patients with active tb to go to their nearest health facility to be tested who has ramped up its xdrtb efforts in southern africa24 delegation of who officials and its partners visited lesotho early 2008 to help plan xdrtb surveillance and treatment as well as improve basic tb control similar missions were also held in malawi and swaziland in february 2008 in march 2008 team of who officers began to assist kwazulunatal authorities investigate the origin and

dots strategy to combat tb31 dots has five key components political commitment with increased and sustained financing tb detection through bacteriology the recommended method of tb case detection standardized treatment with supervision and patient support effective drug supply and management systems and monitoring and evaluation systems and impact measurement in 2000 who and its partners launched the first global plan to stop tb which outlined what actions needed to be taken from 2001 to 2005 to control tb by 2004 more than 20 million patients had been treated in dots programs worldwide and more than 16 million of them had been cured mortality due to tb has been declining and incidence diminishing or stabilizing in all regions except subsaharan africa and eastern europe the global treatment success rate among new smearpositive tb cases had reached 83 by 2003 just short of the wha target of 85 by 2005 and in 2004 the case detection rate which has accelerated globally since 2001 was 53 against the target of 70 by 2005 in 2005 who member states passed resolution that advocated member states provide sustainable financing for tb control and prevention and commit to achieve the tbrelated targets included in the millennium development goals 29 smearpositive test detects the presence of tb bacilli in sputum material that is coughed up from the lungs sample smearnegative test detects tb bacilli in sputum sample though the person carries tb people who are coinfected with hiv and tb frequently have smearnegative results and subsequent chest xrays if available may also look normal tb diagnoses are often belatedly made in coinfected people since many with hiv develop forms of tb outside of the lungs culturing the organism can usually provide

international tb efforts and directing ogac to provide not less than 150 million for joint hivtb programs although congress voted to increase support for global tb efforts some members expressed concern that the additional funds might be provided at the expense of other global health programs the section below presents some issues congress might consider as it debates the appropriate level of funding for global tb initiatives strengthen health systems who asserts that weak health systems play key role in the continued spread of tb across africa many health practitioners argue that inadequate access to rapid and accurate diagnostic tests significantly contribute to the rise in new tb cases on the continent more than century after its development in most developing countries tb is primarily identified through microscopic examination of sputum this tool however only detects from 40 to 60 of tb cases and as little as 20 of hiv coinfected cases44 although sputum testing has limited reliability this procedure is the most widely used in developing countries and is usually performed only after tb treatment has failed after which the patient could have transmitted the disease to others about 85 of all countries who reported tb testing practices to who indicated that all suspected pulmonary tb cases undergo sputum testing of the 22 hbcs 7 did not meet the minimum requirement of at least one sputum testing laboratory per 100000 persons see table 7 in the appendix health experts also advocate for improved access to advanced testing technology because sputum tests do not reliably detect smearnegative tb cases particularly among hivpositive patients45 culturing process requiring laboratory diagnosis is the most definitive method of detecting tb particularly in smear negative cases who recommends that countries have at least one laboratory per 5 million people that is capable of culturing samples seven of the 22 highburden countries meet this minimum requirement brazil 51 cambodia 11 china 14 russia 340 south africa 13 thailand 51 and vietnam 10 meet this 44 gates foundation tuberculosis backgrounder accessed on march 6 2008 httpwwwgatesfoundationorgglobalhealthpri_diseasestuberculosistb_backgrou nderhtm 45 smearpositive test detects the presence of tb bacilli in sputum material that is coughed up from the lungs sample smearnegative test detects tb bacilli in sputum sample though the person carries tb people who are coinfected with hiv and tb frequently have smearnegative results and subsequent chest xrays if available may also look normal tb diagnoses are often belatedly made in coinfected people since many with hiv develop tb outside the lungs culturing the organism can usually provide definitive diagnosis but culturing takes weeks and requires laboratory capacities that are usually unavailable in many resourcelimited settings see who 2007 global tuberculosis control report who improving the

is the only country in subsaharan africa that meets this criteria in order to prescribe medications properly laboratories must be capable of conducting drug susceptibility tests dst prescribing the wrong medication or dosage not only minimizes the effectiveness of tb treatments but can also lead to drug resistance who recommends that countries have at least one dst lab per 10 million people of the 22 highburden countries bangladesh and nigeria have dst labs nine countries have one dst lab to serve their entire population about onethird of highburden countries and nine meet the minimum of one per 10 million people brazil cambodia china indonesia russia south africa thailand uganda and vietnam in many countries patients might experience lapses in tb treatments because clinics might not have the medicines in stock irregular drug deliveries are often caused by poor data collection deficient road and transport conditions and poor quality distribution systems inconsistent use of medication can reduce the potency of tb treatments extend the term of use and result in drug resistence health advocates argue that in order to boost the impact of tb programs congressional support for tb efforts must be accompanied by funding of health systems including laboratory systems the african health capacity investment act of 2007 hr 3812s 805 aims to address some of these issues the bills authorize funds to improve health care capacity on the continent related activities include training african health care workers providing incentive to retain health worker and establishing offsite hivaids testing and treatment facilities for health care providers the bill also requires the president to develop strategy that would coordinate healthrelated strategies with other donors address health worker and health center shortages shortages of properly trained health care workers and sufficiently equipped health centers in highburden countries particularly in africa complicate efforts to properly contain and treat tb cases most of the 22 highburden countries do not have enough health workers to meet the most basic health care needs including identifying and treating tb cases and monitoring drug usage see table 8 in the appendix46 in addition many health centers are unable to contain airborne infections like tb47 46 who 2006 world health report working together for health at httpwwwwhoint whr2006en the joint learning initiative jli network of global health leaders defines shortage as less than 25 health care professionals per 1000 people the minimum proportion it deemed necessary to provide 80 of countrys population with basic health care 47 who 2007 world health report safer future global public health security in the 21st century httpwwwwhointwhr2007whr07_enpdf crs16 high hiv prevalence in some parts of africa further complicates shortage issues because hiv and tb patients are usually housed within close proximity of each other in poorly equipped facilities who maintains that in order for countries to effectively control tb and prevent increases in mdrtb and xdrtb cases hivaids and tb patients should be housed separately and teams of health workers should be trained specifically to manage drug resistance and work in hospitals or isolation units dedicated to tb patients another challenge is that in some countries with high hiv prevalence significant number of health workers are hivpositive posing risk to themselves and their patients who contends that all of these issues converge to cause the extremely high mortality in kwazulunatal48 it is widely understood that mdrtb is caused in large part by poor treatment adherence health worker shortages lessen the likelihood that the dispensing of medication will be properly supervised who fears that the inability to manage sufficiently first and secondline treatments will lead to rise in xdrtb cases49 global health advocates urge congress to increase support for health worker training fund initiatives that supplement the salaries and provide incentives for indigenous health workers and stop recruiting health practitioners from countries with shortages to fill us health positions integrate hivaids and tb programs global health experts are concerned about how hivaids and tb are converging to worsen mortality rates particularly in africa early diagnosis and treatment of both diseases can extend life expectancy and in the case of tb decrease transmission rates greater awareness about the intersection of these diseases has led many health practitioners to routinely test tb patients for hiv while who applauds those efforts it has expressed concern that hiv patients are not yet routinely tested for tb in most highburden countries who asserts that countries could significantly improve tb case identification if health professionals would routinely test all those newly diagnosed with hiv for tb proponents of this idea contend that the practice could ameliorate outcomes of hiv and tb programs reduce overall program costs and make tb and hivaids efforts more efficient in fy2006 ogac reportedly spent nearly 50 million on tb efforts in the 15 focus countries and about 120 million on addressing hivtb coinfection in fy2007 health advocates urge congress to increase funding for programs that integrate hivaids and tb

research treatments many health experts urge congress to increase support for tb research that could lead to the development of treatments with shorter regimens which might improve adherence on average patients must take their medicines daily for sixtoeight months to be fully cured supporters contend that improved adherence might reduce the incidence of emergent drugresistant tb strains who and others are seeking to develop new tb treatments that will be effective against mdrtb can cure patients between one and two months and will cure latent tb infection researchers are also attempting to develop drugs that will be affordable and easily managed in resourcelimited settings vaccines advocates maintain that congressional support for tb research should include tb vaccine research health experts assert that bacille calmette guerin bcg vaccine currently administered to millions of newborns around the world effectively prevents tb in childhood but not in adulthood proponents urge congress to support organizations like aeras global tb vaccine foundation which are seeking to develop vaccine that protects the innoculated throughout their lives50 diagnostic tools tb experts stress the need for new diagnostic tests that could be more easily used in lowresource settings at present culturing is required to provide definitive diagnosis culturing however takes weeks and requires laboratory capacities that are usually unavailable in many resourcelimited settings advocates urge congress to support efforts such as whos tuberculosis diagnostics initiative tbdi which forms partnerships with the private sector academic researchers and national and local health officials to facilitate and accelerate the development of diagnostic tools51 in 2007 representatives gene green and sherrod brown introduced hr 1532 and s 1551 the comprehensive tuberculosis elimination act of 2007 the bills amend section 317e of the public health service act 42 usc 247b6 to authorize funds for

infected with xdrtb has intensified particularly in south africa in january 2007 who issued statement indicating that if patient wilfully refuses treatment and as result is danger to the public the serious threat posed by xdrtb means that limiting that individuals human rights may be necessary to protect the wider public52 forcefully detaining people carrying xdrtb has number of human rights implications the low quality of some health facilities in highburden countries complicates arguments about involuntary detention number of individuals being forcefully isolated in south african health centers reportedly held protests and walked out of facilities complaining of poor treatment and prisonlike conditions one patient was reportedly shot while attempting to leave the premises53 several provinces in south africa have reportedly taken legal action to force drug resistant tb patients to stay in hospitals in isolation units surrounded by wire fences and protected by guards54 the south african medical research council mrc asserts that forcibly quarantining individuals is complicated issue because mdr and xdrtb patients might never be cured mdr and xdrtb are difficult to cure in lowresource settings forcing the patients to be confined until death mrc does not support coerced treatment because of the lower success rate of resistant forms of tb and the reduced life expectancy of mdrtb patients55 some observers point out that forced isolation is also complicated by socio economic factors56 about 10 million south africans about 25 of the population receive some form of social welfare south african policy mandates that those who are hospitalized at the countrys expense lose their government assistance many mdrtb patients choose not to stay in hospitals in part because they can not earn money or receive assistance while hospitalized and mdrtb treatment takes between 18 and 24 months 52 who who guidance on human rights and involuntary detention for xdrtb

bank to study the economic impacts of tb at the household and macro level in africa at the household level some analysts contend that people sickened by tb experience reduced earning potential which in impoverished areas might induce them to avoid or discontinue treatment as soon as symptoms abate at the macro level observers assert that the crowded poorly planned unsanitary conditions that often characterize urban slums facilitate transmission of tb some 1 billion people are believed to live in urban slums and the figure is expected to reach 2 billion in the next 30 years in the worlds
