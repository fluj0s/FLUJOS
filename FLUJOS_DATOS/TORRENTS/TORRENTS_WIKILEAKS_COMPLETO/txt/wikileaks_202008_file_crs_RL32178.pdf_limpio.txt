this section would require the federal energy regulatory commission ferc to promulgate rules within 180 days of enactment to create ferccertified elect ric reliability organization ero the ero would develop and enforce reliability standards for the bulkpower system all ero standards would be approved by ferc under this title the ero could impose penalties on user owner or operator of the bulkpower system that violates any fercapproved reliability st andard in addition ferc could order compliance with reliability standard and could impose penalty if ferc finds that user owner or operator of the bulkpower system has gaged in or is about to engage in violation of reliability standard this provision would not give an ero or ferc authorization to order cons truction of additional genera tion or transmission capacity this provision would also require that ferc establish regional advisory body if requested by at least twothirds of th states within region that have more than half of their electric load served within that region the advisory body would be composed of one member from each partic ipating state in the region appointed byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32178crs2 the governor of each state and could provide advice to the ero or ferc on reliability standards proposed regional ent ities pr oposed fees and any other responsibilities requested by ferc the tire reliability provision would not apply to alaska or hawaii current law the north ameri can electric reliability council nerc has responsibility for reliability of the bul k power system nerc has established reliability guidelines but has enforcement authority the federal power act gives ferc jurisdiction over unbundled transmi ssion and was intended to regulate wholesale rates however authority was provided to regulate reliability policy context the proposed legislation is intended to provide federal jurisdiction over activities that are required to support relia bility of the united states bulk power system clarifying ferc author ity to establish and regulate an ero is intended to improve reliability as restructuring of the us bulk power system proceeds similar provisions were included in the housepassed and senatepassed hr 6 advocates of giving ferc authority over the ero contend that central jurisdiction would provide more acc ountability ferc would be ultimately responsible for reliability issues if th penalties employed by the ero were not successful then ferc would have the authority to enforce penalties for entities that did not comply with reliability standards establishing this new relationship between ferc and the ero would have the poten tial to improve c oordination between market functions and reliability functions those opposed to giving ferc jurisdiction over bulk power system reliability contend that ferc has experience in this area if ferc is given this authority it would have to rely on nerc for much of its expertise placing ferc in this position may add to the uncertainty associated with the changes in institutional structure as ferc takes on this new role subtitle b transmission in frastructure modernization section 1221 siting of interstate electric transmission facilities the secretary of energy would be required to conduct study of electric transmission congestion every three years based on the findings the secretary of energy could designate geographic area as being c ongested under certain conditions ferc would be authorized to issue construc tion permits under proposed federal power act fpa section 216d affected

proposed construction permit however there is requirement for specific comment period new fpa section 216e w ould allow permit holders to pe tition in us district court to acquire rightsofway through the exercise of the right of eminent domain any exercise of eminent domain authority would be considered to be takings of private property for which just compensation is due new fpa section 216g does not state whether property owners will be required to reimburse compensation if the rightsofway are transferred back to the owner an applicant for federal authorization to site transmission facilities

appealed by the applicant or relevant state to the secretary of energy the secretary of energy would be required to issue decision within 90 days of the appeals filing states could enter into interstate compacts for the purposes of siting transmission facilities and the secretary of energy could provide technical assistance this section would not apply to the electric reliability council of texas rcot similar provision was included in the housepassed hr 6 current law regulatory jurisdiction over th electricity industry is divided between federal and state authorities with individual states overseeing activities considered intrastate and with ferc regulating the interstate aspects of electricity and natural gas commerce1 under the federal power act siting of transmission lines is the responsibility of the states section 1222 thirdparty finance the western area power administration wapa and the southwestern power ad ministration swpa would be able to either continue to design develop construct operate maintain or own transmission facilities within their region or participate with other entities for the same purposes if the secretary of energy designates the area as national interest electric transmission corridor and the project w ould reduce congestion or the project is needed to accommodate projected increas in demand for transmission capacity the project would need to be consistent with the needs identified by the appropriate regional transmission organization or indepe ndent system operator more than 100 million from thirdparty fina ncing may be used

connecticut maine massachusetts new hampshire and rhode island released statement that voiced support for fercs ongoing effort to remedy undue disc rimination in the use of th nations interstate high voltage transmission system in order to create truly competitive bulk power market some industry groups have voi ced concerns about the implementation of smd on april 28 2003 ferc staff issued wholesale power market platform white paper that intended to clarif fercs smd proposal the white paper responds to approximately 1000 sets of formal comments submitted to ferc in the white paper ferc states its intention to eliminate proposed requirement that utilities join an independent transmission provider instead the final rule would require utilities to join an rto or iso in the nopr ferc pr oposed to assert jurisdiction over the transmission component of bundled retail service the white paper reverses this position and states that the final rule will not assert new ferc jurisdiction over bundl ed retail sales some state officials have expressed concern that the proposed rule would infringe on state authority ferc responded to this in the white paper by clarifyinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32178crs7 6 conference report hrept 10810 to accompany hjres 2that the final rule would not include requirement for minimum level of resource adequacy in addition the final rule w ould eliminate the noprs requirement that firm transmission rights be auctioned the white paper noted that each rto or iso would need to have cost recovery policy outlined in its tariff but each region may differ on how participant funding would be used in addition ferc stated that the final rule would allow for phased imple mentation to address regional differences the report language that accompanied the fy2003 consolidated appropriations resolution asked the department of energy to analyze the smd noprs impact on wholesale electricity prices and the safety and reliability of generation and transmission facilities6 doe issued its report to congress on april 30 2003 but did not include changes from fercs white paper in its analysis doe in part quantitatively analyzed the wholesale and retail price impacts of smd using two economic models general electrics multiarea production simulation maps and does policy office electricity modeling system poems some of the assumptions that doe uses are the annual increase in electricity demand is assumed to be approximate ly 18 per year from 2005 to 2020 most regions are assumed to have reserve margins of 15 curre nt environmental laws and regulations are assumed to apply generator efficiency for fossil steam plants is assumed to be 2 to 4 higher in ne w rto regions with smd in the nonsmd case the models were not able to take into account freezes on retail rates in states that are transitioning to competitive markets and increase in transmission capacity is assumed under the smd case 5 increase in transmission capability by 2005 is assumed by doe due to improved operational efficiency at regional seams in addition doe assumes that adopting the smd would result in some savings that are difficult to quantify but would be re sult of several factors including the consolidation of control areas from the cu rrently existing 150 the possible avoidance of capital cost and software expenditures that would have been needed at existing control centers improved regi onal planning and consistenc of market design doe assigns 10 savings due to these efficien cy improvements doe believes that the assumptions used in the models are cons ervative and result in an underestimation of the net economic bene fits of the smd doe calculates the median cost of fercs smd rule to be about 760 million per year or about 21 cents per megawatt hour the models range for uncertainties is estimated to be about 100 million the cost varies significantly by region ranging from 47 cents per megawatthour fo r gridflorida to 12 cents per megawatt hour for pjm regions with existing rtos have zero additional costs under the smd case the effects of smd on retail rates are influenced to significant extent by whether the states in question have costofservice regulation or competitive retail choice doe found that for some importing regions with costbased rates the net result could be increased costs associated with wholesale purchases which would be passed through to retail customers for some exporting regions with costbased rates additional utility revenues from exports are expected to lead to lower retail prices for the region under the smd case in contrast in regions in which most states have adopted retail choice increased electricity exports are ex pected to lead to higherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32178crs8 marketclearing prices in the shortterm markets and somewhat higher consumer prices however in areas such as calif ornia that are projected to see increased imports lower wholesale prices and lower prices for consumers are expected doe found that the magnitude of the project ed changes both positive and negative decreases through 2020 overall doe proj ects the net benefit for all consumers would be about 1 billion per year over the first 6 years after factoring in the estimated 760 million per year and rto cost s over the longterm 20162020 the net benefit is expected to be about 700 million per year however the projected change in retail prices varies by region the midatlantic region is expected to see 4 decrease in retail prices but illinoi s wisconsin and arizona are expected to have 3 increase in retail prices as result of smd section 1236 native load service obligation this section would amend the federal power act to clarify that loadserving entity is entitled to use its transmission facilities or firm transmission rights to serve its existing customers before it is obligated to make its transmission capacity available for other uses ferc would not be able to change any pproved allocation of transmission rights by an rto or iso approved prior to september 15 2003 similar provision was included in the housepassed hr 6 current law section 201 of the federal po wer act gives ferc jurisdiction over the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and the sale of such energy at wholesale in interstate comme rce section 205 of the federal power act prohibits utilities from granting undue pref erence or advantage to any person or subject any person to any undue prejudice or disadvantage 16 usc 824 this section is intended to clarify that reserving transmission for existing customers native load is not considered unduly discriminatory section 1237 study on the benefits of ec onomic dispatch the

that provides transmission service to eligible wholesale customers at comparable terms to the service that the utilities provide themselves some rchant generators asserted that they continued to be discriminated against by incumbent tran smission utilities and we re denied access to the system in april 1996 ferc clarifie d its open access transmission tariff policy with orders 888 and 889 making it easier fo r merchant generators to gain access to the transmission grid the regulatory regime has shifted the operations of the electric utility industry creating larger and more fre quent bulk power transfers across transmission system designed for local intrastate service however investment in infrastructure has not kept up with increases in the bulk power tr ansfers and electricity demand electricity demand has been growing at 2 to 3 pe r year but additions to the transmission system have been growing by 07 per year as result during some of the year transmission is congested in several regions of us in cluding california minnesota to wisconsin new york and the ohio valley some transmissionowning utilities argue that the current pricing mechanism for transmission discourages investment currently transmission owners are compensated for use of their lines based on contract path for the movement of electricity generally the shortest path between the generator and its customer however electricity rarely follows contract path and instead follows the path based on least impedance12 transmission lines often carry electricity that has been contracted to move on diffe rent path therefore some transmission owners are not being compensated for use of their lines and lack the incentive to increase capacity under order 2000 ferc stated its inte rest in incentive ratemaking and in particular performancebase d ratemaking those in fa vor of incentive ratemaking argue that incentives are needed 1 to encourage participation in regional transmission organizations 2

transmission system13 currently ferc uses license plate rate for transmission single rate based on customer location as ferc is encouraging formation of large regional transmission organizations ferc is moving toward uniform access charge sometimes called postage stamp rates with postage stamp rate users pay one charge for moving electricity anywhere within the regional transmission organization postage stamp rates eliminate socalled rate pancaking or series of accumulated transmission charges as the electricity passes through adjacent transmission systems and increases the pool of available generation on the other hand by moving to postage stamp rates customers in lowcost transmission areas may see rate increase and highcost transmission providers in the same area may not recover embedded costs as costs are determined on regional basis fercapproved tariffs do not necessarily increase with the addition of new transmission capacity ferc could approve new higher transmission tariff thus increasing all users costs to move electricity on the transmission system however the revenue requirement of the transmission utility may be met with current tariffs local retail customers

pl 95620 policy context the oil embargoes of the 1970s created concerns about the security of the nations electricity supply and led to enactment of the public utility regulatory policie s act of 1978 for the first time util ities were required to purchase power from outside sources the purchase price was set at the utilities avoided cost the cost they would have incurred to generate the additional power themselves as determined by utility regulators purpa was established in part to augment electric utility generation with more efficiently produced electricity and to provide equitable rates to electric consumers in addition to purpa the fuel use act of 1978 fua helped qualifying facilities qfs become established16 under fua utilities were not permitted to use natural gas to fuel new generating technol ogy qfs which are by definition not utilities were able to take advantage of abundant na tural gas as well as new generating technology such as combinedcycle plants that use hot gases from combustion turbines to generate additiona l power these technologies lowered the financial threshold for entrance into the electricity generation business as well as shortened the lead time for constructing new plants fua was repealed in 1987 but by this time qfs and small power pr oducers had gained portion of the total electricity supply this influx of qf power challenged the costbased rates that previously guided wholesale transactions before imple mentation of purp ferc approved wholesale interstate electricity transactions based on the sellers costs to generate and transmit the power since nonutility generato rs typically do not have enough market power to influence the rates they charge ferc began approving certain wholesale transactions whose rates were result of competitive bidding process these rates are called marketbased rates this first incremental change to traditional electricity regulation started movement toward marketori ented approach to electricity supply following the enactment of purpa two basic issues stimulated calls for further reform whether to encourage nonutility generation and whet her to permit utilities to diversify into nonregulated activities epact removed several regulatory barrier s for entry into electricity generation to increase competition of electricity s upply however epact does not permit ferc to mandate that utilities transmit ewg power to retail consumers commonly called retail wheeling or retail competition an ac tivity that remains under the jurisdiction of state public utility commissions purpa began to shift more regulatory responsibilities to the federal g overnment and epact continued that shift away from the states by creating new options for utilities and regulators to meet electricity demand proponents of purpa repeal primar ily investorowned utilities ious located in the northeast and in california argue that their state regulators misguided implementation of purpa in the early 1980s has forced them to pay contractually high prices for power they do not need they argue that given thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32178crs14 current environment for costconscious competition purpa is outdated the purpa reform group which promotes iou in terests strongly supports repeal of 210 of purpa by contending that the cu rrent laws mandatory purchase obligation was anticompetitive and anticonsumer opponents of mandatory purchase re quirement repeal independent power producers industrial power customers most segments of the natural gas industry the renewable energy industry and environmen tal groups have many reasons to support purpa as it stands mainly their argument is that purpa introduced competition in the electric generating s ector and at the same time helped promote wider use of cleaner alternative fuels to generate electricity since the electric generating sector is not yet fully competitive they argue repeal of purpa would decrease competition and impede the development of the renewable energy industry additionally opponents of purpa repeal argue that it would result in less competition and greater utility monopoly cont rol over the electric industry some state

transmission and distribution as the most efficient means of providing service as re sult most people about 75 are currently served by vertically integrated investorowned utility as the electric utility industry has evol ved however there has been growing belief that the historic classification of electric utilities as natural m onopolie s has been overtaken by events and that market forces can and should replace some of the traditional economic regulatory structure for example the existence of utilities that do not own all of their generating facilities primarily c ooperatives and publicly owned utilities has provided evidence that vertical integration has not been necessary for providing efficient elect ric service moreover recen t changes in electric utility regulation and improved technologies ve allowed additional generating capacity to be provided by independent firms rather than utilities the public utility holding company act and the federal power act fpa of 1935 title i and title ii of the public utility act establis hed regime of regulating electric utilities that gave specific and separate powers to the states and the federal government regulatory bargain was made between the government and utilities in exchange for an exclusive franchise service territory utilities must provide electricity to all users at reasonable regulated rates state regulatory commissions address intrastate utility activities including wholesale and retail ratemaking state authority currently tends to be as broad and as varied as the states are diverse at the least state public utility commission will have authority over retail rates and often over investment and debt at the other nd of the spectrum the state regulatory body will oversee many facets of u tility operation despite this diversity the essential mission of the state regulator in states that have not restructured is the establishment of retail electric prices this is accomplished through an adversarial hearing process the central issues in such cases are the total amount of money the utility will be permitted to co llect and how the burden of the revenue requirement will be distributed

can be brought on line more quickly and cheaply with fewer regulatory impediment s second this has lowered the entry barrier to electricity generation and pe rmitted nonutility entities to build profitable facilities one argument for additional puhca reform has been made by electric utilities that want to further diversify their assets currently under puhca holding company can acquire securitie s or utility assets only if the sec finds that such purchase will improve the economic efficien cy and service of an integrated public utility system it has been argued that reform to allow diversification would improve the risk profile of electric utilities in much the same way as in other businesses the risk of any one investment is diluted by the risk associated with all investments utilities have also argued that diversification would lead to better use of underutilized resources due to the seas onal nature of elect ric demand utility holding companies that have been exempt from sec regulation argue that puhca discourages diversification because the sec could repeal exempt status if exemption would be detrimental to the public interest for number of years there has been significant bipartisan congressional support for repealing much of puhca since the 1980s the securities and exchange commission has testified befo re congress that many provisions of puhca are longer relevant and othe r provisions are redundant with state and other federal regulations17 however as result of enrons collapse some in congress have taken somewh at different view toward significantly amending or repealing puhca18 even though enron had cl aimed exemption from puhca on february 6 2003 securities and exchange commission chief administrative law judge brenda p murray denied enrons p

crosssubsidization was major argument against the creation of ewgs and has reemerged as an argument against further puhca reform in the case of electric and gas companies nonutility ventures that are
