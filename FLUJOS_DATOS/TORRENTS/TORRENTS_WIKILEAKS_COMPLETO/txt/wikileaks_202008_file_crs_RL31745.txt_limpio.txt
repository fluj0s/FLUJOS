introduction in an effort to expand the options for health coverage and reduce the number of uninsured majority of states have established high risk health insurance pools1 these programs target individuals who cannot obtain or afford health insurance in the private market high risk pools generally cover people who have sought health coverage in the individual nongroup market but have been denied coverage received quotes from insurers that are higher than the premiums offered by the high risk pools or received offers from insurers that permanently exclude coverage of pre existing health conditions2 many states also use their high risk pools to comply with the portability and guaranteed availability provisions of the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa pl 104191 for eligible individuals moving from the group to nongroup market hipaa requires statelicensed health insurers to make coverage available to such individuals and prohibits exclusion of coverage for preexisting conditions of the 34 states currently operating high risk pools 28 states use their pools to comply with hipaas portability and guaranteed availability provisions3 in general state high risk pools tend to be small and enroll small percentage of the uninsured at the end of 2006 190462 individuals were enrolled in these pools4 compared with over 31 million people who were

crs2 risk pools operating that year5 however such limited enrollment reflects in part the narrow focus of these pools individuals with costly health conditions who seek coverage in the private market health insurance context high risk pools fill niche in the health insurance system patchwork system of private markets and public programs designed to meet the needs of different types of health care consumers6 in the private health insurance market most people get health coverage through the group market this market provides health benefits to groups of people that are drawn together by an employer or other organization such as trade union such groups are generally formed for some purpose other than obtaining insurance like employment while most americans receive their health coverage through the workplace as current employee dependent of an employee or retiree some individuals do not have access to employersponsored insurance esi they may be workers who do not qualify for an offer of health benefits from their employer eg because the workers have parttime or seasonal employment status or they may work for company that does not provide health insurance at all or they may be unemployed public programs also are source of health coverage but individuals and families must meet eligibility requirements in order to qualify for benefits individuals who cannot access esi and are not eligible for public programs may seek health insurance in the nongroup individual market applicants to the individual insurance market must go through robust medical underwriting the process by which an insurer considers information about an applicant and determines 1 whether to offer an insurance policy in the first place and 2 the terms of that policy eg the monthly premium the information that health insurer considers may include personal characteristics such as an individuals health conditions family medical history and other relevant factors though uncommon the insurance carrier may ask an applicant to undergo physical exam or provide specimens in the group market insurers forgo underwriting in the traditional sense that is reviewing each persons demographics and medical history instead an insurer would consider the overall characteristics of the group and calculate premium for set of benefits that would be charged to each person in the group regardless of their individual health status for very small groups insurers may individually underwrite policies if permitted by law federal and state laws restrict somewhat insurers ability to reject applications or design coverage based on health factors in the nongroup market nonetheless some applicants are rejected from the individual market altogether others may receive insurance offers with riders that exclude coverage for specific health condition or body part or others may be charged premiums that are higher than those 5 crs calculation of uninsured in states with high risk pools data source current

market for similar coverage7 rigorous underwriting results in an enrollee population in the individual market that is fairly healthy three out of four enrollees report that their health is excellent or very good8 thereby excluding persons with moderate to severe health conditions from this private market high risk pools were designed to assist such individuals who because of their health conditions have very few options for private health coverage health policy context high risk pools appeal to policymakers who prefer an incremental approach to coverage expansion and reliance on current state oversight of health insurance9 supporters of high risk pools contend that states can use their existing regulatory infrastructure as well as their knowledge of health care markets to efficiently insure previously uninsurable individuals supporters also contend that the private nongroup market will benefit they reason that by removing high risk persons from the individual market and placing them in publiclysubsidized insurance pools coverage in the individual market will become more affordable they argue that better risk spreading helps to stabilize the market promote competition and retain insurance carriers earning the support of such organizations10 moreover high risk pools function as safety net for the nongroup market by assuring that individuals have access to health insurance as long as they are able and willing to pay for it others contend that high risk pools are generally too small and underfunded to meet the needs of the majority of persons who cannot access health insurance in the private market by design high risk pools experience losses but federal attempts to subsidize these losses have been limited waiting lists for enrollment are common and premiums combined with other costsharing requirements can often make the coverage offered by these pools unaffordable as result some researchers remain skeptical that high risk pools will

people without health coverage consumer groups generally advocate for expansion of the federal role in providing coverage whether through existing public programs or broader health care reform12 while high risk pools have existed since the mid1970s only recently has congress acted to support the expansion and operation of high risk pools across the country the enactment of hipaa during the 104th congress specified state high risk pools as acceptable mechanisms for complying with the grouptoindividual market requirements the 107th congress passed the trade act of 2002 pl 107210 which authorized new federal program to provide grants to state high risk pools and made appropriations for fy2003 and fy2004 with expiration of the authorizing legislation for the grant program to states the 109th congress reauthorized the program through fy2010 and made appropriations for fy2006 the 110th congress passed legislation in december 2007 to provide additional appropriations see detailed discussion under federal grants to state high risk pools section state high risk pools in 2007 34 states had high risk health insurance pools states have great deal of discretion regarding the establishment and operation of these pools including covered benefits eligibility requirements preexisting condition exclusion periods and funding sources general characteristics of state high risk pools administration state high risk pools usually are operated through state established nonprofit organizations while private insurance companies typically are responsible for daily administrative duties the pools themselves bear the risk13 boards oversee the management of high risk pools and usually consist of representatives from insurance companies consumer groups health care providers and state agencies premiums and funding in order to limit the cost of health coverage for persons with costly medical conditions all states cap high risk pool premiums 11 for example see d chollet expanding individual health insurance coverage are highrisk pools the answer health affairs october 23 2002 and pollitz et health insurance and diabetes the lack of available affordable and adequate coverage clinical diabetes vol 23 2 2005 12 for example see testimony presented by r pollack families usa education and the workforce committee employeremployee relations subcommittee hearing expanding access to quality health care solutions for the uninsured july 9 2002 and american federation of state county and municipal employees universal health coverage resolution 14 june 2630 2000 13 highrisk pool essentially functions as the health plan and is responsible for paying claims in general the insurance carriers role is for administrative purposes only crs5 almost all states have caps between 125 and 200 of standard market rates majority of states offer coverage at less than 150 of the average high risk pools generally operate at loss because it isnt feasible to pool group of individuals known to have major health problems and expect their premium contributions to cover the entire cost14 thus many state pools tap other sources of funding to cover their operating expenses states may augment premium collection with one or more of the following sources assessments on insurers in some instances combined with offsetting tax credits state funds and other sources15 almost all states with risk pools assess fee on insurance carriers although 13 of those states offset those assessments with tax credits eleven states use general revenue for additional risk pool funding while only two states use monies from hospital assessments benefits although health benefits provided through risk pools vary across plans and states they generally reflect coverage that is available in the private market states usually offer more than one plan from which enrollees may choose deductibles and other costsharing requirements vary from state to state most state pools do not place maximum annual limits on benefits except for california idaho kansas louisiana tennessee utah and west virginia in contrast nearly all pools have lifetime maximums on benefits except for indiana kentucky and new mexico16 eligibility states establish the eligibility criteria for highrisk pools as noted many states allow hipaaeligible persons to enroll in their high risk pools hipaa eligibles are persons who do not have or are losing coverage and seeking it in the individual market17 they must meet the following requirements 1 have at least 18 months of creditable coverage specified in statute without significant break in that coverage 63 or more days 2 most recent coverage must have been through group health plan 3 exhausted federal or state continuation coverage 4 not eligible for medicaid or medicare and 5 not have any other health insurance for hipaa eligibles high risk pools guarantee the availability of health insurance and prohibit exclusion of coverage for preexisting conditions risk pools also are designed to address the insurance needs of nonhipaaeligible persons with costly 14 communicating for agriculture and the selfemployed inc comprehensive health insurance for highrisk individuals statebystate analysis nineteenth edition 20052006 2005 p 14 15 an assessment is tax or fee some states fund the losses of their risk pools by requiring insurers across the state to pay assessments generally the amount of insurers assessment is based on their share of the total premiums sold in the state for each year some states also provide tax credits to these insurers thus reducing the insurers tax liability and enabling them to recover some or all of their expenditures on the assessments under the latter of these funding mechanisms the state assumes part or all of the cost burden for the losses of the risk pools 16 in ks annual maximum applies to certain plans in fl and ky lifetime maximums apply to specified plans 17 hipaa also provides protections to certain people who wish to enroll in the group health insurance market see the aforementioned crs report rl31634 for more details crs6 medical conditions number of states provide for presumptive eligibility allowing individuals to become automatically eligible for highrisk pools if they have certain medical condition specified under state law in addition to hipaa eligibles and persons with specific conditions many states allow individuals who have experienced coverage denials coverage restrictions or premium increases to enroll in high risk pools enrollment high risk pool participation varies significantly across states with enrollment ranging from high of 29089 participants in minnesota to low of 345 enrollees in west virginia18 among state high risk pools the enrollment distribution clusters toward the low end to illustrate almost onethird of high risk pools with 2006 enrollment data had pools below 2000 participants 10 states and twothirds of state pools had participation below 4000 23 states in contrast only six states had more than 10000 participants as for new enrollment all states but florida are accepting new participants19 federal grants to state high risk pools given that state high risk pools typically operate at loss see discussion above the federal government has provided financial assistance to states during the past several years congress established grant program administered by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms to provide seed grants to states that did not already have high risk pools but wanted to establish them and operational grants to existing state pools once congress appropriates funding for these grants cms announces the funding opportunity and collects and reviews applications state may receive up

2002 pl 107210 the federal government provided funding to state high risk health insurance pools for the first time the trade act authorized and appropriated 20 million in the form of seed grants each qualifying state could receive up to 1 million to support the creation and implementation of high risk pool in 2003 cms awarded seed grants to six states maryland 1 million new hampshire 1 million

feasibility of creating high risk pool continued crs7 the trade act also authorized and appropriated 80 million to be split evenly over fy2003 and fy2004 to defray some of the operating losses experienced by states with existing high risk pools each operational grant could cover up to 50 of pools operating losses for the year to qualify each state must have established risk pool that restricts premiums to more than 150 of the premium for standard risk rates in the state offers choice of two or more coverage options and has in effect mechanism designed to ensure continued funding of losses incurred after the end of fy2004 however states may still be able to determine within federal standards how much to charge enrollees in outofpocket costs what benefits to include under the plans how long coverage for preexisting conditions may be excluded and whom among otherwise uninsurable individuals will be eligible table 1 shows which states received operational grants for fy2003
