according to assessments of their risk of extinction the has not been reauthorized si nce september 30 1992 and efforts to do so have been controversial and complex some observers assert that the current is failure because few species have recovered and that it unduly and unevenly restricts the use of private lands others assert that since the acts passage few species have become extinct many have imp roved and that restri ctions to preserve species do not place greater burden on landow ners than many other federal state and local laws this report provides sidebyside analysis of two bills and proposed amendment that would amend the this analysis compares hr 3824 the threatened and endangered species recovery act of 2005 as passed by the house proposed house amendment 588 to hr 3824 millerboehlert amendment and s 2110 the collaboration for the rec overy of endangered species act proponents of each proposal indicate that it is designed to make the more effective by redefining the relationship be tween private and public property uses and species protection implementing new incen tives for species conservation and removing what some see as undue land use restrictions thus all three proposals contain provisions meant to encourage gr eater voluntary conservation of species by states and private landowners concept th at has been supported by many observers further all three proposals would modify or eliminate certain pr ocedural or other elements of the current that some have viewed as significant protections and prohibitions including eliminating or changing the role of critical habitat ch which would eliminate one aspect of the current consultation process making the listing of all threatened and endangered species more difficult or less likely expanding 10 permits allowing incidental ta ke which could incu r greater need for agency oversight and enforcement and expanding state rather than federal implementation of prog rams which might make oversight more difficult proponents of these changes assert that tight er listing standards w ould enable better focus on species with the most dire need s and that other measures would achieve recovery of more species critics argue th at proposed changes cr eate gaps in the safety net of protec tions and prohibitions it is difficult to assess whether on ba lance the proposals would be likely to achieve greater protection and r ecovery of species or to wh at extent the controversies over land use constraints would diminish however replacing some of the protections of the current with new incentives rather than adding the new incentives to the current protections argu ably makes adequate funding of the new programs more critical to determining the outcome of the this report will be update d as

richard pombo and passed the house sept 29 2005 page numbers in text refer to housepassed versionreauthorization of the endangered species act comparison of pending bills and proposed amendment with current law introduction the endangered species act esa1 protects species that are determined to be either endangered or threatened according to assessments of their risk of extinction the act can be controversial because it can affect the use of both federal and non federal lands and resources and because dwindling species can be harbingers of broader ecosystem decline the has not been reaut horized since september 30 1992 and efforts to do so have b een controversial and complex some observers assert that the current is failure because few species have recovered and that it restricts the use of private lands unduly and unevenly others assert that since the acts passage few species have become extinct while many have improved and that some restrictions are reasonable burden to preserve species including some that may directly affect human wellbeing the conservation of habitat was seen as crucial when the was enacted in 1973 reduced habitat still is widely recognized by scientists as major cause of species loss and habitat preservation is focus of debate today whether to retain the current system of designating habitat critical for the conservation of species or to eliminate that system in favor of other options has been discussed widely there appears to be consensus on the desirability of creating incentives for property owners to preserve habitat but there is disagreement as to whether such incentives should replace enforceable protections or s upplement them other issues are the role of science in decisionmaking reducing conflicts with other activities such as those of the department of defense nd possibly enacting some of the approaches taken in current regulations as provisions of the act this report provides sidebyside analysis of two bills and proposed amendment that would amend the this analysis includes hr 3824 the threatened and endangered species recovery act of 2005 as passed by the house which would reauthorize and amend the esa2 proposed house amendment 588 to hr 3824 millerboehlert amendment wh ich would also reauthorize and amendhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33309crs2 3 house amendment 588 in the nature of substitute to hr 3824 offered on sept 29 2005 by rep george miller it was rejected 206 yeas to 216 nays 4 introduced dec 15 2005 by sen mike crapo 5 for information on current issues regarding the and status of legislation see crs report rl33468 the endangered species act in the 109th congress conflicting values and difficult choices by eugene h buck m lynne corn pervaze sheikh and robert meltzthe esa3 and s 2110 the collaboration for th recovery of endangered species act which would amend but not reauthorize the esa4 proponents of the individual proposals have indicated they are intended to make more effective by encouraging great er voluntary conservation of species by states and private landowners modifyin g or eliminating criti cal habitat and expanding state rather than federal imple mentation of programs among other things of the three proposals hr 3824 proposes the most extensive changes to current law the millerboehlert ame ndment is similar to hr 3824 in several respects but omits some of the provisions of hr 3824 and modifies others s 2110 would make some significant changes to current law and establish system of tax incentives and credits for property owners this report presents summary and comparison of current law the two bills and the millerboehlert amendment it does not attempt to analyze the current laws history and implementation in detail for comprehensive discussion of the its features and history see crs report rl31654 the endangered species act primer by pamela baldwin eugene h bu ck and m lynn corn and crs report rl32992 the endangered species act and sound science by eugene h buck m lynne corn and pamela baldwin in the attached chart the three measures are compared with each other and with current law current law is the baseline against which the changes of the various proposal s can be identified or explained with emphasis on the extent of changes to current law and the contents of the provisions the columns present the legislation in th order the bills were introduced the comparison is based on topics covered in the bill and does not analyze all language topics generally follow the sectionbysecti on structure of the current law and the provisions from the bills and the millerboehlert amendment are paraphrased for brevity in the chart crs analyses and comments addressing specific provisions are written in italics below the provision discussed page numbers in the chart refer to the pdf version of the bill or the millerboehlert amendment as formatted by the us government printing office becau s 2110 is the only bill that contains extensive provisions on

summary and analysis of hr 3824 the threatened and endangered species recover act of 2005 tesra as passed by the house oct 13 2005 by pamela baldwin available from the author overview of the bills hr 38246 this bill would include definition of best available science that sets out several limitations and requirements and applies to listing and species status determinations further hr 3824 woul d require an analysis of the economic national security and other relevant impacts of making listing determination the esarelated role of the national marine fisheries service secretary of commerce would be eliminated and those duties transferred to the fish and wildlife service fws the bill would repeal the designation of critical habitat ch and label current areas of ch as areas of special value for recovery planning purposes the elimination of ch would also eliminate one aspect of consultation under 7 the bill would set deadlines for the completion of many recovery plans and require biological criteria in habitat conservation plans to assist in evaluating results further it would require that recovery plan teams include various constituencies and that satisfaction of the criteria specified in recovery plan be considered in decisions to change the status of species the bill would expand cooperative agreemen ts with states to include candidate and certain other species that the secretary and state agree are at risk yet are not federally listed as threaten ed or endangered and speci fy conditions for suspending or terminating these agreements furthe r the bill would establish recovery and conservation agreements with private prope rty owners provide grants to property owners who voluntarily undertake conser vation measures provide for written determinations of whether proposed pr ivate action would vi olate the and when requested pay aid or compensation to qualifying property owners who forego proposed use of their property to avoid violating the compensation would also be available for livestock losses due to reintroduced species the bill would specify additional requi rements for 10 permits and codify surprises approach similar to that in current regulations to afford greater certainty to landowners it would clarify exempti on authorities in times of emergencies or disasters or for national security further the bill would allow actionagencies to determine types of actions as well as particular actions that could be granted categorical exclusions from jeopardy deter minations or exempted from consultation requirements for period of time for many actions involving the use of pesticides millerboehlert amendment to hr 3824 the millerboehlert amendment would define best available science emphasize the inclusion of data obtained by scientifically accepted methods and procedures and establish science advisory board to evaluate the use of science in implementing the jeopardy would be defined with broa der language than found in agency regulations likely making it easier to find jeopardy than under current law conditions applicable to consultation on cooperative agreements nd agency actions would be providedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33309crs4 the definition of ch would be retain ed and under 35b ch apparently could still be designated for listed species without recovery plans however the millerboehlert amendment also states that ch designated before enactment would be treated as areas necessary for recovery until new recovery plan or recovery plan revision is completed and more ch would be designated areas important to species recovery would be designated in recovery plans the bill would also address the status of each listed species every five years require notices to states for proposed determinations and require secretarial justif ication for any prohibitions on threatened species the millerboehlert amendment would require recovery plans for listed species priority system for developing plans and recovery teams to develop plans and c oordinate with federal agencies contents of recovery plans are specified including the identificati on of publicly owned lands needed for recovery or private lands only if also necessary for recovery opportunities for public comment and access to rec overy plans would be provided the millerboehlert amendment woul d expand cooperative agreements with states so that listed and candidate species as well as species of special concern could be included there would be provisions re lated to monitoring and changing the status of agreements exemptions for national security nd disasters would be provided conditions for obtaining written determinations of the lawfulness under of proposed action would be sp ecified conservation program for landowners to improve hab itat and promote conservati on on private lands would be established agreements between the secretary and landowners would be authorized and include management plan s and criteria for evaluation conservation grants and compensation for livestock loss due to reintroduced species would also be available s 2110 the bill would not change any ex isting definitions under current law but would establish priority system fo r determining the status and habitat of species the priority system would consider risk of extinction likelihood of recovery and conflicts with human activities among other things critical habitat designation would be retain ed however designation would occur later than under current law recovery plans would in clude input from an executive committee recovery coordinator would be required and recovery team of experts could be appointed but would not be required add itional requirements for recovery plans would be set out s 2110 would provide for cooperative ag reements with states on listed and candidate species and species that are likely to be threatened or endangered agreements would be subject to consultation with the fish and wildlife service fws and national marine fi sheries service nmfs when entered into amended or renewed but consultation would not be required for sp ecies in an area covered by cooperative agreement that became listed afte r an agreement is finalized incidental take statements could be issued base d on cooperative agreements s 2110 would also provide for the monitoring enrollment termination and re view of cooperative agreements this bill would create system of conservation banks for improving recovery of listed and candidate species and species of concern the bill contains criteria to be included in regulations on managing conservation banks mechanisms for transferring and pricing credits and provisions for outofkind mitigation systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33309crs5 7 food and security act of 1985 16 usc 3831 8 the secretary of agriculture also has duties with respect to the importation or exportation of terrestrial plantsof tax credits would be pr ovided for landowners who par ticipate in the recovery of certain species landowners could also receive tax credits for conservation and recovery costs specifications for entering into an agreement eligibility requirements for credits and value of credits under different tax conditions are provided s 2110 would modify requirements for bitat conservation plans hcp and surprises approach similar to the current administrative regulation would be codified provisional permits for incident take would be available for voluntary implementation of the term s of proposed hcp participants in farm bill conservation programs7 who conduct sitespecific r ecovery activities with net benefit for listed or candida species would receive 10 incidental take permits comparison of hr 3824 the millerboehlert amendment and s 2110 this portion of the memorandum compares and discusses brie fly some of the principal topics in the legislation in format that loosely follows the sectionby section structure of the please refer to the chart for more detail section 3 definitions s 2110 makes changes to the definitions under current law the house bill and mille rboehlert amendmen t would replace the current phrase best scientific and comme rcial data available with best available scientific data both would elaborate on what is the best available science under hr 3824 the secretary is to develop regu lations that ensure compliance with the data quality act and that data be empirical or f ound in sources reviewed by qualified individuals recomme nded by the national academy of sciences nas the millerboehlert amendment would rely less on secretarial determination of what data can be used in decisionma king and would establish criteria for scientifically accepted data including those data that meet scientific standards and are widely used within the relevant fields of science some contend that the specification of empirical data in hr 3824 would exclude estimates derived from models and limit the type of data available for use compared to the provisions of the millerboehlert amendment and current law however estimates derived from modeling could be allowed under hr 3824 if it meets the nas peerreview conditions set forth in the bill currently secretary refers to either the secretary of the interior or the secretary of commerce depending on the species involved8 hr 3824 would eliminate the role of the secretary of commerce and transfer those duties to the secretary of the interior the millerboehlert amendment would retain the definition of secretary as in current law but would delete several specific references to the secretary of commerce and would not authorize ppropriations for the department of commerce some contend that eliminating the secretary of commerce would reducehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33309crs6 9 distinct population segment is population segment of vertebrate species that is discrete eg geographically separate from the remainder of the species considered significant to the species and has endangered or threatened status invertebrates and plants are not afforded protection at the population vel under current law see us department of interior and commerce policy regard ing the recognition of distinct vertebrate population segments under the endangered species act federal register vol 61 26 feb 7 1996 p 4722duplication of efforts and increase resources for recovery others contend that the fish and wildlife service might not have the expertise to manage ocean species the millerboehlert amendment would define jeopardy to include any action that lessens the likelihood species will recove r this definition is broader than the way jeopardy has been interpreted by the courts to date it is not clear how this broader definition would affect other sections of the statute but it could make it easier to find jeopardy during 7 consultati ons on federal actions or private actions with federal nexus several sections relating to critical habitat would be eliminated thereby eliminating the other current test for reviewing actions under current 7 processes section 4 determi nationslistings under current law there is duty to list species that either are threatened with extinction or in danger of becoming extinct the bills and the millerboehlert amendment contain many provisions relating to determinations of species status the type of data used to make determinations under hr 3824 could be more limited th an under current law due to the definition of best ava ilable scientific data ie data must be empirical or found in sources reviewed by nas the millerboehlert amendment does not appear to limit the type of data and analyses used as long as it meets scientifically accepted standards condition that appears to embody current legal interpretations the millerboehlert amendment would mandate peer review through scientific advisory board sab composed of ppointed nominees recommended by the nas the sab would have broade r mandate than peer review panels proposed in hr 3824 because it would evaluate the use of science in implementing the act and develop policies on the us of scientific inform ation hr 3824 and the millerboehlert amendment would expressly make all information used to make determination on species publicly accessi ble s 2110 would make changes to current law however the data quality act requires that information relied on by agencies be made available the millerboehlert amendment would address threatened species by requiring the secretary to publish justification for any prohibitions regarding threatened species and to restrict th circumstances under which pr ohibitions may be applied to more than one threatened species hr 3824 would address distinct population segments9 by directing the secretary to determine them as endangered or threatened only sparingly language taken from hrept 96 151 p 7 hr 3824 would require the secretary to prepare an analysis of the economic national security and other impacts and benefits of species status dete rminations concurrently with making determination this analysis however would not change criteria in making ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33309crs7 determination similar analys would be used under s 2110 to determine priority system for ranking species for cons ideration see discussion below current law authorizes the secretary to establish ranking system to identify species that should r eceive priority review and fws and nmfs have established such priorities this current system re lates to the commitment of agency personnel and funds but may be overridde n by court orders because the statutory duties of the agencies to list species and ch rema in s 2110 would elaborate statutorily on how to establish priority ranking system and related schedule for agency actions it appears that courts coul d only consider whether agency actions are consistent with that schedule and may only order complia nce with it s 2110 could modify or eliminate the duty to list depending on how its judicial review provision is interpreted some of the criteria in s 2110 fo r ranking species could be seen as contradictory and guidance is given as to the weight to be given the various factors for example is species with unusually narro w geographic distribution and habitat needs but with various other subspecies still extant to be considered higher or lower priority than species that is the only living representative of its genus but is widely distributed several of the factors seem aimed at ascertaining which species are in grave difficulty yet anot her factor is the likelihood of achieving recovery of the species how to determine which is more important the latter criterion might be used to suggest that those species listed at the earliest sign of depletion would be given hi gher priority than those species listed after considerable delay at time when species numbers point unequivocally to endangerment for species so depleted that their recovery is in doubt another remaining question is whether they should be allo wed to slide to extinction or could such species be maintained under hr 3824 and the millerboehlert amendment the fiveyear reviews of species status required by current law w ould be based on bienni reports sent to congress and any other information the s ecretary considers relevant the relationship of this last language to th best available scie nce requirements is not clear section 4 designation of critical habitat ch current law requires the designation of ch for species at the time of listing and makes destruction or adverse modification of ch trigger for consultation pro cedures critical habitat is currently defined as habitat that is essential for the conservation of species fws and others have asserted that the design ation of ch provides additional benefit beyond that which is accomplished through the duty to avoid jeopardizing species however several cour ts have held that this conclu sion rests on an erroneous agency regulation and that base d on the definition of conserve ch should include habitat necessary to accomplish recovery not merely to avoid jeopardy conserve is defined in the current law as bringing species to the point where it longer needs the protections of the act wording that courts have held includes recovery see for example sierra club v us fi sh and wildlife service 245 f 3d 434 5th cir 2001 hr 3824 would eliminate ch altogether and rely on landowner incentives to secure adequate habitat the millerboehlert amendment would retain the currenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33309crs8 definition of ch but would re peal several references to it and also treat current ch as areas necessary for recovery until recovery plan is developed or revised similar to hr 3824 ch under the millerboehlert amendment apparently would also be eliminated for future designations although the current definition of ch would allow for some future designations the bills and millerboehlert amendment would delay the time at which ch or its substitute is designated from listing to later time already designated ch would be treated under hr 3824 as areas of special value these areas may or may not be retained wh areas of special value are determined in new or revised recovery plan the millerboehlert amendment would call for identifying publicly owned areas or other areas of land or water nece ssary to achieve the purposes of recovery plan and impacts on these areas that shall be considered when evaluating whether proposed action might jeopardize species this provision requires the location of ch or equivalent areas on public lands first and only if that is insufficient looking to private lands the elimination of ch in the house bill and in several instances under the millerboehlert ame ndment would reduce the 7 consultation process to only an evaluation of whether proposed federal ac tion would jeopardize the continued existence of listed species under current law since ch is defined as that area necessary to conserve ie usually interpreted as recovery species the elimination of ch could significantly change the 7 protections however the millerboehlert amendment would define jeopardy more broadly than under current interpretations so the net effect on 7 protections of eliminating several provisions on ch is not clear ch would be largely retained under s 2110 and designated either three years after recovery plan is commissioned or in accordance with the priority system but not later than five years after species is listed this may mean that designation must appear on the schedule and hence be part of an enforceable timetable or possibly that ch would not be enforceable in the case of lowpriority species that is never listed and for which recovery plan is developed section 4 recovery plans under current law the secretary must develop recovery plans for all listed species unless the secretary finds that plan will not promote the conservation recove ry of the species plans are to the maximum extent practicable to give priority to species that are most likely to benefit from them or which are in conflict with construction or other economic activities plans are to include both sitespecific actions necessary to achieve the plans goal and objective measurable criteria which when met would result in species being removed from lists plans also are to include estimates of the time and costs required all the bills elaborate on the developm ent of recovery plans hr 3824 and the millerboehlert am endment would impose deadlines for recovery plans s 2110 would require th secretary to publish provisional recovery goals at the time of listing that remain in effect unless replaced by an approved recovery plan hr 3824 and the millerboehlert am endment would require the secretary to promulgate re gulations for establishing recovery teams hr 3824 would require stakeholders to be on recovery teams but would not expressly require that scientists be on teams this might be offset by requirement that team members with relevant scientific expertise would establish objective measurable criteria forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33309crs9 recovery based solely on the be st available scientific data under all three measures appointment of team would not be re quired and if one is not appointed the secretary could develop the pl an although recovery team might not be appointed under s 2110 the secretary would appoi nt an executive committee comprised of stakeholders and recovery coordinator to staff and coordinate imp lementation of plan if group of stakeholders form s committee that qualifies as an executive committee the species in which the group is interested would receive priority for development of recovery plan alt hough there are requirements in s 2110 for recovery plans there are none for the recovery programs created by the secretary under hr 3824 recovery plan may pr ovide for the interim improvement of the status of species rather than its recovery if there are insufficient best available scientific data as determined by the recovery team or by the secretary if recovery team is appointed this provision may provide mechanism for assisting species until sufficient scientific data are available to measure when recovery has been achieved and delisting is appr opriate on the other hand the fact that the recovery team itself determines the adequacy of best available scientific data both initially and upon review may permit the inte rim plans that are tied to improvement rather than recovery to continue the recovery team reviews these interim plans at intervals greater than five years under the millerboehlert amendment plan would have to include an estimate of land acquisition costs from willing sellers and identify publicly owned lands that will assist in recovery and an other necessary additional lands under s 2110 the secretary w ould have to acknow ledge appropriate existing conservation programs and coordina with all governmental agencies when creating recovery plans the bills and the millerboehlert amendment all would include more express requi rements on notice and opportun ities for public review of recovery plans than in current law including notice to states and tribes section 6 cooperative agreements with states current law authorizes the secretary to enter into coope rative agreements with any state that has an adequate and active program for the c onservation of endangered and threatened species the relationship of these cooperativ agreements to the enforcement of the prohibitions under the is somewhat ambiguous all three proposals would expand the agreements to cover candidate species or other species that the state and the secretary agree are likely to be determined to be endangered or threatened most agree that authorizing earlier conservation efforts will result in more options and wider distribution of any bur dens of remedial actions the bills and the millerboehlert amendment state that 7 consultation requirements would apply to these agreements language that appears to direct the secretary to consult with fws as appropr iate regarding the agreements hr 3824 and s 2110 state that the consultation re quirement would apply at the time the agreements are entered into renewed or amended the millerboehlert amendment simply states that the agreements would be subject to consu ltation requirements and regulations consultation would not be required for species that are listed as threatened or endangered after an agreement is approved point that some contend does not provide ad equate protection hr 3824 addresses the relationship of cooperative agreements with take prohibitions of the in two ways 1 by allowing incidental take statementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33309crs10 allowing take of listed species to be issued on approved cooperative agreements and 2 by providing that the relevant st ate and landowners enrolled in the program would be exempt from liability for authorized take as long as the agreement and the program are adequate for conserving th species s 2110 is worded similarly but appears to apply only to candidate species s 2110 requires actions of the secretary to be reviewed every three years curre nt law does not expre ssly address cancellation of cooperative agreements although cancella tion authority arguably is implied by the fact that the secretarys nnual review of state programs for adequacy adequacy is necessary condition for entering into cooperative agreement if review concludes that the program is inadequate then the pr ogram arguably could not be authorized all three proposals contain provisions for suspending or terminating

2110 result in dest ruction or adverse modification of ch neither hr 3824 nor the millerboehlert amendment would allow termination of an agreement for destruction or adverse m odification of ch since that concept would be eliminated or changed whether termin ation should be available only if species are likely to be jeopardized by the conti nuation of the agreement could be point of controversy some might urge that termination should be available if cooperative agreement is not contributing to the conser vationrecovery of species subject to the cooperative agreement the millerbo ehlert amendment defines jeopardy as lessening the likelihood of rec overy see section 3 above section 7 consultation current law requires fede ral agencies to consult with the secretary in practice fws or nmfs to insure that any action authorized funded or carried out by such agency herei nafter in this section referred to as an agency action is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of its ch the reference to any action authorized funded or carried out by federal agency encompasses private actions with federal nexus such as actions under federal permit eg 404 dredge and fill permit s or oil and gas drilling permits or those receiving federal funding page 43 of hr 3824 would change the reference from any action to any agency action emphasis added change that arguably eliminates the consultation requirements for private actions with federal nexus however other references to consultations involving permit or license applicants are retained so the net effect is ambiguous in addition hr 3824 would authorize th secretary to identify certain actions or types of actions that do not jeopardize species through procedures other than the 7 consultation processes alternative pr ocedures could replace agency biological assessments the preparation of biologi cal opinions by fws or nmfs and the limitation on agency commitments of resources however the authority for issuing an incidental take statement and the provision exempting from the penalties of the act any takes of species pursuant to an incidental take statement would only apply if the secretary finds or concurs that the agency action meets the standards of 7a2 ie will not jeopardize further the secretary shall suggest or concur in any suggested reasonable and prudent alternatives developed for any action determined not to meet the nojeopardy standard these changes could be seen ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33309crs11 expediting the consultation process along the lines of current administrative practices see hrept 109237 pp 4445 on the other hand allowing the action agencies to make the initial determination as to jeopardy and reducing the role of the secretary to one of concurrence arguably could reduce the independent role of the fws and nmfs the extent to which acti on agency processes replacing biological opinions from fws or nmfs could be re viewed by the courts is not clear although authority for counterpart regulations has existed in regulations for years it has only recently been used and is being challenged in court the process is somewhat similar to categorical exclusions regarding types of actions for which environmental analyses under the na tional environmental policy act nepa need be prepared but the nepa exempti on applies to an essentially procedural process and these alternative consultati on processes would apply to substantive determinations hr 3824 would eliminate the endanger ed species committee the god squad that currently can exempt proposed actions from prohibitions of the section 10 exemptions from take prohibitions and property owner incentives all of the proposals would increase incentives for landowners to conserve listed species nd to conserve or increase bitat all three would make statutory surprises approach similar to the current regulation at 50 cfr 1722b under the surprises concept agreements can be negotiated that impose limitations on the additional measures that can be required of landowner in the case of either changed circumstances that are contemplated in the agreement or circumstances that are not contemplated in the agreement these agreements are seen by some as providing landowners w ith greater certainty and stability thereby facilitating investment and ec onomic development while aiding the conservation of listed species none would codify the safe harbor concept whereby landowner can create habitat and later return to the original baseline as set out in agreements current regulations specify that an ag reement under the surprises approach can be revoked for several causes or if continuation of the activities under the agreement would be inconsistent with the survival and recovery of species in the wild all three proposals would change the current regulatory stance regarding revocation of 10 permits all would llow revocation if permittee is not in compliance with the permit hr 3824 nd the millerboehlert amendment would allow revocation if there are changed circumstances and continuation would be inconsistent with 10a2biv th at is if continuation would reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery of th species s 2110 is similar but would amend paragraph 2 so that it is difficult to discern what circumstances would justify revocation under the current regulation re vocation related to jeopardy is not limited to changed circumstances as appears to be true under the bills and the millerboehlert amendment in addition hr 3824 has several va rieties of agreements first species conservation contract agreements would authorize persons to carry out conservation practices for endangered or threatened species candidate species or other species subject to comparable designations under st ate law these agr eements would specify the conservation practices the person would undertake and describe economichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33309crs12 activities that would be co mpatible with those practices landowners would be compensated for their costs in implementing the conservation practices at the rate of 60 for 10year agreement 80 for 20year agreement and 100 for 30year agreement the secretary would establish priorities for entering these agreements after considering statutory criteria second species recovery agreemen ts would cover landowners who would protect and restore habitat for listed species priority for these agreements would go to areas identified in recovery plans as areas of special value to the species third landowners could also request written determination from the secretary as to whether proposed action on their nds would violate the if so landowner could request aid compensation for foregoing the proposed use the secretary shall award aid if the proposed use meets th qualifying criteria that the proposed use would be lawful under state nd local law and that the property owner has demonstrated the means to undertake th proposed use the criteria are worded generally and eligibility for aid would be broader than under current interpretations of the takings clause of the 5th amendment aid might be triggered for example by curtailment of any proposed use of any pa rt of an owners land or water several aspects of this aid program are unclear nd the cost of compensation is difficult to determine but could be hig h if appropriated funds whe ther regular supplemental or reprogrammed appear to be insufficient to satisfy anticipated demands for aid the secretary could face conflict between payi ng aid which shall be provided but for which funds are not sufficient and permittin g actions which might otherwise violate the to go forward hr 3824 does not specify how the conflict is to be resolved in the face of inadequate funding the secretary could be forced to permit landowners to proceed with violative propos ed actions if written determination has been sought and the action permitted to go forward any use or action taken by property owner in reasonable reliance on either written determination or default permission to proceed cannot be treated as violation of the prohibitions of fourth conservation grant s would be available to landowners who voluntarily seek to conserve threatened and endangered species grants may not be used to fund several specific activities litigation lobbying the acquisition of leases or easements of more than 50 years among other things priorities are set out for awarding grants and preference is given to grants that would promote conservation while making economically beneficial use of the property under the millerboehlert amendmen t landowner may request written determination as to whether proposed ac tion could violate the prohibitions of the act and hence whether an inci dental take permit may be necessary to proceed there is obligation to pay aid or compensati on and there is presumption of approval if the secretary does not render timely decision the miller boehlert amendment states that the process does not apply to agency actions that are subject to consultation under 7 the millerboehlert amendment would authorize agreements with property owners to provide technical assistance and financial assistance up to 70 of the costs of implementation the s ecretary would be requi red to give priority to agreements that apply to private lands necessary to achieve recovery these agreements could be seen as serving similar purposes to the species conservationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33309crs13 agreements recovery agreements and conser vation grants set out separately in hr 3824 some of the new agreements in the millerboehlert amendment and hr 3824 resemble the candidate conservation agr eements with assurances promulgated under 50 cfr 1722d1 for species that are candidates for listing or other unspecified unlisted species these agreem ents provide regulatory guarantees to landowners who voluntarily agree to prot ect habitat for wildlife and plant species before they are listed for protection under the s 2110 authorizes conservation banking agreements that would be somewhat similar to the conservation banking system for protecting wetlands conservation banks could be established by private ndowners who demonstrat that the affected area would be managed under an enforceable legal instrument and contribute to the conservation of listed species candidate species or species of special concern there is requirement that the conserva tion banks be consis tent with approved recovery plans the habitat that is prot ected would not need to be contiguous and the agreement is to run in perpetuity or for an appropriate period the secretary is to promulgate regulations on managing conservation banks and is to determine the value and credits for each bank the serv ice area to which the conservation bank credits would apply is to be defined in the conservation agreement and biological data would determine how many credits bank can sell s 2110 would also establish tax incentives for private conservati on efforts these include tax credits for certain federal or state pproved conservation and recovery agreements the amount of the credit would vary depending on the length of the agreement details on qualifying costs and other limitations are provided s 2110 would also add broad additional protections for ndowners participating in th healthy forest recovery act program s 2110

emphasis added with respect to the enforcement of the act and pertaining to imports of plan ts under the convention on the international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora cites the intent of the language authorizing the secretary of agriculture to carry out enforcement functions of the doi is unclear s 2110 does not reauthorize appropriations for the costs the administrative cost of implementing the could be reduced by some provisions of the three proposals and increased by others reductions to federal expenditures could result from state administra tion of programs under cooperative agreements repeal of ch desi gnations and possibly fewer listings under priority schedule federal administrative costs could be increased in the short term as result of new data nd

species on speciesbyspecies basis and expenditures not attributable to particular species eg conservation activities on river that may benefit several species expenditures would include federal and state funds and funds voluntarily reported by local govern ment entities s 2110 does not amend the annual cost analysis in current law conclusion all three proposals contain incentives that proponents indicate would encourage greater voluntary conservation of species by states and private landowners concept that is supported by many observers in th past and present all three proposals would modify or eliminate parts of what some have seen as the current safety net of protections and prohibitions including eliminating or changing the role of critical habitat which would eliminate one aspect of the current consultation process making the listing of all threatened and endangered species more difficult or less likely expanding 10 pe rmits allowing incidental take which could incur greater need for agency oversight and enforcement and expanding state rather than federal implementation of programs which might make oversight more difficult proponents of these changes asse rt that improved standards would enable better focus on species with the most dire needs and that other measures would recover more species it is difficult to predict whether on balance the proposals would be likely to achieve greater protec tion and recovery of species however replacing some of the protections of the current with new incentives rather than adding the new incentives to the current protections arguab ly makes adequate funding of the new programs more cr itical to determining that outcomehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33309 crs15 table 1 sidebyside comparison of the endangered species act hr 3824

conserve sp ace provisions related to conservation banks will be paraphrased and crs comments are in italics page numbers refer to the pdf version of s 2110 as introduced conservation banks under s 2110 under s 2110 conservation bank is define d as an area of land water or other habitat not necessarily c ontiguous that is managed in perpetuity or for an appropriate period under an enforceable legal instrument and for the purpose of conserving and recovering habitat or an endangere d threatened or candidate species or species of special concern p 31 the conservation bank definition includes habitat not necessarily contiguous which suggests that bank c ould consist of segments of habitat rather than block given the importance and benefits of habitat continuity for species survival some might argue that banks consisting of fragm ented portions would have less value than banks with contiguous habitats this defin ition also mentions an appropriate period as an alternative to in perpetuity when referring to the lifetime of the bank the bill does not identify who will make th determination of an appropriate period or what criteria will be used credit is defined as the unit of curre ncy of conserva tion bank generated by preserving or restoring bitat in an agreement and quantified through the conservation values of species or habitat conservation values are to be determined by the secretary for each bank and converted into fixed number of credits pp 31 32 the definition of credit is written in wa that appears to allow alternatives to money that could be exchanged to pay for the values being purchased out of the bank there is indication what those alternatives might be there is little guidance on how the secretary will determine or measure conservation value and how much value will equal credit due to the changing nature of habitat and the potential for habitat improvement or degradation conservation values may change with in banks there do not appear to be any provisions that allow the secretary to reassign values to conserva tion banks on the other hand allowing the secretary to determine the value and credits for each bank has the potential to insure that there will be consistency am ong banks this may be helpful since credit program for species could involve wide range of habitat values service area is an area identified in conservation bank agreement it includes soil type waters hed habitat type political boundary or an area in federally recognized conser vation plan among others in which credit may be used to offset the effects of project p 32 the scope of service area may vary broadly under this definition which could allow the secretary to create areas that fit desired biological criteria becausehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33309crs91 person under the includes fe deral agencies and page 32 includes reference to federally recognized c onservation plans the provisions on conservation banking may apply to federal agencies it is unclear if this was intended conservation banks may be established by any priv ate landowner who applies and demonstrates that the affected area is managed under an enforceable legal instrument and contributes to the conserva tion of listed species candidate species or species of special concern pp 3233 secretary shall appr ove or disapprove bank within 180 days after the applica tion is submitted p 33 bank can be managed by state holder of the bank another party specified in the agreement or party that acquires property rights related to the cons ervation bank p 34 while conservation banks would require an enforceable legal instrument the bill does not specify any contents for that instrument there may be certain minimal contents that all such instruments or banking agreements should contain to ensure that protection of species and habitat will be ffective and consistent from site to site the time limit for decision will allow approved banks to enter into the program and gain credits within six months which so feel would encourage participation but it is unclear whether this period will be sufficient for the secretary to render decision with adequate justification manage ment of the bank is not restricted which may relieve the burden of manageme nt from the landowner and allow other entities eg state agencies or nongovernmental or ganizations to manage the bank however criteria for holders are stated the holder of conservation bank is re quired to establish an agreement that describes the proposed manage ment of the bank p 34 the agreement is submitted to the secretary who shall approve or di sapprove it as soon as practicable p 35 conditions for amending and nullifying th agreement are given pp 3536 the secretary shall consider the use of banks for implementing recovery plans and must adopt regulations on managing banks that balance the biological conditions of the target species and habitat with economic fr ee market principles to ensure value to landowners through tradeab credit program p 36 bank management agreement undergoes separate approval process from establishing conservation bank and the deadline for approving or disapproving bank management agreements is uncertain standards for acceptable agreements are provided an approved agreement does not seem to be required to transfer credits or to maintain conservation bank the bill does specify that the bank must contribute to the conservation of qualified species but there is requirement that banks be consistent with approved reco very plans and it is not clear that bank managers must comply with the relevant agreement the secretary is to promulgate regu lations on managing conservation banks p 37 the regulations are to relate to 11 subjects including conservation and recovery goals activities that may be ca rried out in any conservation bank measures that ensure the viability of conservation banks the demonstration of an adequate legal control of property pr oposed to be included in th conservation bank p 37 criteria for determining credits and an accounting system for them and the applicability of and compliance with 7 nd 10 of monitoring and reporting requirements are also to be addre ssed in the regulations pp 3738httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33309crs92 the regulations are to include provisions relating to how the consultation requirements of 7 of the and the incide ntal take provisions apply in the context of conservation banks it is not clear whether the authority given the secretary to develop these regulations could be broad enough to eliminate consultation or to authorize the issuance of general incidental take permits for activities in conservation bank areas the requirement that banks be financially viable pp 37 38 appears to refer to both biological and fi nancial viability as to the latter some contend that financial viability should be termined by market forces rather than the federal government which should ensu re the biological viability of the species or habitat should bank fail biological data would determine how ma ny credits bank can sell p 38 and the secretary is to establish standard pr ocess by which credits could be transferred credit transfers can be used to comply with court injunctions to meet requirements of 7a 7b or 10a1 of the and to provide outofkind mitigation p 39 outofkind mitigation is defined as mitiga tion i nvolving the same species or habitat but in different service area additional requirements must be met for approval of outofkind mitigation and the secr etary is to give preference to inkind mitigation to the maximum extent practicab pp 3940 the secretary is not to regulate the price of credit transfers or to limit participation by any party in the credit transfer process p 40 in some circumstances credits may be transferred before the secretary approves bank p 41 the criteria for transferring credits do not include habitat or species requirements for the area being mitigated by the purchase of credits habitat for different species may not be interchangeable therefore if the area being mitigated contained habitat for an endangered speci of salamander there are requirements that credits purchased will be from conservation bank with similar habitat outofkind mitigation is allowed when both ecological desirability and economic practicabi lity can be met the bill allows transfer of credits before the bank is approved if specified conditions can be met which would seem to be risk to the federal interest in species protecti on should the secretary ultimately reject the application for establishing the bank if the secretary rejects bank proposal how would that rejection affect any prior purchase of credits creation of conservation ba nks can be integrated with conservation plans developed under 10 of the if certain criteria are t pp 4142 any party to an agreement including the united states may sue for breach of the agreement and sovereign immunity is waived for participating federal state tribal and local governments pp 4243 subsection g pp 4142 requires to the maximum extent practicable that bank be integrated with habitat conser vation plans developed under 10 of the if the bank meets the ecological criteria of the habitat conservation plan and provides greater economic benefits compared with ot her forms of mitigation of habitat destruction only party to th agreement not interested outsiders with standing may sue for breach of the agreemen t how this restriction could affect enforcement actions under 10 is not clear since party violating an agreement ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33309crs93 not likely to sue to enforce the agreement this really means that only the secretary can enforce the agreement equitable relief is specifically allowed despite the wording that judicial review is allo wed for breach of an agreement which usually connotes suit for damages it is not clear in what ci rcumstances states local governments or tribes would be defendants tax incentives under s 2110 taxpayers may claim tax credit based on the taxpayers qualified conservation and recovery costs for the taxable year pp 5662 qualified costs are those paid or incurred by the taxpayer in carrying out pproved sitespecific r ecovery actions under 4f of or other federal or st ateapproved conser vation and recovery agreements that involve an endangered thr eatened or candidate species p 57 the project must be undertaken according to binding agreement and the credit is subject to recapture if th agreement is breached or terminated pp 5758 and 61 the amount of tax credit gained depends on the length of the agreement 1 if it is for at least 99 years the credit equals the reduction in the lands fair market value due to the recovery action or agreement plus th property owners actual costs 2 if it is for at least 30 years but less than 99 ears the credit equals 75 of the above amounts 3 if it is for at least 10 years but less than 30 years the credit equals 75 of the actual costs pp 5758 the qualifications or standards for the binding agreement are unclear depending on the specifics of the agreement the requirements for claiming the tax credit may be more or less stringent than t hose for tax incentives that currently exist for similar conservation activities eg th charitable deduction for conservation easements under irc 170 the taxpayer must submit to the irs evidence of the binding agreement and written verification from biologist that the conservation and recovery practice is described in the agreement and implemented during the taxable year in accordance with the agreements schedule pp 5859 the credit may not be claimed if the taxpayer received costshare assistance from the federal or state government under any crediteligible recovery action or agreement for that year p 59 there is an exception for individuals whose adjusted gross income is less than the limitations in irc 32 the earned income tax credit p 59 also the taxpayers qualified costs are reduced by any nontaxable government assistance for qualified conservation and recovery costs received in the year the credit was claimed or in any prior year p 61 with respect to the second limitation regarding costshare assistance it is unclear as to whether the assistance must have been received fo r the specific project for which the credit is claimed there are requirements regarding the qualifications of the biologist who can verify the agreement the basis of the property for which any credit is allowable must be reduced by the amount of the taxpayers qualified cost s regardless of whether those costs were greater than the am ount that the taxpay ers tax liability ex ceeded the sum of the specified credits p 60httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33309crs94 this could be interpreted to require that the taxpayer reduce the basis by the total qualified costs in the first taxable year even if the taxpayer did not claim the full credit in that year thus the taxpayer would experience the negative consequences from reducing the basis to account for th total costs without necessarily receiving the positive benefits from claiming the full credit the amount of any deduction or other tax credit must be reduced by the taxpayers qualified costs limited to the taxpayers tax liability pp 6061 this appears to require that the ta xpayer reduce all deductions and other credits by the amount of the credit allowe d regardless of whether they are based on the same expenses used for this credit the credit is limited to the taxpayers tax liability including alternative minimum tax liability after applying certain credits p 57 any portion of the credit that cannot be claimed because of this limitation may be carried back for one year and carried forward for 20 years pp 5960 the new credit may be transferred through sale and repurchase agreements p 60 the tax consequences of such sale are unclear this provision is unusual as other tax credit is allowed to be sold
