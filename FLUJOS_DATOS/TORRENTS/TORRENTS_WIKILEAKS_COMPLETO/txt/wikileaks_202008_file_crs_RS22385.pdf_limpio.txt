in these reauthorization pr oposals but not included in the dra presidents fy2007 budget proposals for tanf the presidents fy2007 budget proposals for tanf would according to congressional budget office estimates incr ease federal budget outlays by 15 million in fy2007 and total of 14 billion over th fiveyear period fy2007fy2011 these increases are in contrast to proposals to achieve savings in other mandatory spending programs such as medicare and medicaid healthy marriage initiative the 2004 poverty rate for children raised by single mother was 42 compared with poverty ra of 9 for children living in families headed by married couple almost six out of ten poor children live in families headed by single mother the most common family receiving cash welfare is also headed by single mother research indicates that children in families headed by both of their biological parents do better on an array of child developm ent outcomes higher academic achievement lower teenage child bearing lower levels of delinquency etc than children living in singleparent families much of this is due to the lower incomes of singleparent compared to marriedcouple families but the statistical associati on between family type and child outcomes holds even when considering families of equivalent incomes however these better outcomes hold only when child lives with both of his or her biological parents these outcomes do not pply to stepchildren further there are concerns about promoting marriage when some relationships are violent additionally there is the caveat to interpreting social science research that correlation does not equal causation the actual cause of the differen ce in child outcomes could be differences in characteristics and behaviors some not obse rved for purposes of statistical study associated with married versus unmarried parents the dra provides up to 100 million per year for fy2006 through fy2010 to fund healthy marriage initiatives the dra funds

fundi ng would be inadequa during recessions tanf includes 2 billion contingency fund to provide additional matching grants to states during recessionary periods if certain conditions are met one of those conditions is that each state spending from its own funds within the tanf program exceeds the amount spent in predecessor programs in fy1994 during the economic downturn associated with the 2001 recession state drew contingency funds even those that met criteria of economic need high and increasing unemployment rates or increased food stamp caseloads failed to spend from their own funds enough to qualify for contingency funds in recent years tennessee and sout h carolina have draw n contingency funds additionally the tanf hurricane katrina relief measure pl 10968 provided 100 federal

block grant equal to peak expenditures for pretanf programs during the fy1992 to fy1995 period during consideration of legisl ation that led to enactment of that law fixed funding based on historic expenditure s was thought to disadvantage two groups of states 1 those that had high rates of population growth and 2 those that had historically low welfare grants relative to pove rty therefore additional funding in the form of supplemental grants was provided to states that met criteria of high rates of population growth andor low historic grants per poor person tota l of 17 states qualify
