pjonesueaacuk kbriffaueaacuk christianpfisterhistunibech christoph i have time for just few brief comments ill leave ed and the others to follow up if they wish mike mann at 0513 pm 41900 0200 you wrote dear prof cook i have received your comments and the comments of prof mann juerg kindly forwarded the messages first i would like to point out that our paper clearly has the intention to contribute in constructive way to the discussion of proxybased climate reconstructions this was the reason for fitting available proxybased indices onto j in order to assess the potential of the complementary information in the proxy data in fact we need proxydata to go further back but it is essential to know the limitations and there are obviously major limitations as you mentioned there might be some nonstationarities in the nao hmmm i think what ed actually meant is that if one samples eg only subset of the quadrapole set of temperature lobes of the nao especially if one samples only say one of themthe european one then one will necessarily be seeing combination of the nao and any other climate patterns that have distinct regional overprint in that region in the case of europe there are several so the nonstationarity isnt in the true nao it is an the attempt to define the nao in terms of an insufficent subsample of regions influence by it however the signature of the nao shows to be quite robust for most of the 20th century as you said we do not know if there is in fact probably strongly biased signal towards the european continent back in time i have downloaded the preprint paper by cullen et in first overview it seems to that one of my main conclusions which states that it is important to use the complementary information in the data is confirmed by their work in fact this was already one of the conclusions in the luterbacher et 1999 paper number of used predictors are an important factor for the obtained skill it would have been nice to find the luterbacher et 1999 index in the analyses of the mentioned cullen et paper eg in the tables 1 to 3 in fact the cullen et paper was originally written and submitted well before the paper you cite grl has an extremely fast turnaround time relative to paleoceanography and it wouldnt have been appropriate for heidi cullen to redo all the analyses using this additional index at the time the paper was already in reviewin press the loss of skill 18401873 found in table 3 of the mentioned cullen et paper implies again that proxybased index reconstructions have to be verified rigorously in the pre1850 period the luterbacher et 1999 index might give some help for the validation of proxybased reconstruction attempts this index will be open to the public after the egs2000 conference httpwwwgiubunibechklimet since im not specialist in treering proxydata you could probably better explain the following questions that i honestly can not explain why are the different proxyindices not significantly correlated back in time if one considers serious significance testing procedure on the interannual and decadal timescale hmmm im not sure how you come to this conclusion from the results we show several proxy indices are in fact quite significantly correlated the appenzeller index is the only one that doesnt show close correlation with the others how is it possible from biological and physical point of view to relate the mid and high latitude treering density and width to the main winter circulation pattern in europe im sure ed and keith can point you to the relevant wealth of literature on this sincerely yours christoph schmutz from michael mann mannmultiproxyevscvirginiaedu to ed cook drdendroldeocolumbiaedu juerg luterbacher juerggiubunibech cc cullenldeocolumbiaedu druidrdldeocolumbiaedu pjonesueaacuk kbriffaueaacuk subject re your recent grl paper thanks for your comments ed i agree with them and think this needs to be looked into further i would encourage those who havent yet to take look at the cullen et manuscript which covers the same territory and comes to somewhat different conclusions the manuscript is now inpress in paleoceanography and is available in preprint form here both as postscript and pdf file httprainbowldeocolumbiaeduclimategrouppapers would be interested in peoples thoughts regards mike at 0434 pm 41800 0400 ed cook wrote dear juerg i have just completed reading your most recent grl paper schmutz et 2000 on nao reconstructions in which you show that proxybased nao reconstructions are probably wanting it is not possible to strongly defend my reconstruction at this time indeed i was extremely cautious in my description of it with regards to overfitting problems etc however i do think that there are some issues that have not been fully explored which could help explain some of the nonstationarity in the relationships found between your index and mine at least based on proxy data alone first my nao reconstruction is based on 6 north american and 4 european treering chronologies because the putuative nao information in these records spans the north atlantic and nicely brackets the nao centers of action as we know them now they potentially contain past information that is missing from purely europeanbased estimate of nao this could occur if the nao did not affect climate on both sides of the north atlantic in the same roughly symmetric way back in time as it does now if this were the case and we have way of knowing that now as far as i know then it is conceivable that your l index is excessively biased towards europe as would be the extended jones slp index if so any comparisons between your l index and my proxy index with the jones index would be hopelessly biased in your favor this is not to say that my reconstruction is as good as yours but it might not be as bad as your results indicate either indeed i did make some effort to verify my reconstruction against early instrumental records with somewhat contradictory and potentially interesting results over the 18411873 period my record correlates significantly with stykkisholmer slp 0456 and oslo temperatures 0323 but not bermuda slp 0156 and central england temperatures 0211 the appearance of significant verification with only the more northerly instrumental records may be telling us something about differences in circulation and ssts over the north atlantic from what is now the case this could affect the way in which the nao affects climate jointly over north america and europe of course when i added some earlier observations same stations to the verification tests table 4 of my paper the results weakened considerably so maybe this means that my nao reconstruction is indeed poor however i must admit to having doubts about the quality of the early instrumental records despite the great efforts made to homogenize and correct them this is especially the case with regards to lowfrequency variability but can also extend to individual values as well i talked with phil jones about one suspect datum in the early portion of his extended nao record that largely destroys any correlation with proxybased nao estimates the sign of the instrumental index appears to be wrong to yet phil is convinced that that datum is good and he may very well be right either way more robust methods of association between series may be jusitified to guard anomalous values last year i asked you to please send my your reconstruction of the nao l i never received it and ask you again to please send it regards ed
