and industry division july 14 2008 abstract livestock industry groups animal health officials and the us department of agriculture usda have been working to establish nationwide identification id system capable of quickly tracking animals from birth to slaughter to deal with animal diseases andor to satisfy foreign market specifications some consumer groups are among those who believe id also would be useful for food safety or retail labeling purposes not all producers support new program fearing it will be costly and intrusive in the 110th congress measures with animal id andor

refers to keeping records on farm animals or groups eg flocks herds so that they can be more easily tracked from birth to slaughter use of animal id dates back at least to the 1800s when hot iron brands were used throughout the us west to indicate ownership id methods today include ear back and tail tags neck chains freeze as opposed to hot iron brands and leg bands some producers use radio frequency id transponders with information that is read by scanners and fed into computer databases the reasons for identifying and tracking animals and their products also have evolved animal health animal id can help to identify the source of dangerous and costly animal diseases and to contain them in the global marketplace animal disease programs aided by traceability systems are used both to reassure buyers about the health of us animals and to satisfy foreign veterinary andor food safety requirements usdas animal and plant health inspection service aphis oversees animal health in consultation with state veterinary authorities and some of its disease eradication and control efforts effectively require id and tracking for example for brucellosis highly contagious and costly disease mainly affecting cattle bison and swine once common here uniquely numbered brucellosis id tags were routinely attached to animals which noted that they had been vaccinated or tested because brucellosis has largely been eradicated from us commercial herds id is longer widespread examples of other official disease programs include pseudorabies in swine and scrapie in sheep where swine and sheep respectively must be officially identified before entering interstate commerce crs2 often state laws or breed association rules require animals of these and other species like cattle and horses to be identified to participate in shows or races still universal system captures the locations and movements of all farm animals across all states us limitations were noted after bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse or mad cow disease was discovered in the united states in canadianborn dairy cow in december 2003 number of trading partners that had quickly closed their borders to us beef reportedly were reluctant to reopen them due in part to us difficulties in tracing the whereabouts of other cattle that had entered the united states with the bseinfected cow similar difficulties arose in determining the whereabouts andor herdmates of the two later usborn bse cases1 commercial production and marketing many farmers and ranchers already keep track of individual animals and how they are being raised in order to identify and exploit desirable production characteristics universal bar codes on processed food including many meats are widely used by processors and retailers to manage inventories add value to products and monitor consumer buying when consumers seek meat eggs or milk from animals raised according to specified organic humane treatment or httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22653 environmental standards id and traceability can help firms verify production methods governmentcoordinated programs also have been established for these purposes for example process verification program operated by usdas agricultural marketing service ams provides livestock and meat producers an opportunity to assure customers of their ability to provide consistent quality products by having their written manufacturing processes confirmed through independent third party audits according to ams usda process verified suppliers can have marketing claims such as breeds and feeding practices and so label them under this voluntary feeforservice program after bse appeared in north america in 2003 ams developed an export verification ev program for us plants seeking to meet the differing beef import specifications of various countries like japan once the numberone foreign market for us beef ams establishes the standards that us suppliers must follow if they want to ship beef to these countries and certifies that the proper procedures are in place while ev is voluntary it is also prerequisite for access to the japanese korean and other foreign markets other programs employing varying levels and types of traceability include the domestic origin requirement for usdapurchased commodities used in domestic feeding programs and the national organic certification program which ams also oversees2 food safety federal and state food safety agencies collaborate with aphis to protect the food supply from the introduction through animals of threats to human health such as tuberculosis and foodborne illnesses from bacteria like salmonella and coli 1 see crs report rl32199 bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse or mad cow disease current and proposed safeguards by sarah lister and geoffrey s becker 2 for more information see the ams website at httpwwwamsusdagov also ams released on april 2 2008 draft business plan intended to integrate usdas current animal id efforts with these marketing programs the plan was posted on the internet at httpanimalid aphisusdagovnaisnaislibrarydocumentsplans_reportsnais_business_planpdf crs3 o157h7 generally when local health officials can link an illness to particular product firms and their regulators have been able to trace that product back to the processor andor slaughter facility it is more difficult and costly to determine which particular animals herds or flocks were involved some believe that more rigorous traceback and animal id system would facilitate food recalls possibly contain the spread of foodborne illness and help authorities stem future incidents others particularly many within the food industry strongly disagree countering that such system would not be based on sound science and would be technically unworkable and extremely costly3 development of national plan early privatepublic efforts work toward coordinated national animal id system began in earnest in the early 2000s and evolved into joint industrygovernment professional effort whose principal goal was the ability to trace animals of interest within 48 hours of an animal disease problem draft us animal identification plan usaip published in december 2003 called for recording the movement of individual animals or animal groups in central database or in seamlessly linked database infrastructure aphis roles would be to allocate premises eg farms feedlots auction httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22653 barns processing plants and animal numbers and to coordinate data collection the work plan envisioned by the usaip had first called for all states to have an animal premises id system by july 2004 with farm animals of all major species identified by july 2006 usda actions4 as the draft usaip was being published in december 2003 the first us bse case emerged among the initiatives usda quickly announced to shore up confidence in the beef supply was accelerated implementation of animal id since early 2004 the department has committed nearly 128 million to its development providing many of the funds to states and tribal organizations for research database systems and startup of premises registration usda first announced framework for its national animal identification system nais in april 2004 and has been periodically revising the outlines of the program since then it issued draft strategic plan in may 2005 announced new set of guiding principles in august 2005 and unveiled new plan in april 2006 that set timeline for full implementation by 2009 in november 2006 usda distributed draft user guide as the most current plan for the nais which replaces all previously published program documents including the 2005 draft strategic plan and draft program standards and the 2006 implementation strategies the user guide sought to assure producers that usda would not require them to participate in the program and that it is bound by law to protect individuals private and confidential business information the draft user guide described three successively greater steps toward full participation premises registration done through one of the state or tribal animal health authorities by late 2006 the goal was to register all premises by 2009 3 see also crs report rl32922 meat and poultry inspection background and selected issues and crs report 97508 countryoforigin labeling for foods both by geoffrey s becker 4 this section is based primarily on current and archived materials found at aphiss animal id website at httpanimalidaphisusdagovnaisindexshtml crs4 animal id accomplished by obtaining usdarecognized numbering tags or devices from representatives of authorized manufacturers selection by the producer of one of the naiscompliant animal tracking databases to which the producer can report animal movements on this last point usda continues to envision universal system as series of state or privately held databases which the department could tap only in the event of an animal disease outbreak with the goal of tracing animals from point of origin to processing within 48 hours its user guide anticipated that the nais would cover the following species cattle and bison poultry swine sheep and goats cervids such as deer and elk horses and other equines and camelids eg llamas and alpacas household pets and other animals not listed would be excluded from nais only animals that enter commerce or that commingle with animals at other premises like sales barns state or national fairs or exhibits would be identified also animals that typically are moved in groups such as hogs and poultry could be identified as part of their group rather than individually the draft business plan released in april 2008 attempted to further clarify current httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22653 implementation strategies one of seven key strategies would be to prioritize species with the primary commercial food animals in tier 1 along with horses that need health certificate or test when moved all other livestock and poultry would be in lower priority tier 2 one key objective would be to bring 70 of the cattle breeding herd into nais by the end of 20095 selected issues supporters assert that an animal id system is needed to maintain us competitiveness in the global marketplace where other major meatexporting countries have been rapidly developing their own id programs in part to meet importing countries demands for such traceability some livestock producers say they are not convinced that any new program mandatory or voluntary will improve animal health oversight and they fear that it will only impose costly and intrusive regulations on their operations without adding any significant value to their animals some reportedly are working within individual states to block mandatory andor voluntary programs there implementation pace some animal id program supporters on the other hand have criticized usda for moving too slowly andor not setting clearer path toward universal id as of midjuly 2008 aphis reported that less than 500000 animal premises had been registered in one of the available databases this compares with an estimated 14 million livestock and poultry farms in the united states 2002 census of agriculture data registration rates vary widely among states july 2007 report by the government accountability office concluded that number of problems had hindered effective implementation of animal id such as prioritization among the nine animal species to be covered to focus on those of greatest disease concern plan to integrate nais into existing usda and state animal id requirements and requirement that some types of critical data be provided to the 5 see footnote 2 crs5 databases such as species or age6 others believe that usdas progress simply reflects the wide differences among producers and other interests over many unresolved issues house and senate appropriators also have questioned usdas progress and direction in implementing national system over several years through fy2007 about 1178 million went into the programs development the enacted fy2008 appropriation part of the consolidated appropriations act 2008 pl 110161 provided 98 million more to continue implementation of nais which is well below the administrations requested appropriation of 332 million for nais for fy2008 the conference report cites concerns about the lack of information provided on full costs and concerns about the use of funds to date including information on how aphis would reach its 48hour traceback goal and information on how the funds for the program have been used to date the report states the committees concern that more than 50 of the obligations to date in nais have been for cooperative agreements that until very recently did not require that cooperators or grantees agree to specific performance goals the committees are also concerned that 25 of the funding has gone for program management administration officials seeking 24 million for the program for fy2009 were httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22653 harshly criticized by the chair of the house appropriations agriculture subcommittee at hearing on april 9 2008 she indicated that she wanted more accountability regarding the spending the house appropriations committee had not marked up usdas fy2004 usda appropriation as of midjuly 2008 however the subcommittees draft bill reportedly contains incentives to encourage wider adoption of animal id notably requirement that usda purchase meats for the school lunch program starting in 2010 only from suppliers in the id system7 mandatory or voluntary according to the departments latest thinking on the nais see above participation in nais is voluntary at the federal level the nais does not need to be mandatory to be effective others including many state animal health officials reportedly disagree at meetings in october 2006 the national assembly of state animal health officials and the us animal health associations livestock committee each approved recommendation that as step toward national system usda make animal id mandatory for all us breeding cattle consumer advocacy groups also have pressed for mandatory national system costs and who pays an animal id system will impose variety of costs such as for tags or other identifying devices and their application and data systems to track animals cost estimates of national system have varied broadly and are not directly comparable reflection of estimators differing assumptions and of the varying designs of proposed programs as the extent of traceability increases so do likely costs related policy question is who should pay the industry and ultimately consumers government or both usdas current thinking calls for expenses to be shared eg database costs funded by government and the identifying devices by producers 6 national animal identification system usda needs to resolve several key implementation issues to achieve rapid and effective disease traceback gao07592 7 see for example funding bill links nais school sales feedstuffs june 23 2008 crs6 it has been argued that as more tracing requirements are imposed large retailers and meat packers will exercise market power to shift compliance costs backward to farms and ranches making it even more difficult for the smaller independent ones to remain in business larger more vertically integrated operations are more likely to have the resources and scale economies to survive some have argued on the other hand if traceability costs forced big meat plants to reduce line speeds smaller plants with slower fabrication speeds may be better equipped to implement traceability to the retail level and may find niche market opportunities8 liability and confidentiality of records some producers are concerned they will be held liable for contamination or other problems over which they believe they have little control after the animal leaves the farm on the other hand documentation of management practices including animal health programs can help to protect against liability because they can prove where animals came from and how they were raised9 also at issue is whether producers can and should be protected from public scrutiny of their records the federal freedom of information act foia entitles members of the public to obtain records held by federal agencies some producers are concerned for example that animal rights extremists might misuse information gained through foia httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22653 or that the data collection might reveal proprietary information however foia exempts access to certain types of business information such as trade secrets commercial or financial information or other confidential material that might harm the provider10 conferees deleted provision sec 10305 in the senatepassed version of hr 2419 the omnibus farm bill enacted as pl 110246 that would have required usda regulations addressing the protection of trade secrets and other proprietary andor confidential business information disclosed due to participation in an animal id system other bills in the 110th congress usda has claimed it has authority under the animal health protection act 7 usc 8301 et seq to implement an animal id program several other pending bills aim to clarify usdas authority andor spell out what type of program should be established they include hr 1018 prohibiting usda from carrying out mandatory program and also seeking to protect the privacy of producer information under voluntary system hr 2301 establishing an industryled livestock identification board to manage national id system and s 1292 requiring usda to implement more comprehensive farmtoconsumer animal id and meat traceability program hr 3485 would require comprehensive new traceability systems for both usdaregulated meat and poultry and for other foods regulated by the us food and drug administration fda
