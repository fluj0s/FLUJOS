supplemental appropriations bill would provide an additional 45 million for expa nsion of checkpoint explosives detection pilot systems this report discusses the current state of passenger explosives trace detection and rela ted policy issues current state of passenger explosives trace detection explosives detection for aviation security has been an area of federal concern for many years much effort has been focused on direct detection of explosive materials in carryon and checked luggage but techniques ve also been developed to detect and identify residual traces that may indicate passengers recent contact with explosive materials these techniques use separation and detection technologies such as mass spectrometry gas chromatography chemical luminescence or ion mobility spectrometry to measure the chemical properties of vapor or particulate matter collected from passengers or their carryon luggage seve ral technologies have been developed and deployed on test or pilot basis paralle l efforts in explosives vapor detection have employed specially trained animals usually dogs the effectiveness of chemical trace analysis is highly dependent on three distinct steps 1 sample collection 2 sample an alysis and 3 comparison of results with known standards2 if any of these steps is suboptimal the test may fail to detect explosives that are present when trace analysis is used for passenger screening additional goals may include nonintrusive or minimally intrusive sa mple collection fast sample analysis and identification and low co st while universal solution has yet been achieved ion mobility spectrometry is most often used in currently deployed equipment in 2004 tsa began pilot projects to deploy portal trace detection equipment for operational

traces of explosive material for det ection as vapor or it may use puffs of air that can dislodge small particles as an aerosol portal deployment is ongoing3 one alternative to portals is to collect the chemical sample using handheld vacuum wand another is to test an object handl ed by the passenger such as boarding pass for residues transferred from th passengers hands in this case the secondary object is used as the carrier between the passenger and the analyzing equipment4 the olfactory ability of dogs is sensitiv enough to detect trace amounts of many compounds but several factors have inhibite d the regular use of canines for passenger screening dogs trained in explosives det ection can generally only work for brief periods have significant upkeep costs are unable to communicate the identity of the detected explosives residue and require human handl er when performing their detection role5 in addition direct contact between dogs and airline passengers rais liability concerns detection of bulk explosives direct detection of explosives concealed on passengers in bulk quantities s been another area of fede ral interest technology development efforts in this area include porta l systems based on techniques such as xray backscatter imaging millimeter wave energy analysis and terahertz imaging6 as such systems detect only bulk quantities of explosives they would not raise nuisance alarms on passengers who have recently handled explosives for innocuous reasons some versions could simultaneously tect other threats such as nonmetallic weapons on the other hand trace detection techniques are also likely to detect bulk quantities of explosives and may alert scr eening personnel to security c oncerns about passenger who has had contact with explosives but is not actually carrying an explosive device when screened current deployments for passeng er screening are focused on trace detection and the remainder of this re port does not discuss bulk detec tion however many of the policy issues discussed below would apply similarly to bulk detection equipment policy issues any strategy for deploying and operating pa ssenger explosives detection portals must consider number of challenges organizati onal challenges include deciding where and how detectors are used projecting costs and developing tec hnical and regulatory standards operational challenges incl ude maximizing passenger throughput responding to erroneous and innocuous det ections ensuring passenger acceptance of new procedureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21920crs4 7 transportation security

equipment including techniques for detecting novel explosives fo r security reasons many technical details of equipment performance are not publicly av ailable which makes independent analysis of technical performance challenging equipment location and use an important component of deployment strategy is identifying where and how passenger explosives detection equipment will be used portals could be deployed widely so that all locations benefit from them or they could be used only at select ed locations where they can most effectively address and mitigate risk in any given location portals could be used as primary screening technology for all passengers or as condary screening technology for selected passengers only widespread deployment and use for pr imary screening might provide more uniform risk reduction but would requi re many more portals and thus increase costs cost of operation the total cost of deploying explosives detection equipment for passenger screening is unknown accord ing to tsa the portal systems currently being deployed in us airports cost more than 160000 each7 document scanning systems are somewhat less expensive according to 2002 gao study similar tabletop systems used for screening carryon baggage can cost from 20000 to 650008 it is possible that technology improvements or bulk purchasing could lower costs the number of devices required would depend on throughput rates device reliability and lifetime and deploy ment strategy the united stat has more than 400 commercial passenger airports if equally distributed several t housand devices might be required corresponding to total capital cost for equipment of up to hundreds of millions of dollars installation and maintenance costs w ould be additional operating the equipment would require additional screening procedures and might lead to costs for additional screening personnel or else create indirect costs by incr easing passenger wait times it is unknown

certification regul ation and the establishment of screening procedures standards for the performance of passenger explosives trace detection equipment procedures for evalua tion and certification of the equipment and regulations for its use are all yet to be established regulations and screening procedures have been established for explosives trace detection on luggage9 detection on passengers is more complicated ventur involving possible privacy concerns greater difficulty in sampling and potentially different sensitivity requirements nevertheless the current luggage regulations could be

screening time when multiplied by the large number of airline passengers each day even small increases in screening times may be logistically prohibitive the tsa goal for passenger wait time at airports is less than 10 minutes and screening systems reportedly operate at rate between 7 to 10 passengers per minute10 additional screening that sl ows passenger throughput and increases passenger wait time may add to airport conges tion and have detrimental economic impact 1996 gao study stated that throughput goals for portal technologies at that time were equivalent to 6 passengers per minute11 according to the same st udy nonpor tal technologies such as secondary object analysis had s lightly higher throughput goals the tsas pilot deployment of passenger explosives trace detection equipment will likely provide useful information on passenger throughput if appreciable increase in screening times occurs then passenger explos ives screening may i nvolve few additional direct economic costs beyond those of procur ing deploying opera ting and maintaining the equipment if passenger throughput is drastically decreased then alternatives for passenger screening may need to be considered in between these extremes it may be possible to moderate the economic impact by adding screening lanes or by using explosives detection equipment only on thos passengers who are selected for secondary screening as recommended by the 911 commission as possible initial step erroneous and i nnocuous detection potential complication of explosives trace detection is the accuracy of detector performance fa lse positives false negatives and innocuous true positives are ll challenges if the detec tion system often detects the presence of an explosive when there actually is none false positive then there will be high burden in verifying results through dditional procedures because of the large volume of air passengers even small false positive rates may be unacceptable conversely if the system fails to detect th presence of an explosive false negative then the potential consequences may be rious assuming the system has adequate sensitivity to detect explosives traces in an operational environm ent the detection threshold or criteria required for an alarm can generally be adjusted enabling tradeoff between false positives and false negatives but neither can be eliminated entirely the appropriate balance may be matter of debate innocuous true pos itives occur when passe nger has been in contact with explosives but for legitimate reasons examples include individuals who take nitroglycerin for medical purposes or individuals in the minin g or construction industry who use explosives in their work such passengers would be regu larly subject to additional security scrutiny similar issues arise from the current use of trace detection equipment on some airline passenger carryon baggage nd innocuous true positives in such cases are generally handled without incident the impact of innocuous true positives will likely depend on their frequency and on the propor tion of passengers subject to explosives trace detectionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21920crs6 12 jay cohen under secretary for science and t echnology department of homeland security testimony before the house committee on homeland security subcommittee on emergency preparedness science and technology september 7 2006passenger acceptance some passengers may have personal c oncerns about the addition of passenger explosives trace detection to the screening process issues of privacy may be raised by the connection between innocuous true positives and passenger medical status or field of em ployment also equipment th at uses vacuum wand or puffs of air for sample collection may offe nd some passengers nse of propriety or modesty passenger reluctance could then increase screening times allowing alternative forms of screening such as within priv acy enclosures or through different imaging technology might mitigate passeng er concerns in some cases potential for inte ntional disruption another concern is the possibility that passenger screening regimen that includes ex plosives trace detection could be exploited to intentionally disrupt the operation of an airport th dissemination of trace quantities of an explosive material on commonly touche d objects within the airport might lead to many positive detections on passe ngers this would make trace detection less effective or ineffective for security screening and might disrupt airport ope rations generally until alternative screening procedures such as enhanced baggage screening by tsa personnel could be put in place or the contaminati on source could be iden tified and eliminated research and development the dhs and its predecessor agencies have historically been the main funders of res earch on explosives detection for airport use most of this research has focused on detec ting explosives in baggage rather than on passengers several other fe deral agencies however also fund research related to trace explosives detection these in clude the departments of ener gy and justice the national institute for standards and technology nd the interagency technical support working group much of this research has been dicated to overcoming technical challenges such as increasing sensitivity and reducing the time required for sample analysis different research challenge is the det ection of novel explosives detectors are generally designed to look for specific ex plosives both to limit the number of false or innocuous positives and to allow determination of which ex plosive has been detected as result novel explosives are unlikely to be detected until identifying characteristics and reference standards have been developed and incorporat ed into equipment designs unlike imaging techniques for detecting bul k quantities of explosives trace analysis provides opportunity for human operator to identify suspicious material based on experience or intuition liquid explosives are novel threat that has been of particular interest since august 2006 when british police disrupted plot to bomb aircraft using liquids the dhs is evaluating technologies to detect liquid explosives12 its efforts are mainly focused on bulk detection such as scanners to test the contents of bottles like solid explosives however liquids might be found through trace detection if the trace detection system is designed to look for them
