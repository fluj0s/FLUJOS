acceleration of f4es for iran ref tehran 1091 tehran 263 moscow 1603 country team message begin summary general azimi minister of war on instruction of shah asks that we take another hard look at f4e production line in order accelerate delivery of one squadron of f4es to iran in 1972 request reflects shahs increasing concern over soviet ambitions in area and especially threat shah sees to iran of friendship treaty under consideration by iraq and ussr shah recognizes problems this poses for us but is turning to usg with this request to give iran higher priority on fa4e production schedule because he regards us as most dependable friend end summary action requested country team recommends us review f4e production line and respond favorably to shahs request for 16 f4es in 1972 from whatever source may be available 1 on feb 24 charge was convoked by minster of war gen rezanuzimi on instructions from shah azimi said shah most deeply concerned at trends in security situation in middle east and expecially on his western borders us officals already aware of shahs concern through discussions with foreign minister and other goi officials see reftels but recent developments in iraq soviet relations including agreement to deliver more migs and other military equipment plus indication that recent iraqisoviet talks in moscow included consideration of friendship treaty as well as increased military cooperation inject new sense of urgency in shahs timetable for moderninzing and strenthening his armed forces most specifically situation required iran accelerate its military procurement and host particularly delivery of f4e aircraft 2 azimi recalled that goi had requested delivery of 16 of f4e aircraft now on order by iran first of which was not scheduled for delivery until august 1973 be advanced to cy 1972 however goi had recently been informed by usg and mcdonnelldouglas that production line for iran could not rpt not be advanced to meet 1972 delivery dates desired shah was most disturbed as addition of f4es in 1972 was vital to irans security at this time shah had directed that usg be asked if production for iran could not in fact be advanced to make requested f4es available from other sources shahs desire is for deliivery of f4fs in lots of four during june to december timeframe 3 charge reviewed recent developments in usiran military cooperation including equipment and credit and stressed that record indicated we understood and appreciated shahs concerns and desires and had been exceptionally responsive to shahs wishes currently azimis deputy gen toufans was in us discussing very question of acclerated equipment acquisiion including f4e acceleration of f4e delivery raised difficult technical and cost problems as well as questions of other commitments and priorities undoubtedly these issues were being discussed in full with gen toufanian to ensure that he was completely informed of possibilities and problems and reasons for any limitations on meeting goi request that might exist gen toufanian probably would have fuller picture of situation than we now had in iran 4 azimi responded that goi was being kept informed of toufanian discussions but decison on f4e could not be delayed azimi made clear shah felt aquisition of 16 f4e aircraft in 1972 was most important immediate military problem outstanding he stressed shah believed that number required was small in relation to us inventory and that unsettled situation confronting iran warranted accelerated delivery to iran as against other possible dispositions as to europe or even usaf in same time frame 5 charge noted we would transmit shahs request to washington and that usg in spirit of friendship which marked our relations would make every effort to be responsive charge said this same friendship required him to say however that although we would do everything possible to meet shahs needs as shah saw them our military advisers as goi knew were concerned that acceleration of aircraft acquisition would strain support and operational manpower of iiaf and could lead to decrease rather than increase in iiaf effectiveness azimi replied that number of aircraft to be delivered had been closely studied by ilaf with maag assistance and iiaf was satisfied that sixteen aircraft requested could be effectively integrated into present force structure azimi closed meeting by asking that usg answer shahs request as rapidly as possible 6 comment shah is deeply concern at developments over past years strengthening soviet influence and presence in mideast and indian ocean and appearing to indicate substantially enlarged soviet commitment economic and military to iraq he has concluded that increased present danger reqires irans first line air defense to be beefedup now rather than in previously programmed schedule starting in eighteen months the number frequency and tone of demarches on subject we have received is virtually unparallelled and can leave doubt that him considers issue of vital importance 7 whether we fully agree with shahs concern we must take into account that request like usg decision in 1970 on sale to iran of seventh and eighth squadrons of f4e has become another gut issue in shahs mind shah is again turning to usg because in periods of anxiety shah feels he can look to us for cooperation and he hopes that us as reliable friend will find chance be responsive on matter he considers important and vital to irans security thus usg consideration of request must recognize that decision involves unusual degree of political importance related to fabric of usggoi relations decision should also not overlook or underestimate importance of iran for vital us national interests 8 action requested counry team urges that usg give prompt and sympathetic attention to shahs request for 1972 delivery of f4e aircraft from whatever sources may be available to be tapped including deliveries to usaf we recognize that request may raise difficult problems but urge that every avenue be explored to reach positive response it is also most important that country team be kept fully informed of progress and prospects to enable us continue to meet and temper sense of urgency on subject which prevails within goi if delays or barriers to fully favorable response materialize we trust that every effort will be made to be as forthcoming as possible eg partial delivery in 1972 and that persuasive rationale can be developed to fully explain to shah reasons for any shortcoming in order to diminish as much as possible negative impact heck
