length of time given nomination may be pending in the senate varies widely some nominations are confirme d within few days others may not be confirmed for several months and some are never confir med this report provides for each executive department nomination that was confirmed in the 107th congress the number of days between nomination and confirmation days to confirm some senate recess days are not included in this sum because senators are unable to take up nominations on these days for prac tical reasons only days from the longer recesses around august and between cong ressional sessions are excluded these recesses are often longer than 30 days th is cutoff point is suggested by the senate rules which provide that if the senate shall adjourn or take recess for more than thirty days all nominations pending and not finally acted upon shall be returned to the president although this rule is often waived4 the 32 days during the august 2002 recess and the 33 days between the first and second sessions of the 107th congress were subtracted from the days to confirm for those nominations that spanned one or both recesses days were subtracted for the august 2001

order for nominations congressional record daily edition vol 148 aug 1 2002 p s8020because as discussed below all pending nominations were returned prior to that recess an accurate calculation of the average time the senate t ook to confirm nomination in the 107th congress is made more challenging by an unusual characteristic of the session as just note d the senate rules pr ovide that all pending nominations are to be returned to the president at the beginning of recesses of 30 days or more usually the senate agrees by unanimous consent to waive this rule and retain pending nominati ons over their recesses prior to the 31day august 2001 recess however the senate did not r each such an agreement and 162 pending nominations 35 of which are among those c overed by this report were returned to the president5 the president sent forward some of these nominees again after the recess those nominations were consider ed to be new nominations rather than continuations of the prerece ss nominations as result when such nominations are confirmed the length of the confirmation process shown in the tables of this report as days to confirm does not include any prerecess time during which the nominee was under consideration in the senate consequently the average is smaller than it would be if the pre and postrecess nomination times were added together for example the mean number of days to confirm for all executive department nominations is 46 days but if the pre recess days during which nominee was under consideration in the senate were included for all confirmed nominees this mean would be 50 days likewise the median days to confirm for all department nominations is 36 but it would be 38 if pr erecess days were in cluded footnotes for appointment action tables for each department below provi figures that take such prerecess time into account in general however comparisons between average confirmation times from this report and those from previ ous reports should be made cautiously the tables in this report show both the mean and median number of days the mean is the average as it is commonly calculated in order to calculate the mean days to confirm for example for each department the days to confirm data for all the confirmed nominations in the department were added together and then divided by the number of confirmed nominations the mean time taken by the senate to confirm nomination to an executive department in the 107th congress was 46 days or 6 to 7 weeks by depar tment the means ranged from 30 days for transportation and veterans affairs to 65 for housing and urban development httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31346crs4 6a succinct historical and contemporary overview of the appointment power is f ound in louis fisher appointme nt powers in his constitutional conflicts between congress and the president 4th ed lawrence ks university press of kansas 1997 pp 2248the median is the middle number when the days to confirm data for all the confirmed nominations are arra nged in numerical order although the mean is the more familiar kind of average the median is included b ecause it diminishes the influence of few extreme entries for the department of agriculture usda for example the mean is 41 and the median is 22 this difference is largely due to the influence of the nomination for inspector general which was pe nding in the senate for 213 days more than twice as long as any other usda nomination in this case the median more accurately reflects the average number of days nominations to the department were pendi ng in the senate the median days to confirm for all departments was 36 days or about 5 weeks this indicates that half of those nominations confirmed sp ent 36 days or less pe nding in the senate the appointment process the president and the senate share the power to appoint the principal officers of the united states6 the constitution article ii section 2 empowers the president to nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate to appoint the principal officers of the united states three distinct stages mark the appointment processsel ection and nomination conf irmation and appointment selection and nomination in this stage the president selects the nominee and sends the nomination to the senate there are number of steps in the presidents selection of candidates for mo st senateconf irmed positions first with the assistance of the white house office of presidential personnel the president selects candidate for the position the candi date then prepares and submits several forms the public financial disclosure report standard form sf 278 the questionnaire for national security po sitions sf 86 and the white house personal data statement ques tionnaire the office of th counsel to the president oversees the clearance process with b ackground investigations conducted by the federal bureau of investigation fbi in ternal revenue service irs office of government ethics oge and ethics official for the agency to which the candidate is to be appointed if conflicts are found during the background check oge and the agency ethics officer may work with the candidate to mitigate the conflicts once the counsel has cleared the candidate the nomin ation is ready to be submitted to the senate the selection and ve tting stage is often the longest part of the appointment process there can be lengthy delays pa rticularly if many candidates are being processed as they are at the beginning of an administration or if conflicts need to be resolved candidates for higher level positions are often accorded priority in this process for positions located within state us attorney us marshal and us district judge the president by cust om normally consults with the senator or senators if they are from the same party as the president from that state prior to nomination if neither senator is from the pr esidents party he usually consults with party leaders from the state

nominee who is hired as consultant while awaiting confirmation may serve only in an advisory capacity if circumst ances permit and conditions are met the president may give the nominee tempor ary appointment under the vacancies act or recess appointment to the position s ee below recess ppointments may have political consequences however particularly if senators perceive that an appointment is an effort to ci rcumvent their constitutional role confirmation in the confirmation or second stage the senate alone determines whether to appr ove or disapprove nominati on the way the senate acts on nomination depends largely on the im portance of the position involved existing political circumstances and policy impli cations generally the senate shows particular interest in the nominees views and how they are likely to affect public policy7 two other factors may also affect the scrutiny with which nominees personal and professional qualities are examined whether the presidents party controls the senate and the degree to which the president becomes involved in supporting the nomination although the senate confirms most nomin ations president can safely assume that his nominees will be approved routinely rarely however does rejection occur on the senate floor nearly all rejections occur in committee either by committee vote or by committee inaction rejec tions in committee occur for variety of reasons including opposition to the mination inadequate amount of time for consideration of the nomination or factor s that may have nothing to do with the merits of the nomination the most rece nt study of senate confirmation action which looked at the period between 1981 and 1992 found that th senate failed to confirm 9 of all nominations to full time positions in the executive departments during the same period 11 of nominatio ns to independent agencies and 22 of nominations to boards and commissions also failed8 appointment in the final stage the confirmed
