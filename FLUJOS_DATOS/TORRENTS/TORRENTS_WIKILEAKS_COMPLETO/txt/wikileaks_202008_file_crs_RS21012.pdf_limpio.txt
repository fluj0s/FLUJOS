authority for the attorn ey general to reque st military assistance is found in 18 usc 2332e unlike 10 usc 382 however the provision is not limited to emergencies involving chemical nd biological weapons but was amended in the patriot act pl 10756 104 to cove r all weapons of ma ss destruction which are defined in 18 usc 2332a to include any destructive device as defined in section 921 of title 18see below b any weapon that is designed or intende d to cause death or serious bodily injury through the release dissemination or impact of toxic or poisonous chemicals or their precursors c any weapon involving disease organism or d any weapon that is designed to releas radiation or radioactivity at level dangerous to human life destructive device is define d under 18 usc 921a4 as any

reimburseme nt as condition of assistance 18 usc 831e4 this last provision should probably be read to apply only to assistance under subsection reimbursement of assistance under subsection d is likely meant to be controlled by 10 usc 377httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21012crs4 finally it is arguable that congress authorization for the use of force against terrorists responsible for the september 11 attacks pl 10740 115 stat 224 2001 has mooted some of the limitations on the use of the military for law enforcement purposes by recasting them as military operations for example the arrest and rendition of terrorist suspects abroad for trial in th united states has been unnecessary as such persons have instead been transported to the military detention facilities at guantanamo bay cuba where they may eventually be tried by military commissions by treating suspected terrorists as enemy combatants rather than criminals the administration could assert that their treatment is matter for the military rather than law enforcement agencies even for persons found within th territory of the united states see padilla ex rel newman v bush 233 fsupp2d 564 588 sdny 2002 revd in part 352 f3d

authority after september 30 2007 inherent presidential authority to use troops to enforce the law the questions of the presidents authority to act in the absence of an explicit statutory exception remain unresolved the pca aside it appears that the president may not use the military to seize an industry critical to national s ecurity even in national emergency when congress has declined to
