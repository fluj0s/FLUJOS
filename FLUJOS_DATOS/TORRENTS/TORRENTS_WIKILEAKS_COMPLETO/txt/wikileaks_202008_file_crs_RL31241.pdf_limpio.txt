reading first as well as their predecessor the rea were created to broaden and expand existin g reading programs to address concerns about student reading achievement and to try and r each children at younger ages4 the most recent 2005 national assessmen t of education progress naep data indicate that many 4th grade students are not proficient readers5 these data indicate that only 31 of 4th graders were at or above th proficient level for 4th graders eligible for freereducedprice lunches onl 16 were at or above the proficient level reading research reading first and early reading first were drafted with the intent of incorporating the latest sc ientific understanding on what works in teaching reading6 in this regard two influential research reports on reading are frequently cited by practitioners and policy make rs working on reading issues in 1998 the national research council nrc published report titled preventing reading difficulties in young children the nrc report examined skill and environmental factors that facilitate acquisition of reading skills it did not explicitly investigate how those skills could be transferred to classroom settings the nrc report concluded that 1 early exposure in the home and in school to lang uage and books is critical 2 effective reading instruction requires well trained preschool and elementary school teachers and 3 elementary school teachers should include all of the following components in reading instruction alphabetics read ing sight words techniques in sounding out letters and words and achievi ng fluency and comprehension in 2000 the national reading panel nrp issued report titled teaching children to read the nrp was convened by the na tional institute of child healthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31241crs3 7

spoken language the word go for example consists continuedand human development nichd with the consultation of the us department of education ed in response to congressi onal charge to review the literature on reading and use it to assess the effectiven ess of different t echniques for teaching reading and whether these techniques were ready to be applied to classroom settings the nrp research was intended to build on the earlier research conducted by the nrc the nrp conducted literature review of studies that met rigorous scientific standards in reaching conclusions the following instructional topics were examined by the nrp phonemic awareness and phonics fluency comp rehension teacher education and reading instruction and co mputer technology and reading instruction the nrp limited its selection of topics becau the volume of reading research was too extensive for examination of all potential topics the selected topics were chosen based on the nrps assessment of issues central to reading instruction and achievement and based on input received from public forums the nrp has been criticized by some for its omission of other topics in minority view attached to the nrp report one panel member argued that the nrp early on in its decision making effectively excluded any inquiry into the field of language and literature and that the research examined by the nrp would be of limited usefulness to teachers administrator s and policymakers because they fail to address the key issues that have made elementary schools both battleground for advocates of opposing philosophies and pr ey for purveyors of quick fixes7 the nrp majority however stated that it does not view its research as exhausting all reading topics that need study rather it noted that it believes further research on reading instruction including research that examines qualitative data is needed the panel identified areas wher significantly greater research effort is needed and where the quality of the research efforts must improve in order to determine objectively the eff ectiveness of different type s of reading instruction8 in summarizing the implications of its work for the teaching of reading the nrp noted that not all the areas it investigated contained sufficient data to reach conclusions however it did find that the data supported the fo llowing conclusions systematic phonics instruction the teaching of planned sequence of phonics elements is effective fo r children in grades k6 and for children who are having difficulty learning to read systematic phonics instruction was found to be so successful that the nrp recommended it as appropr iate for routine classroom instruction phonemic awareness teaching child ren to associate phonemes with letters is crucial building block for phonics9httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31241crs4 9 continued of two phonemes 10 because of the time involved in initial implem entation of the program ed is making some
