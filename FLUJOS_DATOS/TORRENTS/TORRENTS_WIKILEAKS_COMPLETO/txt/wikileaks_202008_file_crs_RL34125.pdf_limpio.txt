experienced remarkable declines in mortality during the past 20 years in 1980 142 of newborns could expect to live to age 90 by 2003 this percentage increased nearly 50 to 209 average life expectancy went from 737 years in 1980 to 778 years in 2004 about 305 years longer than the anticipated life expectancy for baby born at the beginning of the 20th century between 1930 and 2003 the proportion of older americans who lived to age 65 increased by more than 50 the percentage to reach age 75 nearly tripled and the fraction to reach age 85 increased nearly sixfold greater longevity is one factor contributing to the quickly growing share of elderly americans in 1950 persons age 65 and older made up 81 of the population in 2000 they accounted for 124 of the population by 2030 one in five americans is projected to be senior citizen in 2004 total of 18 million deaths of people age 65 and older was reported in the united states onethird lost their life to heart condition onefifth to cancer nevertheless the number of deaths attributable to cardiovascular disease has fallen by nearly onethird since 1980 moreover the death rate for heart disease in 2004 was 416 lower than in 1980 similarly the death rate for stroke declined by 482 during the last quarter century these declines are attributable to number of factors including medical advances that facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of these conditions the introduction of new pharmaceuticals and important changes in lifestyle behaviors including less cigarette smoking and changes in diet this significant decrease however has been partially offset by an increase in cases of some chronic conditions among older americans in pa rticular since 1980 the share of elderly deaths resulting from kidney disease diabetes alzheimers disease atherosclerosis and chronic liver disease more than quadrupled from 50 to 201 and death rates for chronic lower respiratory diseases increased by 120 increases in mortality attributable to chronic illness have not been evenly distributed even among the elderly death rates vary by age moreover significant racial and ethnic disparities are evident reflecting different disease profiles for underlying populations unequal access to health care and other sociodemographic factors such as income and education diabetes has been particularly deadly among blacks and native americans heart disease has disproportionately affected white men and alzheimers has been especially detrimental to white women as the population of older americans grows and the cost of medical care increases the public policy interest in identifying the predominant causes of death among the elderly becomes more acute given the concentration of medical expenditures at the end of life and the fact that medicare covers more than 95 of all americans age 65 and older understanding trends in mortality may inform policy makers as they tackle the many challenges associated with financing and delivering care to the nations rapidly growing cohort of older americans

achieved record high of 778 years about 305 years longer than the anticipated life expectancy for baby born at the beginning of the 20th century2 trends in life expectancy by age may be visually

occurred before 1930 and is attributable to better nutrition and cleaner water between 1930 and 1960 survival improved substantially for middleaged individuals between 1960 and 2000 mortality improvements were significant at the older ages physicians and researchers credit medical innovations and new pharmaceuticals with some of the longevity increases experienced by older americans for example important treatments for cardiovascular conditions explain in large measure the 50 decrease in heart disease mortality seen since 1960 discussed in more detail below 4 greater longevity is one of the reasons why the share of americans age 65 and older has grown so quickly in 1950 persons age 65 and older made up 81 of the population in 2004 they accounted for 1245 this pattern is expected to continue and to be exacerbated as the baby boom generation begins to retire6 the us census bureau projects that the elderly population will swell exponentially after 2010 and that nearly oneinfive americans will be senior citizen by 20307 as result policy makers foresee significantly greater enrollment in medicare and medicaid over the next few decades these changes will exert major cost pressures on public health insurance programs as the ratio of nonelderly taxpayers to elderly individuals shrinks for instance unless the financing mechanism for medicare is changed or its benefit structure altered it is projected that the medicare trust fund will be depleted in 20198 this report is divided into four parts the first outlines the primary causes of death among older americans age

atherosclerosis which refers to the accumulation of plaque in coronary arteries over time these fatty deposits composed of cholesterol calcium and other substances build up on the walls of blood vessels thus impeding circulation and reducing the amount of oxygen that reaches the heart muscle cancer though often discussed as single condition actually consists of more than 100 different diseases characterized by uncontrolled division of cells and the ability of these cells to permeate adjacent tissues process called invasion and to travel through the bloodstream or lymphatic system and implant themselves in distant organs metastasis many malignant neoplasms are associated with exposure to environmental factors such as tobacco smoke radiation and alcohol cancer may affect people at any point but the risk of developing cancer tends to increase with age other leading causes of mortality among older americans include cerebrovascular disease stroke chronic lower respiratory diseases clrd 13 alzheimers disease and diabetes see table 1 although the number of elderly deaths attributable to these four conditions in 2004 355004 is notable it pales in comparison to the deaths

rising incidence of chronic illness in essence greater life expectancy has effectively provided elderly individuals with additional years to develop conditions such as arthritis dementia and congestive heart failure older americans who generation ago might have died from episodes of influenza or pneumonia are surviving acute illnesses living longer and dying as result of complications associated with chronic conditions like emphysema alzheimers disease diabetes and renal disease with these chronic conditions becoming more common among older americans causes of death have generally become less concentrated in 1980 for example 812 of all elderly deaths were attributable to five conditions heart disease cancer stroke influenzapneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd by 2004 however these same conditions accounted for 688 of mortality among americans age 65 and older while the proportion of elderly fatalities caused by heart disease stroke and cancer fell between 1980 and 2004 from about three in four to three in five this decrease was partially offset by concurrent increase in the number of deaths attributable to other chronic disease in the last quarter century for instance the share of elderly deaths linked to diabetes increased by 632 the fraction of deaths caused by clrd rose more than 85 and the percentage whose deaths were caused by renal diseases more than doubled 14 overall the total share of elderly deaths resulting from certain chronic conditionskidney disease clrd diabetes alzheimers disease atherosclerosis and liver diseasehas more than quadrupled since 1980 from 50 to 201 it should be noted that the sharp increase in deaths resulting from clrd and the concomitant drop in pneumoniainfluenza mortality from 199899 are in part statistical artefacts attributable to changes in the international classification of disease an important change from the 9th edition icd9 to the 10th edition icd10 is that the latter allows the individual charged with filling out the death certificate to give precedence to an underlying condition when reporting primary cause of death 14 increases in clrd deaths after 1999 may in part be attributable the international classification of disease change from copd icd9 to clrd icd10

dies of pneumonia wouldunder the icd9 rulesmost likely have had pneumoniainfluenza listed as his or her primary cause of death the icd10 however provides coroners physicians and funeral home directors the latitude to identify different underlying cause of death if person obviously expires as direct consequence of that condition therefore after the introduction of the icd10 the person who died of pneumonia in the example above may have aids listed as the primary cause of deatheven though the most immediate cause of death was respiratory ailment the impact of this icd10 rule change was to reduce the number of deaths assigned to some conditions such as pneumonia and to increase the number of deaths assigned to few chronic diseases including aids and clrd see footnote above for further discussion of the icd10 and clrd mortality g22g155g142g151g141g156g561 reports of death in population are quantified in various ways one of the most common being mortality rate or death rate which is the number of deaths allcause or specificcause per 100000 individuals in given sociodemographic group eg age race gender or in particular region almost all diseases or health outcomes occur at different rates in different age groups for instance communities with disproportionate number of older individuals have higher rates of cancer whereas regions populated by families and young children have higher rates of sports injuries this is true even if the individuals in the two communities have the same risk of developing cancer or being injured figure 2 illustrates ageadjusted mortality rates for leading causes of death between 1980 and 2004 ageadjusted mortality rates control for age by adjusting mortality rates to standard population thus allowing researchers and policy makers to

this report ageadjuste d mortality rates are based on po pulations umerated as of pril 1st for ce nsu s years and estimated as of july 1st for all other years even with change in the agespecific risk of dying of stroke one would observe higher crude death rate in 2004 simply because the population is older using ageadjusted rates accounts for changes in population structure over time and facilitates the comparison of mortality rates across years15 between 1980 and 2004 the overall ageadjusted mortality rate all causes for older americans decreased by 197 much of this decline is explained by drop in heart disease and stroke mortality rates among people age 65 and older during this period the decline in heart disease mortality rates is especially noteworthy because the prevalence of heart disease has not decreased in the past 25 years persons diagnosed with cardio and cerebrovascular disease are living longer thanks to improved surgical techniques the advent of angioplasty and the use of anticoagulants declining heart disease and stroke mortality rates may also be attributable to changes in lifestyle behaviors including less cigarette smoking and changes in diet to reduce the consumption of saturated fats 16 during the same period though clrd and diabet mortality rates increased 586 and 367 15 adjustment is accomplished by first multiplying the agespecific rates of death by agespecific weights the weights for each gr oup are proportional to the age distribution of the standard us population the weighted rates are then summed across the age groups to give an ageadjusted rate 16 david m cutler behavioral health interventions what works and why national bureau of economic research working paper june 2002 available at

over65 population remained virtually unchanged between 1980 and 200417 arguably the most significant mortality change during this period was the rising number of fatalities associated with alzheimers

rates for the seven leading causes of death in the over65 population between 1980 and 2004 it illustrates how dramatic recent changes in alzheimers mortality have been relative to other leading causes of deaths though most of the changes represented in figure 3 are substantial by virtually any standard they are dwarfed by the increase in the mortality rate for ad which skyrocketed over the last

forgetfulness or senility scientists now widely recognize two significant abnormalities in the brains of people with ad twisted nerve cell fibers known as neurofibrillary tangles and sticky protein called beta amyloid which forms deposits called plaques19 plaques 17 death rates for cancer rose between 1980 and 1990 but have been falling during the last 15 years driven largely by decreasing mortality in the four most common malignancies pr ostate breast lung and colon cancers the drop in lung cancer deaths is likely result of the significant numbers of americans who quit smoking 15 to 20

causing the brain to atrophy and shrink damage to the area of the brain responsible for memory the hippocampus appears to be particularly acute20 in addition persons with ad underproduce chemicals in the brain necessary for communication between nerve cells these chemicals called neurotransmitters include acetylcholine serotonin and norepinephrine21 three factors may explain the increased fre quency with which ad has been diagnosed and labeled cause of death in the over65 population22 first the development of diagnostic criteria for ad and greater understanding of ad among medical professionals coroners and funeral directors who determine the underlying cause of death listed on death certificates may have affected the alzheimers mortality rate23 second the adoption of the 10th revision of the international classification of diseases icd10 by the us national center for health statistics in 1999 may have promoted the identification of alzheimers as cause of death instead of more common designated conditions such as pneumonia or stroke24 finally because ad is especially prevalent in individuals age 85 and older it is also possible that the aging of the american population has accelerated the incidence of this condition and thus affected ad death rates g6g146g156g153g138g155g146g157g146g142g156g561 death rates among older americans vary by race ethnicity gender and even age itself this variability reflects different health risks and disease profiles for underlying populations disparities in access to healthcare services and other sociodemographic factors such as income or education this section examines some of these mortality rate disparities changes in mortality since 1980 have not affected older americans uniformly see table 2 although the top three killers of people age 65 and older have remained the same since 1980 significant differences are apparent when mortality rates are compared across age groups for example the largest decrease in heart disease mortality 555 was experienced by persons between the ages of 65 and 74 followed by persons age 7584 497 and 85 370 cancer mortality has increased slightly for individuals over age 75 38 but

among nonhispanic blacks and native americans both groups have experienced unmatched increases in obesity in recent years29 by contrast among males the highest death rates for diabetes are seen among hispanics and nonhispanic whites alzheimers disease disproportionately afflicts and kills older non hispanic whites among men nonhispanic whites are 38 more likely to die from ad than blacks who have the secondgreatest death rate from alzheimers among women nonhispanic whites are 62 more likely to die from ad than blacks final observation concerns the seventh lead ing cause of deathinfluenzapneumonia the highest death rates for these conditions among older americans are seen in the nonhispanic white population what may be most striking about influenzapneumonia mortality however is not the differences in death rates by race but rather the similarities and dissimilarities by gender among most nonwhite racialethnic groups men are more likely than women to die of the flu or pneumonia reasons for this are unclear but large body of research 30 shows that women receive more preventive care and visit healthcare providers more regularly than men supporting the hypothesis that females benefit from early diagnosis and may increase the likelihood that they are able to avoid or effectively treat these conditions before they become lifethreatening interestingly the most recent data suggest that death rates for influenzapneumonia are identical for men and women of caucasian descent this is very different of course from the pattern discussed above which is exhibited by all other groups explanations for this gender equivalence are not readily apparent why among nonhispanic whites alone are men and women equally likely to die from influenzapneumonia because nonhispanic whites have the highest death rates from these conditions it seems unlikely that influenza vaccination rates and access to care could serve as sufficient explanation for this morta lity pattern different possibility is that most white people who succumb to influenza or pneumonia do so very late in lifeat ages that surpass the typical life expectancies for males in minority populations g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g11g150g153g149g146g140g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 as achievements in modern medicine and changes in lifestyle behavior have fostered greater life expectancy for the nations elderly the number of older americans living with chronic disease has also grown often diseases that used to be fatal by middleage can now be effectively managed for years as result older adults are living longer with chronic conditions such as coronary heart disease nephritis and even some forms of cancer this trend may be concern because conditions such as diabetes clrd and alzheimers disease can be resourceintensive generating significant costs for treatments eg dialysis transplant surgery respiratory therapy and institutional longterm care the indirect and direct costs associated with treating chronic diseases in the elderly population are significant especially when longterm maintenance therapy is required families may 29 nicole cossrow and bonita falkner

unable to live independently caregivers often work parttime or deplete their savings and assets to care for elders the direct costs of longterm treatment of older americans in nursing homes and intermediate care facilities is borne at least in part by the taxpayers who subsidize the medicaid and medicare programs although more and more elderly americans live with multiple and complex chronic illnesses requiring high degree of medical management policy makers are just beginning to consider the implications that the rise in chronic disease has for medicare 31 medicare was designed to deal primarily with the effects of acute illness which was seen at the time of its implementation as the major threat to the health and financial security of the aged now however about 20 of medicare beneficiaries have five or more chronic conditions all told they account for more than twothirds of medicare spending32 as the share of the population age 65 and older increases in coming decades federal outlays for medicaid and medicare are expected to grow substantially from 21 of all government spending in 2006 to an estimated 31 in 201733 according to projections by the congressional budget office cbo this will represent 59 of gr oss domestic product gdp in 2017 compared with 43 of gdp in 200634 with 70 of all deaths and more than 75 of all healthcare costs in the united states now attributable to chronic disease the centers for disease control and prevention warns that the united states cannot effectively address escalating health care costs without addressing the problem of chronic diseases 35 some of the questions currently being discussed by legislators include the extent to which the government is willing to shift the costs of longt erm care provided today to future generations of americans how much financial responsibility ea ch family should bear for the longterm health care needs of its eldest members and what kinds of preventive care or health promotion servicesnot currently covered by medicare or medicaidwould help stem the tide of chronic illness in the 65andolder population whether and how to address these issues remains subject of contentious debate but healthcare experts anticipate that the growing prevalence of chronic disease in this country with its disproportionate effect on the health of minority populations and on the mortality of the aged will play prominent role in discussions of health reform 36 31 us congress senate special committee on aging the future of medicare recognizing the need for chronic care
