from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to tom wigley wigleycgducaredu subject re foia date fri jan 21 152006 2005 cc ben santer santer1llnlgov tom ill look at what youve said over the weekend re ccsp i dont know the other panel members ive not heard any more about it since agreeing week ago as for foia sarah isnt technically employed by uea and she will likely be paid by manchester metropolitan university i wouldnt worry about the code if foia does ever get used by anyone there is also ipr to consider as well data is covered by all the agreements we sign with people so i will be hiding behind them ill be passing any requests onto the person at uea who has been given post to deal with them cheers phil at 1435 21012005 tom wigley wrote phil thanks for the quick reply the leaflet appeared so general but it was prepared by uea so they may have simplified things from their wording computer code would be covered by the foia my concern was if sarah iswas still employed by uea i guess she could claim that she had only written one tenth of the code and release every tenth line sorry i wont see you but i will not come up to norwich until monday let fill you in bit confidentially you probably know the panel members we were concerned that the chair would be strong person it is jerry mahlman about the best possible choice richard smith is the statistician also excellent dave randall too very good as token skeptic there is dick lindzen but at least he is smart guy and he does listen he may raise his paper with gianitsis that purports to show low climate sensitivity from volcanoes i will attach our paper that proves otherwise in press in jgr preparing the report has been good and bad experience i think i had the worst task with the exec summ it tied up most of my time for the past 3 months the good has been the positive interactions between most of the people really excellent bunch i have been very impressed by carl mears and john lanzante at meetings john christy has been quite good and there were good and positive interactions between john and roy and the rss gang that helped clarify lot outside the meeting in the email world he has been more of pain he has made lot of useful suggestions for the exsumm but he keeps accusing the aogcmers of faking their models not quite as bluntly as this in the emails there are some very useful exchanges from jerry meehl ramaswamy and ben detailing the aogcm development process we will be writing bams article on this in the summer much of what happens in model development is unknown to the rest of the community the faking idea prompted to write tongue in cheek note also attached as far as i know john will not raise this particular issue in his dissentin views to accommodate dissenting views the report will have dissenters appendix with responses you will get this at some stage the deadline for dissenters to produce is jan 31 and we will not finish our rebuttals until mid feb the dissenters are john c and far worse roger pielke sr all of the rest of us disagree with these persons dissenting views roger has been extremely difficult but the details are too complex to put in an email on the other hand he has made number of useful contributions to the exsumm and other chapters suffice to say that he has some strange ideas often to do with the effects of landuse change that are interesting but still in my view speculative but testable we have yet to see the dissents and it would not be ethical for to say any more than i have already best wishes tom phil jones wrote tom i hope the vtt panel doesnt prove meeting too many at this time it is currently scheduled for feb 2325 and i only get back from an 8 day workshop in pune on feb 20 the ipcc chapter with kevin is now with wgi in boulder we did put you down as one of our potential reviewers dont know whether youll have time or whether wgi will select you regional balance etc next week ill be in reading and exeter so wonbe be in cru have to be at an rms awards meeting then something on reanalysis then i have to collect some data from the archives in exeter for small project we have it is easier for to get this than explain to someone how to do it so ill miss you not back till thursday night on the foi act there is little leaflet we have all been sent it doesnt really clarify what we might have to do re programs or data like all things in britain we will only find out when the first person or organization asks i wouldnt tell anybody about the foi act in britain i dont think uea really knows whats involved as youre longer an employee i would use this argument if anything comes along i think it is supposed to mainly apply to issues of personal information references for jobs etc sorry ill miss you next week if youre in on sunday perhaps you could come round to our new house in wicklewood phone number is still the same as 01953 605643 keith and sarah know where it is even if they did get lost the first time they came cheers phil at 0259 21012005 you wrote phil tom karl told you will be on the vtt review panel this is very good news unfortunately i will not be at the meeting on the 23rd i will be in midair half way across the pacific to spend couple of weeks in adelaide i got brochure on the foi act from uea does this mean that if someone asks for computer program we have to
