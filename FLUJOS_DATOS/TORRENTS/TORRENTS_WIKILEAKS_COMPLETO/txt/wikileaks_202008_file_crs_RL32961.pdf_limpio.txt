enacted into law and bills that have been passed by either the house or senate6 veterans health administration vha history vas largest and most visible operating unit is the veterans health administration vha established in 1946 as the department of medicine and surgery it was succeeded in 1989 by the veterans health services and research administration and renamed the veterans health ad ministration vha in 19917 the veterans medical system was first deve loped to provide needed care to veterans injured or sick as result of service during wartime when there was excess capacity in va hospitals congress gave wartime veterans without serviceconnectedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32961crs3 8 world war veterans act of 1924 pl 68242conditions access to va hospitals provided space was available and the veterans signed an oath indicating they were unable to pay for their care8 at the end of world war ii the federal government undertook th task of increasing the number of va medical facilities to meet the expected demand for health care for veterans returning with injuries or illnesses sustained during hostilities the primary focus of the expansion was to immediately tend to the medical needs of returning combatants for acute care and then to address the longterm rehabilitation needs of more seriously injured veterans within few years after the cessation of hostilities the initial demand for acute care services for serviceconnected conditions diminished and va initiated what was later to become its sp ecialized services mission in part because services such as spinal cord injury car blind rehabilitation and prosthetics were almost nonexistent in the private medical market during the late 1940s the va system has evolved and expande d since world war ii congress has enlarged the scope of the vas health care mission and has enacted legislation requiring the establishment of new progra ms and services through numerous laws some narrowly focused others more comp rehensive congress has also extended to additional categories of veterans eligibility for the many levels of care the va now provides longer health care system focused only on serviceconnected veterans the va has also become safet net for the many lowerincome veterans who have come to depend upon it transformation of vha over the past decade va has transformed its health care system through structural and organizational changes in the early 1990s va recognized that its system might want to respond to certain changes taking place in the private health care market and began process of restructuring and rationalizing services va established re gional networks and decentralized certain budgetary authority to these networks furt hermore advances in medical technology such as laser and other minimally inva sive surgical techniques allowed care previously provided in hospitals to be provided on an outpatient basis similarly development of psychotherapeutic drugs to treat mental illness have led to fewer and shorter hospital admissions for psychiatric patients as well as the deinstitutionalization of many longterm psychiatric patients with the passage of eligibility reform legislation in 1996 p l 104262 and in response to changing trends in medical practice va began to shift its focus from primarily inpatient hospital care to outpatient care in order to provide more accessible and efficient delivery of health care to veterans today va operates the nations largest integrated health care system vha is divided into 21 veterans integrat ed service networks visns see

veterans health care programs discussed later in this report it is important to get sense of how veterans eligibility for health care has evolved over time while full description of this evolution is beyond the scope of this repor t this report will provide brief overview generally veterans eligibility for va health care services has evolved from treating veterans with serviceconnected conditions or veterans with low incomes to veterans with nonserviceconnected conditions and higher incomes moreover vas health care coverage has changed from not having we lldefined medical benefits package to standardized benefits package eligibility criteria used to determine which veterans must be served by va and what type of medical care that they can be provided has undergone many changes since the establishment of va congress has made several ma jor changes throughout the years concerning the provision of hosp ital care outpatient care and nursing home care initially veterans could receive car only for treatment of serviceconnected conditions that were incurred or aggrav ated during wartime service in 1924 congress gave access to hospital care to world war i veterans with nonservice connected conditions on space available basis who signed an oath of poverty in 1943 hospital care was extended to worl d war ii veterans with nonservice connected conditions and outpatient care wa s limited to those with serviceconnected conditions however with the passage of pl 86639 in 1960 congress authorized va to provide outpatient treatment for nonserviceconnected conditions in preparation for or to comple treatment of hospital car in 1973 with the passage of the veterans health ca re expansion act pl 9382 congress further extended outpatient treatment for nons erviceconnected veterans to obviate the need of hospital admission16 by 1985 va was authorized to provide most categories of veterans with hospital nursing home and domiciliary care however va was not required or obligated to do so this is evidenced by the use of the phrase may provide in the statutes in 1986 with passage of pl 99272 congress established three categories of eligibility for va health care the law provided that hospital care shall be provided free of direct charge to veterans within category the term shall was interpreted by many as meaning entitled to hospital care these category veterans were defined to include those with serviceconnected disabilities lowincome veterans without such disa bilities and certain exempt veterans including for example form er prisoners of war those exposed to agent orangehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32961crs6 17 for comprehensive history of eligibility for va health care see us general accounting office va health care issues affec ting eligibility reform efforts

outpatie nt and nursing home care the term may was interpreted by many as meaning eligible for outpatient and nursing home care vetera ns not in category were assigned to either category b or category c on the basis of current in come and net worth va could furnish care to these veterans on resourcesavailable ba sis veterans not eligible for category b on the basis of either income or net worth were placed in category c17 veterans in categories b and c were eligible to receive care but were not entitled to care it should be noted that the terms ligibility and entitle ment had different meanings under the va health care system than under other public health care programs such as medicare for instance all beneficiaries who meet the basic eligibility requirements for medicare are entitled to all medically n ecessary care under the medicare benefits package u nder the va health care system the term eligible meant that va may provide care and the term entitled meant that va was required or must provide care18 however neither being eligible for nor being entitled to health care services guaranteed the availability of health services since funding for va health care was and s till is based on fixed annual appropriations once the funds were expended va could l onger provide care even to veterans who were entitled to care being entitled to care essentially gave veterans higher priority for care than being eligible for va health care eligibility reform although from time to time congress expanded access to va health care certain criteria that accompanied these expansions were an apparent source of frustration not only fo r veterans but also for va physicians and va administrative staff who applied and forced these provisions as mentioned earlier some veterans were entitled to outpatient care only if it was for pre and post hospitalization and to obviate the need for hospital care as illustrated in figure 1 for most categories of veterans eligibility for outpatient care was subject to the obviate the need for hospitalization criterion only two categories of veterans were not subject to this criterion they were veterans with serviceconnected disability rated 50 or more who were entitled to care and nonser viceconnected veterans with special status such as form er prisoners of war who were only eligible for care however the obviate the need statut ory authority was interpreted by va medical centers in several different ways some medical centers interpreted it as care for any medical condition whereas other medi cal centers interpreted this statutory authority as care for only certain medical conditions19 similarly since there was defined health benefits package prior to eligibility reform veterans were often uncertain about whether they were entitled to certain services or were merely eligible to receive some services likewise va health care providers complained that whenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32961crs7

veterans they could only treat the serviceconnected conditions and not the entire patient although the nonservi ceconnected condition could affect the veterans overall health these limitations were addressed by congress with the passage of the veterans health care eligibility re form act of 1996 pl 104262 this act required va to establish priority categories and operate patient enrollment system to manage access to va health care if sufficient resources were not available to serve all veterans seeking care it also substantially revi sed statutes governing care for veterans putting inpatient and outpatient care on the same statutory footing so that va can provide care the patient needs in the most medically appropriate setting20 the intent of these changes was to expand the serv ices vha could provide to veterans while eliminating statutory barriers to providing care in the most economical manner and to lower the expenses associated with providing care to veterans21 vha began enrolling veterans beginning october 1 199822 detailed list of priority enrollment groups is provided in appendix 2 23 24 table 1 provides details on eligibility for va health care prior to th enactment of pl 104262 as it relates to the current priority enrollment groups for example as illustrated in table 1 veterans with serviceconn ected conditions rated 50100 currently are correlated to

million veteran patients in fy1999 to 48 million veteran patients in fy2005 figure 2 this growth in demand for care and the budgetary constraints pl aced on the federal budget has once again opened the debate in congress as to what categories of veterans should have priority to receive care some in congress are concerned about the growing costs question the current eligibility for va medical care and suggest that it should be narrowed they believe that vas primary responsibility is to care for veterans with serviceconnected medi cal problems and that the system should not be providing

limited by the amount of its appropriation generally the mandatory funding pr oposals that have been suggested by veterans advocates are based on formul that takes into account the number of enrolled and nonenrolled vete rans eligible for va medi cal care and the rate of medical care inflation propone nts believe that mandatory funding will eliminate the yeartoyear uncertainty about funding leve ls and close the gap between funding and demand for veterans health care oppone nts believe that with these proposals spending for vha will increase significantly as enrollment in the va health care system soars in most of the proposed f unding formulas automatic funding increases are primarily based on enrollment figures furthermore critics believe that static funding formula cannot adequa tely take into consideration the changing needs of veterans which could affect the funding level necessary to pr ovide different mix of services and that congress is better able to evaluate the funding needs through the current appropriation process at recent hearing chairman buyer of the house veterans affairs committee stated that according to the congressional budget office cbo mandatory funding would cost nearly halfatr illion dollars over ten years that would be costly experime nt in contrast the strong discretionary budgets of the past decade have proven responsive to change61 as highlighted by some budget analysts changing veterans medical care into mandatory budget authority will not solve the issue of closing the gap between funding and demand for vete rans health care since congress could place caps on spending for mandatory programs thr ough budget reconciliation language which could limit spending on veterans health programs62 since congress can act to change the formula or cap the spending am ounts the issue of uncertainty in funding amounts may not be resolved either assured funding for veterans health care act 2005 hr 515 was introduced during the first

opening health care access to more veterans va expects to increase the percentage of enrolled vete rans from 28 of the vetera ns population today to 30 in 2012 and 33 in 2022 this percentage in crease

veteran enrollees reported in 2001 va asserts that the cares plan will reduce the cost of maintaining vacant space over the period 2006 to 2022 from an estimated 34 billion to 750 million and allow va to redirect those funds to patient care76 critics of the cares plan contend that closures ar being considered without assessing what kind of facilities will be needed for longterm care and mental health care in the future for instance at the time of the release of the dncp projections for outpatient and acute psychiatric inpatie nt care contained data inconsistencies on future needs va asserted that it would improve its forecasting models to ensure that projections adequately reflect future nee d also some believe that the cares plan does not focus enough on future nursing hom needs would leave va short of beds in few decades and thus va would not have any choice but to privatize some parts of the health care system moreover so veterans groups be lieve that cares is only about closing surplus hospitals nd do not believe that cares will result in the building of new and modern facilities finally the closure of some va medical facilities raised serious concern among some members of congress who felt that they had little control over the cares process77 in december 2003 the veterans health care capital asse t and business improvement act of 2003 pl108 170 was signed
