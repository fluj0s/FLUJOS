years and inflation concerns coupled with the introduction and growth of new account types in pa rticular retirement accounts fueled the debate in general th intent of federal deposit insurance is to provide degree of depositor security that benefits institutions and individuals deposit insurance is thought to help prevent the type of panic behavior that can cause bank runs which can in turn result in bank failures when an institution fails deposit insurance reduces the resulting financial impact on house holds and businesses in addition the economic instability that failed institution

weakening the incentives for managerial discipline with deposit insurance managers of financial institutions may become less concerned ove r depositors withdrawing their funds and therefore the managers may take on more ris k this behavior is often referred to as moral hazard this arguably increases the need for more effective supervision and examination practices by the regulators of insured institutions recent legislation the 109th congress passed two laws that author ized adjustments to deposit insurance coverage7 the federal deposit insurance refo rm act of 2005 pl 109171 and the federal deposit insurance reform confor ming amendments act of 2005 pl 109173 made the following changes for sh are accounts insured by the ncusif the standard insurance coverage limit per depositor per insured institution remains at 100000 until 2010 in 2010 and in each subsequent five year period thereafter the ncua and the fdic will jointly determine whether an inflation adjustment is warranted the insurance limit for eligible re tirement accounts is raised from 100000 to 250000 and this limit is also subject to the inflation adjustments and passthrough insurance coverage wa s established for employee benefit plans on october 3 2008 the president sign ed into law the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 pl 110343 this law commonly referred to as financial rescue package was enacted to address instability in the credit markets provisions of the law temporarily raise the basic limit of 100000 on federal deposit insurance coverage to 250000 retirement accounts retain their existing 250000 insurance coverage limit the intent of this action was to bolster public confidence in and provide additional liquidity to deposito ry financial institutions the change became effective immediately and unless cong ress determines otherwis the limit returns to 100000 after december 31 2009 the ncuas share insurance tool kit has been updated to reflect these recent changes additional action taken by the fdic has raised interest in whether parity needs to be provided for credit unions on octobe r 14 2008 the fdic announced new program the temporary liquidity guarantee program to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system8 components of the new pr ogram would affect deposit insurance by permitting participating fdic insured
