accomplishmen ts and productivity of its employees2 the economist lester c thur ow defined human capital as an individuals productive skills talents and knowledge it is measured in terms of the value price multiplied by quantity of goods and services produced since consumption is the ultimate goal of our economic system the value of mans capital is the same as the value of the consumption goods and services which he directly or indirectly produces when the value of goods and services rises the value of human capital rises when the value of goods and services falls the value of human capital falls3 to the general accounting office gao human capital is an organizations people its most critical asset in managing for results and assets to be valued4 in january 2001 gao added strategic human

employees union nteu commented during her testimony before the senate subcommittee hearing as this committee knows federal agencies have wealth of flexibilities available to them she said but unfortunately in december of 1999 opm reported that overall only 014 of all executive branch employees receive d recruitment retention or relocation incentives in fiscal year 1998 recruitment bonuses were given 03 of the time relocation bonuses were given to 10 of employees and 009 of employees received retention allowances less than 14 of 1 of the federal workforce received any form of recruitm ent retention or relocation incentive in fiscal year 1998 when agencies were asked why they did not use the incentives available to them more often than not they cited budgetary constraints agencies simply are not be ing given the resources necessary to fund the very programs and incentives that might actually help put them on the road to solving their human capital crises expanding the availability of these incentives makes little sense if agencies are not provided with the resources to accomplish the goal and with agencies sl ated to receive 1 reduction in their discretionary spending accounts for 2003 it is difficult to see how increasing and expanding recruitment and retention allo wances will in any way translate into more of these flexibilities actually being ffered to either prospective or current federal employees31 ms kelley in testifying before the april 8 2003 joint subcommittee hearing emphasized the critical importance of the committee ensuring that appropriate funding will be forthcoming before giving false hope to agencies that additional bonus options are available to them32 she reiterated this view at the house subcommittee hearing33 expressing his views before th senate subcommittee on march 18 2002 bobby l harnage sr national president of the american federation of government employees afge reiterated those of ms kelley and commented implicitly the assumption appears to be that bonus paymen ts to select individuals would be paid from existing salary accounts that is ag encies would only be able to use the broadened authority in the draft proposal to provide bonuses if they paid for them through the elimination of jobs or the denial of other salary adjustments for those not selected for bonus he stated the opinion that limiting the bonuses to general schedule employees ignores the equally acute human capital crisis affecting blue collar workers under the federal wage syst em finally mr harnage observed

sector companies who have increasingly come to realize that success in workforce management feeds success in every other area of organizational activity37 at the same hearing comptroller general david walker recommended that congress should consider capping the number or percentage of employees in an agency who would be eligible for recruitment bonuses and retention allowances38 carl demaio of the performance institute testified before the house subcommittee hearing that at the very leas t in exchange for bonuses system for measuring individual performance should be integrated into the provisions for granting those bonuses thereby requiring resultsbased goals and milestones he also recommended that written service ag reement be required for bonuses paid in biweekly installments39 at the same hearing john gage of afge stated that the proposed legislation does not provide funding for the bonuses and questioned whether such bonuses would improve recru itment and retention according to him bonus payments do not count as basic pay for purposes of retirement or other salary adjustments and they are poor substitu for competitive sa laries and regular salary increases40 mr gage also

senate subcommittee hearing while the legislation draws long overdue attention to the need to properly train em ployees again it does nothing to address the resource problems that have prevented agencies from adequately training their employees in the past59 at the house subcommittee hearing she advocated for congress to ensure that training is funded60 john priolo representing the federal managers association recommended to th senate subcommittee that separate line item on training be included in agency budgets to allow congress to better identify the allocation of training funds each year61 the managerial training program requirement would respond to agency comments most recently presented at senate committee on gove rnmental affairs subcommittee on oversight of government management restructuring and the district of columbia hearing in may 2000 that their employee training budgets were inadequate and that they c ould use additional training funds62 ronald sanders of

would amend 5 usc 6303 by adding new text that would allow an agency head to count prior service not with the federal government for purposes of annual leave accrual the senate version of the provision would authorize an agency head to deem period of qualified nonfederal career experience as period of service performed as an employee for the purpose of annual leave accrual64 credit would be allowed for service that was pe rformed in position with duties directly related to the duties of the position that th individual holds in the agency and that meets other such conditions as opm regu lations would prescribe the authority would become effective 120 days after th acts enactment and would apply only to an individual hired on or after the effective date under the house version of the provi sion opm would prescribe regulations governing the granting of credit for annua l leave accrual of newly hired employee not later than 180 days after enactment of the amendment credit would be granted for the employees prior service not othe rwise creditable for such purposes if the service were performed in position the duties of which directly related to the position the employee had been appointed to and met such other requirements as opm might prescribe further the agency head would have to decide that application of the provision was necessary to achieve an important agency mission or performance goal the service would be creditable as of the effective date of the employees appointment and w ould continue to be so creditable unless the employee failed to complete full year of continuous service with the agency an employee who held position in the civil service within 90 days before the appointments effective date would not be eligible to have his or her nong overnmental service credited for the purposes of annual leave accrual the proposed change would allow newly hired employees to accrue more than four hours of annual leave immediately upon beginning their employment with the federal government for example an indi vidual hired by the federal government who has 12 years of qualified non federal service as determined by the agency head might be credited with 12 years of federa l service and thus earn six hours of annual leave per pay period increasing the numbe r of hours of leave newly hired employees may accrue is viewed by some as an eff ective recruiting tool particularly for mid level employees in her testimony before the house subcommittee hearing colleen m kelley of nteu stated that if annual l eave limits are in fact barrier to

eligible to accrue eight hours of annual leave every two weeks this provision would take effect 120 days after the acts enactment date and would require opm to prescribe implementing regulations not later than 120 days after the acts enactment under the house version the amendments would not apply to an employee appointed to position before the effective date of the regulations implementing the provision targeting senior level employees for th is benefit is viewed by some as an effective tool for recruitment and retention to the extent that most senior executives continue to be drawn from
