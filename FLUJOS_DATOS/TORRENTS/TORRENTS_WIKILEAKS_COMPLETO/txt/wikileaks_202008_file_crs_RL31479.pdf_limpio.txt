budget process reforms introduced considered or adopted during the 107th congress categorized by topic area budget enforcement act procedures federal budget legislation is constrai ned by statutory limits on discretionary spending and payasyougo paygo requirement for direct spending and revenue legislation both of these budget constraints were established by the budget enforcement act bea of 1990 title x iii of pl 101508 which amended the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 title ii of pl 99 177 these statutory budget constr aints were extended in 1993 and 1997 but generally expire at the end of fy2002 ie september 30 20025 for at least the last 2 years there has been congressional interest in modifying and extending the bea procedures be yond fy2002 many members of congress as well as outside observers agree that the budget enforcement mechanisms associated with the bea promoted fi scal discipline throughout the 1990s and contributed to the federal government achieving unified budget surplus in fy1998the first in almost 30 years some have argued that such fiscal discipline mechanisms are necessary even in times of surpluses and that the bea should be extended for this purpose the return of budget deficits at least in the short term has further increased the interest in some fo rm of budget enforcement procedures beyond fy20026 in the last few years congress and the president have made ad hoc modifications to the bea to avoid seque ster for the upcoming fiscal year or to reduce the likelihood of sequest er in future fiscal years7 most recently the defense appropriations act for fy 2002 pl 107117 included provisions increasing certain discretionary spending limits for fy 2002 and changing the paygo scorecard balance to zero for

argued that the concurrent resolution on the budget would be more effective in guiding and enforcing budget policy by transforming it into joint resolution and thus requiring the presidents signature joint budget reso lution would formally and directly involve the president in congressi onal deliberations on the budg et early in the process president bush proposed joint budget resolution in his fy2002 and fy2003 budget submissions to congress however gislation has been introduced in the 107th congress proposing to transform the concurre nt resolution on the budget into joint resolution the reconciliation process under section 310 of the cba provides congress with the option of including instructions in budget resolution instructing house and senate committees to recommend changes in direct spending and revenue laws to comply with the budge t policies in the budget resolution the resultant reconc iliation legislation is considered under expedite d procedures which limit debate and

discussion of this issue see crs report rl30339 preventing federal government shutdowns proposals fo r an automatic continuing resolution by robert keith107th congress the byrd rule has come under increased criticism because many attribute the sunset provision in the tax cut reconciliation legislation enacted in 2001 hr 1836 pl 10716 to it33 without the sunset provision the tax cuts would have

congress provides discretionary budget authority as well as appropriated entitlements to agencies and programs through the annual ppropriations process the house and senate ppropriations committees each with 13 subcommittees have jurisdiction over appropriations measures the 13 subcommittees of the house and senate appropria tions committees are each responsible for one of the 13 regular appropriations acts the re gular appropriations acts provi budget authority for the next fiscal year beginning october 1 congress usually adopts one or more supplemental appropriations acts to provide additional funding for unexpected needs while the fiscal year is in progress if one or more regular ppropriations acts are not completed by october 1 cong ress typically adopts tinuing appropriations act commonly referred to as continuing reso lution to provide temporary funding for agencies and programs until they receive regular appropriation without regular appropriation or c ontinuing resolution an agency does not have the legal authority to incur obligations in order to function34 in such cases the agency must shut down to prevent g overnment shutdown and the threat of one due to the expiration of funding some members have proposed establishing an automatic continuing resolution an auto matic continuing re solution would provide an automatic source of funding for discre
