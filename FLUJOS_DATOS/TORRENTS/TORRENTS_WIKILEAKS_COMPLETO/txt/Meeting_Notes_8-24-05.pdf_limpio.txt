offered preordered peace palaces to raja deans domain 34 of them they are paid for by the movement big bundle of pa rts that need to be assembled on site by crew the movement is paying for then you finance t he building locally so movement can be reimbursed for all or part of building need to get county approval and prepare the land contact your raja if you want one if you have land that seems good you can still req uest approval from international via the internet 7 however maharishis focus is to get the builders to do it all find land finance build and lease back to us ring the builder and get b uild to suit situation some builders have said they can do multiple cities in domain one domainwide yet dont wait for that tony miles 7 th largest builder in nation expressed initial intere st in moving forward and could possibly take on whole domain raja bob will participate in conference call with them and tony and peter mullins if anyone has made any contacts with big builders pass the info on to your state coordinator and they will pass to tony commercial builder usually builds for 3 fee of tot construction so total fee would be 9 and we get 6 in royalty and license fee and bui lder gets 3 for their profit 8 short summary of what to tell builders from raja bo b looking for build to suit build to suit is whe re you tell builder the kind of building you want on their site or on site you find the finance and you lease it back the twist is that we want to be able to buy the bui lding back take it out of the leasing arrangement within the 3 year period at either cost or at some agreed upon addl markup not foreign concept only new thing is that we wa nt to buy it back quickly can we offer builders tax writeoff for depreciat ion during the 3 year period yes because they still own the building the price that we buy it back for has to be negotia ted but we should try to make it what we bought it for plus his 3 profit plus maybe som 23yearly for increase in value barry scherr look to the builders profit motive then figure out your strategy if you want to do buyback try to get it for as long time period as possible because interest rates vary expenses through mved
