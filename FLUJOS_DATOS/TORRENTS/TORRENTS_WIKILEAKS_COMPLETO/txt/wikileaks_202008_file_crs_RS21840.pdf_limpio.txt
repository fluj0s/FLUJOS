iran and continuedstates they also seek to limit the risk that these weapons materials and knowledge needed to produce them might leak out of the s oviet union to other nations or groups in recent years concerns have grown about the possible acquisition of nuclear chemical and biological weapons by rogu nations and terrorist groups nations such as india pakistan and north korea have actively pursued nuclear weapons others possess materials and knowledge that could support weapons program still more have chemical and biological mate rials that could be used in weapons of mass destruction wmd2 many analysts have argued that assistance similar to that provided to the former soviet states could help reduce the risk of terrorist s acquiring and using wmd in february 2004 the president praised th programs that have evolved from the nunnlugar amendment and stated that the united states should expand this cooperation elsewhere in the world3 he suggested that the united states retrain wmd scientists and technicians in countries like iraq nd libya and help nations end the use of weaponsgrade uranium in research reactors congress has also endorsed this idea the fy2004 defense authorization act pl 108 136 sec 1308 allows the administration to use up to 50 million in unobligated funds from dods cooperative threat reduction program ctr in nations outside the form er soviet union similar provision sec 3124 permits the president to use up to 50 million in unobligated funds from does international nuclear materials protection nd cooperation program which seeks to secure and eliminate nuclear materials in the former soviet states for projects in other nations these funds can be used for projects that w ill assist the united states in the resolution of critical emerging proliferation threat or permit the united states to take advantage of opportunities to achieve longs tanding nonprolifera tion goals the report of the 911 commission called for continued support for th reat reduction assistance to keep wmd away from terrorist groups in the 911 recommendations implementation act hr 10 the house calls for commission to review u s policy on the proliferation of wmd and the control of strategic weapons the proposals for the expansion of threat reduction and nonprolif eration assistance do not all contain the same ideas for how why and where the united states should expand this assistance many analysts w ho advocate this approach have published few details about which nations s hould receive assistance and wh at types of programs the united states should fund in these na tions others have offered more specific suggestions although they do not always agree with each other4httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21840crs3 4 continued north korea

and strategic assets materials and facilities see colum lynch weapon transfers targeted washington post apr 8 2004 p a21this report highlights the differences between proposals for expanding us assistance by dividing them into four ke areas objectives for expanded assistance nations to receive assistance programs to provide assistance and funding levels and priorities the report does not suggest that the ideas in these propos als are contradictory or mutually exclusive instead this characterization seeks to identify the range of views evident in the proposals to help members and staff in congress understand the proposals and identify those ideas that they may support or oppose in the future5 differing objectives proposals calling for the expansion of u s threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance generally identify two objectiv containing or reversing weapons proliferation in nations and containing wmd materials and knowledge to keep them away from terrorists some proposals do not distinguish between the objectives and many do not choose one over the other further choosing to pursue one objective does not necessarily preclude pursuit of the other nevertheless the two objectives can lead to differing suggestions for which countries might receive what types of assistance containing proliferation some analysts suggest that the united states offer assistance to nations that agree to contain reduce or eliminate their programs for or arsenals of weapons of mass struction in essence freezin g or reversing proliferation that has already occurred these proposals ofte n focus on nations such as india pakistan north korea iran iraq and libya the propos als also point to programs with the former soviet union as an example of how the united states can help destroy delivery vehicles provide secure transportation and storage of weapons and help eliminate materials removed from nuclear and chemical weapons proponents argue that this assistance might serve as either an incentive for nation to secure or eliminate its weapons and materials or as reward to nation that has alread decided to give up its weapons programs there are doubts however about whether th programs could effectively contain or rollback wmd proliferation however b ecause the recipient nation would have to conclude that it would benef it from reducing or eliminating its weapons programs the united states probably could not provide nough assistance to reverse nations political or security interests in acquiri ng weapons of mass destruction6 consequently efforts to expand threat reduction and nonpr oliferation assistance to support counterproliferation are more likely to succeed if they are incl uded in broader pack age of military economic and political incentives that address the broader concerns of the recipient nationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21840crs4 7 former senator sam nunn has noted that large amounts of civilian highly enriched uranium exist in the

also suggested that th united states expand its assistance beyond the problem cases to widen the international unders tanding of the benefits from threat reduction cooperation see rose gottemoeller cooperative inducements crafting new tools for nonproliferation in janne nolan bernard i fi nel and brian d finlay eds ultimate security combating weapons of mass destruction the century foundation press new york 2003 p 151keeping wmd away from terrorists recent concerns focus on the possibility that terrorists might acquire nuc lear chemical or biological weapons or materials the report of the 911 commission not ed this concern russia has vast stocks of materials that many fear could be lost or stolen then sold to terrorist groups many programs funded by us assistance seek to improve security accounting and control at military and research facilities and to tighten export and border controls so that it would be more difficult for individuals or groups to acquire these materials many other nations also house nuclear materials nd chemical and biological agents at military or research facilities hence many proposals for expande d assistance suggest that the united states might take steps to lock down these stocks of deadly materials by providing these nations with assistance in securing their vulnerable facilities and borders7 nations receiving assistance many analysts believe the united stat should expand threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance to those nations that have already acquired wmd and those that are suspected of seeking such weapons india pakistan iran and north korea are often mentioned as potential recipients for assistance as an incentive for them to reduce or eliminate their weapons programs in spite of the low probability that these nations are likely to respond to such an incentive libya and iraq are cited as cases where assistance might serve as reward for the limination of those weapons programs these nations also appear on the lists of those who believe the united states should use these programs to keep significant nd possibly insecure stocks of wmd materials and knowledge away from terrorists these and other nations might serve as marketplace for individuals or groups seeking to buy or steal the ingredients for wmd but the list of nations with these types of materials goes far beyond those known to have wmd programs any nation with nuclear re search reactor che mical industry or pharmaceutical industry has material s that might be of interest to terrorist groups seeking wmd historically the international community has not viewed these programs and industries as part of the prolif eration problem but they ve attracted growing attention in recent years consequently some of th proposals for expanding threat reduction and nonproliferation assistance nvision cooperative programs that extend to dozens of nations around the world8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21840crs5 9 michael roston redirection of wmd scientis ts in iraq and liby status report russianamerican nuclear s ecurity council ransac apr 29 2004 10 undersecretary of state john bolton noted that the state partments export control and related border security assistance program which had initially focused on the former soviet union and nearby transit states had expanded to over 40 countries from the mediterranean to the middle east to southeast asia us cong ress house committee on international relations hearing mar 30 2004assistance programs the united states has helped russia and the other former soviet states secure and eliminate retired weapons systems from the ol d soviet arsenal some proposals suggest that the united states extend these types of programs to other nations with wmd however programs that seek to secure nd eliminate weapons presum that the recipient nation is willing to eliminate its weapons and to accept us assistance with this effort india pakistan and north korea might be ca ndidates for this type of program but none of these nations has thus far indicated an interest in eliminating its weapons the united states might also offer nations assistance in securing materials removed from weapons or other weaponsuseable materi als as it does in russia and the other former soviet states the united states could offer fences gates and alarms for storage facilities training for personne l and accounting systems to help track the location and quantities of materials this type of assistance could he lp those nations with weapons programs without requiring access to active weapons or nations with civilian research and commercial materials that might be vulnerable to theft these nations would still have to admit they have thes materials and that they ca nnot secure them on their own the united states could also support programs that redirect or retrain scientists and engineers so that they would not be tempted to sell their knowledge to others the united states has offered this type of assistance in iraq and libya9 some question however whether these programs are need ed to stem proliferation scientists who had worked in the soviet weapons infrastructure are highly sk illed and they suffered significant financial losses when the russian economy collapsed u s assistance provided them with basic level of resources that their own government could not provide in other nations this type of assistance is not likely to lure scientists away from ongoing weapons programs if they remain fully employed furthe r some have questioned whethe r scientists in these nations have enough skills or knowledge to pos significant proliferation risk the united states has also begun to pr ovide export control and border security assistance to many nations as part of th effort to stop individuals or groups from removing weaponuseable mate rials from those countries 10 supporters argue that new monitoring equipment and better training for border guards can help detect smuggling and discourage terrorists from seeking these materials critics agree that these programs can be useful but they argue that they will be of marginal effectiveness in nations with long borders and large numbers of border crossingshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21840crs6 11 the other members of the g8 have also pled ged to spend total of 10 billion over 10 years for total of 20 billion on programs in russia and the other former soviet states see statement by the group of 8 leaders the g8 globa l partnership against the spread of wea pons and materials of mass destruction kananaskis canada june 27 2002 12 the proposals vary but many suggest the unite d states spend 2 billion to 3 billion per year see testimony of joseph circincione in u s congress house international relations committee mar 30 2004funding levels and priorities under the g8 global partnership against weapons of mass destruction the united states has pledged to spend 10 billi on over 10 years on threat reduction and nonproliferation programs in the former soviet union11 the united states already allocates around 1 billion per year to these prog rams so this pledge represents constant funding into the future the bush administr ation considers us funding for assistance to other nations part of its commitment under the g8 gl obal partnership it has not suggested that the united states increase its expenditures instead it has called for other nations to join the global partnership to increas total funding for all recipients with its own funding held constant us assistance to russia and the other former soviet states could decline as the united states expands its programs to other countries this shift could occur as the united states completes projects in russia alternatively the administrations approach could reflect shift in priorities away from efforts to secure and eliminate weapons and materi als in russia and towards effo rts to secure materials and knowledge in other nations this appears to be the case in at leas t one instance where the united states has reduced funding for materials protection c ontrol and accounting in russia in spite of the fact that the progra m has completed security upgrades at facilities that house only 38 of russias nuclear ma terials and increased funding for the megaports program which seeks to provide nuclear detection equipment to port facilities around the world many analysts outside the us governme nt have suggested that the united states increase sharply its funding for threat re duction and nonprolifera tion assistance as it expands these programs to other nations12 supporters argue that this increase in funding would allow the united states to accelerate its programs in the former soviet union and initiate new programs in othe r countries others however have questioned the need for more funding noting that bureaucratic probl ems not lack of funding have slowed efforts in russia and that the types of programs that are likely to be acceptable to other nations such as those that improve security at existing facilities and controls at borders do not require large sums of m oney to achieve visible results to date congress has not s upported calls for added funding as noted above when it approved legislation permitting the expansion of these programs to other nations it stated that the administration could use unobligated funds from existing budgets however if the united states continues to expand threat reducti on and nonproliferation programs outside the former soviet uni on without expanding funding congress may eventually have to address tradeoffs and set priorities among the programs
