marginal tax rates on capital income jane g gravelle senior specialist in economic policy government and finance division summary effective marginal tax rates on inves tment are forwardl ooking estimates that project over the lifetime of an investment what share of the return will effectively be paid in taxes these rates can differ significantly from average tax rates measured by dividing tax liability by income because they are affected by timing effective tax rates fell from the early 1950s through the mid1960s rose until the early 1980s and then dropped they have stayed about the same until relatively recently when they fell to an alltime low with bonus depreciation re lief of double tax on dividends and lower marginal tax rates the end of bonus depr ecation and higher inflation rates increased the tax rates in the past two years this report will be updated as warranted the tax rates which determine investment activity are marginal tax rates on new investment they are calculated by proj ecting the path of new investment and discounting the flow of income and taxes th ey take into account the effects of statutory tax rates depreciation rules investment subsidies and inflation the method is to compare the internal rate that discounts the fl ow to the current value of investment with taxes the aftertax return nd the rate without taxes the pretax return the difference between these rates divided by the pretax return is the effective tax rate table 1 shows the estimated tax rates fro m 1953 to 2005 column 2 presents estimates of the corporate firmlevel tax if depreciation were allo wed at economic rates and there were subsidies this rate w ould equal the corporat statutory tax rate column 3 reports estimates of the total rate on corporate investment accounting for the deductibility of interest at the firm level and the taxation of interest dividends and capital gains at the individual level as well as preciation and subsidies column 4 presents the estimated rates for unincorporated business proprietorships and partnerships these business tax rates reflect investments in equi pment structures and inventory column 5 presents estimated tax rates for ownerocc upied housing which is normally close to zero because of the exclusion of implicit net rent from income column 6 provides weighted economywide tax

rl32099 capital income tax revisions and effective tax rates by jane g gravelle 2 see discussion in crs report rl32099as shown in table 1 tax rates for business inves tment fell from the early 1950s to the mid1960s reflecting more accelerated preciation investment credits and lower statutory tax rates rates rose towards the end of the 1960s with the repeal of the investment credit which was re stored in 1971 and led to lowe r rates rates then began to rise in the mid1970s as inflation resulte d in smaller value of depreciation deductions by firms inflation also caused the penalty for not deducting mortgage interest for non itemizers to become more seve re increases in depreciati on and lower rates adopted in 1981 which were followed by more restrictive depreciation but lower corporate and individual rates in 1986 and sl owing inflation led to lower tax rates in the 1980s and 1990s the most recent reductions in tax rate s arose from the lower tax rates adopted in the 20012003 legislation the adoption of bonus depreciation in 2002 which was expanded in 2003 and the lower rates on di vidends and capital gains adopted in 2003 these changes resulted in historically low tax rate1 the tax rate rose in 2004 due to higher inflation rates and rose again in 2005 due to the end of bonus depreciation lower rates on capital gains are tec hnically temporary expirin g in 2010 but may be made permanent the tax rates in table 1 do not account for the tax bene fits to investments through pensions and individual retirement accounts w here tax rates are ge nerally effectively zero about half of passive income inter est dividends and capital gains on stock is received in tax exempt form these provisions affect marginal tax rates only if they affect the return to the marginal saving decision many investments in these forms are made up to the maximum contribution limit many pens ion plans are not under individual control and even where investments are not at the limit all marginal investments may still not flow through the taxfavored account all of these factors suggest not including these tax benefits in marginal calculations however there is probably some marginal effect and if the individual income tax rate on these passive forms of income is set to one half of its value to reflect the share of nontaxed inves tment returns tax rates would be reduced substantially by about eigh t percentage points without th lower rates particularly on dividends and capital gains enacted recently about six percentage points otherwise2 methodology for calculating effective tax rates the basic formula for calculating the effective tax rate is where r is the rrr pretax return or internal discount rate for an inve stment with taxes and r is the after tax discount rate that discounts all flows to the cost of th investment with taxes for business depreciable investment the relationship between r and r with r the firms discount rate derived from an inve stment with geometric depreciation and continuous time is the standard formula 1 r r uz k auz u δδ11 1 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21706crs5 3 note that this table inadvertently repor ts the values for 1959 in the row for 1960 and omits the 1960 values of 28 52 20 and 52 for the individua l tax rate corporate tax rate inflation rate and interest rate where u is the firms statutory tax rate either the individual or corporate rate is the δ economic depreciation ra z is the present discounted value of depreciation deductions k is the investment tax credit and is determinant of the basis adjustment set at one 05 and zero if there is full basis adjus tment ie depreciation allowed only on cost net of the credit half basis adjustment or basis adjustment respectively the formula in 1 is applied to obtain firmlevel tax rate s the firmlevel corporate rate in column 2 and the nonco rporate rate in column 4 with r weighted average of the aftertax real interest rate where i is the interest rate and is the iu1 π π inflation rate and the require d real return on equity befo re individual tax debt is weighted onethird in the case of total corporate tax rates in column 3 the pretax return r is derived from equation 1 but is compar ed with the return after personal taxes to individuals the same discount rate used for noncorporate business weighted average of the aftertax real return on debt where t is the individual tax rate and it1 π the aftertax return on corporate equity w hich is net of taxes on capital gains and dividends in the case of the firm level corporate tax rate in the second column of table 1 r is the discount rate of the corporat firm before personal level taxes the tax rate for owneroccupied housing omits the effect of depreciation and taxes on profit the pre tax return is simply where f is the debt share rf n tn t p 1 n is the share of investments with individuals who itemize on their tax returns p is the property tax rate and r is the aftertax discount rate if ll mortgage interest deductions were allowed but property ta x deductions the tax rate would be zero because there is tax on the imputed net rent slight positiv or negative tax may arise because of the inability to deduct mortgage interest by nonitemizers and the ability to deduct property taxes by itemizers the mathematical formulas and assumptions used to calculate tax rates including depreciation methods and lives i nvestment credits inflation ra tes and statutory tax rates as well as the tax rates themselves for 19531989 can be found in jane g gravelle the economic effects of taxing capital income cambridge mit press 1994 appendix b pp 287301 the statutory tax rate s interest and inflation rates for 19531989 are in table 21 p 203 tax rates for 19902005 incorporate number of assumptions and tax law changes these include the increase in the tax life fo r structures from 315 to 39 years in 1993 the lowering of the capital gains tax rate to 20 in 1997 the introduction of bonus depreciation expensing of share of i nvestment at 30 for 2002 and 50 for 2003 and 2004 and the reduction in the tax rate for cap ital gains and dividends from 20 and the regular tax rate respectively to 15 indivi dual and corporate statutory tax rates and inflation and interest rates are reported in table 2 for 19902005 the pattern of change in individual tax rates is based on the
