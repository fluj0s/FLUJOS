whose ideals are worthy of emulation though only worthy so long as they remain just beyond his grasppreface the initiation ceremony occupies but one hour superb cre ative hour few active men realize the responsibility for the future wellbeing of our fraternity which rests upon the undergraduate members new men are chosen by the undergraduates new men are taught the lessons of our fraternity by the undergraduates and new men perceive the ceremony of initiation from their classmates the undergraduates within that hour there is to be inculcated in the minds of the ini tiates rule of life that has its foundation in the philosophies of timephilosophies that have lived through the ages because they tell the fundamentals of true brotherhood out of which the founders of our fraternity chose the ideals to which we aspire every initiation is golden opportunity that needs preparation of the heart and mind in order that the truths we have to present will be fixed in the hearts of the initiates and there to be held for the rest of their lives to accomplish this requires the faithful sincere and earnest effort on the part of every man in the chapter the ritual of our fraternity is not onceinayear experience the ultimate effect and beauty only become reality in the expres sion of true brotherhood when it is used to the fullest extent at every chapter meeting let not the heart of our

which take only few seconds of the chapters time they are important because each man should have an opportunity to take part in the ritualistic cere monies if he is not present for either the opening or closing of the meet ing members who are habitually delinquent regarding punctuality for meetings will have tendency to be more punctual when confronted with these ceremonies once the chapter meeting is in session member should be called out of the meeting except in the case of emergency the only exception to the use of the ritualistic form in entering or leaving chapter meeting is the case of such chapter officers as the magister or quaestor who may leave the meeting temporarily to make report to the pledge meeting if such meeting is taking place at the same time as the chapter

chapter meeting the chapter meeting is the center of chapter activity it is the official weekly gathering for the purpose of transacting the chapters business to promote spirit of brotherhood and fraternalism and to serve as regu lar reminder of our dedication to the ideals of the white cross basic purposes 1 to promote spirit of brotherhood and fraternalism only in the ceremonies of initiation does the close communion of kindred hearts reach greater intensity than in the chapter meeting although this spirit should exist throughout the chapter meeting it is best expressed and exercised in the literary exercises the charge for the good of sigma chi and the chapter and the friendship circle 2 to serve as regular reminder of our obligations purposes and ideals nothing is of greater importance to the wellbeing of the chapter than the ritualistic part of the regular chapter meeting to omit it is not only to violate the ritualistic law but also to deny the brothers the priv ilege of rededicating themselves together to the teachings of the white cross the ritual for the regular chapter meeting is designed to remind us of every phase of the initiationa prayer seeking divine guidance the challenge the three great aims the seven v irtues and the founders to whom they are dedicated constantine the obligation and the charge without these brief ritualistic ceremonies the chapter meeting would cease to be real sigma chi meeting in other way can we get reminder of our ideals and purposes than from the ritual itself if these ceremonies are conducted correctly and in the proper spirit they will be an inspiration to each member this weekly renewal by word and sym bol of the ideals which bind us together as fraternity and the atmosphere created by it carries over into the business part of the meeting making it smoother more efficient and more pleasant for all 3 to transact the business of the chapter sound chapter organization wellplanned agenda adherence to basic principles of parliamentary procedure and judicious leadership in the chair are essential to suc cessful business meeting while the ritualistic parts of the chapter meet ing should promote feeling of brotherhood and mutual responsibility 19 pro consuls stationconsuls stationannotators station kustos stationsenior initiatemost recent initiate membersritualistic statutes the business session should if properly conducted provide the member ship with feeling of accomplishment and satisfaction the absence of this feeling is good indication that something is wrong with the way the business session is organized presented or conducted physicalarrangements the general physical arrangements of the chapter room for meeting pur poses should be similar to that of the investiture except that the initiation paraphernalia is not used the only exception to this is the seven branched candlestick which is lighted at the opening of the meeting and also during the literary exercises seating should be circular according to seniority and not in rows the surroundings of the room should be pleasant so as to create and atmosphere conducive to congenial chapter meeting if project is undertaken to decorate the chapter room it is best that the color scheme be in soft pastel shades rather than harsh bright or dark colorsproper arrangementfor the chapter meeting20 ritualistic statutes lighting enough light should be available to make the chapter room cheerful for the business part of the meeting the house lights should be controlled rheostatically in order that they may be dimmed for the ritualistic part of the meeting ventilation every effort should be made to provide proper ventilation in the chapter room for the meeting if windows are absent or inadequate some kind of ventilating or air conditioning system is recommended one likes to sit through any meeting in crowded room which is stuffy and hot in this regard smoking during meetings has created substantial problem in many chapters experience indicates that the chapter meeting is more effective where smoking is not permitted at any time if smoking is per mitted it should be allowed only during the business session of the chap ter meeting neverduring any of the ritualistic ceremonies which include the opening closing for the good of sigma chi and the chapter and the literary exercises smoking should be permitted during the business part of the meeting only when the physical condition of the room will permit it without causing discomfort to any members of the chapter under circumstances shall alcoholic beverages be consumed dur ing ritualistic chapter meeting ritualistic procedure in chapter meeting the following comments are an elaboration on the instructions for the ritualistic portions of the chapter meeting they are presented to assist the chapter in avoiding common errors or omissions in procedure opening 1 challenging the kustos the first move toward the official opening of the chapter meeting is the challenging of the kustos by the consul to do this he raps which calls the meeting to order and is signal for the kustos to approach the consul to be challenged 2 the challenge in large chapters the challenge may be expedited by having the pro consul and the annotator challenge the first man on each side who in turn challenges the next man and so on the pro consul anddivision ii the chapter meeting ritualistic opening the time for meeting having arrived the consul raps and chal lenges the kustos consul kustos take your station kustos takes his station at the door and the brothers take their respective places consul raps are none but true sigma chi s present kustos none worthy consul consul in order that we may be doubly sure the pro consul and the annotator shall pass the challenge the challenge the consul shall challenge first the pro consul and the annotator these officers shall in turn challenge the brothers next to them these brothers in turn shall pass it on until the entire circle has been challenged when the pro consul notices that all have been challenged he shall turn to the consul and give the sign of salutation saying pro consul w orthy consul all have been challenged consul brothers in what name come we hither brothers in the name of friendship justice and learning the pro consul shall stand at the altar before which the sevenbranched candlestick shall have been placed before the opening the pro consul shall light the seven tapers in order from right to left as viewed from the chapter circle as each taper is burning brightly the consul shall pronounce in impressive voice the virtue it typifies only the phrase the light of courage etc is given the name of the founder represented and the chapter response following the name of the founder are not given at the opening of chapter meetings these features being reserved for the initiation ceremony 21r i tua l22 ritualistic statutes annotator then proceed to the center of the circle of brothers where two are challenged who in turn pass the challenge back toward the point of beginning 3 the lighting of the seven candles this is perhaps the most impres sive part of the opening ceremony the consul should wait until each candle is burning brightly before pronouncing the virtue for which it stands the pro consul must be provided with taper holder and tapers with which to light the sevenbranched candlestick the use of matches detracts from the dignity of the ceremony and is therefore forbidden another candle may be used to light the seven candles but the difficulty with this is that the candle drips wax profusely all over the candelabrum in the process of lighting the seven lights the sevenbranched candle stick should be kept brightly polished at all times the candles should not be allowed to burn too low but should be replaced periodically 4 the pro consuls prayer this prayer must always be spoken from memorylighting of the seven lights consul the light of courage the light of w isdom the light of integrity the light of high ambition the light of selfcontrol the light of courtesy the light of fidelity brothers what is true sigma chi enlightenment brothers that which we receive before the seven lights consul for what purpose do we receive this enlightenment brothers t ennoble our lives by the practice of the seven virtues consul let us pray that we may be endowed with friendship justice and learning the prayer pro consul god who has taught us that true friendship is true service enable us we pray thee so to befriend our brothers that we may assist them to attain those virtues which are pleasing to thee brothers amen pro consul lord our judge who has commanded us to speak righteousness and to judge uprightly grant that iniquity may not be found in our mouths nor wickedness in our minds but that from pure hearts we may speak and do those things that are just in thy sight brothers amen pro consul god our father grant that we find in thee the light of knowledge and the fullness of all virtue and grant that while we seek for the gifts of learning we may never depart from thee the fountain of all wisdom brothers amen as the consul raps for the chapter to be seated the pro consul extin guishes the seven lights 23r i tua l24 ritualistic statutes literary exercises the literary exercises shall be regularly observed as part of the chapter meeting and may include any special literary feature for which arrangements may be made by either the historian consul or the chapter this is also the time for the reading and discussion of portions of the ritual and the ritualistic statutes from time to time brief talks can be given by members or alumni on subjects of fraternal interest when other program has been arranged the consul shall use the period of literary exercises for the examination of the chapter and its officers upon the ritual and for the delivery of the memory work required by the ritual memorization requirements as soon as convenient after each initiation the new members shall be required to memorize two parts of the ritual the charge and one of the founders parts or the three great aims this memorization shall be delivered with proficiency and any brother may be required to repeat until such time as proficiency has been attained for the good of sigma chi and the chapter this ceremony provides each member of the chapter with an opportunity to express himself on any subject which he feels is for the good of the fraternity and chapter the procedure is to begin with the lowest man in seniority and proceed around the circle to the highest this is not the time for debate and rebuttal but period for some honest searching by every member into ways by which each brother may improve himself or ways by which the chapter as whole may be bettered there should be accusations or recriminations comments should be commendatory or constructive never derogatory the consul who is the last to speak should take care to close this part of the meeting in such way as to clear up any possibility of resentment or misunderstanding should such occasion be presented during the remarks routine announcements or requests should be relegated to the business part of the meeting the seven candles should be lighted during the literary exercises and also during the remarks for the good of sigma chi and the chapte r the seven lights shall remain burning throughout the closing ceremonythe order of business opening roll call of the chapter excuses of absentees reading of minutes election of officers installation of officers reading of correspondence duties and reports of officers reports of committees unfinished business new business proposals of and voting on new members literary exercises seven candles lighted for the good of sigma chi and the chapte r the charge closing if the officer has report he should address the consul as follows officer worthy consul duties performed these sections are inserted only when applicable the officers should be called upon in the order in which they are named in the installation of officers which begins on page 13 25r i tua l26 ritualistic statutes the charge the charge always follows this portion of the meeting the consul deliv ers it at the first meeting following his installation and thereafter assigns it to the officers of his administration then to the entire membership in reverse order of seniority if anyone is not prepared to recite the charge properly the consul should deliver it himself the recital of the charge should never be omitted from regular chapter meeting closing the friendship circle is one of the most important single acts of the entire meeting for the promotion of chapter unity this is the time and sometimes the only time during the week that every brother has an opportunity to give the fraternal grip to every other brother in the chapterthe words of greeting between the brothers should be warm but brief this is not time for extended or animated conversation the consul passes around the circle commencing with the annotator giving each brother the fraternal grip and saying i seek true friendship and receiving the response you find it here after the consul has pro ceeded around the entire circle he shall resume his place the consul shall be followed closely by the annotator whom the brothers shall fol low consecutively in the order of their seating each greeting in turn the remaining members of the circle after all the brothers have passed the pro consul who has been the last in the circle they should return to their places at the very end of the meeting it is traditional in many chapters to dim the house lights turn on the white cross and have the entire chapter join in an appropriate song such as sig i am27r i tua l ritualistic closing since the seven lights should have been lighted for the literary exercises and for the good of sigma chi and the chapter they shall remain lighted for the ritualistic closing consul having risen brothers the time of closing is at hand as we separate let us resolve anew to wear the white cross worthily through life and to help one another to attain its virtues the consul raps he then passes around the circle commencing with the annotator giving to each brother in turn the fraternal grip and saying consul i seek true friendship brother you find it here after the consul has proceeded around the entire circle he shall resume his place the consul shall be followed closely by the annotator whom the brothers shall follow consecutively in the order of their seating each saying in turn to the remaining members of the circle brother i seek true friendship other brother you find it here after all of the brothers have passed the pro consul who has been the last in the circle they shall return to their places consul who is our ancient patron brothers constantine who conquered by the cross consul giving the sign of salutation brothers guard well the honor of the cross brothers giving the sign of recognition in hoc signo vinces consul brothers we part in unity brothers so mote it be consul raps ritualistic statutes 28division iii the ceremonies of initiation the ritualistic phase is fitting climax to the indoctrination w eek and the wellplanned pledge training program until 1947 each of these phas was treated separately and attempt was made to coordinate them it is now recognized that indoctrination week can be wholly successful unless it is preceded by wellorganized pledge training program by the same token the beauties of the ritualistic phase cannot be fully absorbed without outstanding work in both the pledge training program and the indoctrination week successful initiation was ever performed without careful planning and timely execution preparation for the ritualistic work should be made at the same time plans are drawn up for the indoctrination weekthat is at least month in advance since the magister has full responsibility for the planning and operation of the indoctrination week and since this work will keep him quite busy the responsibility for the ritualistic work should fall upon the ritual committee in cooperation with the consul the magister operating in an advisory capacity the entire ceremonies pertaining to initiation into sigma chi are those included in the ritual and ritualistic statutes chapter nor any member of any chapter shall at any time in any way add to the initiation ceremonies or devise other features than those provided in the ritual the entire initiation shall be free from laughter violence or rough ness of any character nor shall anything be said or done which may be physically injurious to the candidate or lowers his selfrespect horseplay of any sort is positively prohibited the snapping of fin gers as sign of approval or otherwise is not allowed during initiation the practice of developing extraneous features and extending them throughout week or more preceding the proper initiatory period is detrimental alike to the best interests of the college the fraternities their chapters and the individual members and is strictly prohibited any infraction of the preceding requirements shall render the offending chapter or any member of any chapter liable to discipline under the provisions of the constitution and statutes of the fraternity the executive secretary shall preserve official designs of ritualistic paraphernalia and regalia the regalia shall not be worn at any time otherritualistic statutes 29than during the ceremonies of initiation the grand praetors shall see to it that the chapters under their supervision maintain strict conformity to of f i cial designs in order that there be uniformity among all chapters certain ceremonies require the officers to wear robes designating their office those robes are as follows theconsulshall wear white tunic and blue and gold toga with design of the badge on the left breast the pro consul shall wear white tunic and blue and gold toga with an eagles head embroidered in gold on the left breast the magister shall wear white tunic and red and white toga with seven gold stars embroidered on the left breast the annotator shall wear white tunic and blue and gold toga with golden scroll embroidered upon the left breast constantine shall wear purple tunic and gold and purple toga the foregoing officers shall also wear brass or gold yellow braid head bands all other brothers shall wear black robes each initiate shall be dressed in white robe when called for in the ritual each chapter shall properly maintain supply of the above described regalia chapters within few miles of each other may choose to share regalia each contributing to the supplythe minimum supply of member robes shall be 25 the ideal situation is to have supply of member robes sufficient for the entire chapter the minimum supply of candidate robes shall be an amount equal to that needed for the largest pledge class the minimum supply of paraphernalia shall include all items required in the ritual and ritualistic statutes under circumstances shall the regalia be worn in public or at any time other than the ceremonies of initiation or an authorized exemplifi cation or rehearsal thereof assignment of duties ritual committee chairmanassistant magister 1 extend written invitation to alumni to attend initiation giving defi nite time schedule for the various ceremonies special invitations should be given to fathers or brothers of the new initiates it is tra ditional to ask them to badge these menritualistic statutes 302 carefully select alumni to conduct the pledge interview inviting them at least three weeks prior to the date of interview 3 have pledges personal files completed and available for alumni interviewers 4 check quest routes before every initiation to make certain the place of search is quiet and secluded sometimes street names are changed trees are cut down or fences torn out thereby making instructions inadequate 5 assign and supervise the setting up of the following the black supper interview rooms cleansing room the chapter room or designated place for the investiture 6 arrange for recommended musical background or lighting used in some ceremonies 7 make arrangements for initiation banquet with steward and social chairman and extend invitations to alumni and special guests 8 brief the chapter thoroughly on complete schedule of events well in advance of initiation 9 be responsible for upkeep and replacement of all paraphernalia aspecial ritualistic storeroom should be available for the proper care of equipment caution do not store paraphernalia in damp ar b all robes should be dry cleaned and pressed periodically prefer ably immediately after each initiation this can be done by taking them to dry cleaner away from the campus where other stu dents are not likely to be working and using brothers name rather than the fraternity name when not in use they should be placed on hangers if this is not done it becomes necessary to have the robes pressed for each initiation c ritualistic items which become worn or damaged should be sys tematically replaced for this purpose the chapter should estab lish depreciation fund in the budget in those years when few expenditures are made the surplus should be carried over to the next year by this method when it becomes necessary for theritualistic statutes 31chapter to make costly replacements of paraphernalia money will be in reserve to cover the expense d list all needed items and assign someone to procure them new candles should be used for each initiation make certain that the pro consul is supplied with taper holder and tapers the brass candelabrum should always be brightly polished b ritualist man with experience in dramatics and public speaking who has made thorough study of the ritual 1 select and assign parts to various brothers who will participate in the ritualistic work the practice by some chapters of having one of the brothers memorize one of the assignable parts and deliver that part at several initiations or until his graduation is commended 2 set definite schedule for and direct rehearsals 3 consult frequently with consul and magister on matters of technique and timing 4 selection of sufficient number of active members to be present during the quest interview and cleansing is important these brothers will be needed to help the magister or assistant magister to maintain record of each initiates attendance to the individual cer emonies it is recommended that the chapter conduct two full rehearsals of each of the ceremonies prior to each initiation at least the final rehearsal of the investiture should be full dress rehearsal conducted in the room in which it is to be held to deliver the printed word aloud requires constant practice to be familiar with the thoughts expressed so well in our ritual each part demands understanding dignity and depth of feeling the speaker must be inspired by the words and convey that inspiration to the candidates that is interpretive abilitythe ability to transfer the full thought and emotional contents of the writing and make it livethe brother rendering each part is representing sigma chi in that role the qualities the ca n didates hear in his voice are attributed to the fraternity in all parts of the ritual with the exception of the obligation which must be read for absolute accuracy memorization is essential to an exem plary performanceritualistic statutes 32time schedule the planning and adhering to definite schedule for the ritualistic work is of the utmost importance not only from the standpoint of the effect on the candidate but also for the morale of the entire chapter nobody likes to sit around and wait for hours for the next ceremony to begin and this applies particularly to the alumni effect on candidate apoorly executed time schedule can have most disastrous effect on the candidate the entire psychology of the initiation is based on chain of events the black supper has direct influence on the thinking processes of the candidate during the quest these thinking processes are probed deeply in the interview which in turn provides background for the undertaking of the cleansing and the investiture the investiture ties all the preceding events together into superb climax therefore if this chain of events is interrupted by an undue interval of time the chances are great that the thought processes induced in the can didates will also be interrupted the result will be that the desirable psy chological effect created by the preceding ceremonies or events will be greatly reduced or lost entirely this cannot be overemphasized recommended procedure 10 pm or4 am the black supper dawn the quest 7 am 8 am candidates are cleaned up properly attired and given light breakfast 8 am 10 am the interview followed by period for reflection 9 am 11 am the cleansing 11 am the investiture afternoon orevening initiation banquet advantages of procedure long experience has indicated that the above procedure is most advantageous it causes great fatigue or loss of sleep on the part of the pledges actives or alumni it is thus easier to obtain more enthusiastic alumni participation dawn is not only the most inspiring time for the quest but also is the time of day when the pledge is least likely to encounter other people during his searchritualistic statutes 33the black supper purpose the black supper in the fraternity is serious and solemn ceremony used as preliminary introduction to the formal initiation the primary purpose of this ceremony is to impress candidates with the seriousness of our teachings it is lesson in personal responsibility the ceremony sets the scene for the quest and gives the candidate the encouragement of the chapter for the symbolic mission he will undertake properties 1 tables 2 chair for each candidate 3 two or three candles for table 4 goblets and saucers 5 black cloth 6 bread and water 7 black robes for members preparation ideally this ceremony should be conducted in room large enough to accommodate the entire chapter standing at one end as group and the candidates seated at long table at the other end the members are to be dressed in black robes with hoods drawn over their heads they should stand as body facing the candidates with arms folded maintaining candidates consul

conducting the cer emony in place other than the chapter house is permissible provided that secrecy is maintained and that the place chosen is large enough to accommodate the entire class of initiates seated at one time as well as the members of the active chapter standing the consul clad also in black robe with his head bared will stand alone approximately three paces in front of the chapter and deliver the black supper address from memory the table is covered with black cloth and for further effect the walls of the room may be also draped in black cloth two or three candles placed on the table provide the only light in the room before each can didate is small glass or goblet of water and small piece of bread cut in the shape of square the bread is placed on small plate the practice of certain chapters of providing special ware for this ceremony is com mended caution w ine or grape juice is not to be used because of the danger of offending the religious sensibilities of certain pledges appropriate recorded music may be played very softly throughout the ceremony if music is not used absolute silence must prevail note the fraternitys recommended ritual music tape or compact disc contains an appropriate selection for this ceremony performance the candidates are blindfolded and conducted into the room by guides and each placed behind his seat at the table candidate should have his back to the speaker and chapter the table may be extended in u shape in the case of large class this being the first part of the initiation the consul should strive to prepare the candidates for the seriousness of this ceremony and of those to follow the consul must study carefully the purpose of the black supper in order to deliver it with understanding and meaning further the speaker must realize the candidates are experiencing something new in their fraternity experience both in text and in procedure the consul must speak slowly deliberately and with feeling making sure his pauses are ample where indicated the speaker must give the candidates time to think about this new experience and what it is all about an understanding delivery and tone of voice will center their minds on the message of the dissertation and give meaning to it35r i tua l dlvision iii the ceremonies of initiation the black supper if desired the black supper may be delivered by the magister

cause he met them in secret places together they shared certain spiritual truths and practiced noble virtues in solemn secrecy jesus revealed the deepest purposes of his heart he outlined philosophy for good life and announced the ideals for better society secret signs symbols and solemn ritual characterized their brotherhood suitable pause our being here is symbolic of the last meeting jesus had with his disciples he had been their leader and guide he had been their per sonal friend and counselor he had been responsible for their motives and their actions suitable pause3637r i tua l at this last meeting he told them that he could longer be their leader guide friend and counselor in visible form he laid upon them the responsibility for carrying on the work of his cause from this time forward they would make their own decisions by their ini tiative and on their personal responsibility they would be accountable for their own character and conduct suitable pause in like manner the ______________ chapter of the sigma chi fraternity has selected you trained you guided you and assumed your responsibilities as their own as jesus left his disciples to their strength of character and trusted them with the ideals of his brotherhood so does this chapter now leave you to your own strength of character and trust you with our ideals from this time forward you are responsible to god to your friends and to your own best judgment for the way you make up your mind the way you think speak and act suitable pause let remind you that the white cross we wear comes to us from the christ

with the ritual as prescribedritualistic statutes 38the quest purpose the aim of the quest is to send the candidate out alone to think it should be an inspiration not wild goose chase when properly conducted the candidate will search for an ideala search that he will be conduct ing for the rest of his life he may discover gratitude to his home appre ciation of college opportunities he may pray and find god and return the possessor of spiritual values and nobler manhood properties 1 table 2 chairs for magister and candidate 3 quest instructions 4 black member robe for magister preparation the preparation of the written instructions for the quest and the manner by which they are to be given to the pledge are explicitly prescribed by the ritual chapter or member shall add to this ceremony or devise features other than those provided by the ritual acareful time schedule must be followed in planning the quest the most successful practice is that of sending the men out at five to ten minute intervals and having them return on similar schedule this will avert the possibility of pledges encountering each other while coming or going care must also be taken in planning the directions for the quest routes to keep candidates from seeing or meeting each other the distance each pledge will have to walk will depend on local ditions half mile to one mile each way is far enough if it is necessary for the pledge to travel long distances because of crowded urban condi tions arrangements should be made to drive him to designated spot let him continue the remainder of the way on foot then pick him up at des ignated hour the length of time for each quest will vary according to the distance the candidate must travel it may be figured on the basis of twenty min utes per mile and maximum of thirty minutes for the actual searchritualistic statutes 39rules to follow in determining quest location the place of search should be 1 an isolated location away from people b away from buildings or other manmade structures c never near church yard or cemetery d away from objects likely to cause injury 2 aplace of tranquility and beauty esthetically appealing the practice of conducting an extremely long quest is illadvised and contrary to its purpose it serves not only to fatigue the candidate but also to slow down the entire process of initiation multiple walks errands missions or quests are forbidden the ritual prescribes but one additional missions defeat our purpose and add confusion performance in the event the black supper is held in the evening the candidates are immediately put to bed and are aroused before dawn for the quest under circumstances should the candidate be caused to remain awake all nightthese several hours of sleep are vital for clear and receptive mind during the ceremonial work the magister shall call each candidate into room in which there is desk upon which has been placed lamp here the magister shall present white paper

three weeks in advance enough alumni should be invited to prevent the need for any one alum nus to conduct more than four interviews 2 see that each gets files on the pledges he will interview far enough in advance to allow ample time to study them 3 make sure they are aware of the purpose and methods of the interview each should read the instructions to interviewers before conducting an interview the practice of having new interviewers witness more experienced alumnus is highly recommended 4 make the current instructions to interviewers available for alumni who may want to do some reviewing each chapter should have available sup ply of the current instructions to interviewers for use during initiation time and also for alumni study they should be numbered and signed in and out to avoid losses copies of the instructions to interviewers may be obtained from fraternity headquarters without char g 5 prepare the candidate for successful interview by well planned pro gram on the jordan standard during the indoctrination w eek the chapter should make every effort to encourage alumni groups in the vicinity to form an alumni committee of interviewers this group may meet from time to time to discuss techniques and problems encountered during the interviews younger alumni should be encouraged to partici pate in these groups where they may learn from experienced interviewers having such groups simplifies the job of lining up alumni interviewers all ritual committee chairman need do is notify the chair man of the alumni committee of the date of the initiation and how many interviewers will be required the tribune will do the restritualistic statutes 43physicalarrangements and setup the chapter should provide the following materials for the interview 1 supply of blank paper for notes 2 complete file on each pledge to be interviewed containing summary of all pledge tests including score made on official examination b summary of all work assignments c academic grades d list of pledges campus and chapter activities the essay f pertinent comments by magister 3 current edition of instructions to interviewers if the chapter is initiating more than few individuals it will probably need to run several interviews at the same time interviews should be set up in quiet locations away from noise or other distractions that may be present seating should be arranged to allow the interviewer and candi date to face one another as it is important that they maintain eye contact during the interview small table should be placed between them soft lighting by candle or otherwise should be sufficient to allow them to see one another but not so bright as to be distracting ordinarily the interviewer and candidate should be left alone after the candidate is presented by the magister in rare instances where another member is present such as prospective interviewer who is present to witness an interview by an experienced alumnus before doing one on his own the member shall not be seen or heard by the candidate immediately upon returning from the quest the candidate still on silence will clean up put on suit and be conducted to his room where he will be brought

anyone other than the magister ask for or accept the candi dates written quest instructionsritualistic statutes 44tothe interviewer purpose except for the first and final ceremonies sigma chi is initiated ind i viduallythe interview is at the heart of his initiation for it is here that the candidate should come to fully recognize the importance of the fraternitys ideals and commit himself to their attainment accordingly the purpose of the interview is to allow the candidate to measure himself by the jordan standard and to help him realize the symbolic and contin uing nature of his quest for the white cross t oward this end it is cru cial that the interviewer establish an atmosphere of trust and open com munication with the candidate the interviewers approach tothe candidate conducting an interview is real art it is difficult form of communi cation the interviewer must establish and build upon the candidates trust in order for him to open up about the jordan standard and most particularly about the symbolic nature of his quest for the white cross the attitude of the interviewer is that of counselor and older brother and during the interview he must set the tone for an honest discussion and selfevaluation by the candidate the interviewer must accept this responsibility in good faith and with sincere desire to be fair and friend ly it is contrary to the laws and purposes of the fraternity and counter productive to the purposes of the ritual to use profanity vulgarity false hood or deception or to embarrass or grill the candidate it is unethical to suggest to or convince the candidate that he will not be initiated or lead him to feel that after an intensive pledge training pro gram he is not wanted and will not be initiated such an approach by the interviewer is deceitful interviewers are responsible to the grand council and to the consul and magister of the chapter for everything that is said and done since the candidate will be under certain amount of emotional stress it is not necessary or permissible to invoke any meas ures that will place him in further emotional or physical discomfort the paragraphs which follow examine the various phases of the typi cal interview the three phases an interview should last more than 30 minutes under ordinary circumstances with bright and well prepared candidate the time required for rewarding and meaningful interview is frequently less than half an hour it is important to remember that the candidate shall45r i tua l the interview the candidate is brought before the interviewer who is seated at table the candidate should be seated facing the interviewer the magister presents the candidate and says mr interviewer this is candidate last name all brothers leave the interview room except as specifically authorized by the consul magister and interviewer in the rare case when another mem ber is present during the interview it is forbidden for his presence to be known by the candidate opening questions interviewery ou may remove the blindfold the interviewer should introduce himself my name is ________________ i have been asked by this chapter to conduct this introduction to our ceremonial work what is your full name how old are you where did you last attend school why did you come to this college or university why do you want to join fraternity what particular reason do you have for wanting to join sigma chi do you have any relatives who are sigma chi sritualistic statutes 46be asked to remove his blindfold for purposes of analysis the interview can be divided into three parts introduction opening questions the jordan standard and the quest brief wrapup or conclusion finishes the interview all of this can be covered in the recommended time phase i introduction the introductory portion of the interview accomplishes two purposes it allows the interviewer to learn bit more about the candidate in his own words further remember that candidate will often be on edge and somewhat confused by the process the interviewer should use these first questions to put the candidate at ease before moving on to the more important topics of discussion phase ii the jordan standard upon completion of the introductory portion the interviewer moves into the jordan standard it is not possi ble to cover in great detail all the parts of the jordan standard in the pre scribed time the interviewer should be familiar enough with the materi to enable him to focus on those areas that seem to be most important in light of candidates strengths and weaknesses the interviewer should also bear in mind that the candidate has just completed comprehensive training period and should be well versed on the jordan standard even though he may still be somewhat on edge and bewildered at this stage of the interview use the suggested questions in the ritual as guide for each interview remember that the purpose of discussing the jordan standard is to assure that the candidate understands this material and to set the stage for the discussion of his quest it is not necessary nor is it good practice to ask the candidate each and every one of the suggest ed questions set forth in the ritual instead use them as checklist or guide to individual situations47r i tua l the jordan standard mr ______________ our fraternity has certain standards which have been maintained from the very beginning and which all men are required to meet before they are fully initiated one of our founders isaac m jordan gave us strict warning of admitting man to membership who was not believed to be aman of good character astudent of fair ability with ambitious purposes acongenialdisposition possessed of good morals having high sense of honor and deep sense of personal responsibility mr ______________ do you regard this standard fair and just by which sigma chis are to be measured are you willing to measure yourself by this standard what have been your thoughts about the jordan standard select one of the seven points of the standard perhaps the one most important to you and tell what it means to you which of the points do you exemplify best which of the points do you have the greatest problem exemplifying are you making efforts in that direction is there any one of the points that is confusing to you or that you would like to discuss with do you feel as though you measure up to the jordan standard as whole m s u re the depth of thought of the candidate if not already covered suffi c i n t l the individual points are provided in the following pages for r f re n c i man of good character what is your idea of manhood what is your definition of character what is the difference between character and reputation discuss courage moral and intellectual the courage of ones convictions manliness and sportsmanship how is character formed maintained and developed how well do you feel you measure up to this standard character is basic in sgima chi sigma chi is character producing institution ii student of fair ability what are the essential habits of student should student budget his time how what is meant by ability what do you think mr jordan may have meant by fair ability discuss studentship subjects difficult or easy does the chapter have plan of scholarship promotion knowledge learning w isdom talents other than intellectual ability how do you evaluate yourself by this standard iii ambitious purposes define ambition what is your chief ambition do you feel that you have ambitious purposes what would you like to be doing ten years from today what are your plans for graduate study or professional training what are your ambitions in sigma chi discuss the value of definite life purpose the relative values of life vocation money family

discuss friendship courtesy cheerfulness loyalty social attitudes personal relationships do you feel that you possess congenial disposition v possessed of good morals what is your definition of morality how do you distinguish between good morals and bad morals what are some of your best habits can this chapter expect you to exercise self control discuss distinction between right and w rong when conduct is matter of custom morals or ethics how do you evaluate yourself in light of this standard vi high sense of honor what is meant by sense of honor what person has had the strongest influence for good in your life asense of honor is derived from what sources give examples of your own trustworthiness what is justice how is justice attained and administeredritualistic statutes 50phase iii the quest once the candidate has demonstrated an under standing of the various parts of the jordan standard and how they are relat ed to one another the interviewer should proceed to discussion of the quest it is crucial that the candidate come to understand the symbolic and personal nature of the quest interview should be completed without accomplishing this objective the suggestions which follow should help the interviewer lead the candidate himself to this realization the aim of the quest is to send the candidate out alone to think it should be an inspiration not wild goose chase when properly ducted the candidate will search for an ideal search that he will be ducting for the rest of his life he may discover gratitude to his home appreciation of college opportunities he may pray and find god and return the possessor of spiritual values and nobler manhood acandidates initial answers to questions regarding the purpose of his quest will typically fall in one of three categories he grasps the true pur pose of the quest he thinks he knows but isnt sure or he doesnt know he believes he missed finding tangible object the goal of the interviewer should be to move the candidate from doesnt know or isnt sure to true understanding of the quest this should be done through carefully developed questions one who isnt sure can be moved to either category through the right set of questions an orderly approach designed to move the candidate along this progres sion should succeed in most instances however in those rare cases where this fails it may be necessary for the interviewer to explain the purpose of the quest to the candidate and follow up with questions to assure that the candidate understands what he has just been told again candidate should leave the interview without understanding the true nature of the quest further specific approaches are suggested through out the text of the ritual advance preparation and the observation of skilled interviewer will ease the task of conducting ones first interview51r i tua l discuss home school churchas sources of inspiration ones debt to society to sigma chi would you support brother if he were wrong would you expect support if you were wrong what is your evaluation of yourself by this standard vii personal responsibility what is your definition of fidelity what is meant by financial responsibility do you owe the chapter any money is it your habit to pay as you go or not go do you make financial reports to your home do you meet the deadline of personal assignments discuss borrowing lending meeting obligations to the chapter and to the general fraternity do you feel that you exercise personal responsibility the quest mr______________ i understand that this chapter sent you out on an important task what were you asked to do you were given certain written instructions w ere these instructions clear what was the result of your search the candidate will respond in one of three ways regarding his search 1 he feels as though he was searching for something tangible 2 he sensed something intangible or 3 he is not sure of the purpose of his search if the candidate was searching for tangible white cross or if he was u n s u re of the purpose of his mission proceed with the questions which follow if he sensed something symbolic or intangible in his quest proceed with the questions headed intangible white cross5253r i tua l tangible white cross if the candidate responds that he searched and couldnt find anything or if he hands you some tangible object proceed as follows are you certain that you followed your instructions carefully recite them if the candidate did not understand the purpose of the quest then you must cause him to reevaluate his important task if he states that his quest was other than to conduct diligent search for the white cross ask him questions until he is certain that the instructions did not say bring back the white cross or find the white cross for example do not use the candidates written instructions except as explained above to have the candidate reread them to the interviewer what were you thinking why did the chapter send you on this mission how did pledgeship prepare you for the mission you were sent on how does tangible object relate to your mission i n sigma chi to what you have learned about sigma chi if the candidate did not spend any time thinking and did not receive any insights then you must cause him to evaluate his important task in retrospect try to turn the tangible into the intangible if necessary you may ask him to replace the blindfold and leave him alone in the interview room for few minutes to think on the process of his pledgeship indoctrination week and initiation if all else fails the interviewer must inform the candidate that the white cross is an ideal that his quest was symbolic missionritualistic statutes 54conclusion after finishing discussion of the quest brief concluding remarks are appropriate and will provide sense of closure for the can didate praise him on his strong points and encourage him to continue thinking about the points raised in the interview finally consider leav ing him with the thought that sigma chi s search does not end at this point but rather continues through life55r i tua l intangible white cross if the candidate states that the white cross is an ideal then you should commend him this is the high point of the interview so spend some time on his thoughts savor them with the candidate this is our objective enjoy the experience with the candidate you not only want to listen to his reasoning but you also want to be sure that he realizes the symbolic lifelong search for the white crossthe ideals of the fraternity tell why you believe the white cross is an ideal when did you reach this belief how did it come about what did your quest mean to you what was the purpose of the quest conclusion you are now ready to end the interview the candidate may have shown superior intelligence in his interview if so congratulate him he may have sensed something symbolic or spiritual in his quest if so commend him you have developed the candidates realization that the search for the ideals of the white cross will require undiminished striving on his part recall points from the interview that you were particularly impressed with do you realize that your search was symbolic mission what can you liken it to the lifelong quest of sigma chi to find the white cross do you realize that you may never achieve the ideals of the white cross are you ready to make lifetime commitment to search for the ideals of the white cross that is all you are excused you may replace the blindfold the guide is then summoned from the hall to escort the candidate to his r m ritualistic statutes 56the cleansing purpose the purpose of the cleansing is to give the candidate few moments of reflection prior to his initiation into sigma chi the process toward initiation is reviewed emphasizing the significance of the interviewthe questions and the minor obligation review some of the requirements for initiation the cleansing of the hands is symbolic of cleansing of heart and mind in preparation for the investiture properties 1 white cloth 2 water 3 glass bowl 4 linen table napkins 5 small table 6 candles andor alcohol lamp 7 officer robes for pro consul and magister preparation the cleansing shall be observed in room or rooms properly prepared for the purpose other than the chapter room this consists of cubicle not less than six feet square completely draped in white cloth in the cen ter of the room is small table also covered with white cloth upon which is placed glass bowl of water and napkin the candidate is so placed that his complete field of vision is white the igniting of flatbottomed bowl of alcohol placed before the candidate on small stand between the table and the wall is very effective the alcohol is usually ignited just proper arrangementfor the cleansingcandidatepro consulthe cleansing the candidate being blindfolded the magister shall bring him in and place him before the table magister my friend your long ordeal is nearing close you have been subjected to an interview which probed the depths of your character our tests were made severe in order that you might never forget the standards of sigma chi your interview may not have been fully credit to you as you must realize et we believe in you and in the inherent worth of your character you have accepted as your standard the virtues of sigma chi if you are willing in this holy and sacred moment to covenant that you will make these virtues rule and guide of your life we will open up to you the way of further progress toward initiation do you promise and agree in all good faith and manly honor that you will make these virtues rule and guide for your life the candidate must answer yes do you believe in the existence of an everliving god the creator and preserver of all things the candidate must answer yes do you belong to any secret college fraternity of similar char acter to sigma chi the candidate must answer is it of your own free will that you desire to take upon yourself the duties and responsibilities of brother in the fraternity the candidate must answer yes my friend our law requires that before your entrance into our temple sacred to the high purposes of our order you obligate yourself to us are you willing to do so the candidate must answer yes 57r i tua lritualistic statutes 58before the blindfold is removed from the candidate atablespoon of alco hol is adequate for each cleansing other light may be provided by candles the water in the cleansing bowl must be changed for each candi date anumber of clean white napkins shall be provided it is sufficient to have fresh napkin for each candidate performance after period of reflection following the interview the pledge is clothed in an initiates robe and is brought into the cleansing room the magister and pro consul should be attired in their regalia for the cleansing the magister stands on the right of the candidate the pro consul who gives the prayer is opposite the cleansing table from the candidate it is important for the pro consul to memorize this brief prayer the cleansing may begin within half hour after the completion of the first interview and continue simultaneously with the interviews until all have been cleansed in the case of very large class it may be advisable to prepare two cleansing rooms with the assistant magister and annotator officiating in the second room the cleansing of several pledges at the same time in the same room is permitted but is not as effective as the individual process in order to meet present conditions of large classes of initiates large numbers of alumni visitors and house conditions generally at initiation time the conclusion of the interview is to be followed by the cleansing as soon as conditions may conveniently permit the interview being completed the magister and pro consul shall pro ceed with the cleansing assisted by the brothers appointed to act as guides to the candidates the ceremony must be conducted with utmost solemnity free from disquieting noise or interruption of any kind in order that the alumni and active brothers may be reminded of the beauty and simplicity of this ceremony they should all witness the cleansing of the last candidate if necessary the white drapes surround ing the cleansing table may be drawn back to enable all to see the formal chapter session is not called until the magister has informed the consul that the cleansings are concluded and that all is in readiness for the entrance to the chapter room59r i tua l as we have all done before you so must you now take upon your self this solemn obligation raise your right hand heavenward and repeat after i your full name do solemnly swear always to conceal and never to reveal but to keep inviolably secret all that i may see hear know or learn during my initiation so help god the magister removes the blindfold candidate before you are bowl of water and napkin in token of the purity of the motives which bring you hither you will cleanse your hands in the water and dry them upon the napkin pro consul slowly and softly let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight lord my strength and my redeemer almighty god unto whom all hearts are open all desires known and from whom secrets are hid cleanse the thoughts of our hearts we beseech thee that with pure motives we may assume our solemn obligations magister replaces the blindfold you will come with the candidate is quietly conducted to suitable place for waiting until all is in readiness for the entrance to the chapter room pauseritualistic statutes 60the investiture purpose sigma chi is initiated only once the investiture is the climax of the initiation since this is the point at which membership is actually being conferred it is necessary that the chapter not only execute the perform ance correctly but also communicate the message sincerely so that the inspiration will emotionally move the candidate this demands the highest degree of determination and perseverance the regular ritualistic opening of the investiture expresses the solem nity and importance of the ceremony the delineation of the lives of the seven founders and the sevenbranched candlestick illuminate the sym bolism behind our own history and traditions the three great aims fully embody the historical spirit of the founding the appearance of constantine unites the heritage behind the white cross and in hoc signo vinces with the solemnity of the obligation which the initiate is about to take the candidate is impressed with the death thesis of our ritual the fact that his obligation will accompany him to the grave he is also reminded that while we are mortals our spirit is immortal the presentation of the badge reviews and clarifies the initiates progress through initiation reminding us of the unique relationship the white cross has as our fraternal badge and the symbol of our lifelong quest the explanations of the badge and seal and the challenge com plete the ceremonial enlightenment the charge reminds us of our privi leges and responsibilities in sigma chi inspiring us in commendat ry and admonitory manner the ritual has beauty in word and in form but the more abiding treas ure of our investiture lies in its meaning and spiritual truth thus the goal of each participant in the ceremony is the communication of message this requires first of all thorough understanding of the ritual and an abiding faith in it after studying part of the ritual to understand it one can easily commit the form of the words to memory understanding and memory unite through repeated practice into meaningful delivery of the investiture

that for group of ten to fifteen candidates and an active chapter of thirty to forty brothers room smaller than 30 x 30 be employed if the facilities of the chapter house are such as not to lend the proper atmosphere to do justice to the beauty of the ritual it is recommended that the chapter find suitable lodge hall church or college building proper precautions should always be maintained to

positions as to be seen easily by all initiates in general it is to be remembered that the officer stations should be so prepared as to sustain and enhance the atmosphere of solemnity dignity and beauty they should therefore be made as attractive and beautiful as possible the use of floral decorations to this end is commended the ritual committee should arrange room adjoining the chapter room for the members to change in and out of the regalia preparation of candidates the candidates who have been interviewed and cleansed should be prop erly attired and blindfolded and waiting in location adequately removed from the place of the investiture so that the opening ceremonies may not be overheard carefully selected recorded music can be played softly in this room in order to help preserve the proper atmosphere it is very unwise to conduct an investiture when the clothing of the candidates does not reflect the dignity and seriousness of the ceremony over this proper attire the candidates should wear the official white robe with blue waist cord and the norman shield embossed on the left breast upon entry the candidates should be arranged in deep semicircle before the consul so that there is ample opportunity for each of them to share in the investiture without having to strain for either sight or sound if an unusually large initiation class necessitates that there be more than one semicircle of candidates there should be ample space between the semicircles for the consul and pro consul during the badging ceremony each of these spots where candidate is to be placed can be indicated by placing chalk or tape mark on the floor thus insuring that there is room for the scene and other ritualistic activity and still preserving the close ness and intimacy which add so much to the ceremony lighting music and specialeffects the use of several lighting techniques and appropriate music selections is encouraged effective lighting and music may aid measurably the initiates experience as he participates in his initiation his visual faculties will respond more readily to lighting which not only makes it possible to see but also adds meaning to that which is seen similarly musical back ground intensifies the experience because it creates an atmosphere aritualistic statutes 64mindset particular receptivity for the ceremony of which it is part in both instances however it is necessary to use great discretion in deter mining when these devices are to be used overdoing either will defeat its purpose which is to augment and intensify the ritual not to become noticeable part of the ceremony ritualistic lighting equipment the equipment may vary at the different chapters but the following is recommended 1 several feet of lighting wire 2 acontrol panel

construction of control box 3 lights the number of lights that are necessary in your chapter sit uation it is usually quite easy to borrow most of the equipment from the university the control panel may be as elaborate and complicat ed as you figure you can handle very simple board consisting of switches and rheostat with this you can handle the brightness of the light is adequate the wires from the different lights are connected and the right light goes on it is important to mark each switch so that you will not make mistake during the ceremony the rheostat is placed in one circuit and knifeswitched to see that certain lights can be brought from nothing to full brightness agreat deal of practice beforehand with the principals is necessary to have good lights b placing of the lights in picking your room for the investiture make sure you are able to hang the lights from the ceiling out of view of the can didates if you cannot hang the lights from the ceiling put two floodlights on the floor shining into the backdrop placing of additional lights may be determined by the amount of avail able light from candles where any one part of the investiture is conducted additional lighting may be needed for constantine the casket the challenge exemplification the roll book etc care should be taken to see that all parts of the investiture are visible to the candidates it is important to put your control board at the back of the room and out of the view of the candidatesritualistic statutes 65ritualistic music general rules to follow in selecting music for ritualistic w ork 1 study the atmosphere and mood that you are trying to create and portray 2 select music which is appropriate to enhance the mood and atmosphere desired 3avoid using any music which is too popular or too common inappropriate music selected without reasonable care and considera tion can achieve negative effect instead of beautiful one u n d r circumstances shall music be played over period of hours dur

badge and seal illumination of each as each is explained charge music is played as charge is delivered performance each of the preceding steps having been completed the chapter is now ready to perform the investiture now is the time for brilliance and centration the consul opens the meeting as at any regular chapter meet ing this is important it is part of the investiture and must be scrupu lously included failure to observe this requisite means that the chapter members are not given ample opportunity to adjust to the ritualistic situ ation and the symmetry of the ceremony is thus seriously disturbed6667the investiture the investiture is the climax of the initiation ceremony and every effort should be made to render it beautiful and impressive before the meeting is opened in the regular ritualistic form as provided the brothers should be clothed in regalia each candidate is blindfolded and awaits in anoth er room under the custody of the magister the observance of singular or plural forms of expression as required should be carefully noted through out the ceremony the form of opening is the same as that used for regular chapter meeting ritualistic opening the time for the

manner he should read the names of the candidates to be admitted in clear voice filled with pride and dignity for it is he who has been large ly responsible for the preparation of the candidates and it is he who in moment will vouch for them entrance of the candidates as the initiates are brought into the room each is on the arm of guide preferably his big brother or pledge father who leads him directly to the proper place before the consul which has previously been designated by mark on the floor there is marching around the room and gong the guides should remain standing behind the

we proceed to make themour brothersit is my duty to remind you that the ties by which we shall bind these candidates to our fraternity are sacred therefore i urge upon you to strive to make this initiation true expression of the worth of the fraternity into which they are entering let levity nor unseemly conduct prevent themfrom learning those lessons whose meaning theymust grasp if they are to be true sigma chis let us remember that these lessons are also for us to follow and in our thoughts let us renew before our altar the lessons of the white cross we love so well consul raps brothers

must understand the philosophy underlying the vouching when the consul questions the magister with serious tone the latter defends his candidates with firm and proud resolve they have worthy consul and i d worthy consul the candidates must really feel that the chapter will admit man who is not fully qualified the vouching by the chapter rising in one voice we all do is one of the most stirring moments of the entire ceremony73the magister salutes the consul with the sign of salutation who responds with the sign of recognition the vouching consul whom have we here magister w orthy consul

truly worthyr i tua lritualistic statutes 74removal of the blindfolds the guides who have remained standing behind each candidate assist the magister in the removal of the blindfolds this is timesaving feature and is smoother and less confusing than other methods once having removed the blindfold of the candidate each guide takes his seat in his proper place in the circle the magister should previously caution the candidates to carry their eye glasses with them when they don the blindfolds the initi ation may be one great blur to one who does not have his glasses when the blindfolds are removed the candidates should view the room in semidarkness the light in the room should be dim this is not the time for blackout as the candidate has faint knowledge so the light is limited but each will grow the lighting of the seven candles the consul should wait until each candle is burning brightly before pro nouncing the name for which it stands the pro consul must be provided with taper holder and tapers with which to light the sevenbranched can dlestick the use of matches detracts from the dignity of the ceremony and is therefore forbidden the sevenbranched candlestick should be kept brightly polished at all times the seven founders as the ritual indicates it is possible for the consul to deliver each of the foundersspeeches it is also permissible for all of the roles to be carried by single brother who has other part in the investiture the third alter native is to have the seven speeches delivered by seven brothers the lat ter affords an opportunity for wide participation in the ceremony and is effective dramatics while sustaining chapter relations it is distinction to deliver speech honoring one of the immortal seven the brother deliv ering the speech should not attempt to achieve any effect other than natu ral sincerity in order to accomplish this an understanding of the part and its relation to the life of the founder is necessarythe brothers who deliv er the speeches should participate freely in the indoctrination w eek dis cussions of the seven founders they not only can make valuable contri butions to the discussion but also may add to their own knowledge of course under circumstances should the ritualistic relationship of the virtues and the founders be disclosed prior to the investiture75the enlightenment consul my friends you are now standing in the sacred shrine of sigma chi whose beauties you do not appreciate because your eyes cannot see them it is well for the sight of our symbols instead of accomplishing your enlightenment would fuse your untutored minds by the manner of your enlightenment you will be reminded that the progress of true learning is gradual for your light will increase as you advance in knowledge brother magister you will remove the blindfolds the magister assisted by the guides removes the blindfolds while this is being done the room is darkened the lighting of the sev candles the pro consul standing at the right of the consul shall be provided with lighted taper for the purpose of lighting the candles in the seven branched candlestick the candles shall be lighted from right to left as viewed from the chapter circle when the room is darkened save for the light of the taper the consul continues consul ou will now hear the names of the seven founders of the sigma chi fraternity and the reasons why we honor them the pro consul lights the first candle having done so and after pause for the candle to be in full flame the consul shall pronounce in solemn voice the name benjamin piatt runkle all all honor to his name if desired the founders parts may be delivered by members of the chapter other than the consul consul as student at

lived to become generalr i tua lritualistic statutes 76in the founders parts each of the seven attributes is ascribed to the founder who exemplifies that v irtue most completelythis tie should stantly be kept in mind during rehearsals let brother who undertakes the obligation of strong performance of founders part assume he need not rehearse t deliver the printed word aloud requires constant practice to be familiar with the thoughts expressed so well in our ritual each part demands understanding dignity and depth of feeling the speaker must be inspired by the words of each tribute and convey that inspiration to the candidates that is interpretive abilitythe ability to transfer the full thought and emotional contents of the writing and make it live each can didate must see clearly the magnificent contribution each founder gave us the brother rendering the part is representing sigma chi in that role the qualities the candidates hear in his voice are attributed to the fraternity after the lighting of each candle the consul is careful to pause until the candle is burning brightly before the calling of the name of the founder memorization as in all other parts of the ritual with the exception of the obligation which must be read for absolute accuracy memorization is essential to an exemplary performance founding parts if seven men are assigned to give the founders parts it is appropriate to have them seated in their robes toward the front of the chapter room near either side of the consul as the name of each founder is called the broth er assigned steps forward and

from one common standard the union of the arms with the standard is emblematic of the strength of your character when endowed with the virtues we emulater i tua lritualistic statutes 82the three greataims the three great aims may be delivered by chapter member other than the consul the usual course is to permit the annotator to make the presentation much of the discussion on the delivery of the seven v irtues applies to the proper presentation of the three great aims the part is as difficult to memorize as it is for the speaker to deliver and understand along with complete understanding of the content it is necessary for the speaker to emphasize the full meaning with comparatively slow pace while none of the parts of the investiture carries any superfluous wordage here is great abundance of information in very few words so it must be delivered slowly and deliberately the last paragraph is brilliant and precise summary of the content of both the seven v irtues and the three great aims it needs special toucha careful pointingup dramatic pause at the close of this recita tion will give the candidates chance to be impressed let them digest it for moment before the appearance of constantine83the three great aims this portion may be delivered by chapter member other than the consul consul the three great aims of this fraternity are friendship justice and learning they contain the elements of complete per sonality for friendship is the noblest expression of our m t i n s justice must dominate every decision of the w i l l and learning is the goal of every trained i n t l l c t these have been the great aims of our fraternity from its begin ning the trials to which our founders were subjected bound them together in an unusually close and enduring f r i n d s h i p the incep tion of sigma chi was protest against injustice in their college life all of our founders were proficient as students and most of them entered the learned professions the seven virtues which we emulate are closely related to these three great aims courtesy and fidelity are noble expressions of true friendship courage and integrity must ever characterize our sense of justice wisdom and selfcontrol will follow learning while these three great aims are true goals of high m b i t i n r i tua lritualistic statutes 84constantine constantine should represent man just past middle age with graying hair who still has the vibrancy of leader articles needed for his makeup are 1 spirit gum 2 stick of grease paint 3 braided gray hair yard lasts long time 4 brown professional eyeshadow pencil 5 jar of cold cream 6 facial tissue 7 white talcum powder 8 scissors most of these items can be obtained in any drug store other items can be obtained from the drama department of the college or any reliable theatri cal or costuming agency the first step in makeup is the light application of cold cream to all exposed areas of constantine except the areas of the face where the beard is to be applied these areas include the exposed parts of the legs backs of hands and lower forearm forehead nose and cheeks the next step is the coloring of these areas with the 19 grease pencil to enhance the effect of strength and maturity shading is effected by physically wrinkling the fore head and drawing light lines in the wrinkles with the brown eyeshading pencil lines should be drawn above and below the eyelids and also from the lower side of the nose to the end of the lips maturity can be achieved in the hands by drawing three light lines from knuckle to wrist the hair may be made to appear gray by brushing it with the white talcum powder the final step is the application of the beard cut off about two inches of the braided hair pull it gently apart until it is spread out thinly and even lythen cut it with scissors into three equal parts apply spirit gum to the beard area of the face and give it minute or two to become tacky then apply the beardone portion on either side and one on the chin pressing them together small strips can be placed in the mustache area additional strips of hair placed over the eyebrows add to the maturity of the face allow the spirit gum to dry then trim the beard with scissors it should look welltrimmed rather than bushy history tells us that constantine kept his soldiersbeards trimmed to length of about one and onehalf inches following the ceremony the beard can be pulled and saved it may be used several times makeup and spirit gum may be removed by applying cold creamritualistic statutes 85since constantine is depicted as man in the prime of life still pos sessed of full physical powers there is need for cane staff or other aid to walking it is constantine thus represented who walks before the initiates at the proper time if mobile scene is used the four hooded coffinbearers should have makeup applied to the exposed parts of the legs feet and hands as described above the scene two types of scene presentations may be usedthe fixed scene or the movable scene the movable scene consists of four brothers in hooded robes carrying the coffin and skeleton slowly into the center of the semi circle of initiates where the coffin is placed on the floor within easy view of all initiates each of the four coffinbearers carries candle two of the brothers kneel at the foot and head of the coffin respectively in an attitude of deep contemplation their left elbows resting on the coffin while their left hands support their foreheads the two kneeling brothers at the same time place their floor candles near the coffin so as to light up the scene the two remaining pallbearers march slowly to either side of the officers turn and stand facing the scene with heads bowed and with their candles held aloft as soon as the four brothers are in the position described above constantine makes his entrance the four pallbearers remain in the same position throughout constantines presence upon his exit the pallbearers return slowly to the coffin and transport it from the room to achieve the greatest effect the entire sequence may be accompanied by appropriate music see section on ritualistic music if fixed scene is used it may be constructed on either side of the offi cers but not visible to the initiates while they are standing before the consul the coffin should rest under canopy of black cloth in front of the canopy should be hung curtains which divide in the center and which can be drawn aside by two brothers dressed in black gown and hood who stand at each side holding back the curtains while the scene is exposed the fixed scene should be illuminated by two candles placed in the floor stands so as to provide effective lighting soft spotlight is also very effec tive near the foot of the coffin one of the brothers should kneel in an atti tude of deep contemplation his left elbow resting on the coffin while the hand supports his forehead the right hand may also rest upon the coffin being extended toward its head in the case of the fixed scene the curtains are not closed until after the obligationritualistic statutes 86the illumination of the white cross should be suspended above the scene and so placed as to be visible to the initiate when he opens his eyes and while kneeling as directed in the address in the case of mobile scene the white cross may be suspended above and behind the consuls station the appearance of constantine the part of constantine can make or break the entire ceremony the constantine part expresses ritual thesis established by the crusaders that when man makes his vows to credo of an organization and takes an oath of lifelong duration there must be in that ceremony recognition that death will ultimately come this death theme is represented by the scene the portrayal also contains the admonition that the advice of older men should be heeded that true friendship is timeless and that the fleet ing character of human life makes imperative that we strive to live up to our ideals to the best of our ability extreme care must be exercised in the selection of brother to portray constantine here is one of the truly magnificent roles in the ritualistic world if there is an undergraduate in your chapter who can present this role with the dramatic maturity it requires you are indeed fortunate if such is not the case an alumnus can undoubtedly be found who can pres ent the characterization properly constantine should be instructed that slow and deliberate pacing is the keynote t add age to his voice he should not try to lower the vocal place ment or constrict the throat age is best achieved by complete relaxation of the throat muscles and softening of the tone at times almost to whis per never try to give the voice shaky quality it is improper for the brother portraying constantine to yell any portion of the speech it is improper for constantine to use cane or any other paraphernalia not prescribed in the ritual or ritualistic statutes constantine is man who speaks from the experience of his some fifty years he has come to believe and is reflective as he speaks he is sol dier strong virile and the epitome of dignity the imperative quality of the early parts of his message gradually tempers through the somber gray words of the second paragraph to the warmth of his thoughts on friendship as the white cross appears it is different man whom we see this is convert the man whose devotion to the cross grew from transcendent moment which he now recalls the new life which accompanies belief in the cross now flows through constantine he loses himself in the inspira87r i tua l the appearance of constantine consul in order that you may still better understand the meaning and importance of the seven virtues and the three great aims of this f r t r n i t i shall now call upon our ancient patron the emperor constantine to give you further light may you profit by his teachings the consul extends his hand and looks toward the place where constantine is to appear constantine appears at the scene the seven lights are left burning until after the obligation constantine hear the words of one who in his own day was mighty i constantine the emperor address you that i may enlist your lifelong devotion to my cause ou have taken vows of eternal friendship and manly honor let your friendship be endur ing and your life beyond reproach the light of the scene is turned on the candidates are in position where they may clearly see the scene observe these emblems of mortality in the chill arms of death we must all at last repose the young the strong the buoyant the happy and the beautiful must all like the weak the poor and the wretched succumb at last but we are taught that he who nobly lives may nobly die an honest man the noblest work of god ashort pause remember now thy creator in the days of thy youth before the evil days come and the years draw nigh when thou shalt say i have pleasure in them before the sun and the light and the moon and the stars are darkened and man goeth to his everlasting home and the mourners go about the streets before the silver cord is loosed or the golden bowl is broken or the pitcher is broken at the foun tain or the wheel broken at the cistern and the dust returneth to the earth as it was and the spirit returneth to god who gave it ashort pauseritualistic statutes 88tion of his revelation and as his words build to powerful climax the rheostatically controlled transparency becomes brighter and brighter his voice is powerful but steady as he speaks his final words after constantine retires and the recorded music has reached its cli mactic end dramatic pause is very effective give the candidates time to absorb this inspirational experience before proceeding with the ceremony89r i tua l atrue friend unbosoms freely advises justly assists readily adventures boldly takes all patiently defends courageously and continues friend unchangeable death cannot kill what never dies nor can spirits ever be divided that love and live in friendship this is the comfort of friends that though they may be said to die yet their friendship and society are in the best sense ever present because immortal ashort pause you will fall upon your knees close your eyes and engage in silent prayer to almighty god while the candidates kneels with bowed heads the white cross appears constantine points to the cross lift your eyes heavenward and look when disaster was immi nent in my despair i was inspired to forsake the gods of stone i besought the god of the christians for mercy in answer to my prayer the white cross appeared unto in the heavens and an angel said thou shalt make representation of the sign thou hast seen of gold and precious stones shalt thou make it it shall be thine emblem and the emblem of thy followers henceforth and forevermore amen amen constantine retires consul you will arise in the presence of this scene which conveys its own somber lesson to every sensitive heart and intelli gent mind and after i charge you that this fraternity is banded together for the practice of pure and steadfast friendship toward every worthy brother until death of strict justice to all men for the acquirement and diffusion of true learning and for the practice of the seven v irtues of which we have learned and that this requires more of you than the world requires of other men is it still your desire to become member of this fraternity knowing that your obligations are of lifelong duration the candidates must make an affirmative answer90ritualistic statutes the obligation the practice by some chapters and at special fraternity events of having all brothers present stand and recite the obligation along with the candi dates renewing their obligations is authorized and encouraged 91consul friends kneel upon your right knee place your left hand upon your left breast raise your right hand and repeat after the obligation to insure absolute accuracy this obligation may be read i repeat your name of my own free will before the allseeing eye of almighty god and in the presence of this chapter do sincerely promise and solemnly swear that i will keep inviolably secret everything connected with my initiation and all that is contained in the ritual and ritualistic statutes of this fraternity also each and every secret

beautiful presentation of the badge speech he leaves his station followed by the pro consul who bears the tray upon which the badges have been appropriately arranged unless the chapter has arranged to have quantity of badges available for this purpose it is cus tomary for each big brother to allow the little brother initiate to wear his badge if the latter is the case the pro consul should take care to arrange the badges in such way as to assure that each initiate shall be pinned with the badge of his big brother the consul takes position before the initi ate highest in seniority who is stationed at the left of the semicircle as viewed by the consul and pins the badge on each candidate in descend ing order of seniority the pro consul stands to the consuls left holding the tray within easy reach and in the case of each initiate indicates to the consul which badge is to be pinned in reciting the famous badging line to each of the new brothers the consul should use care in not varying the intonation of the sentence as he proceeds from brother to brother as the consul badges each brother he does not give the new brother the fraternal grip this is not possible since the new brother has not as yet been instructed in the matter of the grip for emphasis however he may place his right hand on the left shoulder of the initiate as he speaks his words in order to expedite the pinning ceremony it is not necessary for the consul to lock the clasp of each badge as it is placed on the breast of the new brother it is sufficient to merely clasp the pin without locking it later at the close of the initiation ceremony the consul may instruct the new brothers to fasten the pins securely if any of the new initiates has close relative in such as father or broth er it is entirely appropriate to invite him to pin the badge in such an event the consul should instruct the brother as to the appropriate words to be said as the pinning takes place then as the consul comes to an initiate who is to be pinned by his father or brother the consul may merely step aside and call forth the member who is to have the honor of pinning the badge on his or brother93the presentation of the badge consul the great moment of your life has come w are about to place upon your breast the white cross of sigma chi and you are about to learn the significance of our beautiful emblem t wear it worthily will require an exercise of all the good qualities of your character and all the strength of your manhood to the world it will identify you as sigma chi to your brothers it will have deeper meaning standing for the noble qualities of your heart when they see the white cross upon your breast they will believe you to be true brave honest and full of that brother ly love taught by the christ of whom our badge reminds us your quest for the white cross was symbolic mission that you were caused to undertake for your own good you did not find what you sought you may never find it sigma

life which ought to be so conducted that you will always be finding what is noblest and best in your interview others put severe ques tions to you henceforth you will have to be the judge of your own faithfulness in seeking what is worthy the cross is the emblem of sacrifice let it remind you that achievement is accomplished without both sacrifice and service and that only as the cross quers in your heart can you attain the ideals for which it stands until this time the badges which are to be presented have been kept from view the pro consul now produces them arranged upon suitable tray and bears them to the consul the consul shall take the badges singly from the tray placing one upon the left breast of each initiate and saying to each consul my brother may you wear this cross through life without soiling the purity of its whiteness or dimming the luster of its gold the consul returns to his stationr i tua lritualistic statutes 94the explanation of the badge this lecture may be delivered by member of the chapter other than the consul it is customary that this person be the pro consul since the illu mination of the badge is located near him his delivery should be slow and distinct pausing frequently to indicate the appropriate emblems on the badge which he is describing the explanation of the grand seal since the illumination of the grand seal is situated near the annotator it is appropriate for him to deliver this brief lecture95the explanation of the badge the representation of the badge is illuminated at this point consul or may be delivered by another chapter member observe now this representation of the cross you wear and give heed to the meaning of its emblems the badge of this fraternity is the sigma chi cross of gold indicating true worth the arms of white enamel are emblematic of the purity of our motives and the high sense of honor which should characterize all our actions the black enamel surrounding the letters in the center of the badge reminds us of the secrecy which guards the mottoes for which the letters stand upon the upper arm are crossed keys emblematic of our duty to unlock the secrets of learning and of the access of each to his brothers heart upon the right arm is an eagles head emblem atic of our lofty aspirations upon the left arm is scroll typifying our literary character upon the lower arm are clasped hands denoting friendship and seven stars indicating the perpetuity of our union and the equality and brotherhood of our chapters the chains connecting the right and left arms with the top of the cross teach us that we are bound by double obligation for the duties which we owe to the chapter and to the fraternity at large are equally imperative as the absence of one chain destroys the symmetry of the badge so the neglect of either obligation will mar your character as sigma chi the explanation of the grand seal the representation of the seal is illuminated at this point consul or may be delivered by another chapter member r u n d the circumference of the grand seal is the name of our fraternity the numerals 1855 represent the year of our origin the seven stars indicate the perpetuity

magnificence of the charge can only be conveyed as the consul speaks with sincerity and understanding t deliver the charge is challenge the supreme idea in its delivery is personal contact every effort should be made to convince each initiate that he is being addressed personally this is best achieved by the consul leaving his station and descending to the center of the semicircle of candidates before beginning strong vocal projection is not necessary as to pace the charge should not be delivered in less than three min utes three and half minutes is better and it is possible to deliver the charge in three and threequarter minutes without dragging in part of the investiture is there more vibrant and dynamic line than bidding you godspeed my brother i greet you forever in the sacred bonds of sigma chi that line admits of temporal quality in sigma chi the brothers are greeted forever its great emotional value will be realized if the delivery pace is overemphasized injecting sense of finalitythat one line carries the impact of many thoughts into the mind of the initiate he will never forget this great moment if the charge has been delivered with inspiration each new

and then the consul steps forward to congratulate each of the new brothers here for the first time he may extend the fraternal grip to the new brothers if he should so desire the consul may repeat the last line of the charge to each brother as he extends the grip this is not the time for congratulations of the new members by the older brothers closing as prescribed in the ritual the new brothers are then led to their proper places in the circle by the magister this means that the man lowest in order of initiation should sit on the extreme right of the consul as viewed by the chapter and the man highest in order of seniority should sit next to the brother who was last in the order before the investiture when all new brothers have assumed their places in the circle the consul closes the cer emony with the ritualistic closing prescribed for regular chapter meet ing for the good of sigma chi and the chapter is not used in initiation the consul passes around the circle commencing with the annotator giving each brother the fraternal grip and saying i seek true friendship and receiving the response you find it here after the consul has pro ceeded around the entire circle he shall resume his place the consul shall be followed closely by the annotator whom the brothers shall follow secutively in the order of their seating each greeting in turn the remaining members of the circle after all the brothers have passed the pro consul who has been the last in the circle they should return to their places during the friendship circle of the closing ceremony it is entirely appropriate for the older brothers to congratulate the new brothers brothers changing into regular clothes from the initiation regalia should do so in an adjoining room and not in the presence of alumni and newly initiated brothers105remember too that the bond is reciprocal t you we have com mitted the care of our reputation and our honor is in your keeping the stain of dishonor will blacken not your character

for which each candidate has striven so long has become reality he is now member of sigma chi wearing upon his breast the white cross the emblem of lifelong sacred trust this calls for celebration the initiation banquet to accomplish number of impor tant purposes 1 to honor the new initiates this is their big moment the spotlight should be on them arrange to seat them at the head table each should be invited to give brief word of response to the occasion if he so desires 2 to express appreciation to those brothers who worked long and hard to make the initiation success this is often overlooked the toastmas ter should recognize all who participated including alumni 3 to issue new challenge adistinguished alumnus should be invited to give brief address he should stress to the new brothers that being able to wear the white cross carries with it the challenge to be ever seeking new horizons in the endless search for what is noblest and best the responsibility which comes with wearing the white cross should also be emphasized 4 to enjoy great fellowship the past weeks leading to the ritualistic cli max have been filled with hard work and anticipation now is the time for genuine relaxation l rge delegation of alumni in attendance will not only add to the fellowship but will also help to cement activealumni relations tips to the steward and social chairman 1 invite alumni guest speaker and special guests well in advance work with the ritual committee on this 2 dont make this just another meal dress up the food and have dec orations on the tables to suit this special occasion 3 provide small printed banquet program listing the new initiates officers initiation functionaries and the guest speaker these programs are particularly appreciated by the new initiates and alumni 4 do not fail to invite sigma chi fathers brothers or close relatives of any new initiates they have been known to journey hundreds of miles to be on hand in your invitation suggest congratulatory letter or telegram to the initiate in the event the relative cannot make it these can be given out during the banquet 5 write thankyou notes to all alumni who attended this is not only good alumni relations but an expression of common courtesy107ritualistic closing consul brothers the time of closing is at hand as we sepa rate let us resolve anew to wear the white cross worthily

r i tua lritualistic statutes 108orientation of the new initiaties one of the primary purposes of pledge training indoctrination and initiation is to make deep and lasting impression upon the candidate of the tremendous personal responsibility he must accept as member of the f r t r n i t as many active brothers may recall pledge days were often days of little responsibility for the actual administration and government of the c h p t r consequently some fail to realize that to be initiated means to be c h rged with greater responsibility sometimes it takes over year for the active man to come to the realization that part of the responsibility for run ning the chapter is on his shoulders this shift of responsibility must be i m p ressed upon the candidate not only before and during the initiation but also at repeated intervals ther f t r it is vital to convince the new initiates that the acquirement of our badge although an achievement in itself is only symbol that our work for the fraternity and the search for the ideals of the white cross have just begun immediate obligations as soon as feasible following the initiation meeting should be called with the new initiates for ritualistic instruction such meeting could conve niently be called just prior to the regular chapter meeting the pro consul should be present to give instruction on the challenge rehearsing the new brothers until all are proficient the consul should give instruction on entering and leaving the chapter meeting and the ritualistic opening and closing to provide the new brothers with proper understanding and respect for the ritual and the obligations they have assumed the consul should assign to the new brothers the memorization required by the ritual and should insist that they be recited to him or the magister with profi ciency within period of 30 days under circumstances shall penalties for failure to fulfill memorization requirement be imposed in less than thir ty days and confiscation of the initiation badge shall not be used as penalty in these requirements instruction should also be given regarding general conduct in the chapter meeting literary exercises and for the good of sigma chi and the chapte r first chapter meeting every effort should be made to make the first chapter meeting following the initiation model meeting for the benefit of the new brothers the spirit of the initiation should be read during the literary exercises and dis cussed the consul or regularly assigned brother should recite the charge at the close of the meeting the new brothers should be promptly assigned to appropriate committees or duties to hasten their feeling of fullfledged responsible membership109ritualistic statutes 110the ritual historical perspective the ritual of our fraternity is the fundamental statement of the ideals that characterize our brotherhood each of the ceremonial forms has definite purpose in portraying those ideals to the initiate an understanding of the historical background and purpose of each ceremony as it appears in the ritual is the key to an understanding of sigma chi the chapter meeting the chapter meeting is an important part of the ritual the manner and content of the meeting is prescribed exactly one may ask why it is neces sary since early times history has left long line of ritual meetings from the early druids rites of osiris of the egyptians the roman senate jewish law and the early christians later it continued with such diverse groups as the rites of knighthood the kivas of the american indians the masons knights of columbus and so on mankind has constantly found that group must be organized and do the various things that are unique to itself before it developes unity of purpose and action that is why meeting contains certain arrangement type of opening challenges spec ified parts of the meeting and closure the ritual has further specified that all regular meetings be ritual meetings in the early years of our fraternity the order of operation for meetings was included in the bylaws of each individual chapter the rap code order of seating formal opening order of business literary exercises and for mal closing were all long established when they became part of the ritual in 1870 gradually these forms were elaborated upon until they assumed their present form in 1930 the black supper the publication of the first magisters manual in 1935 marked the begin ning of the modern era of enlightened pledge training which was sup posed to have put an end to physical hazing but in fact merely modified its form the era of initiation week activities of physical and mental haz ing created need to have an introductory ceremony which would impress the initiate with the seriousness of the ritual to follow the answer was the black supper which had been devised in the 1920s for just that purpose in 1935 it was included in the ritual as an optional ceremony and in 1952ritualistic statutes 111it was formally adopted as part of the ritual it now serves as ceremoni introduction to the initiation the quest in the years around the turn of the century due to the limited size of chap ter houses it was necessary to have the candidates leave the house while preparations were made for the investiture in order that the candidates would not return too soon they were usually sent out to find something that was not there it was under these circumstances that the search for the white cross began in 1915 the quest became the impossible mission for which the candi date was put on trial in the examination but as the examination evolved away from trial situation the quest evolved into the symbolic mission that it now represents the interview starting with the close of the civil w ar fraternity initiations began to get rough and became increasingly violent in the decade around the turn of the century three deaths occurred during fraternity initiations these received wide news coverage fortunately none was in our fraternity these deaths motivated our change in ritual practice with the idea that we should substitute dignified mental tests for the traditional mans inhu manity to man on the basis that the viciousness could not be reconciled with the ideals of the investiture to follow the substitute was the preliminary initiation into the greek w orld which was designed to relieve the need to do physical harm to the candi dates by making the mental tests severe individually each candidate was put through an elaborate examination in setting of the classical under world however the initiation into the greek world required considerable study and practice for its mastery this resulted in proposals for further revision at the grand chapter of 1915 at this time the quest and examination were substituted for the initiation into the greek w orld in the first examination the worthiness of the candidate was discounted because of his inability to find the white cross and only after serious deliberation was he allowed to continue in his initiation it was found bet ter adapted to the needs of the chapters as the mental test desired to be sub stituted for horseplay and unlawful excess and possessed the advantage over the greek world idea that it was built directly upon the funda mental ideals of the fraternityritualistic statutes 112the examination procedure was again reviewed in 1935 1937 and 1946 by which time it evolved away from trial situation as had been provided since its origin in the 1915 ritual to process in which the can didate would measure himself by the jordan standard and realize sym bolic mission in his quest for the white cross in 1952 the word examination was discarded in favor of interview the cleansing in 1876 the cleansing was added as prelude to the initiation the ques tions which now appear in the ceremony had previously been used in the ritualistic procedure of interviewing the candidate prior to his formal ini tiaton but now these were united with the symbolic cleansing of thoughts and moments of reflection in its original form skull and crossed bones were displayed on the cleansing table and viewed by the candidate as he participated in the ceremonythey were transferred to the investiture with the adoption of the 1886 ritual and later became part of the appearance of constantine the cleansing serves the purpose of removing from the candidates mind the fear that he will not be initiated so that he can approach the investiture with clear mind it assumed its present form after the addition of the prayers in 1909 and 1930 the investiture the investiture being the climax is the most important part of our initia tion it contains the unbroken continuity of the idealism set down by the founders in the first ritual in the founders era the entire initiation sisted of short ceremonial containing the same basic elements as our present investiture the formal entrance of the candidate the vouching the obligation the three aims the enrolment the charge and the expla nations of the mottoes the badge the seal and the grip all had their origin in our earliest rituals changes have come about in an evolutionary manner of which the c h rge is typical example in 1855 the highest honor on the miami cam pus was to be acclaimed the outstanding extemporaneous orator our first ritual gave an opportunity to practice this art it stated in its text at the clusion of the ceremonies of initiation here the consul shall deliver to the initiate an extemporaneous address which shall be both commendatory and admonitory in the minutes of grand chapters following 1857 we find requests by the ritual committee chairmen that consuls send outlines of the address they had given at these grand chapters some of the addressritualistic statutes 113es were read and met with approval sometime around 1868 or earlier the c h rge quite similar in outline as it is today was written by chapter consul in 1872 it was adopted as the charge to be used in all chapters until 1909 the investiture remained very much the simple but complete ceremony that it was in the first years of our fraternity the enlightenment the delineation of the lives of the seven founders the sevenbranched can dlestick the appearance of constantine and the presentation of the badge are the important enrichments of our ceremonial which were given to our fraternity in 1909 these features met demand for somewhat more extended and complete ceremony of initiation under the circumstances of n l rging classes of initiates and the entire evening of session desired to be devoted to the initiation ceremony with the presence of many alumni for the occasion there had been tendency to supplement the lack of more extended ceremony with outside and improperly related activities it was believed that the whole initiation must be made more adequately impres sive and meaningful under the changing and complicated conditions of stu dent life on the modern campus all this was new development in the era which led to the revision of 1909 the addition of the enlightenment and the presentation of the badge served to enhance the ease of operation and functional completeness of the ceremony the seven founders parts and the sevenbranched candlestick are elab orations on the ideals of the fraternitytheir adoption grew out of the feel ing that the time had come when the fraternity could develop suitable symbolism from its own growth and history the appearance of constantine serves to unite the death thesis that entered into our ritual several years earlier and the heritage behind the white cross and in hoc signo v inces an 1870 revision of the ritual pro vided that the emblems of mortality be displayed at the consuls station thus to be in full view of the candidate as he was obligated the 1870 revi sors of the ritual were apparently aware of the common ritualistic practice of having death thesis in that when man takes an oath of lifelong dura tion he must recognize that death will eventually come in 1876 the emblems were transferred to the cleansing where they were used in much the same way in 1886 they were again transferred back to the investiture to scene which was displayed aside from the officer stations here the emblems were accompanied by short speech which was used in 1909 to form the present constantine sequence of the investiture it is interesting to note that founder daniel william cooper was opposed to the constantine part if it were to conform to the interpretationritualistic statutes 114of man resurrected from the dead he believed that constantine should be portrayed as man full of life with an appeal to young men since this is first young mans fraternity minor refinements were made in the investiture until it assumed its present form in 1930 other ceremonies the service in memorium and the form for the installation of chapters became part of the ritual in 1909 the ritualistic forms for grand chapter founders day and chapter house dedication were included in 1930 each has purpose in providing fitting ceremonial for designated occasion the regalia the first regalia as provided for in 1861 was simply black mask for members it was designed to conceal the identity of the brothers until the candidate assumed his obligation after which the masks were removed full robes became more popular in the 1860s in this era the purpose for the use of regalia began to change it now served as function of enhanc ing the decorum of the initiation in 1870 representation of the skull and crossed bones was to appear on member robes as an indication of the death thesis which entered into the investiture at that time our present regalia was first used in 1909 its design met the demand for more elab orate and extended form of initiation all the way through the history of revisions the aim has been suffi ciently unified complete and extended document for groups of college men bound together by ties thus sought to be indissoluble and of lifelong duration all revisions have sought only to interpret the immortal work of the seven founders to the ever growing number of young men to cross our threshold each year the ritual is fundamental statement of the aims and ideals of the fraternity and of the truths which it seeks to exalt in its published form the ritual exemplifies our initiatory and other ceremonies by which these aims ideals and truths are sought to be impressed when membership is first conferred and subsequently all these ceremonial forms however are meaningless except as the ideals and aims which they exemplify are impressed upon the hearts and lives of those who become wearers of our white cross the success of all ceremonials must be measured by the extent to which they make the truth they portray part of ones character and so become lifelong in their influence115division iv grand chapter installation
