performance excitation level acceleration ratio and efficiency self excitation boot strapping abstract efficient high performance pulsed alternator pa systems have low impedance field windings that rely on very fast current rise times in order to maintain attractive system efficiencies these systems rely on positive feed back selfexcitation or bootstrapping action to energize the field winding th selfexcitation process is typi cally started by small capacitor based power supply which is discharged or seed ed directly into the field winding the design of this power supply often called the field initia tion module fim is criti cally important to the process of selfexcitation augmented by numerical simulations this paper examines the important aspects to consider when designing proper fim including impact on system efficiency minimum rotor speed for proper fim function control schemes for triggering the fim proper operating voltage for the fim introduction aircore pulsed alternators pas with or without compensation rely on selfexcited very high mmf field windings to provide excitation as pa designs mature toward higher energy and power densities the re sulting power required to charge the field windings efficiently has also increased field charging power levels exceeding 300 mw have been demonstrated 1 1 center for electromechanic s the university of texas austin

in the laboratory and future designs far exceeding this level of charging power are expected an external dc power source is not practical so pas must rely on the selfexcitation process to energize the field windings the role of the fim then becomes apparent it energizes the field winding with some minimal level of current in order to initiate the selfexcitation process the fim is typically small selfcontained cap acitorbased power supply that is tied directly into the field winding when discharged the current in the field winding rise s thus inducing armature voltage the discharge controller then begins to command the field coil converter switches in order to rectify armature currents directly back into the field winding this is positive feedback process and must be carefully controlled this paper inve stigates the design requirements of the fim for efficient pa operation fim model railgun performance simulation based upon th use of pas was constructed within the matlabsimulink environment the specific design of th pa used is tactically uninteresting and based upon previous studies 2 3 4 conducte d at the center for electromechanics of the university of texas at austin utcem the model block representing the fim of typical pa is shown in figure 1 because versi on 6 of matlab does not permit modeling pre charged capacitor the capacitor model is charged dynamically at the beginning of the simulation in practice the fim capacitor is typically prech arged for the first shot before or during rotor motoring and charged dynamically by th field winding for burst operation referring to the circuit shown in figure 1 there is currentlimiting resistor 014 ω in series with 7 kv voltage source the value of the dc voltage source wa s varied to provide in this case 45 kv

ther will typically be series im pedance between the seed capacitor eml 205 cem 413 distribution authorized to us go vernment agencies and their contractors only 3 and the field winding as discussed

losses tailed above are roughly 300 kj for the study pa simulated results indicated value within 05 of the calculated losses meanwhile the simulation predicted total of 113 mj of tota l field energy losses so that the charging cycle accounts for about 25 of the total field losses the seed current was reduced to 5 ka and figures 5 and 6 show the results although the charging time increased from 16 ms to 23 ms the sses remained about the same this is borne out by the strong exponential in the cycle as figure 7 shows at 1 ka seed current the losses are still about 300 kj what is happening is that th time to achieve the desired field is very much extended ultimately this could result in an undesirable feel for the gunner and an undesirable increase in brush drag heating nd wear the results from

rotor speed voltage issues rotor speed is another important aspect in lecting the proper seed current level once again the main purpose of the fim is to provide seed current to the field winding so that the pa can begin the selfe xcitation process and as discussed bove it is strong function of rotor speed in general the pa can provide pow er to launch other wervelocity rounds from diminished speeds in addition for subsystem commissioning and maintenance mode purposes utcem engineers routinely operate the pa at much reduced speed based upon these factors minimum operating speed of approxi mately 50 of the pa design full speed is recommended the next issue is the minimum voltage require d from the pa to ini tiate excitation this depends somewhat on the bus line impedances and fi eld coil converter fcc characteristics eml 205 cem 413 distribution authorized to us go vernment agencies and their contractors only 7 again experience with these systems has led ut cem engineers to conc lude that there should be at least 25 v across each thyristor in the f cc to commence the selfexcitation voltages less than 25 v when combined with particular gate im pulses have resulted in faulty turnon of scrs during testing according to figure 2 at 6000 rpm the st udy pa still has st rong positive charging coefficient of 54 to study the effectiveness of this 200 µf capacitor charged to 5 kv was used in the simulation the resul ting voltage profile and start of re ctification is shown in figures 8 and 9 note that the rectification was timed to occur very near the peak seed current location otherwise this should be vali d seed current design point figure 8 voltage vs time from 200 µf cap 5kv discharging into study pa at 6000 rpm eml 205 cem 413 distribution authorized to us go vernment agencies and their contractors only 8 figure 9 field current vs time from 299 µf fim event of figure 8 self excitation and control scheme in the simulation results the fim discharge was set so that the pa had switch trigger that occurred near the peak of the seed current cy cle this meant that for such low seed current impulse the controller would have to consider the speed of the machine and the time of the fim discharge event so that phase trigger signal coincided at or ju st after the peak of the seed current profile while this is certainly possibl it does add level of complexity into the controller design and software in previous pa systems the start of the lfexcitation process was passive ie the seed current pulse was of long enough duration so that pha trigger always occurr ed at or just after peak current was observed at 6000 rpm phase is available to be triggered every 125 ms for reliable triggering random pha of the seed current impulse must last for more that 25 ms for the simulation that produced figures 10 and 11 the capacitance was set at 2500 µf at 5 kv charge the phase 4 trigger quence occurs just before peak current and phase 1 is then able to initiate the boots trapping sequence at the 3 ka field current level as stated above this value is at the bottom range of th desired starting voltage it should also be mentioned that the circuit parameters of the fim itself can be adjusted to optimize the pulse width and current delivered to the field coil in order to minimize the eml 205 cem 413 distribution authorized to us go vernment agencies and their contractors only 9 capacitance required there are additional tradeoffs to be considered if fim adjustment is to be implemented however if very low capacitan ce is required approaching 10 of the value defined earlier control modification would finitely be warranted figure 10 seed current for 2500 µf and 5 kv figure 11 phase 4 and 1 fcc trigger points from the results of this simulation it can be concluded that there is strong dependence on the size of the fim with the control scheme selected minimizing seed capacitance would seem to necessitate adapting smart control algorithm to time the phase sequencing with the fim discharge eml 205 cem 413 distribution authorized to us go vernment agencies and their contractors only 10 fim charge voltage levels utcem engineers recommend charge voltage commensurate with the maximum charge voltage of the field wi nding capacitorstored energy is strong function of voltage but there is also an inherent operati onal fault protection advantage to be gained by using this voltage level when the properly designed fim is discharged into the field winding the capacitor voltage is seen instantly across th field winding if there is br ush or insulation issue at this stage the fault can be detected early and the discharge terminated with minimal risk to the generator and its subcomponents the voltage across the field windi ng for the case of 2500 µf fim discharge is shown in figure 12 figure 12 field volts during 2500 µf 5kv fim discharge simulation verification the 200 µf fim case was loaded into the perfor mance simulation for the study pa to make sure the assumptions proved to be adequa figure 13 shows the difference between field charging characteristics in the two cases 2500 and 200 µf the results verify that lower seed current will result in longer charging durations for the field winding figure 14 compares the eml 205 cem 413 distribution authorized to us go vernment agencies and their contractors only 11 two rotor energies extracted duri ng discharge and demonstrates that there is little net difference produced by using the lower seed current in fa ct the lower seed current case shows slightly less net energy used because the initial shot phasing was slightly different based on different seed starting points time did not permit correcting this descrepancy for the purpose of the study and it was felt that identifying the general trend was more important figure 13 current comparisons from simulation for 4500 µf and 200 µf seed capacitors figure 14 rotor energy comparison for 4500 µf and 200 µf seed capacitors conclusions and recommendations this paper addressed the general design guide lines of the fim for any generic pa design the guidelines can be summarized as followi ng and were verified through simulation 1 the fim should be designed so that the pas can bootstrap from half of the rotor full design speed 2 the fim should be sized so that minimum of 25 v appear s across all scrs located in the fcc 3 the fim seed capacitor size depends heavily on what control scheme is utilized passive or calculated controlled timed fim discharge items 2 and 3 are interdependent and must be considered jointly for successful design eml 205 cem 413 distribution authorized to us go vernment agencies and their contractors only 12 acknowledgement this research was funded by the us army and
