congress as whole became less vocal and less legislatively active on chinarelated issues the reasons for this could not be attributed to any resolution of entrenched bilateral policy differencessuch as those long held over human rights or on taiwans statusfor these differences still exist and are likely to plague the relationship for the foreseeable future rather other factors and policy trends appeared to be at work these included the post911 shift in us attention to the global war on terror and the war in iraq and series of prc policy preoccupations including wholesale transition to new

there had previously been limit or what that limit may have been initial questions about the safety of imported products from china surfaced in march and april 2007 when an investigation by the us

that chinas economy was severely unbalanced overly dependent on exports and with weak c onsumer spending at home the treasury report prompted renewed calls and legislation in congress for firmer us

artificially cheap and making it harder for us producers to compete us critics of the prcs currency peg charged that the prc unfairly manipulated its currency and they have urged beijing either to raise the rmbs value or to make it freely convertible subject to market forces on july 1 2005 the prc changed this valuation method instead announcing it would follow managed float policy for the rmb using basket of multiple other currencies since then the rmb has appreciated by about 20 against the dollar but this has not been sufficient to assuage ongoing us congressional concerns 17 in the

for several years prc leaders have attempted to restrict and control the scope of web content and access beijings attempts to restrict and police the internet have attracted congressional attention on may 20 2008 for example the senate judiciary human rights subcommittee held hearings to review the actions of us company cisco which reportedly has played role in helping the prc construct an internet monitoring system42 on september 25 2005 china imposed new regulations designed to further limit the type of electronic news and opinion pieces available to the websavvy in china43 among other things the regulations prohibit major search engines from posting their own independent commentary on news stories stipulating that only opinion pieces provided by statecontrolled media may be posted requires internet service providers to record the content times and internet addresses of news information that is published and to provide this information to authorities upon inquiry and in vague terms prohibits certain kinds of content from being posted such as content that undermines state policy or disseminates rumors and disturbs social order 44 the regulations are backed by penalties including fines termination of internet access and possible imprisonment g10g158g150g138g151g561g20g146g144g145g157g156g561 the bush administration generally favored selective intense pressure on individual human rights cases and on rule of law issues rather than the broader approach adopted by previous american administrations there has been little sign that the us position on human rights has had much affect on prc policies although there is growing evidence of increasing social demands within china for greater accountability transparency and responsiveness in government particularly in cases of official corruption and malfeasance g20g142g149g146g144g146g152g158g156g561g8g155g142g142g141g152g150g561 the prc continues to crack down on unauthorized religious groups and to restrict the freedoms of ethnic communities that seek greater religious autonomy much of this repression focuses on what prc officials have classified as illegal religious cults such as the falun gong and the three grades of servants church45 reports about religious freedom in china suggest that state persecution of some religious and spiritual groups will likely continue as long as the chinese communist party perceives these groups to be threatening to its political control however religions in the prc have also attracted increasing numbers of adherents as well in the china section of its most recent annual international religious freedom report released september 19 2008 the us department of state judged chinas record on religious freedom to remain poor and substantially the same as during

early in 2004 chinas new leadership appointed task force to study the countrys demographic trends and their implications for economic development in october 2004 reports surfaced that beijing was considering at least one proposal to eventually scrap the onechild policy because of currently low prc birth rates and the economic implications this has for supporting chinas huge aging population on january 6 2005 the director of chinas national population and family planning commission stated that the government intended to modify criminal law to make it illegal to selectively identify and abort female fetuses 46 there also is growing evidence that citizens of the prc are becoming more assertive about their reproductive rights47 in midmay 2007 news accounts reported violent public protests in guangxi province bobai county over the savage implementation of family planning policies by local authorities including the retroactive imposition of extraordinarily heavy fines and the confiscation or destruction of household goods and food48 the onechild policy has also been mentioned in connection with the sichuan earthquake of may 12 2008 where the widespread destruction of schools meant that

to be thwarted others believe that it is an inevitable phenomenon that needs to be managed as was the 109th congress before it the 110th congress is facing recurring issues involving this emerging debate and how us interests may best be served according to one school of thought chinas economic and political rise in the world is inevitable and needs to be accommodated and managed in this view as china becomes more economically interdependent with the international community it will have greater stake in pursuing stable international economic relationships growing wealth in the prc is likely to encourage chinese society to move in directions that will develop materially betteroff more educated and cosmopolitan populace already these developments have led chinas population to press its government for greater political pluralism and democracytwo key us objectivesand this trend is likely to continue from this perspective us policy should seek to work more closely with the prc not only to encourage these positive longterm trends but to seek ways to mutually benefit by cooperating on important global issues such as the international financial system alternative energy sources climate change and medical advancements ultimately some proponents of accommodation say the united states simply will have to make room for the economic and political appetites of the superpower that china is likely to become viewing the prc as threat or attempting to contain it these proponents say could produce disastrous policy consequences for us interests in addition to possible military conflict with the prc these consequences could include the possibility of creation of greater chinese nationalism with strong antiamerican bias breakdown in prc governance fragmentation of the country itself andor an increasingly isolated united states that the international community may see as out of step with global trends other proponents of the inevitability of chinas rise stress especially the extreme competitive challenges of chinas growing power they say these challenges even if benign pose potentially huge consequences for us global interests beijing officials say this group view the world as statecentered competitive environment where power is respected and prc leaders are determined to use all means at their disposal to increase their nations wealth power and influence militarily muscular china with substantial international economic ties will be able to wield considerable political power that could prompt us friends and allies to make different choices eroding us influence around the world the united states they argue should develop comprehensive strategic plan in order to counter chinas growing power by strengthen its existing regional alliances and making new ones expanding overseas investments sharpening american global competitiveness and maintaining robust military presence in asia and elsewhere as counterweight to growing prc power and influence others in the american policy debate see less benevolent intentions in chinas growing power prc leaders they argue may be portraying thei r growth as peaceful rise with harmful consequences but actually they are biding their time simply conforming to many international norms as strategy while china is still weak in reality these proponents say beijing seeks at least to erode and at best to supplant us international power and influence in conducting their international relations they maintain chinese leaders seek to cause rifts in us alliances create economic interdependence with us friends and arm us enemies despite the statements of support for the us antiterrorism campaign according to this view the prcs repeated violations of its nonproliferation commitments have actually contributed to strengthening nations that harbor global terrorists furthermore they maintain that the prc under its current authoritarian form of government is inherently threat to us interests and that the chinese
