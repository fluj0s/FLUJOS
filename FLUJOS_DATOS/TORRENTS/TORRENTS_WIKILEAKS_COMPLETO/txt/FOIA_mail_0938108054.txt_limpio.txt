thu 23 sep 1999 133414 0400 cc tkarlncdcnoaagov mannvirginiaedu thanks for your comments phil they look quite reasonable and i will seek to incorporate them ill need keiths comments by tomorrow morning my time at the very latest if i am to have time to assess them and incorporate them some important specifics 1 i am definitely using the version of the briffa et series you sent in which keith had restandardized to retain more lowfrequency variability relative to the one shown by briffa et 1998 so already the reconstruction im using is onestep removed from the published series as far as i know and that makes our use of even this series bit tenuous in my mind but im happy to do it and let the reviewers tell us if they see any problem if i understand you correctly there is yet new version of this series that is two steps removed from briffa et 1998 frankly at this stage i think we have to go w what we have please see ian macadams plot when it is availablei think the story it tells isnt all that bad actually for the time being things as you say will change following review anyways 2 one other thingpim actually averse to shortening the section on sediments even if they havent contributed to some of the multiproxy studies they certainly did contribute to overpeck et there are some important results there irrespective of the role of the proxies in multiproxy studies lets again wait for reviews before shortening this 3 we could eliminate the map of the boreholes although i actually think it is essential to see what the contributing spatial sampling and accordingly the potential bias of that sampling in determining global mean temperature actually is so i vote for keeping it for the time being again its an extremity that we can afford to lose if necessary in the end 4 one important note on references we dont have time at this late stage to dig up incomplete citations so youll need to give full citations for any suggested added references eg the villalba paper fyi the crowley and lowery paper is toms ambio paper he observes mean warming of about 05 c since the 17th century giving us yet another datapoint in the scatter of estimates 5 i agree the ranking of centuries is more specific than it needs to be i dont know what i was thinking you sure that didnt come from the text you originally contributed in any case we can eliminate much of it in my opinion too on the whole i have never been under the assumption that you and i would have independently assessed the evidence quite the same way i would hope we would have come up w the same key points and so your comments in that regard are reassuring i feel confident in my ability to defend the science that is presented here so let the reviews fall where they may im sure we will be forced to admit some changes as well as minority viewpoints and alternative interpretations along the way thats what will make this all interesting mike at 0520 pm 92399 0100 phil jones wrote mike here are my thoughts on the text you sent keith will be sending some as well hopefully later today one important aspect keith will address is whether youre using the latest briffa et curve we know youre not but the one with the greater low frequency and therefore much better chance of looking much better with the other two series isnt yet published we know it looks better in plots we have here specifics p1 line 10 say mid19th century rather than the 20th century lines 1820 seems bit too much here with three refs on laminated sediments line 46 add briffa et 1998b to cook1995 p2 line 59 i would suggest changing particularly to the most line 64 i would add reference here to the paper by crowley and kim 1999 in grl july where this aspect is also discussed p3 line 101 i would add argentina as well as chile adding ref to villalba 1990 in qr line 108 change key to vital line 119 have providing to provide there are several instances where the text doesnt read that well i suspect as there are several iterations to go it is not that important yet the coral section is just about the right size now and is justly devoid of references p4 line 151 i would add reference here to morgan and van ommen 1997 seasonality in lateholocene climate from ice core records the holocene 7 3514 this is the law dome core which is the best available with regards to dating in either hemisphere it should be there as with the coral section the ice core section expresses some cautionary notes with regard to dating etc which i think are justified i suspect teh contrast with the treering section will draw some criticism just warning as none of the multiproxy reconstuctions use any sediment information this section seems overlarge and could be reduced p189 centuryscale add in the p5 the borehole section is also bit overlong i dont know whether the map really adds something not that vehement on this with respect to comapring high and low frequency aspects the diagram comparing cet with the uk boreholes is now out ive sent copy to chris it is in jones pd 1999 classics in physical geography revisited manleys cet series progress in physical geography 23 425428 line 245 the is is not needed p6 i still think that reference to raper et 1996 would be good here this models glacier in northern sweden using the northern fennoscandian temperature reconstructions since ad 500 again it shows how low frequency estimate the glacial snout position can be compared with highfrquency temperature reconstruction from trees raper scb briffa kr and wigley tml 1996 glacial change in northern sweden from ad 500 simple geometric model of storglaciaren journal of glaciology 42 341351 line 268 ipcc1996 earlier is it 95 or 96 p 7 line 295 i would like to add my paper in reviews of geophysics in 1999 as that also says that 1998 was likely to be the warmest year of the millennium line 334 i would like to see bradley 1999 i must get copy from ray in venice p79 all need careful read through for english and the arguments at the bottom of p8 i think you make too much of the differences in the ranking of the centuries the boreholes would agree with my series with the 17th being colder than the 19th although they may not be able to resolve the timescales then is the crowley and lowery 1999 the paper toms submitted to ambio ive not commented much on this final section as again i suspect there are many things you will have to justify in the next two sets of reviews on the whole i think most is ok and i support the final paragraph i dont believe the astronomical argument as an explaination over the last 1000 years but we can differ on that i know i would have written this final section 233 somehat differently with different emphases and slants but the basic final conclusion would have been
