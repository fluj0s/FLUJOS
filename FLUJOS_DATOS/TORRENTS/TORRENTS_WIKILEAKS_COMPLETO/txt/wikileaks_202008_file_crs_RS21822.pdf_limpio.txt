for submission by the secretary of defense to the president this report will be update d as necessary introduction through the brac process dod is res ponding to statutory requirements while attempting to transform the us military services the defense base closure and realignment act of 1990 as am ended provides the exclusiv statutory authority and outlines the process for the 2005 round of ba realignment and closure brac 2005 in the united states this authority expires on april 15 2006 in addition to reducing excess capacity of its bases the department of defense through brac 2005 intends to transform its installation infrastructure to coincide with its other transformation initiatives changing an organization created to fight the cold war to one that will provide military security to the united states for the foreseeable future the department of defense has already ta ken significant steps in the process to implement brac 2005 by preparing three ma jor analytical documents list of brac selection criteria force structure plan and comprehensive base inventory the selection criteria provide the general guidance fro m which detailed measures forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21822crs2 1 us department of defense report required by section 2912 of the defense base closure and realignment act of 1990 as amended throug h the national defense

comprehensive base inventory describes the baseline footprint of installations that will be affected by brac 20051 in assessing the need for new round of base closures and realignments dod projected the force st ructure that will exist in 2009 and compared it to the much larger force that existed in 1988 the year just pr ior to the commencement of the first round of base closures the department then compared the base inventory existing then with the current inventory the secretary then concluded that the base infrastructure that exists now exceeds the requirements of the force th at will exist in 2009 justifying brac 2005 on march 25 2004 the general accounting ffice gao testified before congress on the new brac round it reported that th 2005 selection criteria follow framework that is similar to that employed in prior br ac rounds with more sp ecificity in selected areas especially in those regarding military value2 it also said that while the criteria were sound dod needed to consider total co sts to dod and other federal agencies as well as environmental costs in its analyses organization of brac within the office of the secretary of defense the secretary of defense has delegate d broad brac policy and decision making responsibilities to the deputy secretar of defense who chairs an infrastructure executive council iec the council consists of 10 memb ers including the secretaries of the military departments the chiefs of staff of the military services the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and the under s ecretary of defense for acquisition technology and logistics the council creates the brac selection criteria makes policy decisions regarding the brac process coordinates the efforts of the analytical organizations and recommends the resulting list of actions to the secretary of defense each military department arm navy and air force is responsible for brac data analysis relevant to military operations and each has formed appropriate analyst teams an infrastructure steering group isg created within the office of the secretary of defense is responsible fo r brac analysis relevant to defense functions this isg is chaired by the under secretary of defens for acquisition technology and logistics the vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff the military department assistant secretaries for installations the military service vice chiefs of staff and the deputy under secretary of defense for installations and environment are also membershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21822crs3 3 the list of selection criteria can be found on line at the dod brac website httpwwwdodmilbracseven functional analysis teams subordinate to the infrastructure steering group will perform the actual analysis th ey include 1 education and training 2 industry 3 supply and storage 4 headquarters and s upport 5 medicine 6 technology and 7 intelligence three of these seven joint cr ossservice groups are headed by uniformed officers while the other four are chaired by civilians base realignment and closure office exists within the office of the principal assistant deputy under secretary of defens for installations and environment its director is responsible for providing support to the seven analysis teams the inspector general of the department of defense is available to the defense agencies military departments and the joint crossservice groups to provi advice and review the accuracy of brac data as well as the certification process as explained below selection criteria force structure plan and certification the secretary of defense has published list of eight discrete selection criteria created by the infrastructure steering group3 these will guide the collection of defense installation data and analysis by the military services and the joint crossservice groups within the office of the secretary of defense this will lead to the creation of the list of recommended brac actions to be released in may 2005 these criteria form the basis for the measures and factors used by the military departments and joint crossservice groups in their analyses as required by the legislation creating brac 2005 the secretary has submitted 20year force structure plan to congress the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff was responsible for the writing of this classified document it broadly outlines the defense organization that the future base infrastructure will s upport revised force structure plan if needed is to be submitted with the department of defense budget for fy2006 all brac 2005 recommendations are to be ba sed on the final force structure plan the brac enabling legislation requires the secretary of defense to certify that the 2005 brac round is necessary the secretary issued that certification on march 23 2004 stating i hereby certify that the need exists for the closure or realignment of additional military installations and that the additional round of closures and realignments that was authorized by public law 101510 as amended would result in annual net savings for each of the military departments beginning not later than fiscal year 2011 to make this deter mination the department established baseline force and major installation inventory as of 1988 reflecting the department as it existed before the first brac round it then calculated the likely si ze of the force in 2009 and used that to estimate the infrastructure then needed this notional future infrastructure was found to be smaller than the current inventory of inst allations thereby justifying the secretarys certification to congresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21822crs4 creating the recommended brac action list dod has created an internal brac process that incl udes extensive documentation and analysis of defense functi ons supply training etc and military operations the infrastructure executive council will combine these analyses with additional considerations in creating the recommended brac action list documentation records each of the defense organizati ons and the joint crossservice groups are required to develop and keep descriptions of how brac policies analyses and recommendations are being made including minutes of all deliberative meetings all policy data information and an alyses considered in making brac recommendations descriptions of how recommendations meet brac selection criteria and follow the force structure plan and current base infrastructure inventory and documentation for each brac recommendation these records will be released to the brac commission along with the secretarys list of brac recommendations additional deliberative considerations the military departments and joint crossservice groups are considering consolidating or relocating active and reserve component federal or national guard activities onto any retained base where it make operational and economic sense before recommending changes to reserve component activities the analyzing organization must complete demographic study to ensure that new location will satis fy the recruiting requirements of the reserve component unit the data and analyses used in creating brac recommendations will not be released until the secretary has forwarded his list to the 2005 brac commission the department of defense includes the factors and measures used to generate data calls in its definition of data and analyses the statute establishing the 2005 brac require s the secretary of defense to consider any notice received from local government in the vicinity of m ilitary installation that the government would approve of the closure or realignment of the installation recommendations not supporting such community requests must be explained in the documentation provided to the commission and congressional defense committees internal control plan each element involved in the process is required to develop written plan the internal control plan that lays out the process by which the accuracy of all data collection and analysis is to be carried out the intent of this requirement is to create chain of custody for the information used in brac analysis and to establish uniform guidance for defining each data element and the sources fromhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21822crs5 which it is derived the methods for verifying the accuracy of data the procedures for checking its accuracy and the protection of data from prematur release the military departments defense agencies and the office of the secretary of defense are required to incorporate comprehensive auditor participa tion to ensure thorough assessment of the data and the process also audits will assess the specific applications of data calls and the accuracy of the data collection process collection of data all data used by the depa rtment of defense in ge nerating brac recommendations must be certifiable this means that they must be generated by and traceable to officials within the military departments installation managers who are specifically appointed to the tasks of data collection nd certification this data must be submitted in response to electronic or hard copy reque sts data calls issued by the joint crossservice groups to the military depar tments once created this data must be certified as true and accurate by the designated official before it is forwarded to the analytical organizations the initial call for data was issued during january 2004 additional calls are anticipated as new factors and measures are adopted throughout the analytical stage of the process analysis of data three principal analytical tools are used during the brac process an optimization methodology an installation visua lization tool and the updated cobra installation visualization tool the air force has been given responsibility to develop computer programs combining satellite and other imagery graphics and analytical tools to enable the user to visua lize and analyze current and future uses of each installations resources this will be of use principally during the base reuse and realignment portion of the brac proce ss and is not descri bed further here optimization methodology the navy is responsible for creating the linear programming tools that will be used by th joint crossservice groups in analyzing military value the service has subcontracted this task to the center for naval analyses federally funded research and developmen t center these computer models will be customized for the requirements of each jo int crossservice group medical technology education and training etc and will be run repeatedly to assess alternative distributions of functions across various basing configur ations in order to determine the optimal distribution of functional capability this will be the principal analytical tool guiding the creation of recommended brac actions cobra an updated version of the cost of base realignment actions or cobra will be used by the joint crossservice gr oups and department of defense agencies to calculate the costs savings and return on investment of each proposed realignment and closure actionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21822crs6 each analysis team or group will use the same pool of cer tified data in its deliberations subjecting it to analysis by its own customized version of the optimization methodology and the cobra merging operations and functions into list of brac actions the infrastructure executive council chaired by the puty secretary of defense will be responsible for using the analyses generated by the join t crossse rvice groups and the military departments to create list of recommended brac actions for the secretary of defense the secretary will in turn forward his approved list of recommendations along with the supporting documentation
