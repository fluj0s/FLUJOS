states and european countries have been actively involved i n various initiatives to end the conflict and restore peace at first internationa l objectives as expressed by the sixnation contact group and the securit council were limited to seeking cease fire in the province ending the repression of the kosovo civilian population by serb forces and improving the humanitaria n situation and facilitating political dialogue between the parties as fightin g continued the united states pressed for nato to threaten punitive air strikes i n order to achi eve compliance with demands the contact group became more involved with the possib terms of political settlement in early 1999 the contact group sought serb and kosovar albanian acceptan ce of detailed interim peace plan that would restore substantial autonomy to the kosovo population while upholding yugoslavias territorial integrity yugoslav leader slobodan milosevics rejection of the draft peace plan and his escalating use of force in kosovo prompted nato to launch sustained ai r campaign operation allied force against serb targets throughout yugoslavi beginning in march 1999 nato leaders sought to deter belgrade from bloodier offensive in kosovo and to damage belgrades military capacity in response however milosevic stepped up efforts to drive out the ethnic albanian populatio n from kosovo forcing hundreds of thousands of civilians across borders nat established five key conditions f or milosevic to meet before air strikes would end an end to all military action in kosovo the withdrawal of serb forces from kosovo agreement to the stationing of natoled military presence in kosovo agreement to the retu rn of all refugees and willingness to negotiate political framewor k agreement for kosovo in june milosevic accepted peace framework incorporating these demands eventually leading to an end to the bombing campai gn us and allied officials proclaimed victory for the operation and moved quickly toward peacekeeping and peace implementation phase in kosovo us and european objectives in kosovo remained largely consistent although some evolved in response to changing circumstances and met with varying degrees of success in late 1998 the threat of air strikes achieved the objective of averting humanitarian disaster at least for w hile in 1999 however nato did not succeed in deterrin g the largest serbian offensives to date during the course of the ai r campaign the humanitari an situation in kosovo is likely to improve substantially in the absence of violent conflict the nato operation achieved belgrades agreement to withdraw all of its forces from kosovo and the rebel kosovo liberation armys commitmen t to demilitarize under nato supervision natoled peacekeeping force kfor has been deployed to kosovo under unified command and contro l arrangements with russian participation contrary to some expectations nat countries generally remained unified behind the air operation though were divided on other military options the objective of attaining durable political settlement i n kosovo remains elusive but has been superceded to s ome extent by the establishment of virtual

sloboda n milosevic had accepted international principles for peaceful resolution to the conflict in kosovo kosovo southern province of serbia which together with the much smaller montenegro forms the fry became engulfed in violent co nflict in early 1998 as serbian and yugoslav forces sought to eliminate through brutally repressiv means the separatist threat presented by armed ethnic albanian rebels the kosovo liberation army kla denied their former autonomous rights since milosevics ascent to power in 1989 and 1990 the majority ethnic albania n population has sought full independence for kosovo the international community has supported greate r autonomy for the kosovo population but generally has not backed kosovos claim to independence as the confli ct wore on the united states and european countries became increasingly engaged in efforts to resolve the conflict belgrades rejection of an internationallysponsored peace plan and refusal to accept series f international demands led nato to launch operation allied force in late marc h 1999 striking yugoslav military targets in kosovo and throughout yugoslavia during the course of the air campaign numerous commen tators expressed doubt about the objectives strategy and conduct of the nato operation some doubted that milosevic would yield to western demands or ever cede control of kosovo others urged nato to prepare for ground invasion of yugoslavia in order t ensure victory after its conclusion president clinton and other leaders of nat countries proclaimed victory for operation allied force vindication of nato s strategy and turning point for the civilian pop ulation of kosovo they claimed that all of na tos objectives for the bombing campaign had been achieved nat shortly thereafter launched peacekeeping operation in kosovo i ncluding forces from russia and other nonnat countries in support of an emerging protectorate for the province some observers have questioned the claim of victory and the results of the nato operation in view of original objectives and continued uncertainties in kosovo and serbia this report provides an overview of stated us and international polic objectives i n kosovo from 1998 through

oward approving air strikes against the fry unless it complied with the demands although the resolution did not explicitl authorize the use of force to achieve compliance the united states asserted that the resolution and the charter provided sufficient legal basis for nato air strikes and nato issued an activation order to authorize air strikes in october president clinton and othe r administration officials said that the objective was to compel milosevics compliance with demands by force if necessary october 1998 agreements at the last minute nato air strikes were averted by milosevics agreement to terms worked out after many sessions with us envoy richard h olbrooke milosevic agreed to comply with all prov isions of resolutions 1160 and 1199 he signed two subsequent agreements with nato and the osce establishing unarmed air and ground verification mission s known as the kosovo verification mission kvm in addition the serbian government issued unilateral statement

into neighboring countries and to spark instability in the heart of europeto reverse humanitarian catastrophe in the makingand to seek negotiated peace with the agreement holbrooke obtained milosevics commitment to adhere to demands for the first time the presence in kosovo of over 1000 international verifiers of the holbrooke agreements and many humanitarian or ganizations facilitated the delivery of aid to the province preventing widespread starvation of displace d persons however compliance broke down almost immediately with numerou s violations of the c easefire by both the serb and kosovar

day of natos air operation march 24 president clinton gave n address to the nation in which he outlined three objectives of the mission to demonstrate the seriousness of natos purpose to deter an even bloodier offensive by yugoslavia against innocent civilians in kosovo if necessary to seriously damage the serbian militarys capacity to harm th people of kosovo to limit milosevics ability to make war in kosovo as nato began operation allied force on march 24 mil osevic accelerated his massive ethnic cleansing campaign to drive out most of the ethni c albanian population from kosovo the united

periodically expressed resolve t continue the air campaign until its objectives were met as conditions for the bombing to cease nato established five core demands on belgrade natos objectives were for

international civil presence in kosov s1999672 and s1999779 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30265crs7 kosovo was not addressed for example at the 1995 dayton negotiations on bosnia 3 herzegovinaevolution of policy objectives by theme the overriding us and i nternational objective to achieve peace and stability in kosovo and the rest of southeastern europe remained consistent during this period and will likely continue to guide international policy the i nterest of the united states and other countries in achieving this broad objective was fueled by the perceive d threat of the conflict expanding to other countrie s including members of nato and the prospect of prolonged and massive human suffering in the balkans it wa s tempered in the eyes of some observers by questions about the us stake i n kosovo uncertainties regarding the use of military force to achieve politica l objectives in kosovo and concerns about the strategy of natos air campaign it was also complicated by the actions of slobodan milosevic as result man underlying objectives evolved to varying degrees as the situation on the groun d changed over time and as the united states and other countries reacted to thes changes four components of the goal to restore peace and stability included th objectives of averting humanitarian crisis in kosovo and the r egion securing stable military situation on the grou nd conducive to peace settlement achieving durable political settlement for kosovo and maintaining consensus within nato th evolution of each component is reviewed below 1 avert humanitarian crisis the escalation of violent conflict between the serb forces and kosovar rebel s since early 1998 produced rapid deterioration of the humanitarian situation i n kosovo this phenom enon and the prospect of greater humanitarian catastrophe increased the incentive of the international community for the first time to engage in efforts to reac h political settlement for kosovo during 1998 the international3 community made frequent demands on belgrade to cease offensive operations an d dispatched diplomatic missions to promote negotiated peace process as th humanitarian situation continued to deteriorate with growing numbers of civilia n casualties refugees and displaced pers ons and reports of atrocities nato countries agreed to back up diplomatic demands with the threat of air stri kes under this threat milosevic agreed to international demands in october 1998 the agreement s achieved pause in t he conflict which was intended to bolster diplomatic efforts for political resolution thus worstcase humanitarian predicament was temporarily averted as humanitarian aid agencies gained access to the kosovo population in need however by early 1999 violence had resumed and escalated one objective of natos operation allied force was to deter milosevic from further aggression against civilians in kosovo according to statements made by the president and other administration and nato of ficials the allied military campaign failed to achieve this objective unlike in october when he withdrew some of hi s forces before nato military threat this time milosevic unleashed his largest ethnic cleansing campaign to date driving over 800000 kosovars across the border withinhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30265crs8 the new york times may 23 19994 department of defense background briefing october 27 19985a few weeks the massive influx of refugees to the poor and fragile neighborin g countries of albania and macedonia threatened to spread instability rather tha n contain it the serb c ampaign also displaced hundreds of thousands more inside the province refugee accounts told of numerous massacres and other war crime s committed by serbian forces during this time intern ational observer and aid missions withdrew from kosovo prior to the bombing campaign international aid agencie s were therefore unable to provide humanitarian relief to the displaced population inside kosovo though they assisted refugees in neighboring countries with the assistance of nato forces stationed in these countries in response to these events western leaders pledged to ensure the return of all refugees and displaced persons to thei r homes in an oped article president clinton wrote that the question now is t whether milosevics ethnic cleansing will be reversed but when4 with the subsequent agreeme nt to deploy natoled force in kosovo and the remarkably swift return of most of the refug ees the humanitarian situation in kosovo has improved and is l ikely to show further improvement meeting this objective will depend on how the peace process progresses what conditions returning kosova r refugees find in their home towns and how effectively humanitarian an d reconstruction efforts proceed meanwhile the mass exodus of ethnic serbs fro m kosovo since the start of kfors deployment in kosovo has created ne w humanitarian challenges in serbia 2 produce military situation in kosovo conducive to peace through 1998 an objective of the international community was to induc yugosla v army vj forces stationed in kosovo to return to their garrisons an d demand that extra s erbian special police mup units the ones most responsible for the repression of kosovar civilians withdraw from the province at the same time the united stat and its allies demanded that the kla refrain from terrorist attacks on serb police and the yugoslav army this limited objective reflected n acknowledgment of belgrades sovereignty over kosovo and li ttle support by western countries for the tactics or independen ce goals of the kla under the october 1998 accords milosevic was to have reduced the number of yugoslav army and serbian police units in kosovo to roughly the levels they were before the conflict erupted at the start of the year according to the defense department milosevic would have been considered to be in compliance if 11000 vj troops and 10000 mup polic remained in kosovo5 the worsening of the fighting by the end of 1998 and into 1999 caused re evaluation of the desired levels of serbian forces in kosovo the rambouille t agreemen t called for the phased withdrawal of most yugoslav army and serbia n special police mup forces over period of months it allowed 1500 yugosla v army personnel to serve in border guard battalions and up to an additional 100 0 troops to serve in border security functions it also allowed 2500 mup police t remain in kosovo for up to two years these allowed presences granted belgrad ehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30265crs9 for example see oped just and necessary war by president clinton the new york6 times may 23 1999some physical vestiges of sovereign control over its borders as for the kla th rambouillet agre ement called for the demilitarization of all other forces under terms worked out by kfor and restrictions on where they could carry arms after rambouillet failed and especially after milosevic s ignificantly escalated the ethnic cleansing of kosovo the united states and nato seized upon new objective of getting all yugoslav and serbian forces out of kosovo it was thought that only total serbian withdrawal with the introduction of an international security presence would provide for enough security for the kosovar refug ees to return home on june 9 yugoslav and serbian military officials and nato kfor commander gen jackson signed military technical agreement on the phased withdrawal of l yugoslav and serbian forces and on kfor on june 21 the kla concluded n accord with nato on its demilitarization and the cantonme nt of most of its weapons under the accord the int ernational community would give consideration to allowing kla members to join new kosovo police force or form force similar to national guard the other dimension to pro viding secure environment in kosovo has been the deployment of an interna tional security presence in the province planning and ideas for this mission have evolved with fluctuations in the peace process the octobe r 1998 agreements allowed only civilian ground and unarmed aerial monitoring missions to verify compliance with peace terms the rambouillet agreement specificall invited nato to deploy an international for ce kfor to kosovo and the rest of the fry natos initia l planning for kfor envisaged force of about 28000 troops at rambouillet and afterward yugoslavia rejected the presence of any foreig n military force on it s territory during the course of the nato air campaign nato upheld its condition that belgrade accept an international security force in kosov with nato at its core us officials continued to insist that this meant that th force must have nato command and control and rules of engagement the expressed willingness to arrange for the participation of nonnato members such as russia along the lines of the command arrangements of the na to force in bosnia only such force they argued could prov ide the security to allow refugees to return home and the kla to disarm 6 russian negotiators the wests primary link to milosevic sought unsuccessfully to downplay the nato role in the future security presence moreover the may g8 statement referred only to effective international civil an d security presences an apparent compromise on terminology finally in june milosevic accepted the principle of an international securi ty presence with substantial nato participationunder unified command and control clearing the way for us and nato agreement on deploying the force in kosovo nato s plans meanwhile had evolved to peace force in kosovo of about 50000 the increase in size from earlier plans reflected the more challenging conditions on the ground with muc h larger numbers of refugees to be returned to kosovo and with greater infrastructurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30265crs10 kfors ultimate size is likely to be even larger nato and nonnato countries hav e7 volunteered to contribute total of over 55000 troops to kfor department of defens press briefing june 24 1999 the extent of the actual damage incurred by the yugoslav army during operation allie d8 force has been the subject of recent speculation in the press for example see damage to serb military less than expected the new york times june 28 1999damage resulting fr om the air strikes and from the actions of serbian forces 7 kfors deployment according to the terms of the mta is limited to kosovo russias possible participation in kfor provided nother element of uncertainty after some 200 russian troops entered kosovo from bosnia and unexpectedl assumed c ontrol of pristina airport on june 12 russia reportedly sought control of its own sector in kosovo while western governments feared that that development would lead to kosovos p artition on june 18 us and russian officials concluded an accord on russias participation in kfor it provides for 3600 russian troops to serve in kfor in the us german and french sectors of kfor and does not give russia its own sector in summary meeting the objective of achieving favorable security situation on the ground appears more promising after the nat bombing than before the terms governing both the presence of the local forces and the international security force are stronger now than the terms outlined in either the october agreements or th rambouillet accords all yugoslav army and police forces have formally completed withdrawal from the province the yugoslav military remains damaged by the nato air campaign and deployment of larger international force under unified nat o8 command and control has commenced on the other hand the continuation of the conflict and the increased level f brutalities through half of 1999 may have exacerbated the s ecurity situation in pockets of kosovo where returning alban ian refugees seek retribution against local serbs or where there is any remaining serbian resistence to the albanians return th continued presence of ethnic albanian andor serbian paramilitaries with possibl hidden caches of armaments may present future chall enges to kfor the prolonged fighting in kosovo may have allowed the serbian military to lay additional mine s throughout the province in addition resolution 1244 calls for an agree d number as yet unspecified of yugoslav military and serb police personnel to b permitted to return to kosovo to liaise with the international civil and securit presence mark and clear minefields maintain presence at serb patrimonial sites in kosovo nd maintain presence at key border crossings the actions an d performance of the russian troops in kfor will also likely affect the securit situation on the ground 3 achieve durable political settlement following months of shuttle diplomacy led by the us envoys rambouillet was

the province the peace agreement was to remain in force for three years at the end of this period the international co mmunity would convene special conference to determine mechanism for final settlement for kosovo on the basis of the will of the people opinions of relevant authorities each partys effort s regarding the implementation of this agreement and the helsinki final act eventually signing the rambouillet agreement the kosov ar albanian delegation made clear that it understood this provision to mean that popular referendum woul d determine the final status of the province the rambouillet process was suspended after the yugoslav delegation refused to accept the interim accord in contrast resolution 1244 outlines the general principles of politica l solution to kosovo without the signatures or overt consent of the yugoslav r kosovar parties it assigns all civil and security responsibilities and functions to an9 international administrat ion effectively establishing protectorate it says that the international civil presence will promote the establishm ent of substantial autonomy and selfgovernment in kosovo taking full account of annex 2 the ahtisaari chernomyrdin principles and of the rambouillet accords it does not specify either final status or mechanism for final status for kosovo although it refers t application f the resolution pending final settlement it remains thus unclear as to what entity the transitional arrangement will eventually transfer authority the resolution authorizes the establishment of the civil and security presence s for an initial period of one year implying soft deadline although it also says they are to contin ue thereafter unless decided otherwise by the security council as i t eschews clear outline of f inal political settlement for kosovo the resolution provides exit strategy for the international civil and security administration f kosovo in june report to the security council the secretarygeneral stated that his special representative will be responsible for facilitating political proces s designed to determ ine the future political status of kosovo taking into account the rambouillet accords10 with regard to the structure of the international civil presence the resolution differs from rambouillet in that it increases the role and authority of th united nations many other regional orga nizations such as the european union and the organization for security and cooperation in europe are to become involve d with peace implementation however all civil functions are to fall under the authority of the special representative of the secretarygeneral named to be bernar d kouchner of france rambouillet in contrast assigned larger and mor autonomous role to the osce similar to rambouillet is the separation of military and civilian commands and structures with kfor remaining separate and distinc t from the civil mission though with close coordination between the two httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30265crs12 with peace implementation efforts having just begun it is premature to assess whether the objective of reaching durable political settlement is likely to b achieved much will depend on the leadership exercised by the international civi l administrati on and how it interprets what substantial autonomy means in practice other important factors will be the level of engagement nd resources provided by the international community and the extent to which kfor is able to provide secure environment for or directly assist civilian peace implementation and
