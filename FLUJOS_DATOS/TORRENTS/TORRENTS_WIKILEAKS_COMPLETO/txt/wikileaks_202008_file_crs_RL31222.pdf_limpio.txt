strategic nuclear weapons unilateral vs bilateral reductions summary on november 13 2001 president bush nnounced that he planned to reduce us strategic nuclear weapons to between 1700 and 2000 ope rationally deployed warheads he noted that he would ma ke these reductions unilaterally without pursuing formal arms control agreement with russia president putin welcomed the proposed reductions but argued that they should be made through formal treaty although the united states eventually agreed to sign legally binding agreement officials in the bush administration have argued that the united states should not be bound by formal arms control treaties it argues that many of these agreements do not limit threats to the united states but they do restrict us flexibility in ensuring its national security but the absence of formal arms control treaties would bring about changes in the role of congress the senate has c onstitutionallymandated role in giving advice and consent to the ra tification of formal treaties but would have role in approving informal agreements this approach would also change the role of arms control in the relationship between the united states and russia the united states and soviet union us ed negotiated treaties and unilateral measures to reduce their nuclear forces the start i treaty which reduced strategic offensive nuclear weapons and st art ii treaty which did not enter into force are examples of th former the 1991 presidential nuclear initiatives which eliminated nonstrategic nuclear weapons are an example of the latter review of these cases highlights relative strengths and weaknesses of these two mechanisms formal treaties allow the pa rticipants to understand and predict future changes in forces and threats allow for transparency in monitoring those forces and allow for balanced and equitable trades between the for ces of the participating parties on the other hand the search for balanced trades and the need for detailed definitions tends to lengthen the negotiating process while the detailed provisi ons and requirements lengthen and add to the cost of the implementation process unilateral measures on the other hand can be devised and imple mented more quickly allow for more sweeping changes and provide the participants with the flexibility to reverse their reductions if necessary however they often do not provide transparency or predictability and there is the potential for destabilizing reversals the bush administrations proposals dem onstrate many but not all of these characteristics the president announced his proposed reductions relatively quickly but he plans to implement them at sl ow pace over 10 years and although his reductions appear to move well beyond those implemented under start i they are more sweeping than reductions that ve been considered for the past 10 years under start ii and potential start iii treaty the president did not pr opose any new monitoring measures but the united states and russia are likely to continue to implement the monitoring regime fro m start i to improve transparency with future reductions finally the president nd his advisers have highlighted the fact that these measures will provide the united states with the flexibility to reduce or restore its forces quickly russia on the other hand may feel threatened by the us ability to reverse its weapons reductions and without precise definitions of those weapons that will be eliminated disputes and suspicion could arise in the future httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31222contents introduction 1

states and soviet union si gned numerous treaties and agreements that were designed to limit reduce and sometimes eliminate offensive nuclear weapons some critics cl aimed the agreements did little to enhance us security they either did not limit the threat from the soviet union while constraining us forces or they restrained weapons that the nations had already decided they did not need to maintain their security nevertheless these agreements and the negotiations that produced them often played central role and served to measure the level of tension in the relationship between the ited states and soviet union the united states and russia did not sign any new agreements during the clinton administration but the arms control pro cess continued with the implementation of the 1991 start i strategic arms reducti on treaty the debate over start ii and preliminary discussions on start iii treaty1 during the election campaign in 2000 nd his early months in office in 2001 president bush pledged to set aside the arms control negotiating process and to reduce us strategic nuclear forces ilaterally to the lowest possible number consistent with our nationa l security the depth of the reductions would be determined by review conducted by the secretary of defense but the president expected that the united states could re duce its forces significantly below the start ii level without compromising our security in any way2 this approach to weapons reductions reflected the president and his advisers views on the relatively low value of negotiated arms control and the need to alter the usrussian relationship after the cold war specifically the president stated that we can and will change the size the composition the ch aracter of our nuclear for ces in way that reflects the

putin discuss new relationship november 13 2001washington on november 13 2001 he stated that the united states would reduce its operationally deployed strategic nuclear warheads to level between 1700 and 2200 over the next decade this number falls below the 30003500 warheads that would have been permitted by the 1993 start ii treaty and on its face goes below the 20002500 warheads planned for start iii however b ecause the start treaties use counting rules to attri bute warheads to the parties forces and because these counting rules could incl ude weapons that ar not operationally deployed the presidents decision may reduce us forces to levels similar to those that would have been consistent with start iii4 the president indicated that the united states would reduce its forces unilaterally without signing formal agreem ent with russia he stated that new relationship based upon trust nd cooperation is one that doesnt need endless hours of arms control discussions we dont need arms control negotiations to reduce our weaponry in significant way5 president putin offered mixed response he stated that he appreciated the presidents decision to reduce us strategi c offensive weapons and noted that russia will try to respond in kind6 he did not offer any specific numbers on this occasion but he has in the past proposed that the united states and russia reduce their strategic offensive forces to 1500 wa rheads or fewer many experts believe that russia is likely to retain only 10001500 warheads by the end of the decade and that it will lack the economic resources to produce more than few hundred new landbased missiles and perhaps few new ba llistic missile submarines7 president putin has emphasized that he would like to use the formal arms control process to reduce us and russia forces he emphasized that the us russian dialogue on strategic offensiv and defensive weapons should focus on reaching reliable and verifiable agreement on further reductions of the us and russian weapons he added that ru ssia was prepared to present all our agreements in treaty form including th issues of verification and control8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31222crs3 9rice

administration has not critic ized or backed away from the 1968 nuclear nonproliferation treaty this treaty does not however restrict the us nuclear weapons program and many analysts believe it has been relatively successful in establishing an international norm that limits the proliferati on of nuclear weapons bilateral treaties bush administration officials have argued against the negotiation of new bilateral arms control agreements in part because they believe the process can be too slow and too rigid specifically according to one official formal arms control agreements that require so much time to negotiate and are negotiated at level of detail that has become ast ounding will not allow us to make the kinds of adjustments to our own for ces in the timeframes we need to make them13 in contrast according to administration officials unilateral measures would allow the united states to reduce its forces quickly when they were longer needed and restore forces quickly if conditions changed again this view represents sharp depart ure from policies supported by republicans and conservatives including many who work in the bush administration for much of the cold war during that time many argued that arms control agreements must include detailed definitions and provisions they also insisted on complex monitoring and verification regimes that would permit the united states to detect full range of possible violations this pproach would assure soviet compliance with obligations even if it produced lengthy negotiations and long complex treaties the bush administration has argued how ever that arms control negotiations represent an adversarial process between the united states and russia and they are longer appropriate because according to the president and others in his administration russia is longer our enemy14 accordingly the two nations should work together to lessen or eliminat threats to their security rather than pursue agreements based on the premise that each is threat to the other for many months the administrations critics questioned this view noting that the united states and russia continued to deploy enoug h nuclear weapons to destroy the other and to posture those weapons in ways that threatened targets in the other nation they argued that the political relationship may have improved but it could deteriorate again in the future however after the september 11 attacks on the world trade center and pentagon russi and the united states opened new channels of communication nd cooperation some assert that this new relationship truly does seem to signify change in th security environment for both nations and real reduction in the need for and role of arms control in their relationship in the administrations view the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty embodies all the negative characteristics of formal arms control it constrains the us ability to develop and deploy ballis tic missile defenses wit hout controlling the capabilities of

adversaries poised to engage in massive nuclear war hence the administration would like to replace the abm treaty with new strategic framework that allows for ongoing cons ultation and cooperati on without codifying limits on us or russian offensive or defensive weapons in formal treaty although the bush administration initia lly opposed the negotiation of any new agreements with russia it altered its position in deference to russias president putin in the months after the crawford summit the united states and russia held discussions on the possible fo rmat for and content of new arms control agreement in early 2002 secretary of state powell stated that the two sides would seek to reach legally binding accord in may 2002 shortly before the planned summit in moscow president bush announced that th two sides had completed treaty that would limit their offensive nuclear weapons this treaty however would be short around 3 pages and would lack many of the complex definitions collateral constraints and implement ation requirements common in previous arms control agreements it would not attempt to shap or structure the remaining forces on the two sides and would only remain in force for 10 years after which time the two sides could restore or reduce their forces as they saw fit in essence it contained the same ambiguities and flexibility that had been included in the presidents announcement in november 2001 this is disc ussed in more detail below arms control without treaties many officials in the bush administration and analysts outside government believe the united states nd russia could cooperate in reducing their strategic offensive nuclear weapons without signing formal arms control treaty they could provide each other with information about their plans and programs and possibly employ some cooperative monitoring measur to help each nation confirm changes in the others forces this type of ar ms control process may differ from the formal negotiations and treatydefined implementation rules of the cold war era in the following ways the role of congress the us constitution states that the president shall have the power by and with the advice and consent of the senate to make treaties provided twothirds of the senators present concur15 consequently the president cannot sign and implement an arms cont rol treaty that would limit or reduce us nuclear weapons without gaining the appr oval of at least 67 senators he can however limit or reduce us nuclear forces without seeking the advice and consent of the senate if he does so unilaterally in such circumstance he would act as commanderinchief of the us military to establish us military doctrine policy and force structure in accordance with his views on us national securityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31222crs6 16the prohibition could be waived if the star t ii treaty entered into force see us congress national defense authorization ac t for fiscal year 1998

author ization and appropriations bills for the department of defense if congress did not approve of plans to reduce us nuclear weapons it could deny the use of appr opriated funds for ac tivities that would deactivate or dismantle specified weapons systems congress employed this mechanism in fy1998 when it mandated that funds available to the department of defense may not be obligated or expende d during fiscal year 1998 for retiring or dismantling or for preparing to retire or dismantle nuclear w eapons below specified levels that were consistent with the start i treaty16 initially this legislation was designed to provide the russi an parliament with an incentive to approve the start ii treaty because it clearly stated that us forces would not decline further until start ii entered into force the clinton administration sought to ease the restriction in subsequent years as the budgetary cost to retain aging systems increased but many in congress believed the clinton administration might go too far in reducing us nuclear weapons so congress included similar provisions in the defense authorization bills for fy 1999 fy 2000 nd fy2001 it did however repeal this language for the bush administration in the fy2002 defense bill the role of arms control during the 1990s as the relationship between the united states and russia improved thei r cooperation expanded to include wide range of economic political and military i ssues however even without new treaty since january 1993 arms control s remained on their cooperative agenda they have worked together to implement start i sharing da ta and cooperating in range of onsite inspections and they sought to reach agreement on further reductions arms control also remained important to russia as measure of its political status as russia experienced economic and political disruptions during the 1990s its nuclear weapons were often seen as its sole remaining claim to superpower status therefore negotiations with the united states to limit and reduce those weapons were seen as measure of russias status as an equal to the united states this consideration apparen tly supported russias insistence on the signing of new agreement that would codify the plan s for reductions outlined in late 2001 during the 1990s however many analysts inside and outside government grew convinced that the united states longer needed arms control to limit the russian threat they expected russian forces to decline sharply unde r economic pressure as russia retired older systems without producing large numbers of new weapons therefore the united states would not need to limit its own forces in an effort to convince russia to reduce its arsenal fu rthermore arms cont rol may become less important in russias measure of its rela tionship with the united states as other economic and political issues take central role on their agenda for discussions changing priorities the administrations preference for unilateral

agreements such as the intermediaterange nuclear forces inf treaty and the start i treaty mandated extensive data exchanges and allowe d for frequent onsite inspections although the united states and russia mig ht employ some of these cooperative measures as they reduce their forces in the future the bush administration has indicated that it places higher priority on maintaining us flexibility without formal treaty limits or with an agreement that lacks specific elimination provisions as is the case in the new agreement the united states could reduce or restore its forces quickly this is important becau according to the administration we live in an unpredictable world where threats can emerge and recede rapidly and static predictable forces may stand in th way of an appropriate response17 questions and concerns some members of congress and analys ts outside government have raised questions about the bush administration s policy and prioritie s on arms control some have questioned whethe r the president has the authority to reduce us nuclear weapons without consulting congress others have questioned whether this approach will produce stability and security in the long run they note that russia and the united states will maintain siz eable nuclear arsenals for the foreseeable future and that they could once again pos threat to each other if their political relationship should change18 without the formal elimin ation procedures present in earlier treaties either side could restor weapons to its forces russia may be particularly concerne d about the us ability in this regard because the united states may retain many of the warheads removed from operationally deployed forces in its stockpile furthermore w ithout cooperative monitoring and transparency measures each side may be uncertain about th emerging forces of the other critics also argue that the absence of formal usrussian agreements could undermine international stability and other nations confidence in their security several of the united states allies have expressed thei r support for formal arms control framework noting that the predictability and transparency inherent in such system can ease security concerns among nations who are not direct parties to the agreement19 at the same time some argue that the us disregard for formal treaty regimes could spread to other nations some might choose to withdraw from other treaties such as the nuclear nonprolifer ation treaty that the united states deems to be beneficial also some argue potential adversaries such as china might expand their own nuclear forces in re sponse to us programs see belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31222crs8 20a protocol signed in 1992 named ukraine russia kazakhstan and belarus as the successors to the soviet union for start each of these nations had soviet strategic offensive nuclear weapons on their territories ukraine kazakhstan and belarus have all eliminated their nuclear weapons and delivery vehicles leaving russia as the sole nuclear successor to the soviet uniontherefore critics assert the bush administrations approach could in the long run produce reactions that might undermine us security unilateral and bilateral arms control illustrative cases during the past 20 years the united states has pursued both bilateral arms control treaties and unila teral reciprocal reductions with first the soviet union and later russia these include the bilateral strategic arms reduction treaties start i and start ii and the unilateral reci procal reductions in nonstrategic nuclear weapons the presidential nuclear initiativ pnis in 1991 these efforts exhibit many of the characteristics often attributed to unilateral and bilateral arms reductions the strategic arms reduction talks the reductions the united states and soviet union signed the first strategic arms reduction treaty on ju ly 31 1991 start i limits the parties20 to 6000 warheads on 1600 strategic offensiv delivery vehicles landbased intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms submarinelaunched ballistic missiles slbms and heavy bombers this repres ented reduction of approximately one third from the number of weapons the ited states and soviet union deployed during the cold war the treaty assigns number of warheads to each type of missile and heavy bomber through counting rules because these counting rules discount the number of weapons that might actually be carried by some types of bombers the number of actual warheads depl oyed by the united states and russia could exceed the number of warheads assigned to deployed systems the collapse of the soviet union and end of the cold war led many to conclude that the number of weapons permitted by start i could be reduced significantly without harming us national security consequently the united states and russia signed start ii on january 3 1993 it limits each side to 30003500 accountable warheads on strategic offensive delivery vehicles further 50 percent reduction from start i levels the treaty also bans all multiple warhead icbms mirved icbms for the most part start ii w ould use the same verification regime as start i unlike start i however star t ii includes all the weapons carried on bombers in its counting rules so the numbe r of warheads that could be deployed by the united states and russia would not exceed the number counted under the treaty timeframe for negotiations the united states and soviet union opened the strategic arms reduction talks in 1982 the talks stalled in the mid1980s when the soviet union walked out after the united states deployed intermediatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31222crs9 21russia eventually ratified the treaty in april 2000 but it included conditions in its law on ratification that have prevented the treaty from entering into forcerange missiles in europe the negotiations resumed in earnest in 1985 they took another brief hiatus in early 1989 while th first bush administration reviewed us arms control policy and concluded in ju ly 1991 the treaty entered into force in december 1994 after ukraine belarus and kazakhstan agreed to return the nuclear warheads on their territories to russia and joined the nuclear nonproliferation treaty as nonnuclear nations the treaty allows for 7year implementation period which concluded on december 5 2001 consequen tly start i took 1619 years from the start of negotiations to th completion of reductions the united states and russia began ne gotiations on start ii in early 1992 and signed the treaty in january 1993 this rela tively quick pace reflect s in part the fact that start ii uses the verification regime from start i the treaty initially called for the reductions to be complete by the beginning of 2003 period of ten years after it was signed however in 1997 the united states and russia agreed to extend the elimination period to the end of 2007 because russia had not yet approved ratification21 hence even with relativel short time for negotiation start ii would have taken 16 years from the beginning of the negotiations to the end of the eliminations details in definiti ons and provisions the full text of the documents associated with start i fills 290 pages the treaty itself which includes the basic limits on us and soviet forces and the types of inspections that the parties can use to monitor compliance with the treaty limits is only 16 pages however the document includes 8 annexes nd protocols along with number of other associated agreements and documents each of these documents adds details and complex procedures to the requirements contained in the basic treaty for example sixpage definitions annex includes 124 detailed definitions of the weapons systems facilities procedures and ot her terms in the treaty sevenpage conversion and elimination protocol outlines the precise pr ocedures that the countries must follow when eliminating or convertin g weapons systems so that they will longer count under the treaty the 70page inspection pr otocol identifies the precise procedures and equipment that must be used before during and after the numerous inspections listed in the treaty in contrast the start ii treaty contai ns only 30 pages of documents the 10 page basic text 7page protocol that dds to the provisions in the start i treatys protocol on elimination 4page protocol outlining the procedures to be used during the display of heavy bombers and memo randum of understanding that contains the data needed to attribute warhead numbe rs to delivery vehicles however because much of the detail included in annexes nd protocols to start i was to be used during the implementation of start ii this second treaty did not need as much text to impose the same complex definitions and procedureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31222crs10 22for the text of the presidents speech see larson jeffrey and kurt j klingenberger editors controlling

hence some analysts feared they might be lost sold or used by unauthorized commandersthe 1991 presidential nuclear initiatives the reductions on september 27 1991 in speech to the nation president george hw bush announced number of ch anges he planned to make to the us nuclear arsenal22 he stated that the united stat would withdraw from deployment and eliminate all of its land based nonstrategic nuclear weapons those with ranges less than 3600 miles and withdraw its nonstrategi c naval nuclear weapons deployed on attack submarines and surf ace ships some weapons would be placed in storage and others would be eliminated these measures would affect more than 2000 landbased and seabase d nonstrategic nuclear weapons he also announced that he would remove from alert all u s strategic bombers and 450 minuteman ii icbms that were to be eliminated under start ii he also cancelled several modernization programs for strategic and nonstrategic nuclear weapons he indicated that the united states would implement these measures regardless of the soviet reaction but he inv ited soviet president gorbachev to take similar steps on october 5 1991 soviet president khail gorbachev replied that he too would withdraw and eliminate nonstrategic nuclear weapons23 he stated that the soviet union would destroy all nuclear artillery ammunition and warheads for tactical missiles remove warheads for nucl ear antiaircraft missiles and destroy some of them destroy all nuclear landmines and remove ll naval nonstrategic weapons from submarines and surface ships and groundbased naval aviation destroying some of them estimates of the number of nonst rategic weapons deployed by the soviet union varied but many analysts expected these measures to ffect several thousand weapons president gorbachev also announ ced that he would remove bombers and more than 500 ballistic missiles from alert and cancel many modernization programs russias president boris yeltsin pledged to continue implementing these measures after the soviet union co llapsed at the end of 1991 timeframe for the reductions although some of the measures announced by president bush may have been under re view for several mont hs reports indicate that the package announced on septembe r 27 had been compiled reviewed and approved in matter of weeks the fa iled coup in moscow in august 1991 had raised concerns about the safety of soviet nonstrategic nuclear weapons24 officials in the bush administration hoped that by announcing withdrawals of us non strategic nuclear weapons th soviet union would do the same and ease the growing concerns furthermore with the collapse of the warsaw pact much of the rationale for us deployment of shortrange nucl ear weapons in europe had disappearedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31222crs11 25handler joshua the september 1991 pnis and the eliminati on storage and security aspects of tnws presentation for seminar at the united nations new york september 24 2001the united states implemented these m easures very quickly bombers and icbms were removed from alert status in matter of days or weeks nonstrategic nuclear weapons were remove d from bases in europe and naval vessels by the end of 1993 two years after the president announced the initiative the warhead dismantlement process may be moving more slowly but this is due to the limits on capacity at the pantex plant in texas where the work is done it is possible that president gorbachev compiled his list of measures in the 10 days between the speech by president bu sh and his response eliminating the weapons apparently took bit longer however in part because of the greater number of weapons involved according to some estimates the naval sy stems were removed from deployment by the end of 1993 but the army and air force systems remained in the field until 1996 and 199725 the elimination of warh eads may be proceeding far more slowly because russia may not have the capacity or funding to dismantle more than few hundred warheads each year details in definiti ons and provisions the united states and russia never codified these reductions in formal treaty the presidential speeches are the primary source of the list of measures adopt ed by each nation as result there are few details available about the types of weapons included in the measures or the actions taken to deactivate and disman tle those weapons there also is little unclassified data about the number of weapons eliminated and the number of weapons remaining outside the scope of the measures particularly in russia comparison of unilateral and bilateral approaches the discussion that follows provides an indepth analysis of some of the characteristics of unilateral and bilateral arms control that are evident in the cases of the start treaties and 1991 pnis it divi des these characteristics into two groups strengths and weaknesses in placing ch aracteristics into these groups this report seeks to be consistent with us arms control policy during the past 15 years when the united states sought to reduce the numbers of nuclear weapons while maintaining stability in the nuclear balance between the united states and soviet union or russia the report employs broad concept for stability it is assumed to exist when nations feel confident in their ability to maintain their security strategic stability when nations do not believe they must rapidly build up forces in peacetime to enhance their security arms race stab ility and when nations do not believe they must strike first during crisis to ensure their security or survival crisis stability bilateral treaties strengths predictability many analysts believe that formal arms control negotiations and the resulting treaties enha nce stability because they improve each nations ability to understand the others forces and capab ilities and allow both nations to predicthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31222crs12 how those forces might change in the futu re during negotiations the nations may share details about existing forces and insigh ts into plans for the future so that each can understand how threats may emerge and evolve the limits in an agreement can also provide each nation with confidence bout the future size and capabilities of the other nations forces treatys monitori ng provisions and deta iled restrictions on activities can also provide the parties with confidence that they will not be surprised by actions taken by the other nation and that they will have sufficient warning if the other nation seeks to evade the limits in treaty some analysts also argue that the predictability offered by arms control treaties can enhance stability for nations that are not parties to the treaty and in the international community atlarge for exampl nations in europe that are not parties to the 1987 intermediaterange forces i nf treaty or the start treaties can still be confident that the treaty has reduced and in some cases eliminated missiles that had threatened their territories the 1972 abm treaty is also often cited as an example of the benefits of predictability although the treaty only affects missile defense programs in the united states and russia nations such as china may believe that its missiles could deter an attack by the united states because the united states cannot deploy defenses sufficient to inte rcept retaliatory attack from this perspective the abm treaty may enhance stability between the united states and china furthermore if the treaty did not exist china might feel compelled to expand its offensive forces to penetrate us defenses but an expansion in chinese forces could undermine indias confidence in its ability to deter china leading to an expansion in indias forces and an expans ion in indias forces could raise concerns and possibly lead to an arms buildup in pakistan others however dispute the view that usrussian arms control treaties affect international stability specifically many argue that china might modernize its nuclear arsenal regardless of us missile defense plans and that india and pakistan would alter their forces in response to thei r security needs visavis each other with little attention paid to global balance that included us missile defenses transparency the arms control process has played key role in providing the participating nations w ith access to and an understanding of the military forces and activities of the other participants during the 1970s the united states and russia relied almost exclusively on thei r own national technical means ntm to monitor forces and activities limited by arms control agreements these included the satellites and remote sensing technologies that each nation employed to monitor the other regardless of arms control obligations beginning in 1987 with the inf treaty the parties also added extensive data exchanges notifications and onsite inspections to their mechanisms for monitoring forces and verifying compliance with arms control treaties many viewed these measures as way to build trust foster cooperation and confirm information alread collected by ntm they created degree of openness and transparency that is now familiar characteristic of the arms control process the united states and russia could bu ild openness and transparency without the presence of formal arms control tr eaties the nunnlugar cooperative threat reduction program ctr which the united states is using to assist russia with transportation storage and di smantlement of nuclear w eapons and delivery vehicleshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31222crs13 26for details see crs report 971027 f nunnlugar cooperative threat reduction programs issues for congress by amy f woolf updated march 23 2001provides the united states with access to wide range of military activities facilities and weapons systems in russia26 however cooperation and transparency in the ctr program has limits russia is willing to llow the united states access to many of its nuclear fac ilities and russia has access to us nuclear facilities or weapons through this program balance and equality when negotiating formal treaties the united states and soviet union sought provisions that ppeared balanced and equal in spite of differences in their weapons systems and fo rce structures the need to determine balanced trades between different types of weapons systems of ten added months or years to the negotiating process but this process ensured that the parties interacted as equals with an equal nse of security and an equal sense of sacrifice in way that appeared to enhance strategic stab ility furthermore each nation acknowledged that the size and structure of the other na tions forces could affect its own security when the united states announced that it would reduce its nuclear forces regardless of russias response as it di d in september 1991 and as president bush did in november 2001 it indicated that the balance of forces between the two nations had little or relevance in security calculations some view this as positive development in 1991 after the collapse of the warsaw pact the united states longer needed to deploy groundbased nuclear weapons in europe to deter or respond to an attack there similarly in 2001 pres ident bush stated that cold war is over and the us relationship with russia has improved therefore the united states can reduce its forces without regard for the size or structure of russias forces but some in russia view the absence of us cern about russias forces as negative development with nuclear weapons as russias last remaining measure of superpower status some see us disreg ard for those weapons as disregard for russia as major nation bilateral treaties weaknesses length of negotiations many analysts argue arms control negotiations cannot keep up with either the weapons planning process or changes in the international environment when the start i negotiations began the united states and soviet union were adversaries in nse relationship two months after the nations signed the treaty president bush cancelled several weapons systems such as the program to develop mobile basing mode for the mx peacekeeper missile and the program to develop small singlewarhead mobile icbm that would have been covered by the agreement and 6 months after signing the treaty in december 1991 the soviet union ceased to exist at that time many experts agreed that the number of weapons permitted by start i wa s too high particularly in light of growing concerns about the command and c ontrol of these weapons and their safety and security after the demise of the soviet union many analysts saw the relatively quick conclusion of start ii with the united states and russia agreeing in less than one year to reduce their forces by an additional 50 as evidence that the arms control process could move more quick ly in less adversarial environmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31222crs14 however that treaty faced long delays in the ratification process and had not yet entered in to force at the end of 2001 yet many including president bush believe the relationship between the united states and russia has impr oved enough to permit far deeper reductions in thei r strategic offensive forces length of implementation start i allowed 7 years for the parties to reduce their forces although they elimin ated many weapons more quickly than mandated by the treaty neither the united states nor russia completed their eliminations until the deadline of decem ber 5 2001 the start ii treaty initially mandated that the united states and russia complete their reductions by the beginning of 2003 ten years after they sign ed the treaty but in september 1997 after delays in the ratification process the two nations agreed to extend the elimination period to the end of 2007 russia sought this extension in part because it did not have the resources to eliminate missile launchers and submarines as quickly as would have been required to meet th earlier deadline in addition many of russias aging systems would reach the end of their service lives by the end of the decade and with the later deadline russi an officials could argue that start ii would not impose any undue burdens on the ru ssian military this point helped win the approval of the russi an parliament in the vote to ratify start ii supporters argue that the lengthy imple mentation process is necessary because it will take time for the nations to comply with the detailed elimination procedures and it allows each nation to be certain that the other is meeting its obligations before it eliminates its own weapons critics argue however th at this timeframe adds to costs of nuclear weapons by forcing the na tions to operate and maintain them when they know they will eventually eliminate th em furthermore in an era when the united states is concerned about russia s degraded command and control structure the united states should enc ourage quicker elimination pr ocess not one that allows russia to retain its aging systems for several additional years high cost of implementation the start treaties contain detailed provisions that outline procedures that parties must use wh eliminating weapons or converting them for other uses thes provisions seek to ensure that the eliminated weapons cannot be used again in the future for example the united states and soviet union agreed to destroy the launch tubes on ballistic missile submarines and to excavate or explode ic bm silos to depth of 8 meters under start i the start ii treaty permits ru ssia to convert silos for ss18 missiles to silos that hold smaller singlewarhead missiles but the treaty specifies that russia must fill the bottom of the silo with cem ent and install metal ring around the top to ensure that the remaining dimensions are too small to hold an ss18 icbm these provisions also help the parties monitor the elimination process and verify compliance with the treaty but these procedures can be costly to implement for example if the united states wanted to use old ballistic missile submarines for other purposes it could not simply remove the ba llistic missiles fill or seal the launch tubes and deploy the submarines with othe r weapons it would have to cut out the portion of the submarine with the launch tubes in it and replace it with another structure or accept that the warheads once carried on the submarine still counted under the treatyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31222crs15 27the russian parliament has two chambers the duma or lower chamber and the federation councilabsence of future flexibility most arms control agreements contain provisions that allow nation to withdraw from the treaty so that it can protect or enhance its national security critics of formal arms control argue however that the united states could remain locked into arms control agreements regardless of its national security needs because it would be too difficult politically to withdraw from the agreement they point to the us experience with the abm treaty even though the clinton administration planned to deploy missile defense system that was inconsistent with the abm treaty it did not exercise the us right to withdraw instead it sought to convince russia to accep t protocol to the treaty that would modify and relax its restrictions the bush administration notified russia of the planned us withdrawal from the abm in december 2001 but it still spent months seeking mutual solution with russia unilateral arms reductions strengths speed in decisionmaking presidential decision to alter us nuclear forces is likely to be reached more qui ckly if the reductions will be implemented unilaterally rather than through formal treaty the president would still seek analyses and alternatives from the depar tment of defense and other agencies but without plans for formal negotiations th us government would not need to develop negotiating strategy and fallback positions most experts also agree that without the need to reach agreement with russia on specific definitions or provisions the president could incorporate his decision into us policy guidance in relatively short amount of time he could incorporate the changes into the annual budget for the department of defense or announce them as separate decision the united states might also begin to reduce its forces more quickly after unilateral decision because there would be need for formal approval from either the us senate or the russian parliament27 this process has added years to the implementation of the start agreements for example in late 1992 when the russian parliament approved ratification of the start i treaty it stated that it would not exchange instruments of ratification and allow the treaty to enter into force until ukraine belarus and kazakhstan signed the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt as nonnuclear states bela rus and kazakhstan took this step in 1993 but the parliament in ukra ine delayed its action until 1994 delaying start is entry into force by almost 2 years the start ii treaty faced even greater delays due to the need for approval by the senate and the russian duma the senate foreign relations committee held hearings on start ii in march 1993 but delayed further bate until start i entered into force hearings resume d in early 1995 but dispute over plans to reorganize the state department and eliminate the arms control and disarmament agency delayed further action until january 1996 three years after presidents bush and gorbachev signed the treaty the russian duma began considering start ii in july 1995 but concerns about the treat ys effect on russian forces and negativehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31222crs16 28for details see crs report 97359 f start ii debate in the russian duma issues and prospects by amy f woolf updated april 17 2000reactions to other elements of us foreign policy slowed the debate several times28 when the duma finally approved star t ii on april 14 2000 it stated that the treaty could not enter into force until the united states ratified several 1997 agreements related to the 1972 abm treaty the clinton administration never submitted these to the senate for fear th ey would be rejected and consequently start ii has never entered into force speed in implementation when the united states alters its nuclear force posture through unilateral re ductions without the elimination provisions of formal treaty the changes can take place rela tively quickly through standard military practices as was noted above us bombers and minuteman ii missiles were removed from their alert status in matte r of days after president bush announced he would do so in september 1991 nonstr ategic nuclear weapons were removed from deployment in matter of months fu rthermore the absence of concern for the size or structure of russian forces allo ws these changes to proceed without pause there is need to ensure that the russia has also met its obligations on the other hand with unilateral re ductions the united states or russia could choose to implement the changes slow ly this possibility affected the debate in the russian duma against the start ii treaty as time passed before the treaty entered into force some in russia argued that russia did not have the resources to eliminate its ballistic missile submarines nd icbm launchers by 2003 if the treaty did not enter into force russia would s till probably eliminate these weapons systems but it could do so more slowly after the united states and russia agreed to extend the elimination period in start ii to the end of 2007 president putin told the duma that russia would not have to eliminate any of its older systems before the end of their service lives this argument reportedly swayed some members of the duma and convinced them to vote for start ii allows for sweeping change after president bush announced the withdrawal of us landbased and sea based nonstrategic nuc lear weapons in 1991 many analysts praised the measures because they woul d produce sweeping changes in the us nuclear posture the united states would withdraw and eliminate whole categories of nuclear weapons russia pled ged to do the same in contrast some have argued that in negotiating process wh ere both sides seek to maintain balance and seek equivalent limits on their forces formal arms contro l treaties only produce changes at the margins of the us and sovi et nuclear arsenals this observation was not universally true the 1987 inf treaty eliminated whole categories of nuclear weapons intermediaterange ground unched missiles and the 1993 start ii treaty called for relatively deep 50 percent reduction in strategic offensive forces and the elimination of mirved icbms but after 9 years of negotiations start i would eliminate only few thousand st rategic warheads on each side the 1991 pnis promised to eliminate the same number or more after just few weeks of consideration nd consultationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31222crs17 however broader analysis indicates that similar dynamic may be at work in both types of arms reductions review of bilateral arms control treaties since the early 1970s indicates that the united stat and soviet union were not willing to make deep reductions in their offensive nuclear weapons or eliminate entire categories of weapons because both nations believed these weapons were needed to maintain their national security they accepted modest limits on their forces because they were not willing to make sweeping changes in their force postures as long as their relationship remained tense and poten tially hostile in the mid1980s when the united states deployed and then under the inf treaty withdrew intermediaterange missiles from europe the atmosphere between the two nations had begun to change many analysts believe that during the negotiations both sides adopted political objective of improving their relationship this allowed each to accept the elimination of weapons that had played as much of political as military role in europe in the 1980s the start i treaty codified more modest changes but by the time start ii was negotiated in 1992 the soviet union had ceased to exist both nations recognized that this change in the international security environment allowed more sweeping political and military changes hence start ii reduced forces more deeply than start i similarly the 1991 pnis were announced at time when the changing international security envir onment allowed for more robust changes in nuclear forces than had been possible in the preceding year s many of the weapons withdrawn from the us arsenal were of little military utility after the collapse of the warsaw pact the soviet union too had political incentiv to withdraw its nuclear forces from deployment areas in nonrussian republics to strengthen their control and security hence although the united states and s oviet union may have eliminated greater number of weapons through ilateral measures than th ey did through bilateral treaties the sweeping nature of the changes was arguably more sign of the times than result of the mechanism c hosen for announcing the reductions taking political credit during most of the cold war era the concept of unilateral disarmament d strongly negative connotation in the united states it was often used in political discussions by one side when it wanted to accuse the other side of undermining us security by reducing or slowing the growth of us nuclear forces nevertheless the unite d states did alter its nuclear force deployments and force posture during this time often eliminating large numbers of older weapons when particular objective c ould be met with sma ller numbers of new systems other systems such as nucleararmed airdefense missiles and nuclear armed antiballistic missiles were also eliminated when they were deemed to be not costeffective but these changes occu rred without public announcement as part of ongoing modifications to the us military posture in many ways the unila teral reductions president bush announced in 1991 resembled those that had been taken quietly throughout the cold war era he withdrew nuclear weapons that were l onger considered costeffective the shorterrange systems in europe could only reach targets in eastern european nations that were longer considered to be dversaries in addition the potential presence of nonstrategic nuclear weapons on us na val vessels had led so allies such as new zealand to restrict us access to nava l bases on their territories furthermore maintaining and training with those wea pons placed burden on us military forceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31222crs18 even though changing political and military circumstances may have led to the weapons withdrawal without formal presidential announcement president bush could still take credit for and win public praise for changing the us nuclear posture the high public profile that accompanied the presidents televised speech in september 1991 substantially changed the pe rception of unilatera l arms reductions by removing thousands of nonstrategic nuclear weapons from overseas bases and us naval forces and by reducing the ert rates for some u s strategic weapons president bush had according to some broken through the slow pace of negotiated arms control addressed cerns about security and control over soviet nonstrategic nuclear weapons and reduced the nuclear threat flexibility in 1991 president bush announced that many weapons would be eliminated but others including the seabased tomahawk cruise missiles would be retained in storage he said they could be returned to us naval vessels if the need arose this component of the pni hi ghlights one of the key characteristics of unilateral reductions they provide the united states and russia with the ability to reverse the withdrawals and reductions if new threats emerge the united states or russia could withdraw from an arms cont rol treaty to restore forces but as was noted above the political cost of doing so might seem prohibitive unilateral reductions woul d also provide the united states and russia with flexibility in the timing of their reductions in 1991 the united states removed its nuclear forces from alert in matter of days and its nonst rategic weapons from deployment in matter of months but these reductions do not have to be taken quickly they could move more slowly to allow for renewed cons ideration of threats and security needs or to coincide with the normal retirement schedule for weapons system treaties on the other hand ofte n set an arbitrary time line for weapons eliminations which can add to the costs and increase the complexity of the process unilateral reductions weaknesses absence of cooperative monitoring measures when president bush and president gorbachev announced their in tentions to withdraw and eliminate non strategic nuclear forces in 1991 they di d not include any cooperative monitoring measures in their proposals as they had for nearly 30 years the two nations would monitor the forces of the other nation with their own satellites and sensors their national technical means ntm of verification but they would not provide data on the numbers and locations of weapons cove red by the pnis they would not notify each other when they planned to move t hose weapons and they would not invite or permit inspections at storage or deployment areas the united states and russia did discuss their progress in implementing the pnis and provide some data on the status of their weapons during the early 1990s but this lacked the rigor of information required by arms control treaties the absence of cooperative monitori ng measures can reduce nations confidence in its knowledge and understanding of nuclear force deployments in the other nation however in an environmen t where the nations are willing to pursue unilateral reductions this re duced confidence may not be problem

usrussian relationship in the postsoviet period may have further reduced the need fo r specific cooperative measur to monitor unilateral reductions the united states and russia have implemented variety of different onsite inspections and have provided each other with va st quantities of data under the start i treaty they could extend these measures through the next decade even after completing start i implementa tion to provide adde d information about the status of the unilateral reductions furthermore representatives from the us government and us industries are pr esent at military facilities in russia to implement projects funded by the n unnlugar cooperative threat reduction program their presence provides the unite d states with deta iled information about the status of some of russias nuclear weapons however the ctr program is not complete substitute for cooperative monito ring measures russian officials do not have an equivalent presence at us facilities difficulties in verifying compliance the ability to monitor forces and activities in another nation is only part of what is needed to verify compliance with arms control agreements before one na tion can determine whether the other nation has met its obligations it must have cl ear understanding of the nature of those obligations in bilateral treaties this understanding is provided by the detailed definitions collateral requirements and precise limits on forces covered by the treaty unilateral reductions often lack this precision even the best monitoring data cannot answer questions of whether nation has satisfied its obligations when there is uncertainty about the steps required or wh nation is free to reverse its decision this problem became evident in early 2001 when press reports indicated that russia had deployed nonstrategic nuclear weapons in kaliningrad29 this enclave which is physically separate but politically part of russia served as major soviet military installation and probably housed significant numbers of nonstrategic nuclear weapons prior to the 1991 withdrawal s russia denied that it had deployed nuclear weapons to kaliningrad in mid 2000 but the united states reportedly detected their movement and pres ence with its satellite technology30 the potential deployment of russian nuclear weapons in this enclave which is surrounded by nations that will become part of the european economic union raised concerns among many us and european officials some noted that russia might be trying to pressure the eu and nato to contain their expansion plans however the united states and its allies in europe had little legal recourse when president gorbachev announced that he would move nonstrategic nuclear weapons from deployment to storage ar eas he did not indi cate which categoryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31222crs20 applied to the facilities in kaliningrad regardless he was under legal obligation to move weapons out of the enclave and he did not state that he would even if the weapons were moved to storage areas in russia that nation is under legal obligation to keep nuclear weapons out of kaliningrad in the absence of well defined legally binding obligations russia can store and deploy its nuclear weapons at any site on its territory potential for destabilizing reversal as is noted above those who support the use of unilateral measures rather than bilateral trea ties to reduce nuclear weapons argue that the flexibility permitted by these measures and the ability to reverse them if conditions warra nt is one of their key stre ngths however reversing the reductions can lead to uncertainty and instability the absence of welldefined obligations and the absence of precise in formation about those forces can lead to further uncertainties about ployments and intentions furthermore if one nation feels threatened by the others actions it too could choose to reverse its unilateral measures if both nations then feel in secure or threatened and both lack clear information about the status of the others forces the balance between the two could be unstable resulting in rearmame nt race or escalation of crisis some analysts argue that the reversal of unilateral reduc tions should not prove destabilizing in the current environment because the nations chose to reduce their forces regardless of the others force posture s an increase in the others forces would not necessarily be seen as threatening furthermore the united states and russia maintain many channels fo r communication and therefore would be able to defuse any crisis before it escalated review of the bush administration proposal as was noted above president bush announced that he would reduce us strategic nuclear weapons to between 1700 and 2200 warheads over the next 10 years although he initially stated th at he would do this unilaterally without codifying the reductions in treaty he has since to sign an agreement completed in midmay 2002 this agreement incorporates many of the adminis trations preferred positions such as the absence of any rules requiring the elimination of delivery vehicles or nondeployed warheads th counting of only those warheads actually deployed on operational deliv ery vehicles long imple mentation period short withdrawal period and date on which the treaty will expire unless the parties agree to continue its limits the treaty also contains provisions calling for the extension of the start i verification regime and the two sides reportedly will continue to seek agreement on additional transparency measures that would allow them to gain an understanding of the status of the othe r sides deployed forces the remainder of this report reviews the administration pr oposals that comprise this agreement to determine how it incorporates the stre ngths ands weaknesse s identified above strengths speed in decisionmaking when president bush announced his decision to reduce us offensive nuclear weapons he had been in office just over 9 monthshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31222crs21 during the presidential campaign and his first months in office he had stated that he would make this decision after the depar tment of defense completed review of us nuclear posture this study began in early 2001 and was completed by the end of the year the united states and russia then held discussions for an additional 5 months before they completed an agreemen t based on the presidents proposals this time frame is significantly shorter than the 9 years of negotiations on start i and about the same as the year it took to comp lete start ii although the united states can begin to reduce its forces as soon as congress appropriates the need funds this schedule could be slowed bit by the need for senate advice and consent to ratification and the pproval of the russian duma ho wever early reports indicate that both legislatures are likely to offer their approval with little delay although the president announced his deci sion relatively quickly many of the force structure changes he has authorized have been under consideration for more than 7 years they are the same changes that would have occurred if the start ii treaty had entered into force thes include the elimination of 50 peacekeeper icbms the elimination or conversion of 4 trident ballistic missile submarines and the downloading of all 500 minuteman iii icbms so that they carry one instead of 3 warheads dod approved these changes in the us nuclear force structure in 1994 but the services have been unable to implement them because congress prohibited the use of funds for this purpose until start ii entered into force other measures such as the idea to count only ope rational weapons rather than to use the counting rules in start i and start ii have been under consideration since 1997 when the united states and russia agreed in principle to reduce their forces to between 2000 and 2500 warheads in future start iii treaty speed in implementation president bush has stated and the new agreement confirms that the united states will reduce its offensive nuclear forces over 10 years this time frame is longer than the 7year elimination period outlined in start i and equal to the 10 years initially expected for start ii some of the changes in us forces may occur relatively quickly over the next 34 years but as is noted above the departme nt of defense has been wa iting and preparing to make these changes for several years several factors could slow the implementation of these reductions first even though the united states may not follo w the complex elimination procedures outlined in start i the process of d eactivating and disman tling nuclear weapons can still be timeconsuming warheads must be removed transported and secured in storage areas missile stages with highly explosive fuel must be handled carefully and stored safely the process of decommi ssioning or altering submarines so that they can perform other missions may also take several years finally the administration may plan to re tain some weapons for time to assess changes in the international security environment and to reduce or eliminate them in future years sweeping change and taking credit after president bush announced his planned reductions in u s strategic nuclear wea pons analysts and observers commented on the depth of the reductions that would be achieved by this initiativehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31222crs22 31gordon michael us arsenal treaties vs n ontreaties new york times november 14 2001 the united states currently can deploy between 7000 and 7500 warheads on its strategic offensive delivery vehicles see appendix 32ibid 33the details behind this analysis and calculation appear in the appendix 34press briefing the white house office fo the press secretary november 15 2001some noted that it represented reducti on of twothirds from current levels31 however as was noted above the depar tment of defense has planned for the elimination of many the w eapons covered by this initiative since 1994 when it identified force consistent with the start ii treaty in addition in 1997 presidents clinton and yeltsin agreed that the two sides would reduce their forces to between 2000 and 2500 warheads under prospective start iii treaty they never reached agreement on the formal rms of treaty but the willingness they demonstrated in 1997 indicates that the initiatives announced by the bush administration do not represent sweep ing change in thinking about the number of nuclear weapons needed to safe guard us national security to the contrary the president has stated that the united states will reduce its forces to between 1700 and 2200 operationally deployed warheads this accounting is likely to exclude submarines that are in overhaul and possibly some of the weapons on the bomber force that w ould have counted under the rules used to attribute warheads to delivery ve hicles under start i and start ii32 depending on how many delivery vehicles remain in the us force including these warheads in the calculation could increase the acc ountable number of warheads to over 2700 hence the bush proposal could result in fewer changes to us forces than would have been necessary if the united states had concluded start iii treaty along the lines of the 1997 framework33 nevertheless because the clinton administration completed neither the ratification process for start ii nor the negotiations on start iii president bush can take credit for implementing the reductions in us forces because congess has removed the prohibition on deac tivation from the defense authorization bill he will be able to be gin to deactivate and dismantle strategic forces in fy2002 flexibility the president and many of his advisors have highlighted the fact that unilateral reductions provide greater flexibility than bilateral treaties they often note that the united states will be able to begin and complete the reductions more quickly eliminating weapons that are long er needed for us national security some analysts who support the presidents pproach have also argued that unilateral reductions provide the united states with the ability to increase its forces if conditions change although the presiden t mentioned during his press conference with president putin that the united states would destroy warheads removed from us nuclear forces this is not likely to happen in the near term according to condoleezza rice the presidents national security adviser the united states is more likely to move the warheads so that they are not near the places at which they could be deployed their capabilities will not be accessible to the united states34 but she added that it will take

disposition is unclear they could remain in storage as part of the us stockpile for many years this flexibility is likely to remain in the treaty the united states and russia have agreed to sign in

the treaty also will not contain any sublimits that the sides must comply with during the elimination period and it does not contain any provisions that are would affect how each side chooses to structure its forces within the 17002000 warhead limit furthermore either side will be able to withdraw after giving 90 days notice hence even after it signs this treaty the united states could restore warheads removed in the next few years to its deployed forces if the united states retained the force structure outlined in the appendix and if it restored 3 warheads to each minuteman iii icbm 8 warheads to each trident slbm on 14 trident submarines and between 12 and 20 nucleararmed cruise missiles to each b52 bomber it could build to force of betw een 5500 and 6 000 warheads on its strategic offensive nuclear weapons although it is unlikely that the united states could restore large number of warheads in short period of time it might still be able to add several hundred warheads to its bombers or missiles in crisis weaknesses cooperative monitoring and verification of compliance t h presidents proposal did not include any sp ecial provisions to allow for cooperative monitoring of us and russian nuclear fo rces however in the short treaty based on these proposals the united states and ru ssia have agreed to continue operating the verification regime outlined in the start i treaty start i provides for number of onsite inspections that would otherwise end in the coming years the parties may also continue to discuss their concerns in the joint compliance and inspection commission jcic established by the treaty in addition they have agreed to seek additional transparency measures that will enhance their ability to monitor the other sides forces they had hoped to agree on these measures before the treaty was signed but absent that th ey are likely to continue the negotiations after the moscow summit even if the united states and russia continue to monitor reductions in their forces with cooperative measures questions could arise about compliance with the obligations to reduce forces the absen ce of precise definitions of terms like operationally deployed forces and uncer tainties about the eventual disposition of warheads removed from operational for ces could create misunderstandings and disagreements russia in particular may grow concerned about the size and status of the remaining us nuclear arsenal this may be of little concern in the current environment where there is cooperative re lationship between the united states and russia the presidents proposal for unilate ral reductions is premised on the fact thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31222crs24 36see for example cirincione joseph and j on b wolfsthal what if the strategic framework goes bad arms c ontrol today november 2001 nuclear weapons and arms control longer serve as central features in the relationship between the two nations therefore disagreements about the implementation of re ductions in these weapons may not undermine or interfere with cooperation in other areas of the relationship some critics of the administrations approach argue however that the absence of codified limits and restrictions precise definitions and verification provisions could lead to disputes that might undermin the usrussian relationship since the positive relationship between the united states and russia might change in the future such uncertainties and concerns could prove destabilizing potential for destabilizing reversal in the past russian officials have objected to arms control provisions that provide the united states with the ability to increase its forces relatively quickly specifically they complained about the upload potential that united states w ould have had under start ii if it reduced its forces by removing warheads from deployed missiles similar criticism emerged during the us and russian discussions bout the content of the new treaty the united states will retain significant upload capability if it reduces its forces by removing additional warheads instead of dismantling missiles and submarines and declares that weapons in overhaul should not count against operational totals russia could seek to balance this us advant age by increasing the warheads on its own icbms russias new icbm the ss27 has b een tested with only one warhead but many experts agree that russia could retain its older missiles and deploy the new ss 27 with 3 or 4 warheads if it feared that its forces were declining more quickly and deeply than us forces but if russia deployed greater number of warheads by retaining mirved icbms us official s and defense planners might choose to restore warheads to the us force to offset russias increase the bush administration has argued that the new relationship between the united states and russia has eliminated this type of calculation from the two nations force planning processes neither nation needs to consider the forces of the other when sizing its own forces yet critics ve noted that although this may be true in the political relationship between the nations it is not necessar ily true among military planners the us military still appears to determine us nuclear requirements with consideration for the ability to deter russia by threatening unacceptable damage against range of russian targets and russia still appears to consider us nuclear forces as threat to its security according to some the potential for instability could increase as the united states withdraws from the abm treaty and deploys missile defenses that russia might view as threat to its offensive forces from russias perspective the combination of robust ssile defenses and uncertainty about the potential number of operational wa rheads in us offensive forces could lead to grave concerns about russias security and pr essure within the russian military for increases in russias deployed nuclear forces36httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31222crs25 conclusion over the years the united states and russia have used both bilateral treaties and unilateral reduc tions to reduce their nuclear forces on balance it appears that unilateral measures may offer the opportun ity for more rapid and comprehensive reductions than bilateral treaties but treaties if they contain precise definitions detailed restrictions and cooperative monitoring provisions may do more than unilateral measures to promote and ensure stability some argue that stability and predictability are less important in the current environment than they have been in the past because the relationship between the united states and russia has improved and now reflects cooperation and consultation across much wider range of issues others however argue that this relationship could change in the future they argue that if it does comprehensive web of arms control agreements could provide predictability and transparency to ease concerns about nuclear weaponshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31222crs26 appendix us nuclear forces under arms control scenarios start i start i limits the united states and russia to 6000 warheads on 1600 strategic offensive delivery vehicles with more than 4900 warheads on landbased intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms c ounting rules assign number of warheads to each type of miss ile and bomber the number of warheads assigned to icbms and slbms usually quals the number actually deployed on that type of missile but bom bers equipped with cruise missiles count as 10 warheads even though they can carry up to 20 wea pons and bombers not equipped with cruise missiles count as one warhea d regardless of the number of weapons they can carry the treaty allows downloading of wa rheads to reduce the number of warheads attributed and carried on some multiple warhead mirved missiles start i contains 7year implement ation period which ended on december 5 2001 the strategic nuclear forces that c

delivery vehicles the treaty also bans all multiple warhead icbms mirved icbms as under start i the parties can reduce their deployed warheads and eliminate mirved icbms by downloading or removing warheads from deployed missiles but the parties can remove at most 4 warheads from each missile so icbms with 10 warheads must be eliminated rather than downloaded the treaty makes an exception for the russian ss19 missile which carries 6 warheads russia can remove 5 warheads fro m 105 of these missiles so that they will remain as singlewarhead missiles unlike start i however the counting rules for start ii do not discount the number of warheads on bombers they count as the number of weapons they are equipped to ca rry consequently there is difference between the number of attributed warhead s and the number of actual warheads and weapons on us deployed forces the start ii treaty has not entered into force and the bush administration has not indicated that it will complete the ratification process however in 1994 as part of the nuclear posture review the department of defens identified force structure consistent with the start ii limits this appears on table 2 table 2 us

this treaty would limit each side to be tween 20002500 strategic nuclear warheads by december 31 2007 the parties also hoped that the new treaty would use the same counting rules and downloading rules for ballistic missiles as start i and the same counting rules for bombers as star t ii ie bombers would count as thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31222crs28 number of weapons they were equipped to carry because start ii never entered into force the united states and russia never opened formal negotiations on start iii they held several r ounds of informal discussions but they remained far apart on the details of the limits and provisions they wanted in the treaty table 3 below illustrates force structure for the united states that would have been consistent with limit of 2500 warhead s it assumes that the united states would download its trident slbms to carry 4 warheads instead of 8 warheads consistent with the start i rule limitin g the amount of warheads removed from missile to 4 it also assumes that each b52 bomber that could carry nuclear weapons would be equipped to carry 12 cruise missiles the re mainder of the b52 bombers would either be eliminated or converted so that they could only perform nonnuclear missions the force structure in table 3 eliminates some of each type of us nuclear weapon but this is just illustrative th united states could have retained more bombers or icbms for example if it had eliminated more trident submarines table 3 illustrative us strategic nuclear forces consistent with start iii system launchers attributed warheadsactual warheads weapons

for start iii the air force and navy expressed concerns about the options for re ducing us forces pa rticularly if start iii relied on the same c ounting rules as start i and start ii the navy did not want to eliminate trident submarines and possibly consolidate its fleet at one base on one ocean they are currently deployed in bangor washington and kings bay georgia because this would interfere with the submarines operations and their ability to cover their targets the air force did not want to eliminate b52 bombers because they are often needed for conve ntional missions and it did not want to convert some of the bombers so that they could not carry cruise missiles because the aircraft have been used to launch conventi onal longrange cruise missiles in conflicts both services pressed for changes in the counting rules so that they could exclude some of their delivery vehicles from the treatys limits without altering or eliminating them bush administration proposal by altering the measure of account for us nuclear forces from attributed warheads to operationally deployed warheads the administrations proposal relieves the pressure that would have been imposed by start iii to liminate ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31222crs29 nuclear delivery vehicles specifically the united states could retain the same force structure as it planned to deploy under start ii as table 4 below indicates the navy could retain all 14 trident submarines that had been planned for start ii but the number of operationally deployed warheads on those submarines could declin below start ii levels for example without the start i provision that limits downloading to only 4 warheads from each missile the navy could deploy trident missiles with 3 warheads instead of 8 in addition the navy could exclude trid ent submarines in overhaul because they would not carry any operationally deployed warheads similarly the air force could retain all 76 b52 bombers and reduce the number of operationally deployed warheads in its force without altering an aircraft if it c ounted only operationally deployed longrange nucleararmed cruise missiles rather than the total number of cruise missiles the bombers we re equipped to carry to bring us forces below the 2200 limit the table below assumes that this number will decline to around 500 cruise missiles over the next 10 years table 4 also lists the number of warheads that would be attributed to identified force structure if start counting rules were used to calculate warheads specifically this number includes all 14 tr ident submarines and counts 4 warheads on each trident missile it also attributes 12 cruise missiles to each of the 76 b52 bombers if some of the bombers were equipped to carry 20 cr uise missiles this number would be 1520 rather than 912 as is evident on the table the number of warheads attributed to this force by start counting rules exceeds the number of operationally deployed warheads by more than 500 table 4
