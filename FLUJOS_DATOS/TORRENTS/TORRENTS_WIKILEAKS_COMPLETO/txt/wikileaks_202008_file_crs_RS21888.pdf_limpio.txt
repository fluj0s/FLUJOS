holding the court abrogated the rule set out in ohio v roberts4 which made said statements admissible if the court deemed them reliable crawford v washington facts and proceedings petitioner michael crawfor d was tried and convicted for stabbing man kenneth lee when crawford was arrested the detectives interrogated him and his wife sylvia twice eventually crawford confessed that they had gone to lees apartment looking for him because crawford was upset over an earlier incident in which lee had allegedly tried to rape crawfords wife after finding lee fight broke out in which crawford stabbed lee5 crawford and sylvia both gave the detec tives similar accounts of the events leading up to the fight crawford stated that he could swear he had seen lee going for something before right before everything ppened and that he thought lee had pulled something out and crawford wa s cut when he grabbed for it6 however sylvias account of the fight was arguably different from crawfo rds particularly with respect to whether lee had drawn weapon before crawford assaulte d him sylvia stated that lee had lifted his arms up when crawford came up to him then lee reached into his righthand pocket just before crawford stabbed him lee then fell to the ground with his hands open sylvia did not notice any weapons in his hands at that time7 crawford was charged with assault and attempted murder at trial he claimed self defense his wife did not testify at trial because of the state marital privilege8 since in the state of washington the marital privilege does not extend to statements made outof court the state sought to introduce sylvias statement to the detectives under hearsay exception9 the state intended for the statement to refute the selfdefense argument in response crawford argued that admitting the statement would violate his sixthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21888crs3 10 id at 66 the rule set out in roberts also allowed statements from unavailable witnesses to be admitted

unavailable witnesss statements if the statement bears adequate indicia of reliability and bears par ticularized guarantees of trustworthiness10 the prosecution played the tape for the jury and argued during closing argument that it was damning evidence that completely re futed crawfords claim of selfdefense11 the jury convicted crawford of assault on appeal the washington court of appeals reversed the finding in reversing the court applied test to determine if sylvias statement bore particularized guarantees of trustworthiness12 the washington supreme court reinstated the conviction on the grounds that sylvias statement did b ear guarantees of trustworthiness13 the court found that sylvias statement overla pped crawfords statement they were virtually identical and neither statement clearly st ated that lee had weapon in hand at the time of the stabbing14 crawford petitioned the supreme court for review and the court granted certiorari15 the issue presented was whether the states use of sylvias statement violated the confrontation clause on march 8 2004 th court reversed the judgment of the washington supreme court and remanded the case holding that the states use of sylvias statement violated the confrontation clause because as far as testimonial evidence is concerned confrontation is the only indicium of reliability sufficient to satisfy constitutional demands16 history of the c onfrontation clause as noted the confrontation clause provides that in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him 17 in deciding the case the court found that the constitution alone did not resolve the case since witnesses against defendant may mean those who actually testify at trial those whose statements are offered at trial or something inbetween18 accordingly the court found it necessary to examine the historical background of the confrontation clause to understand its meaning httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21888crs4

us 237 243 1895 cf houser 26 mo at 433 435the court found that the concept of an accuse ds right to confront his or her accuser dates back to the roman times19 however the source of the concept for the constitution was the english common law20 of particular interest to the court was the trial of sir walter raleigh for treason in that trial raleigh had been implicated by an alleged accomplice lord cobham in an examinati on before the privy council and in letter21 raleigh arguing that the proof of the common law is by witness and jury demanded that the judges call cobham to appear at the trial22 the judges refused and raleigh was consequently sentenced to death after the raleigh trial the courts developed unavailability rules admitting examinations only if the witness was unable to testify in person23 around the time of the american revoluti on many declarations of rights were adopted by the states which guar anteed right of confrontation24 in addition the first congress included the confrontation clause in proposal to amend the constitution this became the sixth amendment25 the court reasoned that this history suppor ted two inferences about the meaning of the sixth amendment first the principal evil at which the confrontation clause was directed was the civil law mode of crimin procedure particularly the use of ex parte examinations as evidence against the accused26 therefore the court rejected the view that the confrontation clause applies only to incourt testimony and that the applicability to outofcourt statements introduced at trial depends on the rules of evidence27 second the court reasoned that the framers woul d not have allowed ad mission of testimonial statements of witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify and the defendant had had prior opportunity for crossexamination28 the court noted that the text of the sixth amendment does not suggest that the courts can develop exceptions to the confrontation clause but ra ther that only those exceptions established at the time of its creation are allowed29 based on its interpretation of the historical sources the court concluded that prior oppor tunity to crossexamine was necessaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21888crs5 30 id at 13661377 31 roberts 448 us at 66 32 crawford 124 sct at 1371 33 id 34 id at 1374 35 id 36 id the court states that they leave for anot her day any effort to spell out comprehensive definition of testimonialnot merely sufficient condition for testim onial statements to be admitted against an accused30 ohio v roberts before its decision in crawford the court had allowed narrow class of exceptions to the mandatory confrontation of the sixth amendment in ohio v roberts 1980 the court had established the reliability exception ruling that certain witness statements could be allowed into evidence without cro ssexamining the witness if judge found that the statements were sufficiently reliable so as to be trustworthy31 in deciding crawford the court overruled roberts on the basis that admitting testimony which has not been subject to crossexamination on mere judicial determination of reliability is akin to dispensing with jury trial becau defendant is obviously guilty32 that the court stated was not what the sixth amendment prescribes33 therefore the court concluded that for testimonial evidence from witness not appearing in court to be admissible against an accused the witness must be unavailable and the accused must have had prior opportunity to crossexamine the witness34 holding in sum the court held that the lowe r court failed to ta ke into account the constitutional requirement of confrontation that the statement be subject to cross examination when admitting sylvias statement to the police at trial the lower court had relied on the supreme courts prior holding in ohio v roberts which allowed hearsay statements to be admitted at trial based on judicial finding of reliability however in crawford the court held that the r eliability test announced in ohio v roberts was contrary to constitutional requirements the court limited its holding to testimonial evidence stating that where nont estimonial hearsay is at issue it is consistent with constitutional requirements to afford the states flexibility in their development of hearsay law35 however the court did not provide comprehensive definiti on of what qualifies as testimonial evidence except to say that at minimum it includes testimony at preliminary hearing grand jury or at form er trial and statements made during police interrogations36 the court stressed that the confrontation clause does not place any constraints in the use of prior testimonial statements when the declarant appears at trial and it does not bar the use of testimonial stat ements for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted furthermore the court left the door open for possible exception to

that it is possible that the sixth amendment incorporates an exception for testimonial dying declarations however it did not rule so conclusively37 chief justice rehnquist joined by jus tice oconnor concurred in the result but dissented from the majoritys decision to overrule roberts they found that the courts interpretation and historical analysis of the confrontation clau were unnecessary to decide the case instead they wrote the courts holding in idaho v wright38 where the court held that an outofcourt statement is not admissible simply because its truthfulness is corroborated by other evidence at trial wa s dispositive of the case furthermore they criticized the court for not providing definition of testimonial evidence since it created uncertainty for future trials39 commentators have suggested that crawford is one of the most important supreme court decisions for the criminal litigator in recent years40 crawford significantly changes what outofcourt statements will be admissible against criminal defendant at trial it replaces the reliability analysis for admissi on of outofcourt statem ents of unavailable witnesses and replaces it with th requirement of prior opportun ity to crossexamine the holding in crawford could potentially impact numbe r of hearsay exceptions used currently to admit statements from unavailable witnesses however the extent of its impact on the hearsay exceptions is yet to be determined as the court did not provide concrete definition of testimonial eviden ce until the court provides definition of testimonial evidence it will be up to prosecutors and defense attorneys to argue the issue in court
