us dollar and the dollar was defined in terms of gold countries could devalue th eir currencies only if they were faced with in the original language of article iv fundament disequilibrium in their economy and only if the imf approved international capita l movements were restricted and cumbersome that world has now largely disappeared since the 1970s the relative value of most major curre ncies is determined by world currency markets and the daily volume of interna tional currency movement s far surpasses the volume of currency circulating in most ma jor countries article iv was amended in 1976 to repl ace the fixedparity exchange rate system with new procedures for enhanced surveillance in the new world of flexible exchange rates this has led over time to the imf having basically the same customer base as the multilateral development banks mdbs while the imfs core concerns are macroeconomic and exchange rate stability many of the factors the imf now takes into account in its surveillance and loan programs are similar to those the mdbs consider in their development programs the imf is monetary institution not development agency nevertheless grow th and development are among the purposes specified in its articles of agreement and its activities can have significant impact on the economic prospects of its borrower countries many ideas have been put forward in recent years suggesting ways the imf world bank and other international financial institutions ifis might be restructured or reformed this report looks at propos als which have been made to alter the structure of the imf to change its format add or eliminate programs restrict the scope of its lending prog rams and limit the scope of its loan conditionality this report discusses seve n proposed

better coordination between the imf and world bank and 7 expand the imf each is discussed and an alyzed in this way the report hopes to give readers better understanding of the ba sic issues and choices which affect the future direction of the imf there are many avenues by which congre ss can influence this debate congress must approve any increase in imf or worl d bank funding it also frequently enacts legislation or includes direc tives in reports specifying goals the united states should pursue in the ifis the united states n eeds the support of other countries however if it wishes to effect change in the policies procedures or structure of the imf and the mdbs many of the alte rnatives listed above require changes in the international agencies articles of agreement this requires an 85 majority vote other changes may be effected by simple majority ho wever this requires broad consensus of support among the advanced industrial c ountries their views on these issues are often quite different from t hose expressed by policy make rs from the united states this report will be updated onl if major developments re quire changes to be

perhaps south korea in 1997 has borrowed from the imf since the united kingdoms last standby expired in january 19791 the imfs articles of agreem ent were rewritten in 1976 to take account of the new realities caused by the system of flexible exchange rates the imf now has basically the same deve loping country customer base as the multilateral development banks mdbs the balance of payments bop problems of developing countries are often deeper nd harder to resolve than those of the imfs prior customer base while the imfs goals and core concerns macroeconomic and exchange rate stability differ from those of the mdbs many of the factors the imf now takes into acc ount in its surveillance and loan programs are similar to those they consider in their development programs2 the imf is monetary institution not development agency nevertheless growth and development are among the purposes specifi ed in its articles of agreement and its activities can have substa ntial impact on the economic prospects of its borrower countries3 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32432crs2 3 continued and balanced growth of international trade promoting high levels of employment and real income and the

safeguards for repayment thus providing them with opportunity to correct ma ladjustments in their balance of payments without resorting to measures destructive of national or international prosperity and 6 to shorten with such loans the duration and to lessen the degree of disequilibrium in the international balances of payments of members 4 more specifically article iv requires that each country i endeavor to direct its economic and financial policies towards the obj ective of fostering orderly economic growth with reasonable price stability with due regard to its circumstances ii seek to promote stability by fostering underlying economic and financial conditions and monetary system that does not tend to produce erratic disruptions iii avoid manipulating exchange rates or the international monetary system in orde r to prevent effective balance of payments adjustment or to gain unfair advantage over other members and iv follow exchange rate policies compatible with the undertakings of this section in many respects the imfs role in the world economy is much different than it was before bop lending c ontinues to be principal focus of imf activity to help countries correct maladjustments in their balance of payments without resorting to practices damaging to the world monetary system however with the end of the fixedparity exchange rate system the imfs role in relation to exchange rates has changed substantially in 1976 new language was added to article iv requiring countries to pursue economic policies whic h generate orderly economic growth with reasonable price stability and monetary system which does not produce erratic disruptions of the intern ational monetary system4 the imf was told to exercise firm surveillance over the exchange rate po licies of members nd to adopt specific principles for the guidance of all members with respect to those policies the imf was given disciplinary tools however to exercise these functions currency values are determined in the marketplace based partly on the strength of countrys foreign exchange reserves but mainly on the strength of its national economic policies and the markets c onfidence that sound policies will be maintained the imf has role in exchange markets article iv now directs the imf to consult annually with each imf memb er country about its exchange rate and other economic policies the staff submits an article iv consultation report to the executive board annually summarizing th discussions and assessing economic conditions for each country article xii sa ys that without the permission of the country involved the imf may not publish information about these consultations since 1997 however the imf successfully persuaded an increasing number of countries to allow publication of their artic iv reports the imf has also expanded its technical assistance func tions and broadened its role as source of data about economic conditions and ec onomic performance in its developing countries it is in this context that debate arises about the imfs purpose its policies and it operating procedures some analysts argu that with the end of the fixedparity system the imf is longer needed and it should be abolished others say the imfhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32432crs3 is still vital but it needs to be restructured and its operations refocused still others suggest that new functions should be dded to the imf and its role in the international monetary sy stem should be expanded much of the discussion about the imfs role centers on the issue of mission creep the idea that the imf has broadene d its agenda taken on new functions and expanded its mission into new areas not cont emplated or perhaps not intended by its founders not everybody agrees that there has been mission creep many believe the imfs basic mission has not changed but because of changes in the world financial system it has had to evolve new procedures and new criteria in order to carry out its mission successfully analysts critics and noncr itics alike agree that broad interpretation of the imfs articles of agreement has been necessary to justify its new activities and its increased emphasis on poverty and economic velopment this has raised to greater extent than before questions i n congress and elsewhere about possible overlap between the activities of the imf and those of the mdbs particularly the world bank in developing countries box the international financial institutions the international monetary fund imf makes loans to help countries address financial or balance of paym ents crises the imf is monetary institution not development bank it does not finance projects or programs its principal responsibilities include stability of the worl ds monetary system and oversight of its member countries exchange rate and economic systems the world bank is multilateral development bank mdb which makes loans and some grants to promote poverty alleviation economic development and growth and economic policy reform in w and middleincome countries two of its facilities the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd and international developmen t association ida lend directly to governments to finance projects and prog rams the ibrd lends at marketbased interest rates ida aid is highly concessional and is available only to lowincome countries they also make nonproject loans to promote economic policy and institutional reform two other facilities the international finance corporation ifc and multilateral investment guarantee agency miga also work with private firms to promote private sector growth the regional development banks are mdbs which operate in specific areas of the world they are independent bodies not subsidiaries of the world bank the united states is member of four re gional banks the african development bank afdb asian development bank adb european bank for reconstruction and development ebrd and interamerican

http wwwtreasury govau type authors names in the keyword boxoverlap with world bank activities whether one sees imf and world bank overl ap as problem or necessity will depend on ones expectations about their ro in the world economy some believe they have distinct goals and unique functions any overlap in their activities is deemed unnecessary others believe the imf and world bank share global agenda yet retaining their own set of core activities t hough some have made proposals others find it hard to separate the issues which should be the exclusive responsibility of the fund from those which should be th exclusive jurisdiction of the bank as peoples expectations differ this debate will likely continue for some time congress will be an active participant through its oversight and appropriations role mission creep or ffective adaptation what some people call mission creep others call effective adaptation on the part of the imf to new conditions and ne w requirements the issue of mission creep has both functional and legal dimensions the imfs independent internal evaluation unit summarized the question in 2002 report the international community increasingly looks to the imf to help developing countries particularly the poorest implement and maintain policies and institutions needed for the achievement of sustainable growt h the fundamental objectives of the imf as set out in article i of the articles of agreement are sufficiently broad that they could encompass such an expanded role however this raises the basic question of where legitimate adaptation of roles ends and where inappropriate mission creep begins5 parkinson and mckissack senior offi cials with the australian treasury explained the issue in 2003 repor t prepared for their government6 in part they say mission creep occurred at the behest of the imfs shareholders who asked the fund to pay more attention to range of areas only loosely related to its original purpose they cite for example the imfs increased attention to military expenditures poverty reducti on and economic growth in addition they say pressure for the imf to expand the scope of its activity has also arisen as changes have taken place in its membership with the end of the cold war they note countries with very different types of economic systems s ought to make the transition to market economies likewise the imf f ound that many of the basic monetary and financial institutions in these countri and in developing countries were dysfunctional in ways that made more difficult the traditional application of macroeconomic conditionality consequently they say the imf gave more consideration to institutional and structural issues because of their implications for macroeconomic stability and growthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32432crs5 7 article iv of the imfs articles of agreemen t specifies that the imf shall exercise firm surveillance over the exchange rate policies of members and shall adopt specific principals for the guidance of all members with respect to those policies to carry out that duty imf staff meet annually with senior officials of each member country to assess its economic condition and its compliance with fundapproved standards and guidelines an annual article iv consultation report is prepared for each country if the country permits each report is posted on

transnational law 41153 2002 9 quoted in graham bird suitable case fo r treatment understanding the ongoing debate about the imf third world quarterly 224 2001 82348 parkinson and mckissack report that ther are some 40 separate issues covered in every imf article iv surveillance report7 ultimately they say the key issue in mission creep is knowing where to stop almost any economic issue can be linked in some way to macroeconomic policy they conclude but lines should be drawn and not all of them need be considered the temptation to expand might be diminished they propose if the funds technical assi stance functions were shifted to other international agencies and it consulted with them instead some critics argue that the imf must re duce the scope of its operations because they say its new functions and activities violate the terms of its articles of agreement hockett says that from gal point of view however the question of mission creep is clear8 the imf board of governors s final authority to interpret the imfs articles if new measures are ju stified by its reading of the articles and by reference to exigencies and changes in the world economy and the world financial system he said that is legally the end of the matter arguments that the imf must drop these concerns because they are not in cluded in its articles are based he said on unsound legal premises the question he concluded is not whether the imf has the authority to deal with issues which go beyond the area of macroeconomic and exchange rate policy but whether its attention to these concerns is appropriate and whether other international agencies ar better positioned to deal with them early beginnings it was originally thought at bretton woods that the imf would focus on the shortterm and on monetary and balance of payments bop issues while the bank would look at the longrun and concer n itself with economic development production growth and project support this division of labor was spelled out in 1966 internal memorandum the imf would ve jurisdiction for exchange rates and restrictive systems for adjustment of temporary balance of payments disequilibria and for evaluating and assisting members to work out stabilization programs as sound basis for economic advice the banks responsibility would be for the composition and appropriateness of development programs and project

and c ountry services department available through the world bank website at httpwwwworldbankorg type title in inquiry boxthe imf had concluded in the early 1970s however that payments deficits could be caused by structural problems in countrys economy and longterm assistance was needed to address them in 1974 it created the extended fund facility eff to make longterm loans to promote bop stability through basic change in institutions and the structure of the borrowers economy under the 1966 agreement this task was entirely within the jurisdiction of the world bank in 1976 the imf began making longterm lowinte rest stabilization loans to poor countries through the enhanced structural adjustme nt facility esaf and its predecessors in 1999 the esaf was refocused and re named the poverty reduction and growth facility prgf among other things the prgf plan required the imf to work with the world bank and developing countries to formulate poverty reduction strategy papers prsp which would be supported by its loan pr ogram in the late 1990s in response to series of international financial crises the imf began including institutional and structural chan ge in its loan conditionality the overlap between the functions of the imf and those of the mdbs was not necessarily the result of onesided imf invasion of the other agencies turf in the 1970s when the imf began making loans to promote structural change the mdbs focused primarily on project finance since the early 1980s however the mdbs have expanded their emphasis in areas such as macroeconomic stability and policy change which were traditiona lly seen as the purview of the imf adjustment loans are now major com ponent of the world banks annual loan program from less than 4 of total nding in 1980 adjustment lending has grown substantially in recent years by 1990 it comprised 27 of all world bank lending in 1999 during the world financial crises wh ich followed russias fault of its debt adjustment loans accounted for 53 of th world banks annual aid in the past three years about onethird of the money lent by the world bank has gone for adjustment loans10 the bank is considering plan to rename the program and to call these development policy loans in the future11 however though the word adjustment will be eventually dropped and more emphasis will be put on growth and consultation with civil society the basic requirements for macroeconomic and institutional change will be essentially the same in the newly renamed program as before the regional mdbs have also expanded their levels of lending for adjustmenttype programs only the european bank for reconstruction and development ebrd which has more private sector focus continues to allocate most all its aid fo r investment projects httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32432crs7 12 structural adjustment loan s sals promote broad changes in the structure and policy framework not necessarily macroeconomic of the borrower country these are also now used sometimes to promote change at the s ubnational level sector adjustment loans secals promote institutional and policy chan ge in particular sectors of the economy 13 the imf said later in an assessment of the asian crisis that the sudden collapse of the three countries currencies was due more to poor debt management policies unsound banking institutions and weak bank oversight procedures than to any specific problems with macroeconomic policy see imf recovery from the asian crisis and the role of the imf prepared by imf staff imf issue brief number 0005 june 2002 available from the imf website at httpwwwimforgexternalnpexrib2000062300htmiiadjustment loans are specialized form of bop support in effect in exchange for the loan the country agrees to make sp ecific policy or institutional changes the mdb disburses its funds directly to the countrys central bank these are not used to fund inputs for development projects or velopment activities in most cases the bank expects that countries will use the money for activities with positive development effects12 the developmental impact of an mdb adjustment loan comes not from the activities funded but from the increased productivity and the growth that occurs when the policy and institutional changes specified in the loan conditionality are put into effect since 1995 in recent years the imf and the mdbs have sometimes used their stabilization and adjustment loan programs for common ends in many cases the imf did not have enough money to fund major stabiliza tion program alone or rather it did not want to leave its financial cupboard bare in case more crises occurred while other countries were still repaying their loans to supplement the imfs resources in times of crisis the mdbs have sometimes lent subs tantial amounts for parallel adjustment operations and bilatera l lending agencies have agreed to provide backup financing in case of additional need three instan ces might be cited the asian financial crisis and the recent crises in brazil and argentina which show the imf and multilateral banks working jointly in thei r response to major financial crises asian financial crisis during the asian financial crisis in 1997 and 1998 the world bank and asian development bank adb lent major sums to help south korea indonesia thailand and other countries13 this was the imf reported new breed of economic crisis in s outh korea the imf announced 582 b illion program including 21 billion of its own funds an initial 14 billion pledge from the mdbs and 233 in standby assurances from bilateral lenders the imf said that institutional and structural reform were the heart of its stabilization program however it disbursed all its money in the initial weeks of the crisis and the programs to restructure and strengthen koreas financial institutions were managed by the mdbs the world bank lent 5 billion and the adb lent 4 billion in fast disbursing aid their loans were linked w ith programs to rebuild koreas financial sector improve corporate governance and restructure its competition and labor market policies they also provided technical aid to facilitate action in these areashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32432crs8 14 there was serious concern that argentina might default indeed it was twice overdue on payments and many believed that the loan in 2003 was made to forestall that prospect in march 2004 argentina sdr 107 billion was the third largest borrower after brazilsdr 10 billion and turkey sdr 16 billion for further discussion of the argentine situation see crs report rs21072 the financial crisis in argentina june 5 2003 brazil in november 1998 the imf announced 415 billion stabilization program for brazil of this amount 181 billion was from its own resources 33 billion came from the world bank and interamerican development bank idb and the rest was pledged by various countries the mdb money was disbursed rapidly to help brazil cope with very serious financial crisis however the mdbs targeted their money in ways which also served development objectives to receive the banks social protection and social sector reform loans the brazilian government had to demonstrate that its domestic expend itures for health edu cation and other key social services would be sustained as it strove to achieve the budget reduction goals mandated by it imffunded stabilization program argentina in 2000 and 2001 the imf agreed to lend argentina 14 billion to help it deal with serious and growing balance of payments crisis in january 2001 the fund announced that the argentines had assembled 397 billion financial support package including besides the im f money 5 billion pledged by the world bank and interamerican development bank idb 1 billion from spain and about 20 billion in voluntary refinancing by the private sector in september 2003 the imf agreed to lend an additional 126 billion14 that year the idb lent argentina 19 billion and the world bank lent 11 billion in fast disbursing emergency assistance to help it cope with the financial crisis as in the brazilian case the argentine government had to pledge that it would protect the budgets of priority social programs and maintain the social safety net which help ed children the poor the unemployed and others vulnerable groups two features of the mdbs emergenc aid programs for argentina were particularly interesting first disbur sements of the idb funds were tied to the countrys successful implementation of m easures in the imffunded stabilization program aimed at strengthening the ta x system and improving budgeting and financial management sec ond the world bank funds were used in part for deficit reduction efforts elimination of quasimonies and regularization of salary payments to civil servants clearing up the outstandi ng stock of national and provincial script was central element of the imfs program control of the monetary system was not possible so long as provinces could issue bt and circulate it as currency in these two respects the mdbs used their funds to encourage argentine compliance with key aspects of the imfs program for macr oeconomic and structural reform unlike the korean situation though they did not manage the reform programs themselves coordinating institutional reform these examples show the imf and the mdbs working in synchronized manner to address financial cr ises in developing countries in all three instances the md bs provided fast disbursing money to supplement the imfs program but their c onditionality was targeted to bolster their prime development and anti poverty concerns the mdbs also addressed either through activities they funded or throug h their conditionality some of the keyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32432crs9 15 not everyone agrees that these proposed change s are reforms in the sense that they will make things better many believe that some of the reforms proposed in each of the three categories would be damaging to the ifis hurtf ul to people living in borrower countries and injurious to the world financial system othe rs argue that their proposed reforms will be beneficial for comprehensive bibliography on this subject see nouriel roubinis global macroeconomic and financial site at http wwwsternnyuedu globalmacrostructural or institutional issues which the imf said were at the heart of the problem the imf has expanded its program of techni cal assistance to he lp countries design and implement improvements in their financial and monetary policies and institutions for the most part however major projects for policy and institutional change are funded through projects f unded and supervised by the mdbs alternative directions for the imf many ideas have been put forward in recent years suggesting ways the imf world bank and other international financial institutions might be restructured or reformulated15 on the whole these can be separated into three categories one is concerned about potential changes in the policies of the institutions raising or lowering interest rates including or ex cluding issues such as the environment poverty alleviation labor sta ndards or altering the polic conditions the international financial institutions ifis attach to th eir loans the second looks at possible changes in the ifis procedures altering their systems of governance giving developing countries or other donor count ries the europeans combined vote is double that of the united states larger say in the process or making the institutions operational and decision making procedures more transparent and more open to outside influence th third category involves possible change in the architecture of the international agencies expanding or shrinking the ifis scope of operations shifting functions or tasks from one institution to the other or changing the way the ifis coordinate their operations it is impossible to separate entirely the issues of policy and process from those of structure nevertheless the present discussion focuses on architecture or structural issues since this is the essential issu which underlies most discussion of mission creep what should the ifis be doing and which of them should perform what tasks variety of proposals might be considered some people believe the imf should be abolished substa ntially reduced in size or limited to its original focus on macroec onomic concerns ot hers want clearer line of differentiation between the imf and the mdbs activities and functions should be shifted or transfe rred between the imf and world bank they say in order to reduce overlap and to give each sp ecific area of responsibility finally some believe that the idea of separating the functions of the ifis into separate boxes is an exercise in artificial clarity the work of the imf and the multilateral banks is inextricably linked at the functional level they argue better to put more effort into policy and program coor dination they say rather than stopping the world bank from promoting policy changes or prohibiting im f from looking at institutional factors that might precipitate or exacerbate future financial crisishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32432crs10 16 george p shultz william simon and walter b wriston who needs the imf the wall street journal february 3 1998 shultz is among other things former us secretary of state of the treasury nd of labor simon is former us secretary of the treasury wriston is former chairman and ceo of citicorpcitibank their article was republished and is available through the hoover institutions website at httpwwwimfsiteorgabolishneedsshultzhtml rebuttal articles by lawrence summers former us secretary of the treasury and pr esident of harvard university robert solomon economics journalist and others are also available on the same page abolish the imf proposal shultz simon and wriston wrote in an opinion piece first published in the wall street journal that the imf is ineffective unnecessary and obsolete once the asian crisis was ove r they said it should be abolished16 when the imf intervenes in crisis they said governments and their foreign creditors are rescued but not the people w ho generally suffer massive declines in their standards of living moreover they argued the imf promotes moral hazard because it insulates politicians and foreign creditors from the consequences of bad economic and financial decisions because the imf stands ready to protect them in times of crisis shultz simon and wriston write lenders make risky loans and countries pursue unsound policies and avoid real refo rm of their monetary and financial policies moreover they say the imfs policy prescriptions make crises worse from their perspective abolishing the im f would force countries to change their policies and to operate sound fi nancial institutions the pr ivate sector is better able than governments or official institutions th ey say to monitor and discipline country behavior assessment this proposal assumes that governments will undertake real reform only when they see that absent the imf they will be punished perhaps severely rather than rewarded if they continue to pursue unsound economic policies some question whether governments par ticularly those in developing countries are quite so pragmatic and whether polic reform in those c ountries is as easy to adopt as shultz simon and wriston seem to suggest without an international agency to help encourage and facilitate the process the dissenter s say countries may be unable to muster the will and skills nece ssary to implement reform their record before 1945 was not encouraging in that resp ect moreover many analysts will argue that shultz simon and wriston underestima the temptation g overnments may feel to pursue beggarthyneighbor policies or to adopt macr policies which preserve monetary stability at the price of grow th or opportunity for nonprivileged groups it might be said however that the s hultz simon and wriston proposal points to concerns that many find valid questions remain how the imf should relate to the private sector how it can promote open systems and sound financial institutions while still remaining bound by the requirements of confid entiality and consensus and where the worlds major governments ve the final say

only be able to make shortterm loans w ith little or conditionality but at penalty rates of interest and its prospective borrowers would have to qualif in advance before any crisis occurred by meeting prudential eligibility requirements eligible countries would need to allow fu ll freedom of entry nd operation in their domestic economy for foreign financial institutions financial institutions would need to be well regulated in order to assure adequate capitalization and prudent behavior and governments w ould need to publish regular data on their foreign debt and other offbalance sheet liabilities countri would also need to meet imf fiscal requirements to assure that imf loan s do not support irresponsible budgetary policies the commission said that longterm development aid policy reform and assistance to countries that do not qua lify for imf assistance should be the responsibility of the world bank though it also proposed that the banks scope of action and its resources shoul d be reduced it said th at the newly renamed world development agency should replace its loan program with program of grants funded by donor contributions emphasizing poverty alleviation education health and the construction of physical infrastructur it could also make subsidized loans to promote policy and institutional change but crisis lending would not be allowed borrowers would lose the interest subsidy and they would have to begin repayments immediately if during any one year they failed to achieve the performance standards specified in their loan assessment the arguments in support

that investments in emerging markets have been heavily influenced by the expectation of the availability of official resources for bailouts see his 2000 ri chard t ely lecture printed as international financial crises causes prevention and cures the american economic review papers and proceedings of the 112th annual meeting of the american continuedof the recent financial crises raise doubts the commission said about the system of crisis management now in place and the incentives for private action that it encourages and sustains they maintain that imf lending encourages moral hazard and sends the wrong message to internati onal lenders and borrowers by providing countries with funds they can use to pay ff foreign creditors in times of crisis the commission argued the imf implicitly assures international lenders and borrowers that they can take inappropriate risk s and pursue unsound policies and the imf will bail them out if they get into trouble if the imf did not exist the commission asserted the market would force countries and lenders to be more prudent in their decisions and it would require that countries adjust more rapidly to changes in their economic situation imf loans let countries stretch out or delay the adjustment process the commission said thus prolonging the crisis and delaying the recovery which will take place only after the needed policy changes have been put into effect furthermore the commission argued the imf is deficient in its current form as an instrument for providing liquidity during crises conditioned lending it said with each stage disbursed over time as specified requirements are met is not very effective way to respond to liquidity crisis despite its criticisms the commission di d not recommend that the imf should be abolished more limited version of the imf s hould be maintain ed it said in case concerted action by major central banks and to lesser extent action by the imf might be needed to address major fi nancial crises with broad possible effects many have questioned the feasibility and utility of the ifiac plan some members of the panel argued for exam ple that if the imf lent without conditionality as the ifiac majority propos ed this would virtually eliminate any prospect of overcoming the crisis since countries would not be required to abandon the policies which brought on the crisis when they resort to the revised imf for crisis finance on the other hand they said th stipulation that countries must meet an undefined imf proper fiscal requirement in order to prequalify for loans would seem to require the kind of perpetual imf oversight and discipline of country budgetary policies that the majo rity otherwise rejects many doubt that shrinking the imf is the right answer to the problem of moral hazard they dispute the assertion th at the prospect of future imf lending encourages moral hazard it is unlikely they argue that governments or lenders will intentionally risk financial crisis simply

lenders of shortterm money to participate in these losses is an important issue they agree however they argue new policy arrangements are likely to be more effective approach the process of settling fina ncial crises in developing count ries will be more disorderly they say if those countries are not eligible for imf loans and it is more likely in such situation that some creditors will be treated more favorably than others the meltzer commission says that the im f should continue to be source of data and provide advice to c ountries through its article iv consultation process even though many of its member countries woul d not qualify for loans many doubt that this would be feasible the statistical da ta and the country reports which the imf and world bank publish on regular basis are important sources of information for government academia and busin ess krueger noted in 1999 that other international agencies or perhaps even private firms could provide this service instead21 however she said the fact that the imf and world bank are undertaking other activities probably gives them an edge in obtaining information from member country governments it is at least as likely that in the absence of the other relationships between the multilateral institutions and individual governments she said the data would be forthcoming later in less reliable form and be less accessible for researchers and other users the same might be said for countries ineligible to borrow from the imf about their openness to imf advice during article iv consultations or their willingness to discuss in detail their internal economic situation or the underlying dyna mics of their exchange rate regimes many also question whether developing c ountries will be able to reform if they are not eligible to borrow from the imf presumably most countries will aspire to the status of imf eligibility however w ithout international assistance to help them cope with crises along the way critics of the ifiac plan argue their path to that goal may be hard they note that the world bank under the ifiac plan would have neither the mandate nor the resources to play the role of balance of payments lender to the countries excluded from access to the im f it would be able to make loans under the ifiac plan to promote policy nd institutional reform but monetary and exchange rate policy would be outside its rms of reference and crisis lending would be prohibited the stiff penalty for failure immediate repayment and termination of the interest subsidy might discourage countries from pursuing hard but important changes in their policies and institutions and unless they provide rapid infusions of money these loans would be of limited use to countries suffering bop crisis even if

said in 1999 task force report for ex ample that the imf is losing its focus and reducing its effectiven ess by doing too much24 the fund needed to go back to basics the cfr report concluded it should limit the scope of its conditionality to monetary fiscal exchange rate and financial sector policies the overseas development council odc c oncluded in 2000 task force report that the imf should scale back its activities and focus on its core competency which it said was macroeconomic policy25 the imf should continue being source of data and of policy advice through article iv consultations for member countries however the odc report said that 1 it should limit itself to providing shortterm liquidity to countries hit by macroeconomic crises 2 it should stop providing longterm development finance and 3 it should ceas its involvement with structural and institutional issues and exclude them from its loan cond itionality the latter discourages countries from coming to the imf until they have other choice the task force said it also scares away foreign investors by giving them the impression that the problems that caused the crisis in country might be not be easy to fix the cfr and odc reports recommended th at the imf should leave longterm structural change and development fi nance to the world bank and the other development banks the odc says that structural and institutional

for low income countries the poverty reduction and growth facility prgf should be transferred to the world bank assessment the imfs operations would be clearer and easier to implement if it only dealt with macroeconomic issues it would only need to talk with the officials from borrower countri who deal with those issues and it would not need to negotiate with others about institutional and structural reforms it could disburse money more rapidly since changes in fis cal exchange rate and monetary policy can be accomplished much more quickly than can institutional change if the mdbs also went back to basics if they stopped pr oviding bop aid to countries in the form of structural adjustment or sectoral ad justment loans the overlap between bank and fund operations would be substantially reduced among other things the imf would not need to be concerned that the macroeconomic c onditionality of mdb loans might conflict with its own conditionality this concept might be appr opriate if balance of payments crises were caused only by poor or poorly executed macroec onomic policy howeve r many economists believe that structural and institutional probl ems can also precipitate or intensify the effects of financial crises the imf found in its study of the asian financial crisis cited abovethat the crisis of 19978 wa s due more to poor debt management policies unsound banking institutions and w eak bank oversight procedures than to any specific problems with macroeconomic policy from this perspective even the bestlaid macroeconomic policies will be ineffective in their execution if the institutions which apply it are defective26 the imfs articles of agreement do not specify in article i what means the imf should use to promote exchange ra stability or how its loans will help borrowers correct maladjustments in their balance of payments article iv does not say how the imf shall exercise firm surveillance over the exchange rate policies of members macroeconomic criteria have been the means traditionally used to carry out these tasks but there is nothing in the articles prohibiting the imf from considering institutional and microeconomic issues as well if it finds these help it accomplish its primary mission the cfr and odc reports agree that the imf should pay attention to structural and institutional issues during its surveillance process it is not clear from the two reports however what the imf should do if it finds that institutional or structural problems in country are threatening to unde rcut its monetary st ability or precipitate crisis should the imf simply mention its concerns in its ar ticle iv surveillance report or should it require countries to approach the world bank or the regional mdbs for loans

the reform project if it pays attention on grounds that structural reform is outside its core competence it might find that the final results are unsatisfactory the cfr and odc reports say that the world bank and the regional banks should bear the res ponsibility for promoting longt erm policy reform and ins titutional and structural change however if the md bs stop making adjustment loans in order to leave the area of bop lending entirely to the imf they may have difficulty promoting the kinds of reforms the cfr and odc envision on the other hand if the mdbs continue making adjustment loan s in order to promote policy reform the imf may need some way of keeping the conditionality and timing of these loans congruent with its own operations streamline loan operations there seems to be general agreement that the imfs surveillance function should be retained there is less agreem ent about the policies and tools the imf needs in order to carry out its duty to promote exchange rate stability in world where exchange rates are largely determined by market forces arguably the imfs resources are now too small compared to the volume of interna tional financial flows and world trade to undertake the stabilization role it play ed in the old fixedparity exchange rate system likewise th imf cannot stop countries from pursuing policies that increase or diminish the value of their currencies even though this may have serious destabilizing ffects on other countries if countries do not need to borrow money from it the imf can do little more than give them advice and publicize its concern in documents such as its world economic outlook and article iv consultation reports if country allows publication proposals some experts believe the imfs loan operations could be streamlined and its procedures simplified williamson27 and bird28 contend for example that the imf needs only two an facilities one w ould lend with little or conditionality to help countri maintain liquidity

borrowers fa il to adequately ddress their problems caballero argues by contrast that the imf needs only one loan facility to address crises caused by exog enous events and poor policy30 instead of lending in response to crises however he believes the imfs main function should be one of preventing crises and stabilizing exchange rates through market arrangements renamed by caballero the international market facilitator the imf would create hedge arrangements in private markets in order to insure countries against volatile capital flows it would also help countri design macroeconomic policy frameworks consistent with those insurance mechanis ms and through its surveillance function it would assure that countries comply with their terms buira also believes the imf only need s one

countries choose policies and programs consistent with their goals and consistent with the funds mandate the imf should limit itself to monetary and exchange rate issues buira says and should not use mone tary crises as an opportunity to force basic changes in the borrowers domestic institutions or to open its economy to foreign penetration assessment twotiered loan program would let the imf differentiate between countries whose crises were attr ibutable to their own actions and those whose crises were less of their making macroeconomic and structural conditionality would not be necessary for countries buffeted by contagion effects as is often the current imf practice this assumes however that the imf will be able to discern accurately which exogenous shocks are onl temporary and which herald permanent changes in the world economy in the latte r case countries may be lulled deeper into debt through unconditioned liquidity loans and the eventual burden of adjustment may be heavier

parts of the house built through hedging can stand even though others may fall it also assume s that imfs market traders can build financial network strong enough to withstand crisis where everyone else is betting against it many will dispute these ssumptions some will also wonder why this task should be done by an international agency rather than by private firms or governments themselves longterm loan s with little conditiona lity might be very desirable from the point of view of veloping countries however with specific requirements progress towards ad justment and policy change may be slow or negligible the rich countries may be unwilling to let the imf lend large amounts of their quota money for long periods without some assurance that conditions in the borrower will improve and the money will be repaid reassign functions and authority proposal gilbert powell and vines say there needs to be new agreement on the division of labor between the world bank and the imf32 overlap in their functions is inevitable they say and th ere needs to be clear agreement about the terms on which the two agencies share the common ground each should focus on its own core mission the imf on macroec onomic and crisis resolution and macro policy advice and the bank on longterm development including microeconomics and trade and industry issues the author s say there should be an agreed list of competencies and division of lead responsibilities though in all areas there should be an obligation to consult in each area one agency would have the final authority and the other would have right to be c onsulted and to give its views in some instances for example the imf might have the final say regarding certain macroeconomic aspects of world bank and the bank would have similar authority regarding certain social or developmental aspects of imf stabilization programs assessment formal division of labor and authority may be useful particularly in areas where the bank and fund agree it may be less workable though when they disagree even if the imf had final authority regarding balance of payments aid for example the bank might not be willing to let the fund veto its development policy loan or adjustment loan operations even if the bank were the final authority for growth and developmen t policy the fund might not be willing to let the bank decide how rigorous the term s of its stabilization programs should be by itself authority on paper may not be very durable agencies will likely define problems or issues in such way as to ensure that they fall within their area of jurisdiction furthermore if an agency has overall responsib ility for program it will probably follow its own judgment rather than acquiescing to decisions by others likewise if an agency sees problem which impacts its core mission it is more likely to deal with the issue itself rather than ask someone else to do the job the imfs establishment of the eff and the esaf in the

functions were shifted between the agencies transferring the prgf to the bank has already been discussed this would not solve the tension but it would put all the agencies which deal with poor countries under the world bank president who could settle dis putes transferring the imfs technical assistance functions elsewhere as the australian report suggested would be another possibility ho wever the fund would still need to talk with them about common concerns altern atively all the functions in the world bank and the regional banks which deal with banking finance and corporate governance could be shifted to the imf it would then serve as advisor regulator and source of funding for projects to strength and improve institutions and policy in these areas however this would make the imf development lending institution better bankfund coordination proposal some would argue that dividing up the functions and putting the world bank and imf into separate boxes ma not be practical design the bank and fund have different ma ndates but they have very many areas of common concern stiglitz says that it is inevitable that the two agencies will have major disagreements about economic policy33 instead of papering over their differences by giving each agency total authority over certain areas of joint concern he says it is more important to find ways they can effectively discuss their differences writing in 1999 stiglitz reported that th bank and fund have tried on several occasions to reach an accord separating th eir areas of responsibility but this has not been successful it is natural for th fund to take large responsibility for macroeconomic issues and for the bank to take lead responsibility for development however he notes issues of macroec onomics and microeconomics are intertwined tight monetary policy aimed at stabiliz ing countrys currency and balance of payments situation and strengthening the capital base of its banks can lead to credit crunch that hampers the banks efforts undermines growth and precipitates widespread bankruptcy the bank and fund may have very different views about such situations likewise the imf f ound during the asian financial crisis that structural and institutional change can be essential to head off crises and to lessen their intensity and it included them in its work program even though conceptually they lay entirely within the jurisdiction of the mdbs the fund may put higher priority on some of these concerns than does the bank there are many areas where the bank and fund share responsibilities and have common concerns stiglitz says open disagreement can be healthy he argues particularly for situations where the co mpeting policy choices have very different possible results instead of the bank nd fund hammering out an agreement which they then impose on the borrower country he proposes the international agencies should advice governments about the alterna tives available

socalled washington consensus the view that sound macro economic policies and open domestic and international markets were crucial both for effectiv development and for sound monetary policy in 1994 some economists began saying that the earlier consensus view embodied first generati on reforms they argued that another body of second generation reforms involving institutiona l and structural changes in developing countries was needed to consolidate and extend the devel opment and monetary stabilization process begun by the earlier reforms34 in 2000 the managing director of the imf and the president of the world bank issued joint statement setting forth th eir shared vision for closer cooperation between the two agencies35 it stressed country ownership of programs to change policies and institutions more cohe rent approach to setting and upholding priorities for change and better use of conditionality measures to improve program success in 2001 the executive boards of the bank and fund approved framework to promote consultation in the early stages of the policy process and greater information sharing between the two ag encies staff at bot h the country and functional thematic levels of activity to prevent competing or duplicate conditionality between the two agencies the guidelines employ lead agency pro cedure to clarify responsibility the new guidelines allow the imf to draw on the advice of other international organizations in the design of conditionality this is important since in the bank and fund often have their own separate ssistance programs underway simultaneously in countries and there is assurance that their conditions and guidelines are compatible under the new procedures imf and bank st aff are expected to coordinate their policies for countries where they both have operations in effect they are supposed to harmonize their country strategies iden tify key areas where policy and institutional change will be sought and implement strict division of responsibilities in promoting them with one of the agencies assuming lead position for each of the goals series of interagency task forces were created to deal with issues such as

continuedassessment initial reports indicate that the coordination process is having some success both in facilitating country ownership of the programs to promote institutional and policy change and in promoting interagency c ooperation the imfs 2004 report cited earlier on c onsultation process suggests however that there continue to be problems stemming from differences in the two agencies mandates cultures and structures it recommended for example that the joint implementation committee jic panel of senior staff created previously by the executive boards of the two institutions and then allowed to lapse should be revived and revamped in order to monitor the consultation process more closely specifically the report said that when needed the jic should help country teams in the two institutions to reach agreement on priorities so as to ensu re coherence of policy advice and program design it seems from these remarks that bank and fund staff continue to see things differently and there continues to be problems elic iting cooperation between them in the formulation of their country programs this is the area where the difference in their mandates priorities and expectations is probably greatest perhaps topdown authority from the jic on w hen needed basis may be required to secure closer collaboration between the two agencies at the operating level improvements in coordination may help the bank and fund pursue the mandates better with less friction and fewer occasions where they work at cross purposes nevertheless while this arrangement changes their format to degree fundamental changes in the scope of the bank and fund operations or the terms and conditions of their assistance programs will likely result any possible gains in the efficiency and effectiveness of their programs will likely provide little satisfaction to those who want to reorganize the imf in order to effect fundamental alterations in its policies pro cedures and mandate

proposal since 1998 many have recommended that the imf take the lead to stabilize international capital markets and to resolv international debt issues soros proposed in 1998 for example that an international credit insura nce corporation icic should be formed as an adjunct of the imf to provide c ountries with access to world capital markets at prime rates up to levels guaranteed by the

for these purpos stiglitz said in book review that soros plan for onetime issuance would not be enough42 much larger amounts would be needed every year he said in order to achieve what he called modest development goals such as the 50 billion annual effort to achieve the millennium development goals by 2015 assessment these proposals either to expand the imfs functions establishing it as kind of internationa l bankruptcy mediator or making it new source of development aid might have us eful effects to date however there appears to be internati onal consensus on their behalf and little support among the major creditor countries in terms of camdessuss recomme ndation it seems very unlikely that governments will be willing to surrender to an imf intergovernmental committee their power to determin their own economic policy in any case it is unclear how these new functions would be integrated with the imfs existing responsibilities the internal strain within the organization would be great for example if the imf is making ans to help countries deal with bop crises at the same time that it is working to settle or write down sovereign debt securing private sector cooperation with

economy this re port has presented sample of the wide spectrum of options that experts have pres ented on what proper role of the imf should be in the 21st century there are many avenues by which congress can influence this debate for example congress has enacted legislation specifying what us policy shall be in the international financial institutions ifis and how the us executive directors at these institutions shall vote and the objectives they shall pursue the number of policy goals or requirements enacted by congress is large43 for example the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 pl 104132 instructs the treasury department to oppose any loan or other use of ifi funds to or for any country for which the secretary of stat has determined is statesponsor of terrorism congress also mu st authorize and appropriate any increase in imf or world bank funding congress has frequently made specific suggestions to the administration through sense of congress resolutions or language in committee reports accompanying legislation suggesting specifi c goals and priorities the united states ought to emphasize in the ifis since the world bank and the other multilateral institutions are not agencies of the us government but rather international institutions their activities and policies are not subject to us law44httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32432crs24 changing the imf any future changes in the structure of the imf will be the result of new consensus among its stockholders author ity among the imfs member countries is widely distributed and an 85 majority is required to alter the articles of agreement consequently there is strong builtin bias in favor of continuity and against fundamental change most of the changes in the imf discussed in this report would require broad membership support the articles would need to be amended for instance to expand the imfs oversight au thority to add new functions such as debt restructuring facility or market hedging program or to change the imf into world central bank likewise the articles would need to be changed in order to rescind the language barring the imf from releasing information about economic conditions in member country wit hout its consent to extend the loan repayment period or to alter the require ment that the interest rate s and repayment periods must be uniform for all borrowers 70 vote is needed to raise or lower the interest rate charged for imf loans it may be difficult to get an 85 majority to effect these proposals given its voting structure ll major groups of countries in the imf have veto power over changes in the articles of agreement issuances of new sdrs approval of new quota increases the sale of imf gold and other major actions supermajorities would not be needed to effect some of the other changes proposed by the various authors neve rtheless broad support among the imfs major stockholders will still be required together the united states the other g7 countries and other advanced countries in europe have n early 56 of the vote broad consensus among these countries mig ht be sufficient to change imf loan policy imf procedures or the structure of the organization however broad unity among the major countries would be neede d initiatives for change will likely fail if the major countries split their votes it seems doubtful that many potential borrower countries would vote for initiatives that w ould restrict their future access to imf credit or disadvantage them in other ways traditionally the united states has exercised leadership in the ifis however other major governments often have view s which differ substantially from those advocated by the united states they ar not likely to support initiatives for change unless they agree on the merits that they are desirable several of these countries have expressed reservations about some of the alternativ discussed earlier in this report in the past the united states often resolved disagreements of this sort through series of oneonone bilate ral talks with other countri more recently though as seen in some recent negotiations about world bank issues many countries have preferred to discuss their differences with the united states in block all at the same time the more advanced members of th european union have about 31 of the vote and there has been discussion among them in recent years about ways they could pool their vote and exercise larger leadership role in the international financial institutions proposals to change or restructure the imf can be offered at any time however the most likely occasion for consideration will occur during future negotiations about possible new imf quota increases or other similar events the imf is required by its articles to consider every five years whether its resources arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32432crs25 adequate and whether new quota increase is needed in 2002 the united states and other major countries decided that incr ease was necessary the next occasion for formal consideration of this issue will lik ely occur in 2007 those seeking to effect change in the imf may keep this timetable in mind as they form ulate their proposals
