option instead of taking the subsidy with respect to the new part d they may elect to pay portion of the part d premiums they may also elect to provide enhanced coverage though this has some financial consequences for the employer or union enhanced coverage may be provided through supplementary or wrap around benefits alternatively employers or unions may contract with pdp or mapd to offer the coverage finally they may become part d plan sponsor themselves for their retirees in january 2006 the secretary of hhs announced that close to 24 million medicare beneficiaries had prescription drug coverage this included 64 million persons in retiree plans receiving subsidy an additional 1 million retirees were in employer coverage that incorporated or supplemented medicares coverage and another

the implementation requirements as outlined by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms the agency that administers the medicare program cms issued final part d regulations in january 20053 and has provided on periodic basis supplemental guidance documents on its website requirements for employerunion subsidies the employerunion subsidy is available to sponsors of qualified plans provided certain conditions are met the plan itself must meet the definition of qualified plan the plan sponsor must submit an application to cms on timely basis this application must include an actuarys attestation that the plan meets the actuarial equivalence requirements the plan sponsor must also meet certain administrative requirements qualified plans mma applies the employerunion subsidy provisions to qualified prescription drug plans plan requirements qualified plan is defined as employmentbased retiree health coverage provided under group health plan group health plans may include federal and state government plans collectively bargained plans and church plans however the office of personnel management stated that plans offered under the federal employee health benefits

1974 erisa 5 other account arrangements such as health savings account and an archer medical savings account will not be considered as qualified medical plan because contributions to the plan cannot be made once the individual is eligible for medicare 6 see crs report rs21573 taxadvantaged accounts for health care expenses sidebyside comparison by bob lyke and chris peterson crs3 amounts carrying forward to subsequent coverage periods hras and other account based arrangements are often combined with high deductible health plans hdhps regardless of whether an account standing alone is group health plan the hdhp associated with that account can qualify as group health plan if it is contributed to or otherwise established or maintained by an employer or union qualifying covered retiree subsidies are linked to an individuals status as retired participant in the qualified group health plan or as the medicareenrolled spouse or dependent of the retired participant thus sponsor offering qualified coverage for dependants will be able to claim coverage for part d eligible dependent of retired participant even if the retiree is under age 65 and not part d eligible however the sponsor will not be able to claim coverage for part d eligible dependent of an active employee it should be noted that subsidies are only paid for qualifying retirees covered under the qualified employer plan but not covered under part d individual retirees may elect to enroll in part d however that decision may have consequences recent survey of anticipated employer responses to the mma provisions found that among large employers who expected to continue to offer drug coverage and receive the subsidy 41 said retirees who signed up for part d would maintain employer sponsored coverage 31 said the retirees would lose prescription drug coverage only and 29 said these retirees would lose both employersponsored medical and drug coverage in addition 44 of these employers stated that once an individual signed up for part d they would not be allowed to enroll or reenroll in the employer plan at future date7 actuarial equivalence the sponsor of the plan must provide cms with an attestation that the actuarial value of the retiree prescription drug coverage is at least equal to part d standard coverage the determination must be made using the methodology specified by cms and be signed by qualified actuary the attestation must be provided annually comparison to standard coverage in order to determine actuarial equivalence coverage under the retiree health plan is compared to standard coverage under part d in 2006 standard coverage has 250 deductible 25 coinsurance for costs between 251 and 2250 then coverage until the beneficiary has trueoutofpocket troop costs of 3600 5100 total

other drugs or 2 5 coinsurance calculation calculation of actuarial equivalence is determined according to twoprong test first under the gross value test the actuarial gross value of the 7 kaiser family foundation and hewitt prospects for retiree health benefits as medicare prescription drug coverage begins findings from the kaiserhewitt 2005 survey on retiree health benefits december 2005 httpwwwkfforgmedicare med120705pkgcfm crs4 retiree prescription drug coverage under the plan for the plan year must be at least equal to the actuarial gross value of standard coverage under part d for the year in question second under the net value test the net value of the plan taking into account expected premiums must be at least equal to the actuarial net value of part d standard coverage in general gross value of coverage is determined using actual claims experience and demographic data for part d eligibles who are in the sponsors plan alternative approaches are permitted under certain conditions the plan satisfies the gross value test if the total expected paid claims for beneficiaries under the sponsors plan will be at least equal to the total expected paid claims for the same beneficiaries under the defined standard part d benefit the net value of coverage under the sponsors plan is determined by reducing the gross value of coverage by the expected premiums plan sponsors that charge single premium for both drug and other medical coverage must allocate portion of this premium to drug coverage the plans net value is compared with the net value of standard coverage under part d the net value of standard part d coverage is calculated by reducing the gross value by 1 monthly beneficiary premiums expected to be paid for standard coverage and 2 an amount reflecting the impact of sponsorprovided supplemental coverage on the value of standard coverage if the sponsor provides coverage that supplements standard coverage this will delay the point at which retiree will qualify for catastrophic coverage because sponsorpaid costs will not count toward the troop trigger this in turn decreases the value of that catastrophic coverage assurances related to the gross value test must be provided separately for each benefit option for which sponsor is requesting subsidy assurances related to the net value test may be provided in one of several ways it may be applied separately for each benefit option for subset of benefit options that in the aggregate meet the test or in the aggregate for all benefit options for example if retiree group health plan has five separate options all of which individually meet the gross value test the plan could claim the subsidy for 1 each of the options that separately meet the net value test 2 all five options if they meet the net value test in the aggregate or 3 subset of the options if the subset meets the net value test in the aggregate8 cms notes that actuaries will have considerable flexibility in the use of simplified actuarial calculations treatment of multiple benefit options and allocation of premiums between drug and nondrug coverage further once the actuarial equivalence standard is satisfied plan sponsors will have full flexibility in plan benefit design9 8 us department of health and human services centers for medicare and medicaid service medicare program medicare prescription drug benefit

crs5 notification to retirees of creditable coverage mma imposes premium penalty for persons who delay enrollment in part d plan after their initial enrollment period the penalty is equal to 1 of the beneficiarys part d premium for each month of delayed enrollment thus oneyear delay would result in 12 surcharge however there is an exception for persons who maintain creditable coverage through some other public or private source and then choose to enroll in part d at later date creditable coverage is defined as drug benefits whose actuarial value equals or exceeds that of standard coverage sponsors of retiree plans are required to disclose whether their plan is creditable coverage the disclosure must be made to all their retirees and their spouses and dependents who are both eligible to participate in the retiree health plan and who are eligible for part d administrative requirements plan sponsors are required to submit applications containing information on the employer plan and individuals that the sponsor believes are qualifying covered retirees sponsor may satisfy the requirement relating to individual information by entering into voluntary data sharing agreement with cms once full application has been submitted cms will match the name and identifying information on individuals with the medicare beneficiary database to determine which retirees are part d eligible individuals who are not enrolled in part d plan the results will be provided to the sponsor in general an application for plan year must be submitted later than 90 days prior to the beginning of the plan year applications had to be submitted by september 30 2005 for plan years beginning in 2006 sponsors are required to provide information necessary to assure accurate subsidy payments this includes electronic submission and periodic updating of enrollment information about retirees and dependents electronic submission of aggregate data about drug costs and reconciliation of costs at the end of the year sponsors are required to maintain and furnish to cms or the office of inspector general upon request certain records these include reports and working documents of the actuaries who wrote the required attestation of actuarial equivalence and documentation of incurred costs and other information used to calculate the subsidy records must be retained for minimum of six years after the expiration of the plan year in which the costs were incurred longer period is required in the event of investigation litigation or negotiation involving civil administrative or criminal liability crs6 subsidy payments as noted above the mma subsidy provisions were intended to counteract the erosion in employerprovided retiree health benefits the subsidy is calculated based on gross planrelated drug costs that are actually paid net any manufacturer or pharmacy discounts chargebacks rebates and similar price concessions the calculation includes drug payments made by the qualified retiree drug plan and those made by the covered retiree or on the retirees behalf gross costs include costs directly related to dispensing of the drugs but not administrative expenses in 2006 subsidy payments equal 28 of an individuals gross drug costs between 250 the cost threshold and 5000 the cost limit the dollar amounts for the cost threshold and cost limit will be adjusted annually by the percentage increase in medicare per capita prescription drug costs subsidy payments may be made on monthly quarterly or annual basis as elected by the plan sponsor unless cms determines that these options must be restricted because of operational limitations mma specifies that subsidy payments to plan sponsors are not subject to federal tax other options types of options instead of taking the subsidy an employer or union may choose another option for providing prescription drug coverage for their retirees under these options the retiree is encouraged to sign up for part d the employer or union plan would then provide some additional assistance the following are the major options available payment of part d premiums employers or union sponsors could choose to pay some or all of the part d premiums for their part d eligible retirees and eligible dependants providing supplemental coverage employers could set up their own separate plans that supplement or wrap around part d coverage these plans would coordinate with benefits offered by any pdp or mapd the beneficiary chooses health plans typically take this approach for services such as hospital and physicians services provided under medicare parts and b purchase of enhanced part d benefit through pdp or mapd an employer or union could elect to contract with specific pdp or ma pd plan to offer enhanced prescription drug benefits to retirees and dependants eligible for medicare become pdp or mapd alternatively the retiree plan itself could apply to be part d plan for its retirees crs7 true outofpocket troop implications if employers or unions elect to sponsor enhanced alternative coverage or provide separate coverage that wraps around part d this will have financial consequences for them as noted above part d enrollees with standard coverage must have 3600 in troop costs in 2006 before part d catastrophic coverage begins troop costs include only those payments paid by the individual paid by another family member on behalf of the individual paid on behalf of the individual under the lowincome subsidy provisions or under state pharmaceutical assistance program10 insurance and other third party payments do not count toward troop thus if an employer chooses to pay some of the part d costsharing on behalf of its retirees this would have the effect of delaying the point at which the part d catastrophic coverage would begin the employer could therefore end up paying some costs which would otherwise be covered under the catastrophic portion of the part d benefit employerunion sponsored plans employers or unions that contract with part d plan to provide customized package for their retirees as well as those who elect to become part d plan themselves will have to meet part d plan requirements this means they will have to meet the applicable bidding requirements for pdps or mapds however both the law and subsequent cms guidance11 permits waivers from certain part d requirements which would otherwise hinder the development and offering of such plans the intention is to facilitate employerunion sponsors to offer these group plans waivers the following are some of the key waivers that have been identified enrollment plans may restrict enrollment solely to their retirees further they do not have to meet otherwise applicable minimum enrollment standards governmental entity requirements in general governmental entities are not permitted to be pdp or mapd sponsors however this prohibition is waived for governmental entities applying to sponsor pdp or mapd plan for their retirees such as for state retirement funds and municipal and local government plans 10 it should be noted that cms final regulations state that distributions from health savings accounts flexible savings accounts and archer medical savings accounts count toward troop however distributions from health reimbursement accounts do not count toward troop 11 for further guidance information see 1 part d waiver guidance

cover beneficiaries in the service areas in which they operate under employer union direct contracts coverage can be extended to all retirees regardless of where they reside service area requirements for pdps offering customized employeruniononly group plans to qualify for waiver the pdp must offer nonretiree coverage in the area where the largest portion of the employerunions total number of employees participants reside coverage may then be offered to all the employerunion retirees regardless of where they reside otherwise coverage is limited to retirees in the same region that the pdp offers nonretiree coverage service area requirements for mapds offering customized employeruniononly group plans if local mapd sponsor provides coverage to individuals in any part of state it can offer retireeonly coverage for an employer or union throughout the state an ma organization offering regional plan in specified ma region may offer an employerunion sponsored mapd plan in any area within the ma region or throughout the region cms may on case by case basis grant waiver to permit regional mapd to extend coverage to retirees living outside the area12 state licensure state licensure requirements may be waived for direct contracting plans however they are required to meet certain financial solvency standards if the employer or union does not meet these specified standards cms may approve on casebycase basis waivers of the requirements provided the entity can demonstrate that 1 its fiscal soundness is commensurate with its financial risk and 2 it can assure that claims for benefits will be covered calendar year operation part d plans are required to operate on calendar year basis employerunion sponsored plans will be able to operate on noncalendar year basis pharmacy access plans will not be subject to the part d retail pharmacy access standards however they will have to provide an attestation that the plans networks are sufficient to meet the needs of its retiree population including situations involving emergency access waivers of the mailorder only prohibition will not be granted marketingbeneficiary communication requirements cms will waive specific part d marketingbeneficiary communication requirements upon receipt of an attestation that the plans comply with alternative disclosure requirements such as those applicable under erisa reporting requirements in general part d plan sponsors are required to disclose certain information to cms enrollees and the general public for direct contracting plans only information must 12 for discussion of local and regional ma plans see crs report rl32618 medicare advantage payments by hinda ripps chaikind and paulette morgan crs9 be disclosed to the extent required by other law such as erisa or securities law or by contract federal payments to plans in general federal payments to part d plans include 1 direct monthly per capita payment for each plan enrollee which is labeled the direct subsidy payment not to be confused with subsidy payments to qualified retiree plans discussed earlier 2 catastrophic reinsurance payments equal to 80 of an individuals costs over the annual outofpocket threshold amount the troop level 3 risk corridor payments if plans losses exceed specified thresholds and 4 subsidies for lowincome enrollees cms has established several payment modifications for employerunion plans discussed below per capita direct subsidy payments to plans direct subsidy risk adjusted payments to employerunion plans will be based on the national benchmark amount rather than the bid submitted by the plan catastrophic reinsurance payments for most part d plans catastrophic payments will be made prospectively with reconciliation adjustments at the end of the year however for employergroup plans cms will make the full reinsurance payment at the end of the year cms expects that since the employerunion plans will be providing enhanced benefits which do not count toward troop the reinsurance trigger will be delayed and reinsurance payments will be small as result catastrophic reinsurance payments will not be available for noncalendar year plans however these plans will still be required to provide catastrophic coverage risk corridor payments cms guidance states that employerunion drug plans will forgo risk corridor payments risk corridors permit part d plans to share both losses and gains with medicare risk corridor payments were included in mma to assist entities entering new markets in which they have experience cms notes that employersunions already have experience with their retiree population lowincome subsidies in general lowincome subsidies will apply in the same manner they apply to other part d plans13 lowincome premium subsidies paid on behalf of an eligible retiree must first be used to reduce the portion of the monthly premium paid by the beneficiary with any remainder used to reduce the employerunion contribution cms guidance states that if the premium subsidy amount is less than the beneficiary premium the beneficiary should be informed of the premium impact of remaining in the employer plan versus enrolling as an individual in another part d plan 13 see crs report rl32902 medicare prescription drug benefit lowincome provisions by jennifer osullivan crs10 beneficiary payments in general part d plans are required to charge uniform premium for each beneficiary enrolled in the plan this is the standard premium for basic coverage the plan can charge 100 of the value of any supplemental coverage cms will give employerunion plans flexibility in determining the amount they will subsidize for retirees subject to certain conditions employerunion plans can subsidize different amounts for different classes provided the classes are reasonable and are based on objective business criteria such as years of service business location or job category this is in recognition of the fact that employers often acquire new employee groups as result of business deals premiums for employerunion plans cannot vary based on eligibility for the low income subsidy further enrollees cannot be charged more than the sum of the premium for standard part d coverage plus 100 of the premium for supplemental coverage finally the per capita direct subsidy payments from cms to the employerunion part d plan must first be passed through to the beneficiary to reduce the amount of the beneficiary premium timing in the fall of 2005 cms signed contracts with employerunion direct contract plans it also signed contracts with pdp and mapd plans with addenda for customized benefits for employerunion group applicants impact of provisions distribution of beneficiaries 2006 when cms issued the final part d regulations in january 200514 it estimated that in the absence of mma 114 million persons 28 of beneficiaries would have employmentbased retiree coverage including unsubsidized coverage in 2006 of these cms estimated that 98 million persons 86 would receive creditable drug coverage through an employerunion sponsored retiree plan that was eligible for the subsidy though some employers such as the federal government would not apply for the subsidy an estimated additional 04 million persons 3 would receive coverage through pdp or mapd plan with the employerunion offering enhanced benefits or providing wrap around or coordinated coverage the remaining 13 million 11 would enroll in standard pdp or mapd portion of these persons will receive assistance with premium costs on january 17 2006 the department of health and human services hhs released press release on drug coverage15 it estimated that nearly 24 million persons 14 us department of health and human services centers for medicare and medicaid services medicare program medicare prescription drug benefit 70 federal register 4194 jan 28 2005 15 hhs nearly 24 million medicare beneficiaries now have prescription drug coverage continued crs11 had drug coverage as of that date the statistics include both those covered under part d as well those persons who continued to have drug coverage through retiree plans it estimated that 64 million persons were in retiree plans receiving subsidy about 1 million retirees were in employer coverage that incorporated or supplemented medicares coverage and another 500000 were continuing in plans with coverage at least as good as medicares approximately 31 million persons were receiving their drug benefits through tricare and the federal employees health benefits program fehb subsequent years when cms issued its january 2005 estimates it suggested that the projected ratios would change over the fiveyear estimation period as some employers who elect the subsidy in 2006 transition to other options in later years see current issues discussion below for 2010 cms estimated total of 118 million would have had coverage in the absence of mma of these an estimated 72 million 61 would have assistance through subsidyeligible plan 24 million 20 would have enhanced or wrap around coverage and the remaining 23 million 19 would enroll in standard pdp or mapd average employer savings in the final part d regulations16 cms estimated that the employerunion retiree drug subsidy payments would average 668 per beneficiary in 2006 for employers with tax liability this translates into taxable per capita payment of 891 for an employer in the 25 marginal tax category and 1028 for an employer with 35 marginal rate by comparison the average indirect subsidy for employersunions choosing to provide supplemental coverage was estimated to be about 900 per person excluding reinsurance payments which are expected to be low for this population because of the troop rules for employersunions who cannot take advantage of the taxfree nature of the subsidy such as state governments and nonprofit corporations one of the alternative options may appear more attractive than the subsidy in its august 3 2004 proposed rulemaking cms estimated that 60 of beneficiaries over 65 receiving retiree health benefits were obtaining them from entities exempt from taxation current issues in recent years employers have been cutting back on health benefits offered to their retirees when mma was being considered there was concern that employers would use the enactment of medicare drug benefit as an excuse to further reduce retiree health benefits or drop such coverage entirely in response the legislation includes significant incentives for employers to continue to offer drug benefits for their medicareeligible retirees most notably the law both provides for subsidy of 15 continued press release at httpwwwhhsgovnewspress2006pres20060117html 16 hhs 70 federal register jan 28 2005 opcit crs12 portion of retiree drug costs and exempts these subsidy payments from federal taxes as noted the legislation also offers other options to encourage employerunions to continue to provide assistance to retirees cms strongly encouraged employersunions to take advantage of the subsidy rather than one of the other available options in 2006 it stated that it was generally better option because the value of the subsidy was generally expected to be larger though the actual value of the assistance varies by number of factors further cms established streamlined application process for the subsidy most large employers offering retiree health benefits in 2005 have taken the subsidy in 2006 some plans may wish to avail themselves of other options however it might take time to restructure their plans in light of the new part d 2005 survey by kaiser family foundation and hewitt17 noted that its survey of 300 large private sector firms with 1000 or more employees showed that the majority of plan sponsors 82 would seek the subsidy at least in the first year fifteen percent said they were likely to supplement the benefit and 2 said they intended to become pdp eleven percent said they were likely to discontinue prescription drug coverage of which 3 reported they were discontinuing both drug and other medical coverage18 when asked which strategy they were most likely to pursue for their largest plan 79 of surveyed employers representing 89 of the age 65 retirees in the largest plans expected to take the subsidy in 2006 the kaiserhewitt study reported that many employers taking the subsidy in 2006 were likely to pursue additional cost control strategies thirtysix percent were very or somewhat likely to increase copayment or coinsurance charges 21 were likely to require use of mailorders for refills or maintenance drugs 14 were likely to replace copayments with coinsurance approach 13 were likely to only cover the cost up to the level of the lowestcost drug for given condition 8 were likely to impose deductibles specific to the drug benefit 3 were likely to impose cap on the drug benefit and 2 were likely to cover generic drugs only over time many plans may face an additional consideration it is not clear that employers will be able to continue to meet actuarial equivalence standards necessary to qualify for the subsidy for variety of reasons including the financial accounting standards board fasb standards fas 10619 many employers are capping their contributions to future retiree health benefits these amounts may fall below the level necessary to keep pace with the actuarial value of the part d drug benefit 17 kaiser family foundation and hewitt prospects for retiree health benefits as medicare prescription drug coverage begins findings from the kaiserhewitt 2005 survey on retiree health benefits dec 2005 at httpwwwkfforgmedicaremed120705pkgcfm 18 some employers with multiple plans provided multiple responses as result the total exceeds 100 19 see crs report rl32944 health insurance coverage for retirees by hinda ripps chaikind and fran larkins crs13 over time these considerations may become bigger issue as the baby boom generation ages into retirement employers will continue to reexamine their contributions to health benefits for both current and future retirees some employers may elect to drop their contribution to retiree health benefits entirely while others may reduce their contributions for future retirees key concern for policymakers is whether the mma provisions will encourage employers to continue to provide retiree health coverage it will be several years before we have more complete picture of how employers have responded to the laws incentives further whatever actions employers take should be viewed as part of the larger response to rapidly increasing health care costs both for active workers and for retirees for other versions of this document see
