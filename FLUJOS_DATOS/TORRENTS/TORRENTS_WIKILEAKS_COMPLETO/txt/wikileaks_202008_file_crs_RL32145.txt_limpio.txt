policy issues november 13 2003 gail mccallion specialist in labor economics domestic social policy division congressional research service the library of congress early intervention in reading an overview of research and policy issues summary significant body of research has emerged examining the potential shortterm and longterm effects of early intervention for children having difficulty in acquiring reading skills many researchers believe that early intervention with children who experience difficulty in learning to read is more efficacious and ultimately more costeffective than attempts at later remediation this research in conjunction with data indicating that the majority of children with learning disabilities have primary disability in reading has led congress to support efforts to intervene early to assist children with reading difficulties develop the skills they need rather than attempt remediation with impaired readers later in their school years reading first and early reading first were drafted with the intent of incorporating the latest scientific understanding on what works in teaching reading recent longitudinal data indicate that an above average home literacy environment as well as good health possession of certain literacy skills and positive approach to learning are all positively related to reading achievement even after controlling for raceethnicity and poverty overall the research on early intervention finds positive shortterm effects of highquality early childhood programs in terms of cognitive skills school readiness and social behavior and positive longterm effects in terms of greater high school completion rates higher earnings less criminal activity and less welfare use for model early intervention programs longterm effects from more typical programs such as head start are not conclusive in part this is due to the difficulty of separating the influence of early intervention from all the other factors that are significant in influencing longterm success much of the reading research has focused specifically on the wordlevel reading difficulties that many children with reading difficulties experience in this regard the national reading panel nrp report has provided concrete suggestions on how to improve the teaching of reading the nrp report has received significant positive as well as critical attention and its research conclusions have been important in implementation of the new reading first and early reading first programs many reading researchers assert that strategy of early intervention focused on identification and instruction of children with reading difficulties would significantly decrease the number of older children identified with learning disabilities would be more efficacious than later remediation and would reduce the need for special education placements practically reading research has important policy implications in helping to craft programs that will effectively provide

intervention in reading an overview of research and policy issues there is significant body of research examining the potential shortterm and longterm effects of early intervention for children with difficulty in acquiring reading skills many researchers believe that early intervention with children who experience difficulty in learning to read is more efficacious and ultimately more costeffective than attempts at later remediation this research in conjunction with data indicating that the majority of children with learning disabilities have primary disability in reading has led congress to support efforts to intervene early to assist children with reading difficulties develop the skills they need rather than attempt remediation with impaired readers later in their school years reading first and early reading first were drafted with the intent of incorporating the latest scientific understanding on what works in teaching reading1 this report summarizes evidence regarding the effectiveness of early intervention in general and in specific examines early intervention to improve reading skills background early intervention there is an extensive and growing body of research examining the effectiveness usually measured by cognitive functioning school readiness andor social adjustment in the shorterrun and by subsequent wages high school graduation rates criminal activity and welfare use in the longerrun of early childhood programs2 in some instances subsequent placement in special education is also considered 1 reading first and early reading first were authorized in pl 107110 for ongoing updated information on reading first and early reading first see crs report rl31241 reading first and early reading first background and funding by gail mccallion 2 in dec 2000 study titled eager to learn was released by the committee on early childhood pedagogy the committee was established by the national research council in 1997 to review and synthesize the theory and research on early childhood pedagogy and to make recommendations based on the present state of knowledge for early childhood education programs and public policy eager to learn included 19 specific recommendations in four major areas 1 teacher training 2 teaching materials 3 public policies to support quality preschools and 4 dissemination of information on preschool development the committee made recommendations in all four of these areas that it argued would significantly improve the us system of preschool education and care the committee agreed that the case for substantial investment in highquality system of child care and preschool on the basis of what is already known is persuasive one of the strongest recommendations made in eager to learn was regarding teacher training the committee recommended that all children in early care programs be provided with teacher who has bachelors degree and specialized education in early childhood crs2 overall the research on early intervention finds positive shortterm effects of highquality early childhood programs in terms of cognitive skills school readiness and social behavior and positive longterm effects in terms of greater high school completion rates higher earnings less criminal activity and less welfare use for model early intervention programs3 longterm effects from more typical programs such as head start are not conclusive4 in part this is due to the difficulty of separating the influence of early intervention from all the other factors that are significant in influencing longterm success there is also an extensive body of literature that specifically examines the impact of early intervention on reading outcomes many reading researchers assert that strategy of early intervention focused on identification and instruction of children with reading disabilities would significantly decrease the number of older children identified with learning disabilities would be more efficacious than later remediation and would reduce the need for special education placements5 reid lyon et state we estimate that the number of children who are typically identified as poor readers and served through either special education or compensatory education programs as well as children with significant reading difficulties who are not formally identified could be reduced by up to 70 through early identification and prevention programs6 many reading researchers contend that early intervention is more efficacious in improving reading than later intervention if child is experiencing difficulty early in the process of learning to read they say the child will fall behind in building vocabulary may fall behind in developing reading comprehension strategies and may develop negative attitude towards reading child with reading difficulties will read less than good readers and without early intervention will fall further behind normally progressing readers over time as these readers are rapidly increasing 3 for more information see crs report rl31123 early childhood education federal policy issues by gail mccallion 4 gao indicates that research to date is not definitive on the effectiveness of head start gao03840t head start key among array of early childhood programs but national research on effectiveness not completed for more on the issue of the long term effects of head start see crs report rl30952 head start issues in the 108th congress by melinda gish and alice butler w steven barnett director of the national institute for early education

at httpwwwnieerorg 5 reid lyon et state that 80 of children with learning disabilities have reading as their primary difficulty reading disability may consist of learning disability in basic reading skills or learning disability in reading comprehension reid lyon jack fletcher sally shaywitz bennett shaywitz joseph torgeson frank wood ann schulte and richard olson rethinking learning disabilities

disabilities 6 ibid p 260 crs3 their repertoire of sight words throughout elementary school according to these researchers in addition they say following years of failure older poor readers may be less motivated to learn to read joseph k torgesen argues that to the extent that we allow children to fall seriously behind at any point during early elementary school we are moving to remedial rather than preventive model of intervention once children fall behind in the growth of critical word reading skills it may require very intensive interventions to bring them back up to adequate levels of reading accuracy and reading fluency may be even more difficult to restore because of the large amounts of reading practice that is lost by children each month and year that they remain poor readers7 reading research factors influencing reading success the early childhood longitudinal study kindergarten class of 19981999 eclsk recent longitudinal data from the us department of education have provided more information on factors related to reading achievement these data indicate that there are host of child and family characteristics that are correlated with reading achievement in kindergarten and first grade8 the eclsk is longitudinal study that beginning with the 19981999 school year tracks nationally representative sample of children and measures among other things their reading achievement from kindergarten through 5th grade this study will provide an ongoing source of data on factors that are related to later success in reading up through 5th grade data on these children for their first 2 years of school kindergarten and 1st grade are now available upon kindergarten entry children with multiple risk factors for school failure mother with less than high school education single parent family welfare receipt primary language not english scored lower on measures of reading skill than children with zero or one risk factors during kindergarten these atrisk children made gains toward closing the gap with other children in simple reading skills such as letter recognition but the gap widened between the two groups in more complicated reading skills such as recognizing sight words in addition home literacy environment children who have more books records etc than average and are read to and sung to frequently was related to childrens reading skills at the beginning of kindergarten as well as to their reading skills at the end of kindergarten and 1st grade this relationship between childrens reading achievement and their home literacy environment was found both in children in families with incomes above and below the poverty threshold the eclsk data also showed that children who could recognize letters numbers and shapes and the relative size of objects at the beginning of kindergarten 7 joseph k torgesen catch them before they fall american educator springsummer 1998 p 32 hereafter cited as torgesen catch them before they fall 8 us department of education national center for education statistics the condition of education 2003 p 6 crs4 did better in reading at the end of kindergarten and 1st grade when compared with children who did not have those skills upon entering kindergarten in addition childrens reading performance was positively related to whether or not they had positive approach to learning and were in good health at the beginning of kindergarten data on effects of halfday versus fullday kindergarten were also examined the eclsk data suggest that public school students attending fullday kindergarten made more gains in reading during kindergarten than those attending halfday kindergarten9 the eclsk data also indicated some differences in the frequency that certain skills were taught in fullday versus halfday kindergarten full day classrooms were more likely than halfday classrooms to spend time everyday on the following skills letter recognition lettersound match conventions of print vocabulary making predictions based on text using context clues for comprehension rhyming words reading aloud reading multisyllable words and alphabetizing10 impacts of early intervention on reading steven barnett has surveyed model and more typical preschool education programs in order to assess their impact on subsequent reading achievement as well as on measures such as iq employment and special education placements in order to consider studies that would best measure program effects on these specific outcomes and exclude the effect of other differences among the children he considered 12 model programs that used random assignment participants were randomly assigned to either the experimental group ie with the intervention or else they were assigned to the control group11 most of the studies either had small initial sample sizes andor had significant attrition children leaving before the end of the study period two studies without these limitations were the abcedarian and perry preschool studies12 these two studies 9 ibid 10 ibid p 10 11 research studies that employ random assignment of comparable subjects to both control and treatment group are considered the most reliable however because educational research is conducted with children it is difficult to justify the random assignment of children to control and treatment groups if it means some will be deprived of instruction that they would have otherwise received partly for this reason many studies rely on similar group of nonparticipating children but this can result in biased results because of family and child characteristics that influence participation in the program even those studies that do use random assignment often have very small initial sample size andor experience great deal of attrition children not continuing in the study over the course of the study or there are limitations on the sample of children eg only children with low iq which may affect the results 12 steven barnett preschool education for economically disadvantaged children effects on reading achievement and related outcomes in susan neuman and david dickinson eds handbook of early literacy new york guildford press 2001 pp 421443 hereafter cited as barnett preschool education crs5 found positive effects on reading and literacy test scores that persisted into early adulthood barnett argues that the fadeout effect in reading found in many studies may be due to problems with research design and procedures that bias estimated effects toward zero and attrition in achievement test data that decreases statistical power 13 barnett notes that participation in other preschool education not the treatment being investigated by children in the control group may lead to underestimating treatments effect in addition barnett argues that the fadeout effect in the long term found in many reading studies may be due to the reduction in statistical reliability of study results because of attrition the loss of participants over time and to limitations in the research design and implementation that bias the effects downward14 for example he notes that many large studies rely on grade level school administered tests barnett raises several concerns about the use of these tests they are administered to an entire class by teacher in contrast to individually administered by specialist additionally over time fewer and fewer poorly performing students will be tested with their age cohort due to grade retention and the sample of poorly performing students will decrease due to special education placements and other factors15 13 ibid p 436 14 ibid p 436 there are other data issues that concern researchers investigating the efficacy of reading interventions and other early interventions these data limitations can influence researchers ability to conclusively determine the effectiveness of an intervention and to determine which children will benefit the most from the intervention one of these data issues is socalled prediction error ie false positives eg children who are incorrectly identified as at risk of reading difficulties as well as false negatives eg children who are incorrectly found to not be at risk of reading difficulties for example measures of phonological awareness during kindergarten are correlated with later success or difficulty in reading however the choice of cutoff score for children to be found at risk or not at risk can result in children being incorrectly identified if lower cutoff score is chosen to try and minimize the number of false positives then the group of students identified as at risk of reading difficulty will be smaller and as consequence the number of children incorrectly identified as not at risk of reading difficulty will rise if higher cut off score is chosen to try and minimize the number of false negatives then the group of students identified as at risk of reading difficulty will be larger and as consequence the number of students incorrectly identified as at risk will rise if intervention is delayed until 1st grade when test scores become more reliable then kindergartners who are at risk of reading difficulties will be deprived of needed intervention torgesen catch them before they fall p 35 15 barnett preschool education p 436 states at best studies relying on school administered tests have reading test data with lower reliability and sample sizes that decline over time both of which would reduce their ability to detect longterm program effects at worst such studies systematically lose the more poorly performing students from year to year as the cumulative percentage of children retained in grade placed in special education or otherwise omitted from testing grows the result is that any differences between program and comparison groups are gradually hidden as grade level rises because the children for whom achievement tests are available become more similar across the two groups crs6 barnett concludes that welldesigned studies do indicate that early intervention can produce positive longterm effects on reading outcomes for children in poverty there are also longterm improvements in math and language achievement and in school success measured by grade retention and special education placements but not in iq the long term gains have been found to occur even without subsequent interventions it is also consistent with the view that the first few years of schooling have an important influence on future school success for example by affecting reading group placements and other ability tracking teacher expectations parental expectations and the childs sense of selfefficacy motivation and classroom behavior none of this suggests that society should abandon efforts to improve the elementary education of disadvantaged children whether by such structural changes as decreased class size or through improved pedagogy16 wordlevel reading difficulties the discussion thus far has focused on the relationship to subsequent reading success or failure of intensive early childhood interventions such as enriched child care and of ses status and other child and family characteristics however much of the research on reading intervention has focused specifically on wordlevel reading difficulties many reading researchers agree that poor readers experience difficulties in the early process of learning to read because they have difficulty learning accurate and fluent recognition of words this section briefly explains wordlevel reading difficulties the efficacy of interventions with children who have such difficulties is addressed below many empirical studies focusing on wordlevel reading weaknesses have found these weaknesses to be largely attributable to phonological processing difficulties17 and to lessened ability to quickly and accurately read words also referred to as rapid word naming research grounded in common theoretical framework now provides evidence that instruction that heightens phonological awareness and that emphasizes the connections to the alphabetic code promotes greater skill in word recognition skill essential to becoming proficient reader18 research has also indicated that wordlevel reading difficulties are not linked to intelligence and that intervention can significantly reduce the number of children in early elementary school experiencing these difficulties some reading researchers 16 barnett preschool education p 438 17 phonological processing requires the ability to hear identify and manipulate phonemes as well as broader skills of word manipulation eg the ability to identify rhymes words syllables onsets and rimes these difficulties are also linked to lesser extent with phonological memory 18 benita blachman phonological awareness in handbook of reading research vol iii mahwah nj lawrence erlbaum pub p 495 joseph torgesen ann alexander richard wagner carol rashotte kytja voeller and tim conway intensive remedial instruction for children with severe reading disabilities immediate and longterm outcomes from two instructional approaches journal of learning disabilities vol 34 no1 janfeb 2000 p 33 crs7 argue that identifying children for early intervention in reading based on weaknesses in phonological processing rapid automatic wordrecognition and phonological memory will be more effective in identifying children who need early intervention in reading than identifying children for early intervention by looking for discrepancy between general verbal ability and reading achievement however children with higher general verbal ability than their wordlevel reading skills may ultimately achieve higher reading comprehension levels because they have greater cognitive skills in other areas critical to reading comprehension19 research on efficacy of reading interventions two influential research reports on reading are frequently cited by policy makers working on reading issues they are preventing reading difficulties in young children and teaching children to read national research council nrc in 1998 the nrc published report titled preventing reading difficulties in young children the nrc report examined skill and environmental factors that facilitate acquisition of reading skills it did not explicitly investigate how those skills could be transferred to classroom settings the nrc report concluded that 1 early exposure in the home and in school to language and books is critical 2 effective reading instruction requires well trained preschool and elementary school teachers and 3 elementary school teachers should include all of the following components in reading instruction alphabetics reading sight words techniques in sounding out letters and words and achieving fluency and comprehension the national reading panel nrp in 2000 the nrp issued report titled teaching children to read the nrp was convened by the national institute of child health and human development nichd with the consultation of the us department of education ed in response to congressional charge to review the literature on reading and use it to assess the effectiveness of different techniques for teaching reading and whether these techniques were ready to be applied to classroom settings the nrp research was intended to build on the earlier research conducted by the nrc the nrp conducted literature review of studies which met rigorous scientific standards in reaching conclusions it focused only on experimental and quasi experimental studies the following instructional topics were examined by the nrp phonemic awareness and phonics fluency comprehension teacher education and reading instruction and computer technology and reading instruction the selected topics were chosen based on the nrps assessment of issues central to reading instruction and achievement and based on input received from public forums20 19 joseph

crs8 in summarizing the implications of its work for the teaching of reading the nrp noted that not all the areas it investigated contained sufficient data to reach conclusions however it did find that the data supported the following conclusions systematic phonics instruction the teaching of planned sequence of phonics elements is effective for children in grades k1 and for children in grades 26 in word decoding and pseduoword reading and for children who are having difficulty learning to read systematic phonics instruction was found to be so successful that the nrp recommended it as appropriate for routine classroom instruction phonemic awareness is crucial building block for phonics21 as early as kindergarten children benefit significantly from phonics instruction children with learning disabilities lowachieving children and those from low socioeconomic levels benefit from systematic phonics instruction in conjunction with synthetic phonics instruction teaching students to convert letters into phonemes and then blend the phonemes to form words reading fluency word recognition and comprehension are enhanced by repeated guided oral reading the nrp found the research data insufficient to conclude whether or not encouraging children to read on their own is effective in improving reading fluency word recognition and comprehension although there is correlational evidence of its effectiveness in particular looking at the effects of phonics instruction an area that has received much public attention the nrp found statistically significant results from phonics instruction across multiple domains22 the effect sizes of phonics instruction were found to be greatest for students in kindergarten and 1st grade researchers surmise this occurs because phonics is more effective if taught before students are reading on their own the largest effects of phonics training overall for 20 continued reading education week jan 30 2002 p 5 three new federal panels have been formed following the issuance of the nrp report one is examining more quantitative research on reading one is examining qualitative research on reading and the third is examining reading issues for english as second language learners in addition the national institute for literacy and the national center for family literacy have formed panel to examine early childhood studies to identify predictive factors for later reading proficiency as well as effective practices for building prereading skills for children from birth to age 5 its report is expected in dec 2003 kathleen kennedy manzo national panel readying guidance to build foundations for reading education week july 9 2003 p 13 21 phonemes are the smallest units of spoken language the word go for example consists of two phonemes 22 jacob cohen statistical power analysis for the behavior sciences hillsdale nj erlbaum 1988 an effect size of 2 is considered small 5 is considered moderate and 8 or above is considered large crs9 kindergartners and first graders were in decoding regularly spelled words d09823 decoding pseudo words and in spelling words d067 the effects of phonics on comprehension measures were mixed across subpopulations youngest students benefitted the most in comprehension measures d051 for kindergarten and 1st graders in part because the youngest readers comprehension of text is strongly influenced by the ability to read the words in the text probably more so than for children in later grades24 the effects of phonics instruction on comprehension for students beyond first grade were relatively small for disabled older students d032 and were even smaller for older students overall d01225 thus research indicates that early intervention in phonics instruction benefits children in learning to read words however its impact on comprehension is more limited as indicated by the research of the nrp this intervention does have moderately significant effect with young children and small effect with disabled older students on comprehension the correlation between phonics instruction and comprehension for older students in general is not significant this may be attributable to the many additional factors beyond being able to read words that influence comprehension reading comprehension requires in addition to word reading skills vocabulary subject area knowledge thinking and reasoning skills effective reading strategies and motivation among other things26 critical perspectives on the national reading panel report the nrp report has prompted significant critical response 1 because of the perceived narrowness of the topics examined 2 because of methodological concerns and 3 because of its substantive and policy conclusions joanne yatvin member of the nrp wrote minority view criticizing the perceived narrowness of the topics selected for review in her minority view attached to the nrp report yatvin states that the nrp effectively excluded any inquiry into the field of language and literature and that the research reviewed by the nrp would be of limited usefulness to teachers administrators and policymakers because they the reviews fail to address the key issues that have made elementary 23 report of the national reading panel reports of the subgroups pp 110 hereafter cited as reports of the subgroups effect sized effect sizes equaled how much the mean of the phonics group exceeded that of control group in standard deviation units when appropriate and feasible effect sizes were calculated for each intervention or condition in experimental and quasiexperimental studies the subgroups used the standardized mean difference formula as the measure of treatment effect 24 reports of the subgroups pp 2107 the effect of phonics instruction on oral reading for kindergartners and 1st graders although significant was only d023 25 reports of the subgroups pp 2108 the effect of phonics instruction on oral reading for older students was statistically

california state university has authored book written in question and answer format that is directed at questions that teachers may have as they investigate how to implement scientifically based reading research in their classrooms garan argues that the conclusions of the nrp are based on limited research and are focused on few limited topics and thus fail to provide useful information on reading instruction as whole entity which she argues is how teachers must confront it because the nrp focused its research on isolated skills they ignored the complexities of the reading process as well as the incredible complexities of real children in real classrooms in fact only about 16 of the studies in the phonics report even looked at the impact of its scientific methods on childrens reading comprehension of authentic connected text28 and garan expresses concerns about the potential impacts of applying the nrps findings on teachers and classrooms the federal government has decided it knows better than we do what we should teach how we should teach and even when we should teach it29 one recent study attempted to replicate the nrps results on the influence of phonics on beginning readers by conducting its own metaanalysis of the studies examined by the nrp30 gregory camilli professor at rutgers graduate school of education sadakovargas assistant professor at kean university and michele yurecko phd student at rutgers graduate school of education began with the 38 studies examined by the nrp and deleted one because it lacked control group and added three others that they felt should not have been rejected for inclusion by the nrp after conducting their metaanalysis the authors concluded that the methodology and procedures in teaching children to read were not adequate for synthesizing the research literature on phonics instruction31 camilli vargas and 27 report of the national reading panel reports of the subgroups minority view of joanne yatvin 2000 28 elaine

the results of multiple studies in systematic way the authors note though some of the methodological steps taken by the nrp analysts were retraced our goal was to verify whether an independent team of researchers would arrive at conclusions consistent with those in the nrp report we did not examine how the original 38 studies were chosen 31 camilli et teaching children to read p 12 among other things the authors believe that there were differences among control groups that might have biased the results and continued crs11 yurecko did find statistically significant effect of systematic phonics instruction compared to nonsystematic or phonics instruction on learning to read but of much lower magnitude than the effect found by the nrp d024 and d041 respectively however the authors also found that the effect of individual tutoring d040 was greater than the effect of phonics instruction d024 and they found that the effect of systematic language activities was comparable d029 to the effects of phonics instruction the authors believe that these effects are likely additive and that when all three instructional techniques are combined the effect size may be triple that of phonics alone as federal policies are formulated around early literacy curricula and instruction these findings indicate that phonics as one aspect of the complex reading process should not be overemphasized32 michael pressley professor in the psychology department at the university of notre dame argues that the nrp report was too methodologically and conceptually narrow he contends that the nrp should have examined influences in early childhood that can affect reading outcomes rather than relying solely on school age interventions effective reading instruction occurs over years and changes with the developmental level of the child with these dynamics not captured at all by the panels emphases on discrete skills appropriate at only particular developmental levels ie mostly when children are mastering lettersound associations and beginning word recognition effective literacy instruction is balance and blending of skills teaching and holistic literature and writing experiences33 additionally pressley argues that there are scientifically validated findings on the effects of the following factors that should have been included by the nrp home storybook reading television eg between the lions community resources such as tutoring language of instruction and school reform movements pressley also argues that the nrp should have included information on the positive effects of whole language instruction which pressley states is the most pervasive approach to reading instruction in schools in the 1990s further he argues that the nrp could have done great deal of good for educators by attempting to separate out the instructional wheat from the instructional chaff in whole language for there is both 31 continued that more moderator variables should have been employed by moderator variable we mean component of treatment delivery that leads to stronger or weaker effect four new moderator variables were constructed for specifying the treatment conditions degree of phonics systematicity degree of coordinated language activities whether treatments were regular inclass or pullout programs and whether basal readers were used these variables which were coded from the research studies by means of rubrics provided the explanatory power missing from the simple comparative design used in the nrp analyses that is the nrp design did not fully account for variation in the mixtures and degrees of treatment delivered to both experimental and control groups 32 camilli et teaching children to read p 12 33 michael pressley effective beginning reading instruction paper commissioned by the national reading conference 2001 p 3 crs12 wheat and chaff in what is conventional instruction for many children in american classrooms34 policy and implementation issues reading first and early reading first were created to broaden and expand existing reading programs in order to address concerns about student reading achievement and to try and reach younger children these programs draw upon recent reading research and in particular upon the recommendations of the nrp by requiring that reading first and early reading first programs implement scientifically based reading and prereading curricula these significant new reading initiatives were part of the january 8 2002 reauthorization of the elementary and secondary education act pl 10711035 these new programs are part of broader initiative by the administration to among other things increase the quality and quantity of academic and preacademic skills lowincome children are receiving with the goal of ensuring children participating in these programs are able to read by third grade one of the purposes of the early reading first program is to integrate scientifically based reading research into existing head start childcare and preschool programs these preschool programs are intended to be integrated with the reading first program which may serve some of these same children in early elementary school grades k3 in addition to reading first and early reading first there are several other federally funded programs that provide early education and care to lowincome children the largest federal program with early childhood development as its primary mission is head start the programs reauthorization is currently being considered by congress the house has passed head start reauthorization bill hr 2210 and reauthorization legislation has been approved by the senate health education labor and pensions committee the head start improvement and school readiness act36 head start provides educational services to lowincome children to prepare them to enter kindergarten as well as health nutrition and other services the last reauthorization of the head start program in 1998 increased the share of appropriations targeted for quality improvement activities and also required the administering agency the department of health and human services to develop specific education performance standards for the program in its fy2004 budget the administration proposed transferring head start to ed to better ensure coordination with other preschool programs with the goal of ensuring all children participating are prepared to enter kindergarten in addition to head start other large federal programs funding early education and care are the child care and

support to all k3 students and their teachers in the schools that are served and it is the departments view that the classroom provides the most important teaching venue for reaching these early readers it is the classroom where the program will build and support the scientifically based reading foundation reading first seeks to embed the essential components of reading instruction into all elements of the primary mainstream k3 teaching structures of each state41 leas receiving reading first funds are required to use these funds to select and administer screening diagnostic and classroombased instructional reading assessments42 leas are also required to implement scientifically based reading program that includes the essential components of reading instruction additional required uses include procuring and implementing scientificallybased instructional materials providing professional development to teachers grade k3 and k12 for special education teachers that will prepare them in all of the essential components of reading instruction collecting summarizing and reporting data and promoting reading and library programs that expose students to engaging reading material 43 reading first defines the essential components of reading instruction as phonemic awareness b phonics c vocabulary development d reading fluency including oral reading skills and reading comprehension strategies44 the early reading first program with funding of 75 million in its first year fy2002 is competitive grant program leas eligible for reading first grants as well as other public or private organizations serving preschool age children or combinations of one or more of the above may apply for these grants there are five stated purposes underlying the early reading first program to support local efforts to enhance the early language literacy and prereading development of preschool age children particularly those from lowincome families to provide preschool age children with cognitive learning opportunities in highquality and languagerich environments to demonstrate language and literacy activities based on scientifically based reading research that supports ageappropriate development of prereading skills to use screening assessments to effectively identify preschool children who may be at risk for reading failure and to integrate such scientificallybased instructional materials and literacy activities with existing programs of preschools child care 41 us department of education guidance for the reading first program apr 2002 42 section 1202 c7ai pl

size and scope has focused considerable attention on it and on the requirements states must meet in order to receive reading first money in response to congressional and public concerns ed has stated that there is approved list of reading programs and assessments that will be required for states to receive reading first funds nevertheless ongoing concern has been expressed regarding what some perceive as overly prescriptive requirements of reading first and about whether states will be able to use locally developed reading initiatives and other supplemental programs such as reading recovery46 reading first is still very new and as consequence performance data from states in implementing these grants are not yet available however the international reading association ira has published study examining the successful application experience of 13 states under reading first47 the review included interviews with the application coordinators of the 13 states via telephone and email as well as examination of the actual applications available on the web the ira wanted the following areas of concern about the application process explored whether states would be limited to specific curriculum materials or to specific assessment measures and how the eligibility of providers of professional development would be determined in the review of these 13 applications the ira noted that some states privately expressed ongoing concerns about the extensive revisions to their applications that were required before final approval the ira also expressed concerns about document distributed at reading first leadership academies and relied upon by many states in completing their applications48 the document titled consumers guide to evaluating core reading program grades k3 critical analysis was authored by deborah simmons and edward kameenui the ira noted that the publication recommended the use of decodable 45 section 1221 pl 107110 46 reading recovery is highly

classroom teaching in reading recovery individual students receive halfhour lesson each school day for 12 to 20 weeks with specially trained reading recovery teachers as soon as students can read

were conducted by the ed to assist states in understanding the requirements of the new law crs16 text in reading programs even though the nrp had found the research insufficient to reach conclusion on the effectiveness of decodable text49 nevertheless if states are not required to use materials that include decodable text this concern will be satisfied according to cathy roller director of research and policy for the ira it is not clear exactly how each of the approved states will use the consumers guide it is not clear how serious this problem may be it is unlikely that any series would meet all of the criteria listed in the consumers guide if it is possible to use materials that do not include decodable text then there is little cause for concern however if the states are required to use materials that include decodable text then that would be cause for concern the ira study conclusions were generally positive the study found that the us department of education so far has not restricted states to the use of specific curriculum materials or specific tests and that there is broad range of plans for determining eligible providers of professional development50 the ira survey noted that the 13 states surveyed were not limited to specific commercial programs and that state officials were satisfied overall with the application process remedial education part of the rationale for early intervention in reading is that it is more educationally effective and ultimately more cost effective than subsequent remediation with already impaired readers although the reading instruction provided by special education is more effective than general education classroom instruction for children with reading disabilities current instruction in many special education placements is not sufficient to accelerate reading growth so that there is reasonable hope for these children to achieve averagelevel skills in reasonable time51 part of the promise of early intervention for students who need it in general education classrooms is that it will result in fewer children needing more extensive and expensive remediation such as that provided under title i of the elementary and secondary education act esea for children attending relatively high poverty schools and the specialized services provided under the individuals with disabilities education act idea52 49 decodable text refers to books containing the lettersound relationships that children have been taught 50 bell the international reading associations review 51 joseph k torgesen ann w alexander richard k wagner

failure takes hold indeed in the majority continued crs17 to what extent might early reading intervention reduce the number of children requiring subsequent remedial services the congressional research service crs has examined the potential growth in the population of children with learning disabilities in order to project full funding costs of idea under alternative assumptions53 one of these alternatives assumes that the percentage of children identified as learning disabled could be reduced over time by 50 via an estimated 70 reduction in the 80 of learning disabled children whose primary disability is in reading due to early reading interventions such as those provided by reading first and early reading first it should be emphasized that crs does not predict that such reduction will actually occur but is only exploring the implications of such an assumed reduction in pupils with disabilities employing these assumptions the number of children identified as learning disabled would be significantly reduced over time under these assumptions crs estimates that by 2010 66 million children would be identified as learning disabled compared to the eds budget office projected estimate of 74 million54 52 continued of cases there is systematic identification until third grade by which time successful remediation is more difficult and more costly for more on esea

estimating maximum funding for idea part b grants to states under current law hr 1350 and 1248 by richard n apling july 30 2003 hereafter cited as apling estimating maximum funding for idea under idea child with disability is defined as one i with mental retardation hearing impairments including deafness speech or language impairments visual impairments including blindness serious emotional disturbance hereinafter referred to as emotional disturbance orthopedic impairments autism traumatic brain injury other health impairments or specific learning disabilities and ii who by reason thereof needs special education and related services idea also permits states and leas to include child as having disability who is experiencing developmental delays in one or more of the following areas physical development cognitive development communication development social or emotional development or adaptive development idea section 602 3a in addition children aged 39 may be classified as child with disability under the discretion of the lea if they are experiencing developmental delays and as consequence need special education and related services 54 these assumptions on the overall percent decline in children with learning disabilities are based on research by reid lyon crs further assumes that the slowing growth in the number of children with disabilities due to these reading interventions will be gradual ie in the first year after implementation it assumes reduction of children in 1st grade identified as learning disabled in the second year the reduction in growth will affect children in first grade and the previous first graders now entering second grade this trajectory is assumed to continued over time see apling estimating maximum funding for idea crs18 cooccurring disabilities and treatmentresistors when considering how to reduce the number of children who will require intensive subsequent intervention it is important to briefly mention the issue of cooccurring disabilities and so called treatmentresistors first there are children who suffer from multiple disabilities children with cooccurring disabilities may respond positively to reading interventions but may still require ongoing intensive treatment such as special education and related services for other disabilities the us department of educations 22nd annual report on the implementation of idea 2000 includes chapter discussing available data on cooccurring disabilities ed notes that although cooccurring disabilities are common because of data limitations including differing definitions of disability and differences in populations studied estimates of cooccurring disabilities have varied from 19 of special education students to 4855 secondly reading researchers have pointed out that there are group of children called treatmentresistors who do not respond positively to typical reading interventions torgesen et have noted in their research that the nonresponders were children with multiple areas of reading related difficulties ie they had weaknesses in phonological awareness rapid automatic naming ability and knowledge of lettersound correspondences as well as weaknesses in general oral language skills thus even if early intervention in reading succeeds in significantly reducing the number of children requiring more intensive intervention the research is clear that there will remain group of children who will continue to need subsequent intensive intervention assuming that early intervention in reading succeeds in significantly reducing the pool of children who need intensive remedial education such as the services provided under idea there remains an issue regarding whether these remedial services are being effectively targeted to the children who continue to need it some researchers argue that current eligibility determinations for receiving idea services may be delaying and limiting the pool of children who are receiving intensive reading assistance under idea in order to be eligible under idea child must be found to have disability and many children are not identified as having disability until 3rd grade in addition many states and leas employ discrepancy standard eg the point spread between iq and achievement scores to determine whether child qualifies for services under idea as having specific learning disability56 55 us department of education twentysecond annual report to congress on the implementation of the individuals with disabilities education act 2000 p ii34 56 many children are covered by idea because of specific learning disabilitys which is defined as in general the term specific learning disability means disorder in one or more of the basic psychological processes involved in understanding or in using language spoken or written which disorder may manifest itself in imperfect ability to listen think speak read write spell or do mathematical calculations b disorders included such terms includes such conditions as perceptual disabilities brain injury minimal brain dysfunction dyslexia and developmental apahsia c disorders not included such term does not include learning problem that continued crs19 some researchers contend that the discrepancy standard is not valid indicator of learning disabilities arguing that most children who experience difficulty in acquiring early word reading skills have phonological processing difficulties and that these difficulties occur in children with low general intelligence as well as those with normal general intelligence57 lyon among others contends that applying this discrepancy standard results in wait to fail model because the discrepancy formulas usually cannot reliably identify child as learning disabled until 3rd grade58 legislative proposals in the 108th congress to reauthorize idea hr 1350 and s 1248 include provision that specifically states that leas need not use the discrepancy standard in determining whether student has specific learning disability59 56 continued is primarily the result of visual hearing or motor disabilities of mental retardation of emotional disturbance or of environmental cultural or economic disadvantage idea section 602 item 26 57 torgesen catch them before they fall pp 3334 phonological processing is often measured by assessing phonemic awareness defined as the ability to identify think about or manipulate the individual sounds in words 58 lyon et rethinking learning disabilities p 260 because there is strong evidence that the iqachievement discrepancy criterion either 1 describes an intrinsic readingrelated processing difference within lowachieving readers nondiscrepant versus discrepant or provides differential prediction of response to intervention or education outcomes the use of such discrepancy requirements to deny specialized services andor accommodations to nondiscrepant poor readers is arbitrary and problematic 59 for more on idea see crs report rl31259 individuals with disabilities education act statutory provisions and selected issues by richard apling and nancy jones crs20 glossary of selected

first is intended to provide teachers information on what works in teaching reading based on scientificallybased reading research phoneme is the smallest part of spoken language that makes difference in the meaning of words english has about 41 phonemes few words such as or oh have only one phoneme most words however have more than one phoneme the word if has two phonemes i f check has three phonemes ch k and stop has four phonemes s t p sometimes one phoneme is represented by more than one letter grapheme is the smallest part of written language that represents phoneme in the spelling of word grapheme may be just one letter such as b d f p s or several letters such as ch sh th ck ea igh phonics is the understanding that there is predictable relationship between phonemes the sounds of spoken language and graphemes the letters and spellings that represent those sounds in written language phonemic awareness is the ability to hear identify and manipulate the individual sounds phonemes in spoken words phonological awareness is broad term that includes phonemic awareness in addition to phonemes phonological awareness activities can involve work with rhymes words syllables and onsets and rimes syllable is word part that contains vowel or in spoken language vowel sound event newspaper very onsets and rimes are parts of spoken language that are smaller than syllables but larger than
