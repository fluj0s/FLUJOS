from ed cook drdendroldeocolumbiaedu to keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk subject re the real message date mon 10 sep 2001 164518 0400 hi keith you probably havent seen the newest version which has not yet been submitted but i clearly state that several of the data setssites used in the paper have been used before and i reference all of the relevant papers i never implied anywhere that this was the first successful use of rcs i also reference your quat sci rev paper and your age banding paper i also state in the concluding section that what has been shown is not new but it is somewhat novel the separation of the data into rc curve classes and the regionalization of the data on the scale described and informative i stand by that completely so the version i am working on covers hopefully some of your concernscomplaints i will do my best to be fair before i finally submit it however this is report to science 2500 word limit so i cant do the kind of review of the literature and detailed discussiion of results that would be possible in more normal size papers sorry for sounding bit testy here ive been fielding whole raft of questions comments and criticisms from mike mann tom crowley and malcolm hughes some of them useful many of them tiresome or besides the point i never wanted to get involved in this quixotic game of producing the next great nh temperature reconstruction because of the professional politics and sensitivities involved all i wanted to do was demonstate with jan that broecker was wrong something that you have obviously done few times before but in journals that broecker and others dont follow closely i guess i should also say that the amount of ignorance about tree rings in the global changepaleomodeling community is staggering given what has been published like it or not they simply dont read our papers in so doing it seemed reasonable to compare the rcs chronology against the hockey stick because that is the series that broecker was railing against that is why i didnt bother to compare the series against all the other records produced by you phil and others jan originally did that but i chose to restrict the comparison to tighten the focus of the paper more reference to your results is clearly justified so maybe i was wrong here this all reinforces my determination to leave this nhglobal temperature reconstruction junk behind once i get this paper submitted its not worth the aggravation however the paper is something that i need to do for jan and i still think it is good paper cheers ed what i really mean is that you have written this paper implying that you are getting lowfrequency nh temperatures out of treering data for the first time using the rcs you set up this question then use lot of data in your analysis and the rcs as though they have not been analysed like this before and then show you get more of lia than mann while ignoring the fact that i have already produced calibrated summer temperature curves in the science perspective piece from rcs ring width data in sweden urals taimyr and in the jgr paper using banded density which both show more low frequency than mbh the real question is whether mbh use data in tropical and mid latitudes that supress what is really high latitude summer signal in their northen predictors i just dont think you are being very fair here despite how many times you cite perhaps the citations should anyway reflect the useful contributions to particular area even if they number more than token couple thats off my chest now cheers keith professor keith briffa climatic research unit university of east anglia norwich nr4 7tj uk phone 441603593909 fax 441603507784 httpwwwcruueaacukcrupeoplebriffa dr edward r cook doherty senior scholar treering laboratory lamontdoherty earth observatory palisades new york 10964 usa email drdendroldeocolumbiaedu phone 8453658618 fax 8453658152
