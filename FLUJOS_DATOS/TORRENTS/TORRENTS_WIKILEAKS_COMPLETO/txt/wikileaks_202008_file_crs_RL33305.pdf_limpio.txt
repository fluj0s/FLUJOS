government acted the crude oil windfall profit tax on the us oil industry th main purpose of the tax was to recoup for the federal government much of the revenue that woul d have otherwise gone to the oil industry as result of the decontrol of oil prices supporters of the tax viewed this revenue as an unearned and unanticipated windfa ll caused by high oil prices which were determined by the opec organization of petroleum exporting countries cartel despite its name the windfall profit tax wpt was actually an excise tax not profits tax imposed on the difference between the market price of oil and an adjusted base price while most domestically produced oil was subject to the tax about 23 in 1985 the remaining 13 that was taxexempt was significant 13 billion barrels in 1985 or 360000 barrels per day the 80 billion in gross revenues generated by the wpt between 1980 and 1988 was significantly less than the 393 billion projected due to the deductibility of the wpt against the income tax cumulative net wpt revenues were about 38 billion significantly less than the 175 billion projected this report presents timates of the amount of foregone oil production from 19801986 due to the wpt unde r three alternative supply price responses reflecting three different assump tions about the price elasticity of the domestic oil supply function critical fact or statistic in estimating lost oil output and increased import dependence from 1980 to 1988 the wpt may have reduced domestic oil production anywhere from 12 to 80 320 to 1269 million barrels dependence on imported oil grew from betw een 3 and 13 the tax was repealed in 1988 because 1 it was an administrative burden to the internal revenue service irs 2 it was compliance burden to the il industry 3 due to low oil prices the tax was generating little or revenues in 1987 and 1988 nd 4 it made the united states more dependent on foreign oil the depressed state of the us oil industry after 1986 also contributed to the repeal decision reinstating the windfall profit tax would reduce recent oil i ndustry windfalls due to high crude and petroleum prices but could have veral adverse economic effects if imposed as an excise tax the wpt would increase marginal production costs and be expected to reduce domestic oil production and increas the level of oil imports which today is at nearly 60 of demand crude prices would not tend to increase some have proposed an exci tax on both domestically produced and imported oil as way of mitigating the negative effects on petroleum import dependence such broadbased wpt w ould tend to reduce import dependence but it would lead to higher crude oil prices and likely to oil industry profits potentially undermining its original goals because th pure corporate profits tax is relatively neutral in the short run few if any price and output effects occur because marginal production costs are unchanged in the short run possible option would be corporate income surtax on the ups tream operations of crude oil producers such tax that would recoup any r ecent windfalls with less adverse economic effects imports would not increase because domestic pr oduction would remain unchanged in the long run such tax is tax on capital it reduces the rate of return thus reducing the supply of capital to the oil industryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33305contents background 1 t h i l p

oil industry profits which have pr ompted some policymakers to propose that either the windfall profit tax of the 1980s wpt be reinstated or that some new version of that tax be enacted currently fourteen congre ssional bills propose some type of windfall tax on domestic oil companies three of these bills have been offered as amendments to s 2020 the senates tax reconc iliation b ill such pr oposals are not uncommon when oil prices rise sharply to high levels the doubling in oil prices from june to august of 1990 due to the crisis in the middle east iraq invaded kuwait on august 2 1990 prompted similar proposals to redu ce what many policymakers viewed as an unduly large increase in oil industry profits this report provides an overview and anal ysis of the crude oil windfall profit

that can be learned from the eightyear experience with the tax and the implications of reinstating the tax are discussed in the final section background the crude oil windfall profit tax ac t pl 96223 was enacted in 1980 as part of compromise between the carter administration and the congress over the decontrol of crude oil prices the struct ure of the wpt was based on the structure of the oil price control program the oil price control program from august 1971 to january 1981 the pr ice of domestic oil was controlled by the federal government it was constrained from rising to market levels oil price controls were initiated under president nixons general wageprice freeze of august 15 1971 which consis ted of four stages or time periods called phases each withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33305crs2 1 wage and price controls were authoriz ed under the economic stabilization act of 1970 2 the yom kippur was occurred in october 1973 and the arab oil embargo lasted from october 1973 to april 1974 the emergency pe troleum allocation act also created the crude oil entitlement program and other programs intended to subsidize and protect small refiners for discussion of that program see crs report rl32248 petroleum refining economic performance and c hallenges for the future by robert pirogvarious degrees of controls1 these controls were not focused on oil alone they applied generally to most goods and services the general wageprice freeze terminated in 1973 but under phase iv of the program effective from august 12 1973 to april 30 1974 price controls on petroleum were retained oil price controls were extended th rough 1975 under the emergency petroleum allocation act of 1973 pl 93159 enact ed in november 1973 at the onset of the arab oil embargo2 this law created the twotiered price control program making the structure more complex most domestically produced oil was categorized as either lower tier old oil or upper tier new oil each with its corresponding controlled base price lower tier oil was generally oil from properties that began production before 1973 under regulations the price ceiling on this oil was the highest posted price in effect on ma 15 1973 plus 035barrel on all oil produced from wells that produced at less than th eir 1972 levels which resulted in posted price for old oil of about 425barrel subs equent regulations increased the ceiling price in 1973 to 525barrel new oil oil produced from wells that began production in1973 stripper oil oil produced from we lls that produce 10 bpd or less and imported oil were not price c ontrolled it could be sold at the market clearing price which was determined by the delivered pr ices of imported crude inclusive of the customs duties note that these tiers were artificial designations for the purposes of controlled pricing the distinctions were made only for purposes of establishing different base prices they had other meaning oil price controls were amended under the energy policy and conservation act of 1975 epca75 and the energy conser vation act of 1976 eca epca75 pl 94163 replaced the twotiered price control system with threetier system lower tier oil was oil produced below the bas production control level the level below the 1975 average monthly production upper tier oil was output in excess of this base level or output from new wells those broug ht into production after 1975 stripper oil was initially classified as controlled upper tier oil but subsequent changes see below decontrolled it altoge ther epca75 also established national average price for all oil of 766barrel the weighted average price of lower tier oil old oil which had ceiling of 525barre l and upper tier oil new oil and stripper oil which by this time also became controlled at 1128barrel the average domestic oil price was per mitted to increase at the ra of 10 annually in 1975 uncontrolled imported oil sold for about 1325 barrel at the onset of the oil price control program domestic oil prices we re just above 3 per barrel epca75 also gave the president the discretionary authority to end oil price controls anytime between may 31 1979 and september 30 1981 on october 11981 all controls would expire the eca of 1976 made furthe r mostly technical amendments to the price control system eg exempting stripper oil from the price controls but otherwise it left

riod between june 1 1979 and september 30 1981 after which prices would rise to wo rld market levels on april 5 1979 the carter administration announced its intention to use that authority and throughout its remaining term in office price contro ls on petroleum products and various types of crude were selectively d econtrolled the intent of the gradual decontrol was to promote energy conservation and to stimu late energy explor ation and production without the dislocations that might resu lt with sudden decontrol between april 1979 and january 1981 oil prices were partially and gra dually decontrolled newly discovered oil was completely decontrolled but price cont rols on other types of oil continued president reagan repealed pr ice controls on january 28 1981 which was one of his first official decisions as president3 origins of the crude oil windfall profit tax of 1980 excess profits taxes are extraordinary measures as tax policy instruments their use limited to wartime or othe r periods characterized by economic emergencies and instabilities such as inflations and hyperinflations such was the case with the surtax on business profits imposed as temporary measure to control large profits earned during world wars i and ii and the korean war4 the origin of the 1980 wpt was as with many other energy taxes and energy tax subsidies the first oil crisis of the 1970s the arab oil embargo of 197374 between 1973 and 1980 attempts to decont rol oil prices were accompanied by proposals to impose an excess profits tax in 1974 the ford administration proposed an emergency windfall profit tax to recap ture oil industry windfalls resulting from price decontrol in august of 1975 the senate finance committee approved windfall profit tax conditi oned on price decontrol congress however did not decontrol oil prices in 1977 the carter administration proposed an oil tax similar to the 1980 windfall profit tax the crude oil equalization tax as part of program to restructure the existing price controls5 these proposals were the precursors of the 1980 windfall profit taxhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33305crs4 table 1 summary of the oil price control program in

tax that was ultima tely enacted in 1980 originated with president carters april 5 1979 decision to gradually phase out price controls between june 1 1979 and september 30 1981 as discussed above at the same time the carter administra tion announced its proposal to impose wpt to prevent unearned excessive profits by the oil industry in congress the carter administrations original windfall profit tax bill hr 3919 was proposed by representative ullman chairman of the ways and means committee the house approved an amended version on june 28 1979 the nate approved its version at the end on 1979 and the house senate conference deliberated for about three months president carter signed the bill into law on april 2 1980 amendments to the windfall profit tax the wpt was amended many times afte r it was enacted in 1980 virtually every tax law that was enacted be tween 1980 and 1988 made some type of amendment to it usually minor and technical but sometimes significant for example the technical co rrections act of 1982 pl 97448 made several minor and technical amendments major ch anges were made however under the economic rec overy act of 1981 pl 9734 which reduced tax rates on newly discovered oil made strippe r oil from small wells tax exempt and introduced tax credit for royalty owners soon after enactment of the wpt ther were proposals to reduce tax rates liberalize some of

and 1988 in may 1987 for example ten bills were pending in the congre ss proposing to repeal the wpt repeal of the windfall profit tax the actual repeal of the wpt in 1988 was made through an amendment to omnibus trade legislation hr 3 afte r hearings in the summer of 1987 the senate voted 5840 in favor of repeal amendment to the trade bill the original house trade bill however did not contain the amendment while house conferees were generally opposed to wpt repeal confer ees from the senate finance and house ways and means committees did agree on repeal amendment on march 31 1988 the house approved hr 3 with the repeal amendment on april 21 by vote of 312107 the senate appr oved the conference report on hr 3 on april 27 enactment of hr 3 including the wpt repeal amendment was precarious because president reagan objecting to several of the provisions in the trade bill had threatened to veto it eventually however these problems were resolved and the trade bill with the repeal of the wpt was signed in august of 19887 structure of the tax despite its name the crude oil windfall pr ofit tax was not ta x on profits it was an excise tax or more accurately system of

not integrated producer ie one with more than 50000 barrels per day in refinery capacity and 5 million or less in revenue from any gasoline retailing operations 10 this was oil from any well subject to price controls the revenues of which were used to finance enhanced oil recovery projects up to 15 million that is only oil that generated 15 million in revenues or less for such projects was exempt from the wpt and only through september 31 1981 tertiary oil is oil that is recovered through certain enhanced oil recovery techniques such as flooding the reserv oir with hot water or steam or gases such as carbon dioxide this is oil that is usua lly not recoverable through secondary recovery methodsprice and statutory 1979 base price that was adjusted quarterly for inflation and state severance taxes8 all domestically produced oil that was not specifically taxexempt was classified into one of three categories or tiers based upon the age of the well the type of oil and the amount of daily pr oduction these categories were carryover from the oil price regulations which also categorized oil into various tiers for example tier i oil was oil classified as lower and upper tier oil under price controls tier ii and tier iii oil was oil exempt from price controls domestic crude oil is oil produced from an oil well located in the united states or in any of its possessions and it includes the continental shelf area of the united states for each oil category there was correspondi ng tax rate or rates as explained below and corresponding adjusted base price the tax rates and adjusted base prices differed not only according to the type of oil but also according to whether an oil producer was an integrated producer called major or an independent oil producer the tax rates applicable to oil sold by an independent oil producer were lower than the tax rates applicable to oil sold by major integrated producer9 the windfall profit tax liability on any barrel of oil was limited to 90 of the net income profit from the sale of that oil which was basically the taxable income gross income less costs corres ponding to that same oil five categories of oil were originally exempt from the windfall profit tax 1 oil owned by state or local government or any political subdivi sion thereof 2 oil owned by qualified educational institution or charitable medical institution 3 oil owned by

north slope tier ii and tier iii oil was uncontrolled oil under epca75 the 1981 erta legislation changed the rate structure as follows 1 the tax rate on new oil was reduced gradually but further reductions were frozen in 1984 so that the rate remained fixed at 225 until 1988 2 stripper oil produced by independents was made ta xexempt 2 royalty owners received tax credit followed by an exemption for limited amounts of oil production the wpt was imposed on domestic oil produ cers at the point of the first sale of taxable oil which was generally to re finer the refiner know n also as the first purchaser withheld the tax from the am ounts otherwise payable to producer and deposited the funds semimonthly into an account in other words the tax amount per barrel was subtracted from the oils purchase price the first purchaser was required to file tax returns on quarterly basis in cases where withholding was not required such as when the producer and fi rst purchaser were one and the same the tax was paid directly to the treasury the wpt was deductible expense in determining an oil producers income tax liability b ecause as with all other excise taxes it was considered cost of doing business as explained in later section this meant that as result of paying the wpt producers income tax liability wa s lower than it would have been without the tax the wpt was temporary tax the statute provided that the tax would begin to phase out sometime during the thr eeyear period between january 1988 andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33305crs8 january 1991 the precise starting point for the phase out depended on cumulative net revenues if the secretary of th treasury reported that on given month beginning january 1988 cumulative net reve nues would exceed the preestablished target of 2273 billion then the phaseout of the tax would begin on the month following the attainment of the target if estimated cumulative net revenues would not exceed 2273 bi llion between january 1988 and january 1991 then the phase out of the tax would begin january 1991 i rrespective of the onset of the phaseout once the phaseout began the tax was to ve been phased out over 33month period by reducing each producers tax by 3 each month with 4 on the last month cumulative net revenues which totaled about 43 billion between 1980 and 1987 fell far short of the 2273 billion target hence had it not been repealed the wpt phase out would have begun january 1991 and the tax would have terminated on october 1 1993 as already discussed the wpt was repealed in august 1988 before the onset of the phaseout rules finally while the tax was called profit tax it was not really profit tax but rather special type of excise tax selective excise tax on oil producers the tax was paid first before profits from the sale of the oil were determined and except for the net income limitation profits d bearing on how much wpt was paid the base prices had precise or even pproximate relationship to the costs of oil production this difference between an ex cise tax and true excess profit tax is crucial because as will be demonstrated the two taxes have very different economic effects particularly on ener gy prices and oil imports rationale for the windfall profit tax the wpt resulted from compromise between the carter administration which wanted to decontrol oil prices nd the congress which generally did not without the tax many doubted that the congress would have supported oil price decontrol the reasons for the tax are manifold and complex they transcend economics and they concern the image and perception of the oil industry the record does show however that the congress was concerned that the industry would reap enormous revenues and profits as resu lt of decontrol to world oil price levels the congress believed that the projected huge redistribution of income from energy consumers to energy producers would not be fair th congress was concerned that the oil industry was not paying its fair share of fe deral taxes and fi nally the congress was looking for additional sources of revenue oil price decontrol and windfall profits price decontrol implied that domestic crude oil prices would rise from an average of about 14 per barrel 1979 to world market levels which at that timehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33305crs9 11 crs report 88147 oil price projections and the windfall profit tax on crude oil by salvatore lazzari 12 us congress house crude oil windfall profit tax act of 1979 report of the committee on ways and means report 96304 june 22 1979 us govt print off washington 1979were averaging about 24 per barrel and pr ojected by some to rise to 50 60 per barrel or more by 198511 in 1979 many analysts were predicting sharp increases in domestic oil prices and with them significant increases in il industry revenues and profits the joint committee on taxation had estimated that d econtrol would increase oil industry revenues by about 1 trillion from 1980 1990 and profits by over 400 billion federal policymakers believed that these dded profits were in the nature of windfall an unearned unanticipated ga in in income through additional effort or expense this windfall was thought to provide additional incentive to produce more oil especially old oil which was already being produced under the preexisting controlled price regime rather existing oil reserves would simply be worth more command higher price by virt ue of price decontrol moreover all oil would command higher price including oil that was discove red at historically low costs and produced at the controlled pr ice old oil which was primarily owned and produced by the major oil companies was selling for about 6 per barrel prior to decontrol after decontrol it would have increased to market price of about 24 per barrel the congress was concerned that additional effort investment or cost would be incurred by oil producers in ge nerating the added profits the congress also believed that higher price was not needed for all oil in order to stimulate its production but that higher price might be needed for new oil the decision to produce much of the oil had been made with the expectation of return based on the controlled price the following quote illustrates the concerns of the congress for most types of oil after certain poi nt these higher prices will only lead to very limited increases in production the revenues resulting from these higher prices however would provide income to oil producers far in excess of what most of them originally anticipated wh they drilled their wells and in excess of what they might now be expected to invest in energy production indeed some producers are now using their excess reve nues to acquire unrelated businesses thus the committee believes that the additional revenues received by oil producers and royalty owners both as re sult of decontrol of oil prices and as result of increases in world oil prices substantially above those prevailing in 1978 are an appropriate object of taxation the windfall profit tax in this bill will tax away fair portion of these additional revenues while allowing producers to receive very high prices for those types of oil whose production can be expected to increase in response to that incentive12 other motivations and factors underlying imposition of the windfall profits tax were thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33305crs10 domestic crude prices would rise to market levels that did not reflect competitive market forces but the market power of opec and further opecs prices were projected to increase in real terms at very high rates usually ssumed to be 3 per year the market price of oil was believed to be in sense unanticipated unearned and unneeded for the profitability of the oil industry society should share in the economic return to natural resource production oil is natural resource whose longrun supply is fixed it is not like other factors of production such as labor and capital the stock of natural resources is fixed in the long run whereas the stock or supply of the other factors is variab since the stock of oil is fixed some argued that high levels of industry income were not necessary to ensure adequate supplies if low levels of income would ensure adequate oil supplies then any industry income above that income earned from alternative use of i ndustry resources could be deemed excessive economic rents and should be taxed away some believed oil indus try income was excessive to start with due to the concentrated structure of the domestic oil industry and due to the fact that domestic price of oil was not competitively determined price additionally it should be re membered that the wpt was enacted in the wake of two oil shocks in the 1970s 1 the 19731974 oil embargo which raised oil prices fourfold and 2 the 19781979 iran ian revolution which doubled oil prices and created gasoline shortages and long lin of motorists at the gasoline pumps also there was certain amount of public spicion of the oil industry suspicion that the energy crisis was not real but contri vance of the industry in concert with opec for the purpose of profiteering distributional equi ty fairness another rationale for the windfall profit ta x was equity or fairness it was estimated that oil price decontrol would cause large redistribution of income

than from highincome persons the windfall profit tax was intended to be the instrument for achieving more equitable redistribution of the income wh ich would result from oil price decontrol underlying this instrument was the belief that the oil companies were entitled to fair and reasonable return but not an excessive return which was in any event determined by opecset prices rather than competitive prices the industrys historically low effective tax rates another powerful argument for enacting the wpt was that the tax helped to offset the oil industrys low effective income tax rates due to th availability of two oil industry tax subsidies incentives th percentage depletion allowance and the provision which permits companies to expense deduct fully in the initial year the intangible costs of drilling the percentage depletion allowance pe rmits oil producers to deduct an amount for the exhaustion of an oil reserve equal to percentage of revenues in theory the deduction should be based on th actual oil output and the actual investment costs of the deposit it should be cost depletion the percentage depletion allowance was introduced in 1926 in 1975 the allowance was eliminated except for limited amount of oil produced by independents the deduction for intangible drilling costs permits oil producers to expense dedu ct contemporaneously costs that according to economic theory and standard financial accounting practices should be capitalized over the incomeproducing life of the deposit this subsidy or incentive was introduced in 1918 administrative ru ling by the treasury department the cumulative value of these tax and ot her nontax subsidies from 19641977 has been estimated at over 100 billion13 in recent years the value of these oil and gas subsidies

of the deductibility of the wpt the remaining revenue losses were due to receipts from federal interests column 2 effects on domestic oil production and oil imports the wpt had the effect of reducing th domestic supply of crude oil below what the supply would have been without the tax this increased the demand for imported oil and made the united stat more dependent upon foreign oil as compared with dependence without wpt nevertheless oil price decontrol by increasing prices should have increased domestic production and made the us less import dependent and further while wpt made the us more dependent on imported oil decontrol and wpt made the us less dependent than controls without wpt the wpt was excise tax on oil produced domestically in the united states it was not imposed on imported oil in economic terms such taxes increase marginal production costs and profit maximizing firms respond to the tax by reducing output and raising prices the wpt increased the marginal or incremental cost of domestic oil production subject to the tax every ba rrel of oil produced cost more to produce by the amount of the tax however in the case of domestic crude oil the higher marginal costs are not to be shifted as higher oil prices because oil being priced in the international world oil market oil pr ices are exogenous to the us the us is price taker rather than price setter32 oil producers could not shift the tax forward as higher oil selling price becau the purchaser would merely substitute imported or taxexempt crude instead the wpt reduces the net selling price paid to producers as noted earlier the first purchas er generally the refiner subtracted the tax from the price paid to the producer supplier the producers net selling price of each barrel of oil was less by the amount of the wpt this inability to shift the tax forward imp lies that the entire effect of the tax is to reduce domestic production and supply in other words us domestic oil production was to some degree lower as direct result of the wpt but as oil imports to the united states are residual the difference between aggregate demand for oil and aggregate domestic oil supply th effect of this is an increase in the demand for oil imports33 another way of stating this point is that imported oil is the marginal source of oil whenever an ex tra barrel of oil is needed to meet an increase in demand it is imported any c ondition or factor which either reduces domestic supply such as higher industry ta xes or which increases the aggregate demand for oil such as higher national income will increase oil imports and therefore also reduced the supply of the taxed producthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33305crs19 34 this estimate is quite sensitive to the assumed supply price elasticity which is also unknown and has been derived from other studies generally the more price elastic is the supply of oil the larger would be the additional oil imports induced by the wpt 35 dahl and duggan 1996 survey

curves for example hogan 1989 estimates long r supply curve of 058 see hogan william w world oil price projections sensitivity analysis energy and environmental policy center john f kennedy school of government harvard university 1989estimates the magnitude by which the wpt reduced domestic oil supplies and increased imports depends on two variable s 1 the magnitude of the decline in the supply price of domestic crude oil t he amount of the wpt which determines the aftertax price received by oil producers and 2 the price elasticity of the supply curve which determines the reduction in il production in response to the lower price net of the wpt received by oil producers since oil prices are determined in world market it is assumed that the wpt had effect on pretax oil prices in the united states this means that the aftert ax price received by domestic oil producers is lower by the full amount of the wpt per barrel that is as noted above the wpt cannot be shifted forward in higher prices producers absorb the entire tax in terms of lower profits the second variable that determines the output effects is the price elasticity of the oil supply curve which measures the responsiveness of oil production to changes in oil price34 an elasticity of 10 means that 10 reduction in the net price of oil to the producer translates into 10 re duction in the quantity of oil supplied an elasticity of 05 means that 10 reduc tion in price would reduce output by half that or 5 the price elasticity of oil supplies is determined by the technology underlying domestic oil production there is little doubt that crude oil producti on is relatively inelastic in the short run even large price increases are likely to elicit substantial increases in production over the longrun however produ cers can increase their investment and capital to increase production development wells from existing fields and increase exploration of new fields the percenta ge reduction in oil production in response to the wpt would be the product of the percen tage reduction in the aftertax price of oil times the price elasticity of supply oil supply price elasticities are difficult to estimate few studies generate reliable estimates and in fact some studies estimate negative supply elasticities which are not pl ausible in developing our assumptions about the price elasticity of the crude oil supply curve we surveyed 20 studies35 in general studies from the 1970s and early 1980s report larger supply price elasticities ranging from 1 to 8 with mean of about 536 studies from the mid1980s and more recent studies tend to show smalle r supply elasticities for example 1985 study for the department of energy found convergence around number

elasticity of oil supply of 02 short run 5 and 8 table 5 presents estimates of annual domestic oil produc tion that was lost in response to the wpt based on conventi onal assumptions note that unlike tables 3 and 4 data are presented in calendar ears to conform with the reporting of production and tax data timates were prepared for the period 19801986 from 19861988 there are output effects because the wpt liability was zero in those years the wpt was zero because market crude oil prices were below inflation adjusted base prices for perspective the annual estimates of production losses are compared to the actual levels of domestic oil producti on and imported oil these estimates indicate that the windfall profit tax caused domestic oil production losses in every year but 1986 when crude prices declined below adjusted base prices resulting in zero wpt over the entire 19801986 period it is estimated that depending on the assumed supply curve price elasticity the wpt reduced domestic oil production from between 320 million barrels 12 of domestic production and 1268 million barre ls 48 of domestic pr oduction the effect of reducing domestic oil production was to increase the level

were in 1981 that year the estimated loss in domestic oil production in response to the wpt ranged from 77 million barrels 21 of total domestic output to 310 million barrels 83 of output depending upon the assumed price elas ticity as fraction of total imports these constituted 48 and 121 respectively estimated annual pr oduction losses declined steadily between 1981 and 1986 this was due to the combined effect of declining market prices and increasing base prices over this period in 1986 production losses were estimated to be zero because average market oil prices were below averag base prices the average windfall profit was negative in each of these years it is important to note that the estimates in table 5 assume that the production losses occur in the same year as the tax increase in reality there may be lags in the eff ect of the wpt on domestic oil production to this extent the aggregate production losses estimated over the 19801986 period are probably more meaningful than the losses estimated for any one year on this basis the wpt increased oil imports and made the united states somewhat more vulnerable to sharp oil price increases or complete oil supply embargoes from foreign oil producers if accurate these estimates suggest that oil production losses in response to the wpt ma have been from 3 to 13 of total oil imports economic efficiency and resource allocation the efficiency effects of the wpt on the allocation of resources are less clear than some of the other economic effects from an economic perspective excise taxes distort the price systems ability to efficiently allocate resources among competing economic sectors but the windfa ll profit tax had little if any effect on oil prices simply because such tax cannot be forward shifted ie producers are not able to pass the tax forward by increasing prices to refiners because refiners would merely substitute imported oil the reason for this is that oil prices in the united states are given they are determined or established in the world oil market in which the united states is only one of many producers in the long run permanent excise tax re duces the rate of return in the taxed sector and resources are allocated toward the nontaxed sectors but the wpt was temporary tax when it was enacted and it was repealed two and onehalf years before expiration it is difficult to say whether this is long enough period of time to cause resources to be reallocated in any significant way the other complicating factor was the decontrol of oil prices it is fundamental economic law that generally price controls cause serious distortions and create allocational ine fficiencies oil price decontrol on january 28 1981 when the wpt was about 10 months old comple tely removed these distortions and inefficiencies in all probability decont rol with wpt was less distorting than controls without wpt the efficiency effects of the wpt also hinge on the question of whether oil production creates costs these are called ex ternal costs that society incurs but that producers do not account for if th business of producing oil domesticallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33305crs23 38 these incentives were more than offset by other factors including environmental regulations low rates of return and other factor s inhibiting the flow of capital into refining and marketing for discussion see crs report rl32248 petroleum refining economic performance and challenges for the future by robert pirogcreates these external costs then an economically appropriate policy would have imposed some type of excise tax on oil pr oduction the wpt that was in effect was not inconsistent with this policy and to this extent may have contributed to economic efficiency the wpt however may have distorted the way resources were allocated within the oil industry since the tax wa s imposed on oil pr oduction i upon its removal and sale extraction and othe r upstream operations was penalized and other aspects of the business refining and marketing the downstream operations become relatively favored thus it created financial incentives to shift resources from exploration and drilling to refining and marketing38 there may have been add itional distortions within the oilproducing sector as result of the structure of the tax unde r wpt different tax rates and base prices applied to taxable oil depending upon its classification in one of three tiers as described in table 1 these differences seemed to favor oil from newer wells as opposed to oil from older wells and oil produced from small wells and by independents as opposed to oil produced from larger wells and by integrated producers while this wa s probably done to minimize th adverse effects on supply the structure of the wpt created artificial tax incentives based on the age and infrastructure of producti on and who owned the oil in addition to the above distinctions th following categories of oil were tax exempt 1 oil produced from property ow ned by state or local government or any political subdivision of state govern ment 2 oil produced by educational institutions or charitable medical instituti ons 3 oil produced from wells in certain regions of alaska 4 oil owned and produced by certain american indian tribes and 5 frontend tertiary oil and royalty oil even so it must be underscored that th distortions under th windfall profit tax with decontrol were probably less than th distortion under full price controls without wpt the burden of tax compliance and administration after 1986 the wpt imposed little or tax liability on oil producers because oil prices were below the threshold base prices that triggered it oil producers were obliged to comply with the paperwork re quirements of the law however and the internal revenue service irs was compelled to administer the system despite the fact that the tax generated revenue the oil industry maintained all along that the wpt was an extremely complicated tax to comply with and to administer the irs and the general accounting office gao now the govern ment accountability office both

property any individual or business with an economic interest in an oilproducing property was considered as producer and subject to the tax there were four kinds of producers independent producers integrated oil comp anies royalty owners landowners and taxexempt parties according to 1984 gao report there were about 1 million oil producers persons institutions and busin esses in the united states in 198440 operators were the appr oximately 18000 persons in the business of managing oil properties the property operator supplied the relevant information to the agent who withheld the tax the operator had to determine the proper tier how much oil was sold and who had the economic in terest sometimes th ere were hundreds of people having fractional econo mic interest in single oilproducing property even determining the proper tier was easy task according to 1982 gao report considerable uncertainty surrounded the c oncept of oil property thus making it difficult to classify oil into tiers41 the withholding agent had to comput and withhold the windfall profit tax based on the information supplied by the operator the withholding agent also called the first purchaser was usually an integrated oil company but it could also have been an independe nt producer or refiner to compute the windfall profit tax am ount the agent subtracted from the removal price the base price and the corres ponding state severance tax if any this computation required the following steps 1 knowing the category of oil 2 determining the removal lling price 3 adjusting the corresponding base price 4 subtracting the state severance tax and 5 testing for the 90 net incomehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33305crs25 42 the net income limitation restricted the wi ndfall profit tax liability to more

basic steps in th is computation could be complex for example in 1983 there was some controve rsy over how to determine the removal price in the case of certain sadlerochit oil in an alaskan north slope reservoir three different methods were used by the oil companies the irs had to issue several rulings before the matter was settled having computed the tax liability the first purchaser deducted this from the purchase price to be paid to the operato r and deposited the money in federal reserve bank integrated producers were required to deposit twice per month independent producers were required to deposit every 45 days the tax payment process did not however end there in the event of overpayment or underpayment due primarily to the net income limitati on and underw ithholding respectively this required either refunds or additional payments throughout this compliance process many tax return forms and information forms were required the process was fu rther complicated due to the numerous exceptions to the basic general rules and due to possible interactions between the windfall profit tax rules the personal nd corporate income tax rules energy regulations and state and cal tax and energy laws the windfall profit tax also appeared to be significant administrative burden for the irs the tax stat ute itself encompassed 13 sections in 25 pages of the 1986 internal revenue code43 in addition the irs had to promulgate dozens of separate regulations revenue rulings letter rulings and information releases to enforce it furthermore there had been statutory amendments to the wpt in virtually every tax bill enacted between 1980 and 1988 the irs acknowledged the administrativ burden of the tax in 1981 hearings before the house subcommittee on gove rnment operations 1984 gao report seemed to support this when it referred to the tax as perhaps the largest and most complex tax ever levied on us industry44 fortune magazine referred to the tax as one of the most monumental exci ses ever levied in us history45 reasons for repeal of the windfall profit tax as was discussed in the background sec tion the crude oil windfall profit tax was repealed in august of 1988 two nd onehalf years before the legislated termination date in january 1991 there wa s one reason for repeal of the tax rather repeal was caused by the confluen ce of several factor s and conditions fromhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33305crs26 46 there were 18 such bills in the 100th congress 47 see for example us congress senate energy taxation issues hearings before the subcommittee

was fairly wide spread and numerous bills were introduce to repeal the tax46 the congress became convinced that the tax was complex and costly tax to comply with and to administer it wa s compliance burden to the oilproducing industry and an administrative burden for th internal revenue service even though after fy1986 the tax generated little or tax revenues it is doubtful that the congress would have repealed the wpt d it been generating significant revenues at that time or had it been expected to generate significant revenue in the future the fact that the tax was generating little or revenue however made the argument that the tax was burden easier to accept another apparent reason for the repeal of the wpt was the recognition that the tax kept domestic oil production below wh at it would have been without the wpt and increased petroleum imports above the level of imports without the wpt47 this made the united states more depende nt upon foreign oil and therefore more vulnerable to either price upsurge or supply disruption petroleum imports were growing from 1985 to 1986 there was sharp increase in the share of oil use being met by imports oil imports as percent of total us oil consumption increased from 32 to nearly 38 one of the larges t annual increases on record moreover projections showed this degree of pendence rising to over 50 by 1990 projection which has been realized48 today petroleum imports account for nearly 60 of consumption and are projected by the department of energy to rise to nearly 70 by 2025 finally the domestic us oil industr was experiencing difficult economic conditions due to the collapse of oil pri ces in 1986 crude oil prices dropped from about 30 per barrel in the fall of 1985 to just over 10 per barrel in the summer of 1986 after 1986 oil prices were volatile but basically increasing at the time of repeal oil prices were about 18 per barrel prices incr eased during the persian gulf war of 1992 but collapsed again in the fallwinter of 19981999 there was little question about the effect of the rapid price decline on the u s oilproducing industry it had strong ne gative effect on oil producers ie drillers operators and landowners with an economic interest in oil in general and the small independent producer in pa rticular according to industry data earnings from explorationproduction operations of selected

the second quarter of 198651 between 1982 and 1988 this industry lost about onethird of its jobs52 however the collapse of oil prices helped some segm ents of the industry such as independent refiners and marketers the congress came to view the windfall profit tax as burden on an industry that was becoming severely pressed due to the sharp dr op in oil prices and due to the volatility in oil prices repealing th wpt did not reduce industry tax payments so it was of little actual economic benefit at that time becau oil prices were below base prices and there was tax liability to producers howe ver higher oil prices in the future might have exceed base prices and the wpt would have been triggered at the very least repealing the wpt re duced business costs and improved industry profitability somewhat by eliminating the compliance burden of the tax opponents of repeal basica lly made the following arguments 1 the oil industrys income is an economic rent or monopoly profit to highly concentrated industry which society through taxation s hould share in 2 the oil industry benefits from other tax subsidies which have traditionally kept effective income tax rates very low 3 if oil prices rise above base price levels then the tax would generate additional revenues which are badly needed to reduce larg federal budget deficits 4 the administrative apparatus is ready in place and it makes little sense to eliminate the tax now given that the tax is temporary this final argument in favor of retaining the wpt was in effect c ounterargument to thos who have criticized the tax as compliance and administrative burden the point was that even admitting its complexity the wpt system was already in place much of the costs of administering the tax were fixed costs they had been in large part already incurred since most of the regulations d been promulgated given that the irs had already incurred the fixed costs of r unning the wpt system and given that the system would only be

economic and policy issues the remaining sections discuss some of the more im portant economic issues surrounding proposed legislation and draw releva nt policy implications the final section discusses alternative policy options current market conditions the first issue is the difference between the current market conditions and those wh the 1980 wpt was imposed as noted above the 1980 wpt was imposed as part of compromise to decontrol crude oil prices quidproquo from control regime vel of about 6barrel crude prices were allowed to rise gradually to market levels as influenced strongly by opec which at that time were about 24 barrel by contrast today there are price controls on crude oil and prices are determined in generally competitive market one in which the united states is price taker and one in which opec plays relatively smaller but still important role crude oil prices have increased for significantly different reasons than was the case in the 1970s also on august 8 2005 president bush signed comprehensive energy policy bill pl 10958 that provides over 25 billi on in energy tax breaks over 11 years to the domestic oil and gas industry some have questioned the wisdom of providing additional tax subsidies to the oil industr at time of high crude and petroleum product prices and have propos ed either reducing or liminating these subsidies in lieu of the wpt the question of windfall profits of course the fact that current high prices are due to reasons di fferent than in the 1970s does not belie that there may be windfalls crude prices ma rched steadily

early 2006 stood at about 65barrel56 petroleum product prices have also spiked and c ontinue to remain high increases in crude prices in effect increas the value of oil reserves and increase the revenue from the sale of domestically produced oil just as any higher market price for commodity makes inventories or othe r stock of that pr oduct more valuable57 the extent to which recent high petroleum prices have increased profits has been reported in the press and is disc ussed in two recent crs reports it is not discussed here58 more intractable issue is whether any increased recent profits are true windfalls and whether windfalls accrue to both crude oil and refinery products the sharp and rapid increases in prices if they are realized as higher profits would be pure windfall in the sense that they are an unforeseeable unanticipated gain that accrues to owners of the nations stock of oil reserves most of any additional revenue and profit would accrue to the major oil companies since they own most of the reserves and produce the bulk of the oil in the united states in sense they are unearned little or additional cost or effort is incurred in generating this additional income oil that would have been produced at 26 or 37 per barrel can now be sold for 62 per barrel or more in another sense they are earned increased profits are the reward for the risks the industry takes to provide pe troleum products to consumers as an illustration using domestic oil production of 55 million barrels per day doubling of crude oil prices from 35ba rrel to 70barrel would generate an additional 70 billion in annual revenue to il producers if the baseline started at 10barrel and prices rose to 70barrel and stabilized at that rate for one year revenues would increase by about 120 billion profits would also increase but not by the increased revenue because income taxes federal state and local would have to be paid on the windfall thus even without windfa ll profit tax government tax revenues would increase commensurate w ith any oil industry windfall this is because as profits of the oil pr oducers increase so does taxable business income since there is little or cost incurred in generating the added profits then all of the revenue gains likely would be taxable at marginal tax rate of 35 the marginal corporate tax rate the federal govern ment would gain about 35 of any oil industry windfall59httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33305crs31 59 continued and other tax provisions which enter into the calculation of the tax on income from the marginal investment in the windfall profits tax situation in the text there is marginal investment hence these oil and gas tax incentiv essubsidies do not enter into the calculationin addition to the higher profits accruing to oil producers there appear to be additional profits accruing to refiners but th increases have been smaller than the profits accruing to producers but these prof its are not true windfalls as they are in the case of crude oil while refinery marg ins and profits can and have increased even sharply they are due to the constraint s on the supply capacity essentially the supply or cost curve of the refinery industry another problem is one of timing th ere is question that producers and refiners could reap enormous windfall prof its if the recent price upsurge is sustained but it is not certainty that the recent pr ice spike will be sustained recently crude oil prices while still high declined some what from their peak of nearly 70 per barrel even though they are high ther is guarantee that they will not fall possibly precipitously and become losses in the near future if crude and product prices decline and barring any other pr oblems abroad or natural disasters prices would be expected to decline somewhat fu rther it should be remembered that oil prices declined from high of over 30 pe r barrel in the early 1980s to about 10 per barrel at their low point in the spring of 1986 from 19861999 oil prices averaged about 1700 per barrel but fluctuated between 12 and 20 per barrel the fluctuations including the most recent fouryear period have been even greater domestic crude oil prices reached w of about 8barrel in december 1998 among the lowest crude oil prices in history afte r correcting for inflation from this volatile behavior of oil prices deri ves the volatility of oil industr profits and it is not clear that there will be persistent windfall profit over the longer run economic implications depending on how the tax were structured reinstating the windfall prof it tax might make the united states more dependent upon foreign oil this is likely to be more serious problem today than in 1980 because unlike then when the united states was importing about 40 of its petroleum use the nation is now importing close to 60 as the above analysis suggests windfall profit tax in the form of an excise tax hr 3752 and s 1631 could reduce domestic oil production and increase the demand for imported oil and petroleum products in ec onomic terms oil producers would view the tax as an increase in th marginal cost of domestic oil production during the 1980s the marginal cost the incremental cost of producing every barrel of taxable crude oil was higher with the wp t than without it in consequence the wpt reduced the supply of domestic oil to so extent at every possible market oil price it is estimated that domestic oil production was lower with the wpt than it would have been without it the tax in creased the marginal cost of producing domestic oil thereby reducing domestic production and increasing the demand for oil imports both in the short run and long r this is result of the fact that oil imports to the united states are residual the difference between aggregate demand for oil and aggregate domestic oil supply any condition or factor which either reduces domestic supply such as higher indus try excise taxes or which increases thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33305crs32 60 eliminating the gasoline tax would deny th highway trust fund of its principal source of revenue unless some adjustment were made see crs report rl30497 suspending the gas tax analysis of s 2285 by salvatore lazzariaggregate demand for oil such as higher national income will increase oil imports crude oil prices might increase somewhat as the demand for imported oil increases because the export supply of oil to the unite d states is somewhat elastic the size of the effect would depend on the magnit ude of the excise tax and the price elasticities of oil demand and supply in th united states as well as the oil export supply to the united states reinstating the windfall profit tax w ould probably raise the question of the burden and cost of compliance and administr ation of the tax which was an important rationale for repeal of the tax in 1988 this issue seems to become more of concern when wpt revenues dont live up to exp ectations unless the tax were greatly simplified or unless large amount of re venue were generate d from the tax past experience suggests that this could be serious problem in reinstating the wpt many analysts believe base d on market fundamentals that the recent oil price upsurge will not be lasting one and since oil prices have been highly volatile in recent years there is way to judge wh ether wpt revenues would be large enough to justify the alleged high costs of compliance and administration alternative policy options if instead an excise tax were to be imposed broadly on both imported as well as domestically produced oil as proposed in the early 1980s by the reagan administration much greater price effects would be expected the price of crude oil in the united states would tend to be much higher than under the wpt on domestic oil alone this is because the tax is imposed on imports which are the marginal source of oil supplies and therefor the benchmark for crude oil prices in this case the tax would both increase the marginal costs of oil imports an upward shift in the oil import supply schedule and cause slight movement along the schedule due to increased demand for oil impor ts and thus have bigger price effect an excise tax holiday suspension of the 184gallon tax on gasoline combined with an equal revenue wpt on oil would be comple tely counterbalanced or offsetting eliminating the gasoline tax would cause refiners to reduce prices over time by the amount of the tax or somewhat less depending on tax incidence which depends on the ratio of pri ce elasticities of the demand nd supply schedules but the wpt on all crude oil which remember is actually an excise tax would be shifted as higher price of crude oil bought by refi ners thus offsetting the decline in product prices60 from an economic perspective the only tax that would be relatively neutral in the short run that would have or few price effects and other economic effects would be pure corporate profits tax since this tax does not affect marginal production costs and cannot be shifted in the short run thus to the extent that surtax on the corporate income of crude oil producers on their upstream operations could approximate such tax this woul d not raise crude oil prices and would nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33305crs33 increase petroleum imports in the short run while the current corporate income tax is not pure corporate profits tax surt ax for oil companies would arguably be an administratively simple and economically effective way to capture estimated oil windfalls in the short run in the long run however all ta xes distort resource allocation and even corporate profit tax either of the pure type or the surtax on the existing rates would reduce the rate of return and reduce the flow of capital into the industry adversely affecting domes tic production and increasing importshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33305crs34 61 except that for tier iii oil the base price increases
