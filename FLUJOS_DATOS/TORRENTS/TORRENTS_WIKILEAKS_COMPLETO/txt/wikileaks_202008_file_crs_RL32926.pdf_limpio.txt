immediately emerges article i the legislative branch is quite detailed and specific with respect to the authority of and limits on congress especially when compared with article ii the executive branch and article iii the judicial branch one reason for this detail is that article i deals not only with the nature of the legislature but also with the overall powers of the federal government but this contrast also makes it clear that congress possesses the authority to fill out the powers conferred on the executive and judiciary this is revealed in several specific provisions but most notably in the final provision of the article the necessary and proper clause 1 that clause not only empowers congress to enact all necessary and proper laws in order to execute the powers conferred on congress but also allows congress to make laws to execute all other powers vested by this constituti on in the government of the united states or in any department or officer thereof the constitution contains few requirements regarding the structure of the federal courts article iii section 1 of the constitution provides that the judicial power of the united states shall be vested in one supreme court and in such inferior courts as the congress may from time to time ordain and establish2 the judges both of the supreme and inferior courts shall hold their offices during good behaviour and shall at stated times receive for their services compensation which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office 1 us const art i 8 cl 18 2 the latter part of this quoted language dovetails with clause 9 of 8 of article i under which congress is authorized to constitute tribunals infe rior to the supreme court t

justice of the united states3 nothing else about its structure and its operation is specified so the size and composition of the court is left to congress4 the lack of constitutionally prescribed number has provided opportunities to manipulate or to attempt to manipulate the court5 as congress also determines the time and place of the supreme courts meeting6 it has also used this power to influence the makeup of the judiciary 7 utilizing its power to establish inferior courts congress has created the united states district courts8 the courts of appeals for the thirteen circuits9 and other federal courts10 identified their location11 the places in which they sit12 and the number of justices or judges for each court13 congress has also addressed range of aspects of the administration of the courts for example congress through its exercise of spending clause power14 provides funding for the operation of 3 although the position of chief justice is not specifically mandated it is referenced in article i 3 cl 6 in connection with the procedure for the senate impeachment trial of president the senate shall have the sole power to try all im peachments when sitting for that purpose they shall be on oath or affirmation when the presiden t of the united states is tried the chief justice shall preside and person shall be convicted without concurrence of twothirds of the members present 4 by the judiciary act of 1789 it was established that the court was to be composed of the chief justice and five associate justices the number of justices was gradually increased to ten until in 1869 the number was fixed at nine where it has remained to this day 5 thus following lincolns assassination and acrimonious dispute between president andrew johnson and the reconstruction congress the legislators took number of steps to ensure that johnson would have appointments to the court by providing that the number of justices would be reduced from ten to seven as vacancies occurred more farreaching though ultimately unsuccessful effort occurred as result of the supreme courts decisions blocking several initiatives of the new deal in february 1937 presid ent franklin d roosevelt proposed in part that congress authorize the appointment of an additional justice for each of the incumbent justices older than 70 who did not retire within six months of his 70 th birthday this would have given the president four appointees and an opportunity for reversal of some of the decisions to which he objected although the president was coming off his overwhelming 1936 reelection congress could not be prevailed on to give him this victory 6 thus the traditional first monday in oc tober is solely statutory creation 7 in 1801 after the jeffersonians took control of the presidency and of congress the judiciary act of 1801 enacted by the federalists after the 1800 elections to maintain control of the courts by creating additional judgeships and circuit courts as well as abolishing circuit riding by the justices was repealed provision was made for the displaced judges despite the good behavior tenure guarantee fearful that the repeal at least in part would be challenged before court composed of federalist appointees congress in the same law changed the dates of the terms of the court so that the justices did not convene for fourteen m onths ultimately the constitutionality of the 1801 repeal was not litigated but the court in the aftermath did render one of its most seminal cases in marbury v madison 1 cr 5 us 137 1803chastising the jeffersonians

section 1 of article iii contains two critical provisions regarding federal judges first is good behavior tenure25 which effectively has come to mean lifetime tenure for article iii judges subject to removal only through conviction on impeachment the second provision relates to security of compensation meaning that federal judges compensation may not be diminished during their continuance in office although as controversies over the years have shown the compensation need not be sufficient within the judges understanding 26 impeachment which is addressed in article ii of the constitution applies to all civil officers of the united states in both the executive and judicial branches27 however majority of the fifteen28 officials who have been impeached in the house of representatives and tried in the senate and all of the seven convicted and removed from office have been judges29 the imposition of punishment for judicial misconduct by the federal judiciary has also been addressed by statute30 but these provisions do not provide for the removal of judge or justice from office31 24 prior to the adoption of the federal rules of evidence in 1975 congress had never used the report and weight provisions of the rules enabling act to delay block or change rules prescribed by the supreme court when the supreme court proposed the federal rules of evidence however congress intervened to

courts may be thought to imply that congress may expand and contract the units of the system but what happens to the judges who occupy posts on the courts that are abolished or reduced in the number of judges this was the question that occurred with the repeal of the judiciary act of 1801 but resolution of the issue was achieved at that time congress did not exercise this power again until 1913 when it abolished the special commerce court which had proved disappointing to its sponsors in 1913 congress provided for the redistribution of the judges of the commerce court among the circuit courts since then as congress has rearranged some courts it has always provided for the same kind of redistribution usually assigning judges to those courts that received the jurisdiction of the abolished courts g11g11g495g561g14g146g150g146g157g156g561g152g151g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g514g561g5g152g151g156g157g146g157g158g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g18g152g160g142g155g156g561

appellate jurisdiction to create inferior federal courts and to specify their jurisdiction however that is true of the constitutions other grants of legislative authority in article i and elsewhere but this does not prevent the application of other constitutional principles to those powers the constitution is filled with provisions that grant congress or the states specific power to legislate in certain areas justice black wrote for the court in different context but these granted powers are always subject to the limitations that they may not be exercised in way that violates other specific provisions of the constitution32 the elder justice harlan seems to have had the same thought in mind when he said that with respect to congress power over jurisdiction of the federal courts what such exceptions and regulations should be it is for congress in its wisdom to establish having of course due regard to all the constitution33 thus it is clear that while congress has significant authority over administration of the judicial system it may not exercise its authority over the courts in way that violates the fifth amendment due process clause or that violates precepts of equal protection for instance congress could not limit access to the judicial system based on race or ethnicity34 nor without continued has yet to pass on the validity of either act or of any exercise of the judicial discipline power under the act but compare chandler v judicial council 382 us 1003 1966 chandler v judicial council 398 us 74 1970a pre act case 31 currently disciplinary actions that can be imposed

may take property while denying right to compensation under the takings clause35 in general the mere fact congress is exercising its authority over the courts does not serve to insulate such legislation from constitutional scrutiny g4g495g561g21g142g153g138g155g138g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g18g152g160g142g155g156g561 it is also clear that congress may not exercise it s authority over the courts in way that violates precepts of separation of powers the doctrine of separation of powers is not found in the text of the constitution but has been discerned by courts scholars and others in the allocation of power in the first three articles ie the legislative power is vested in congress the executive power is vested in the president and the judicial power is vested in the supreme court and the inferior federal courts that interpretation is also consistent with the speeches and writings of the framers but while the rhetoric of the supreme court points to strict separation of the three powers its actual holdings are far less decisive 36 nevertheless beginning with buckley v valeo 37 the supreme court has reemphasized separation of powers as vital element in american federal government38 the two approaches that the court has used in its separation of powers cases have been characterized as formalist or strict approach and as functionalist approach formalist or strict approach examines the text of the constitution to determine the degree to which branch powers and functions may be intermingled emphasizing that powers committed by the constitution to particular branch are to be exercised exclusively by that branch such an approach looks to textual analysis to determine whether and the extent to which the actions of one branch aggrandize the power of that branch or encroach upon that of another branch 39 in contrast to such textual analysis the more flexible functionalist approach to separation of powers focuses upon the preservation of the core functions of the three branches looking in given case to whether the exercise of power by one branch impinges upon core function of coordinate branch 40 in 35 the fifth amendment provides that private property be taken for public use without just compensation 36 for instance the supreme court has declared categorically that the legislative power of congress cannot be delegated united states v shreveport grain elevator co 287 us 77 85 1932 the categorical statement has never been literally true the court having upheld the delega tion at issue in the very case in which the statement was made the court in the cited case upheld the power of the food and drug administration to allow reasonable variations tolerances and exemptions from misbranding prohibitions the court has long recognized that administration of the law requires exercise of discretion and that in our increasingly complex society replete with ever changing and more technical problems congress simply cannot do its job absent an ability to delegate power under broad general directives mistretta v united states 488 us 361 372 1989 see also whitman v american trucking assn inc 531 us 457 2001 37 424 us 1 10943 1976 38 it is true that the court has wavered between two approaches to cases raising separationofpowers claims using strict approach in some cases and less rigid balancing approach in others nevertheless the court looks to test that evaluates whether the moving party usually congress has impermissibly undermined the power of another branch or has impermissibly aggrandized its own power at the expense of another branch whether that is the moving party has disrupted the proper balance between the coordinate branches by preventing the other branch from accomplishing its

general services the court stated that where question arose as to whether an act of congress disrupts the proper balance between coordinate branches the proper inquiry focuses upon the extent to which it prevents the executive branch from accomplishing its constitutionally assigned functions only where the potential for disruption is present must we then determine whether that impact is justified by an overriding need to promote objectives within the constitutional authority of congress 41 the federal courts have long held that congress may not act to denigrate the authority of the judicial branch in the 1782 decision in hayburn s case 42 several justices objected to congressional enactment that authorized the federal courts to hear claims for disability pensions for veterans the courts were to certify their decisions to the secretary of war who was authorized either to award each pension or to refuse it if he determined the award was an imposition or mistaken the justices on circuit contended that the law was unconstitutional because the judicial power was committed to separate department and because the subjecting of courts opinion to revision or control by an officer of the executive or the legislative branch was not authorized by the constitution congress thereupon repealed the objectionable features of the statute 43 more recently the doctrine of separation of powers has been applied to prevent congress from vesting jurisdiction over commonlaw bankruptcy claims in nonarticle iii courts 44

court jurisdiction by congress is co mplicated by the presence of state court systems that can and in some cases do hold concurrent jurisdiction over cases involving questions of federal statutory and constitutional law thus th power of congress over the federal courts is really the power to determine how federal cases are to be allocated among state courts federal inferior courts and the united states supreme court congress has significant authority to determine which of these various courts will adjudicate such cases and the method by which this will occur for most purposes the exercise of this power is relatively noncontroversial continued 1988 commodities future trading comm n v schor 478 us 833 1986 mistretta v united states 488 us 361 1989 41 nixon v administrator of general

jurisdiction of federal courts to hear cases in particular areas of law such as busing abortion prayer in school and most recently reciting the pledge of allegiance45 generally proponents of these proposals are critical of specific decisions made by the federal courts in that particular substantive area and the proposals are usually intended to express disagreement with decisions in those areas andor to influence the results or applications of such cases several such proposals passed the house in the 108th congress for instance in july 2003 an amendment was passed by the house to limit the use of funds to enforce federal court decision regarding the pledge of allegiance46 then in july 2004 the house passed hr 3313 the marriage protection act which would have limited federal court jurisdiction over questions regarding the defense of marriage act47 finally in september 2004 the house passed hr 2028 the pledge protection act which was intended to limit the jurisdiction of the federal courts to hear cases regarding the pledge of allegiance48 these proposals are often referred to as court stripping proposals and some of these proposals may raise significant constitutional questions49 g3g495g561g22g145g142g561g3g149g149g152g140g138g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g12g158g141g146g140g146g138g149g561g18g152g160g142g155g561 as noted article iii

litigants or persons affected the subject matter of the federal judicial power is quite broad as it includes the power to consider all cases arising under either the constitution federal law or treaty or arising from the admiralty or maritime jurisdiction as noted article iii also extends the federal judicial power to cases based on the types of parties affected or involved these latter cases can be divided into two different groups the first group includes all cases which affect an ambassador or other public ministers or consuls or which involve controversy betwee n two or more states the second group includes cases involving disputes between the united states and another party state and citizens of another state citizens of different states citizens of the same state claiming land under grants of different states and between state or the citizens thereof and foreign states citizens or subjects 51 the cases in the first group and any other cases where state is party are to be heard directly by the supreme court under the courts original jurisdiction52 the remaining cases in the second group along with the courts previously noted substantive authority are heard under the courts appellate jurisdiction53 it is important to note that the courts appellate jurisdiction unlike its original jurisdiction is subject to exceptions and under such regulations as congress shall make54 it should also be noted however that the constitution provides for jurisdiction in all cases under its substantive jurisdiction or under the first group of cases based on parties as will be discussed later this has led some commentators to suggest that while congress has the power to limit the supreme courts appellate jurisdiction that at least some cases must be considered by some federal court whether it be the supreme court or an inferior court continued 1884 the original jurisdiction conferred on that court by ar ticle iii 2 cl 2 of the us constitution was not made exclusive by operation of that constitutiona l provision rather congress has the power to grant or deny exclusiveness in subsection 1251b congress by statute provided that the supreme court would have original

every state are bound to follow the united states constitution and applicable federal law55 congress does not appear to have the authority to establish state courts of competent jurisdiction56 however once such state courts exist congress can endow them with concurrent power to consider certain cases concerning federal law when state court has rendered decision on an issue of federal law and final determination has been made by the highest court in that state then that case may generally be appealed to the supreme court 57 thus state court cases can also fall under the supreme courts appellate jurisdiction the question arises however precisely how the j udicial power should be allocated between the various courts and what sort of limitations can be implemented on the combined court systems by congress while there have been many proposals to vary federal court jurisdiction in order to affect particular judicial result few have become law and even fewer have been subjected to scrutiny by the courts further those laws that did pass varied from modern proposals thus the answer to these complex questions must be ascertained by reference to constitutional text historical practice limited set of case law and scholarly commentary federal district courts and courts of appeal the inferior federal courts are authorized to consider most questions of federal statutory and constitution law with appeal to the supreme court in general most modern courtstripping proposals appear to be intended to increase state court involvement in constitutional cases by decreasing federal court involvement there are at least three possible variations to these proposals 58 first there are proposals which by limiting inferior federal court jurisdiction would in effect cause particular class of constitutional decisions to be heard in state courts with appeal to the supreme court59 second there have been proposals to vest exclusive jurisdiction to hear such constitutional cases in the state courts without appeal to the supreme court 60 third proposals may exclude any judicial review over particular class of constitutional cases from any court whether state or federal it should be noted that at least one courtstripping proposal does not limit the courts jurisdiction but rather limits the remedy available to the extent that these remedy limitations actually prevent the vindication of established constitutional injury they would appear to fall under the same category as proposals that limit the jurisdiction of particular courts thus for instance the amendment noted above which would prohibit the use of funds for enforcement of particular 55 this constitution and the laws of the united states wh ich shall be made in pursuance thereof and all treaties made or which shall be

similarly to an amendment limiting lower court jurisdiction over constitutional cases as will be discussed later however in situations where some sufficient remedies remain court might determine that

judicial review federal and state courts review the constitutionality of legislation passed by congress and state legislatures 63 there are few examples of congress attempting to use its power over federal court jurisdiction to limit judicial review of substantive constitutional law and examples of congress successfully precluding federal courts from an entire area of constitutional concern most commentators agree that the constitutional problems with courtstripping provisions do not just ar ise from an analysis of the extent of congress article iii powers but must also address an examination of constitutional limitations on this authority64 the court has struck down attempts by congress to pass legislation intended to directly overturn constitutional decisions of the supreme court65 it would seem unlikely that the supreme court would allow congress to achieve the same result s using congress power over jurisdiction and procedure as noted previously legislation that has the effect of encroaching upon the judicial branch or aggrandizing congresss authority may be limited by the doctrine of separation of powers 66 in particular significant issues of separation of powers issue might arise if congress attempted to prevent the supreme court from reviewing the constitutionality of legislation that congress had passed67 in united states v klein 68 congress passed law designed to frustrate finding of the supreme court as to the effect of presidential pardon the court struck down the law essentially holding that congress had an illegitimate purpose in passage of the law the language of the proviso shows plainly that it does not intend to withhold appellate jurisdiction except as means to an end its great and controlling purpose is to deny to pardons granted by the president the effect which this court had adjudged them to have it seems to us that this is not an exercise of the acknowledged power of congress to make exceptions and prescribe regulations to the

ability of court to adjudicate or remedy constitutional violation could violate the doctrine of separation of powers as providing relief from unconstitutional acts is judicial branch function70 when specific constitutional rights are singled out by congress for disparate treatment question also arises as to whether that class of litigants is being treated in manner inconsistent with the equal protection clause as noted earlier it is generally agreed that law that limited federal courts power for an illegitimate purpose such as to deny access to the courts based on race would run afoul of provisions of the constitution apart from article iii but what if members of group being excluded from the courts were not defined by membership in suspect class but instead by their status as plaintiffs in particular type of constitutional case in general article iii allows congress to provide different legal procedural rules for different types of cases if there is rational reason to do so 71 however even rational basis analysis of such disparate treatment might not be met if the court finds the argument put forward for burdening particular class of cases is illegitimate72 as mere disagreement with the results reached by the federal courts in prior cases regarding the constitution may not be viewed as legitimate legislative justification alternative justifications for such laws would need to be established before such rational basis test would be met it should be noted however that not all variations of the courts jurisdiction absolutely limit the rights of litigants to have constitutional issues reviewed by some court thus an evaluation of particular piece of courtstripping legislation may vary depending on what jurisdiction remedies or procedures are affected and what ultimate impact this is likely to have on the specified constitutional rights thus the question may well turn on how such legislation burdened particular group or impaired fundamental right for instance requiring litigants in particular federal constitutional cases to pursue their cases in state courts may not represent significant burden 73 and thus might require less legislative justification however more serious attempts to impair either the burden of litigation or the remedies available might well require the establishment of more significant governmental interest before such law could be enforced g5g495g561g7g149g146g150g146g151g138g157g146g151g144g561g11g151g143g142g155g146g152g155g561g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g5g152g158g155g157g561g20g142g159g146g142g160g561 various proposals have been made that would eliminate lower federal court review over certain constitutional issues leaving such decisions to state courts with supreme court review the argument has

foregone conclusion at one point it was proposed that the convention eliminate provision establishing such inferior courts this proposal would have had state tribunals consider most federal cases while providing supreme court review in order to enforce nationa l rights and ensure uniformity of judgments74 james madison opposed the motion to eliminate lower federal courts arguing that such decentralized system would result in an oppressive number of appeals and would subject federal law to the local biases of state judges compromise resolution proposed by madison and others was agreed to whereby congress would be allowed but not compelled to create courts inferior to the supreme court the new plan referred to as the madisonian compromise was ultimately adopted thus article iii provides that congress has the power to create courts inferior to the supreme court once congress has agreed to the creation of inferior courts however the question then arises as to whether it must grant these courts the full extent of the jurisdiction contemplated by article iii some commentators have argued that the very nature of the madisonian compromise described above plainly allowed the establishment of fede ral courts with something less than the full judicial power available under article iii 75 1816 decision by justice story martin v hunter s lessee 76 however suggests that the constitution requires that if inferior courts are established there are some aspects of the judicial power which congress may not abrogate for instance justice story argued that congress would need to vest inferior courts with jurisdiction to hear cases that are not amenable to state court jurisdiction 77 thus arguably constitutional issue which arose under law within the exclusive federal jurisdiction78 would need to be decided by federal court there is significant historical precedent however for the proposition that there is requirement that all jurisdiction that could be vested in the federal courts must be so vested for instance the first judiciary act implemented under the constitution the judiciary act of 1789 is considered to be an indicator of the original understanding of the article iii powers that act however falls short of having implemented all of the judicial powers which were specified under article iii for instance the act did not provide jurisdiction for the inferior federal courts to consider cases arising under federal law or the constitution although the supreme courts appellate jurisdiction did extend to such cases when they originated in state courts

52 at 2 section 11of the 1789 judiciary act did not confer general federal question jurisdiction jurisdiction arising under the constitution laws and treaties on the inferior federal courts but rather conferred diversity jurisdiction with so limits and few other grants so absent the ability of litigants to obtain original jurisdiction in the inferior federal courts under some other jurisdictional basis the constitutionality of federal statutes could not be attacked in these courts some few instances of federal question jurisdiction appear in the historical record but it was not until 1875 when congress conferred general federal question jurisdiction on the inferior federal courts subject to jurisdictional amount limitation 18 stat 470

need not vest the lower courts with all jurisdiction authorized by article iii in sheldon v sill 80 the court was asked to evaluate whether congress need grant federal circuit court jurisdiction in case where diversity jurisdiction based on parties being from differen t states had been manufactured by assignment of mortgage to person in another state the court held that congress having the power to establish the courts must define their respective jurisdictions81 the court further indicated that congress may withhold from any court of its cr eation jurisdiction of any of the enumerated controversies so that statute which does prescribe the limits of their jurisdiction cannot be in conflict with the constitution unless it confers powers not enumerated therein82 as noted earlier the supremacy clause provides that state courts are bound to follow the united states constitution so that state courts which have cases within their jurisdiction are required to consider and decide such constitutional issues as they arise congress does not have the authority to establish the jurisdiction of state courts and consequently those court stripping proposals that relate to the inferior federal courts do not generally specify that state courts will become the primary courts for vindication of specified constitutional rights to the extent however that state courts provide forum for the complete vindication of constitutional rights then concerns about removal of such issues from federal court are diminished however as noted earlier such court stripping proposals would still need to meet requirements of equal protection due process or separation of powers

federal question review over particular constitutional question by the supreme court appears to be unprecedented while there was time when inferior federal courts did not have general federal jurisdiction 83 constitutional challenges against states actions could still be brought in the state courts with appe llate review in the supreme court initially the supreme courts appellate review was limited to only certain procedural postures under 25 of the judiciary act of 178984 there were three categories of appellate jurisdiction to the supreme court available 1 where the validity of treaty statute or authority of the united states is drawn into question and the state courts decision is against their validity 2 where the validity of state statute or authority is challenged on the basis of federal law and the state courts decision is in favor of their validity 3 where state court construes united states constitution treaty statute or commission and decides against title

to promote national uniform resolution of questions of the validity of federal laws or treaties by providing supreme court review where federal law or treaty was invalidated thus if federal law was found to violate the constitution the case could be reviewed by the supreme court similarly if federal law and state law conflicted and the state law was upheld the litigant could appeal to the supreme court thus providing for review of state laws upheld despite constitutional challenge finally where state court decided against title privilege or exemption of litigant based on federal law the court could hear the case only if state court upheld federal law or treaty or struck state law as inconsistent with federal law did the supreme court lack jurisdiction thus in those procedural postures where the federal interest was not being challenged 25 would have the effect of insulating federal law from constitutional attack86 thus while constitutional challenge might be postponed because of the procedural posture of case state and federal laws were not protected from appellate review from the supreme court for instance if state law was invalidated by state court as being in conflict with federal law precluding the losing party from appealing that decision principle of res judicata or collateral estoppel would prevent challenge to such state laws being brought in other states if another state court upheld such state law this decision could be appealed and the precedent would apply to the state where the first challenge was brought87 thus there was general bar on such issues coming before the supreme court whether complete bar of federal court review of constitutional issue could be implemented by congress first requires evaluation of two aspects of article iii the power of congress to allocate federal judicial power and the power of congress to create exceptions to the supreme courts appellate jurisdiction under the exceptions clause as to the former the question arises as to whether congress need allocate any of the authorities delineated in article iii to the federal courts beyond cases decided under the original jurisdiction of the supreme court in martin v hunter s lessee 88 justice story noted that the constitution provides that the judicial power shall be vested in the supreme court or in the such inferior courts as are created his opinion thus asserted that it is the duty of congress to vest the whole judicial power where it is so directed either in the supreme court or in the inferior courts justice story did however note that the text of the constitution suggests some limits to the requirement that the whole judicial power shall vest this limit arises from the previously noted fact that some types of federal judicial power are extended by the text of the constitution to all such cases ie cases arising under either th constitution federal law treaty admiralty or maritime jurisdiction or cases affecting an ambassador or other public ministers or consuls89 the vesting of other types of cases cited in article iii such as cases between citizens of different continued rev 1101 111820 1985 86 the law incidentally was not

due process clause one may wonder how often this kind of thing happened if the law was not changed for 85 years 87 as there were thirteen states when the judiciary act was passed in 1789 and around 40

have discretion whether or not to establish these powers in the federal courts under this textual analysis the power to consider cases concerning the constitution must be vested in some federal court thus according to justice story statute limiting consideration of specific constitutional issues to state courts with supreme court review would be unconstitutional this analysis however has attracted large amounts of scholarly attention and there is significant dispute over justice storys conclusion on one hand at least one commentator asserts that not only is the theory that some federal powers must be vested in the supreme court supported by analysis of the text of the constitution but that it is also consistent with jurisdictional limitations found in the judiciary act of 1789 and subsequent case law 90 other commentators however have taken issue with this analysis91 absent additional court precedent on this point resolution of this scholarly debate would be largely speculative the second issue whether supreme court review over category of cases can be limited by legislation under the exceptions clause has been addressed to some extent by the supreme court in ex parte mccardle92 in ex parte mccardle congress had authorized federal judges to issue writs of habeas corpus mccardle the editor of the vicksburg times was arrested by federal military authorities on the basis of various editorials published in his newspaper and charged with disturbing the peace libel incitement and impeding reconstruction claiming constitutional infirmities with his case mccardle sought and was denied writ of habeas corpus in an inferior federal court decision which he then appealed to the supreme court during the pendency of that appeal however in an apparent attempt to prevent the supreme court from hearing the appeal congress repealed the jurisdiction of the supreme court to hear appeals from habeas corpus decisions in mccardle congress purported to be acting under its authority under article iii to make exceptions to the appellate jurisdiction of the court in reviewing the statute repealing the supreme courts jurisdiction the court noted that it was not at liberty to inquire into the motives of the legislature we can only examine its power under the constitution and the power to make exceptions to the appellate jurisdiction of this court is given by express words 93 consequently the supreme court accepted the withdrawal of jurisdiction over the defendants case and dismissed the appeal the case of ex parte mccardle while it made clear the authority of congress to make exceptions to the appellate jurisdiction of the supreme court does not appear to answer the question as to whether all supreme court review of const itutional issue can be eliminated the court specifically noted that mccardle had other avenues of review to challenge the constitutionality of his arrest apart from appellate review namely the invocation of habeas corpus directly by the supreme court94 consequently unlike what would be provided for in some of the courtstripping 90 akhil amar neofederalist view of ar ticle iii separating the two tiers of federal

the ability to otherwise consider the underlying constitutional issues being raised as noted previously it would also be the case that courtstripping proposals in this category would raise significant questions of separation of powers for instance if congress were to provide that the supreme court were unable to consider constitutional challenges to federal law this would clearly raise the question of whether congress was moving to aggrandize congressional power at the expense of the judicial branch as noted in section iib of this report under textual analysis such aggrandizement or encroachment can be the basis for finding that such legislation is unconstitutional 95 even under more flexible functionalist approach to separation of powers the question would arise as to whether such legislation impinges upon core function of coordinate branch96 in sum there is direct court precedent on the issue of whether congress can eliminate all federal court jurisdiction over constitutional issue and little or consensus among scholars the practical consequences of enacting such proposals is also unclear while it is presently the case that supreme court precedent binds state courts it is not clear if this would continue to be the effect if the states became the court of final resort on particular issue97 even if existing precedent was adhered to over time it could become the case that divergent constitutional doctrine would arise in each of the fifty states on any issue where supreme court review was precluded arguments have been made that such result would undercut the intention of the founding fathers to establish uniform federal constitutional scheme98

court decisions seems to indicate that in most cases some forum must be provided for the vindication of constitutional rights whether in federal or state courts for instance in 1946 series of supreme court decisions 99 under the fair labor standards act of 1938100 exposed employers to five billion dollars in damages and the united states itself was threatened with liability for over 15 billion

supreme court has not directly addressed whether there needs to be judicial forum to vindicate all constitutional rights justice scalia has pointed out that there are particular cases such as political questions cases where all constitutional review is in effect precluded104 other commentators point to sovereign immunity and the ability of the government to limit the remedies available to plaintiffs105 however the court has in cases involving particular rights generally found requirement that effective judicial remedies be present thus for instance the court has held that the constitution mandates the availability of effective remedies for takings106 these cases would seem to indicate basis for the court to find that parties seeking to vindicate other particular rights

other possessions under article iv 3 clause 2 it must provide for courts but the status of these entities is far fr om permanent that is some territories may be slated for statehood others may be given independence and some may stay dependent in all such instances congress will want to maintain its discretion and not tie its hands by creating judges with lifetime tenure thus in american ins co

court held unconstitutional the vesting of jurisdiction over commonlaw claims arising under the bankruptcy code in nonarticle iii courts either artic i tribunals or adjuncts attached to article iii courts the case is premised on the decision that the vesting of any but the most limited amount of judicial power in nonarticle iii tribunals effected an unwarranted encroachment upon the judicial power of the united states classic statement of the doctrine of separation of powers as it emerged in the late 20 th century the dissenters did not disavow the notion that congress could encroach on the authority of the federal courts by vesting the judicial power elsewhere but they advocated balancing test based on the particular facts of each case to determine whether congress had indeed impermissibly interfered with another branch but the use of nonarticle iii tribunals has become too widespread to maintain this position and in subsequent cases see thomas v union carbide 473 us 568

concerns the power that congress can exercise over legislative tribunals because the officeholders of these tribunals lack article iii security designed to maintain judicial independence congress may limit tenure to term of years as it has done in acts creating territorial and local district of columbia courts and in such tribunals as the tax court and others and it may subject the judges of such courts to removal by the president and reduce their salaries during their terms similarly congress can vest nonjudicial functions in these courts that it may not vest in article iii courts it is obvious that if there is congressional power to create nonarticle iii tribunals and vest in them jurisdiction over public rights and other matters that are traditionally the subject of article iii cases then congress has potential leverage visavis federal courts that can alter federal separation of powers

of jurisdiction can constrain the courts in the performance of their duties so restrictions on judicial processes such as the ability to afford injunctive relief can equally constrain the courts 110 while major interpretive differences have arisen between congress and the courts regarding the construction of these legislative enactments the supreme court has never expre ssed any doubt that congress has the power to enact them the court has however always left open the possibility that congress might go too far111 for instance in 1793 for reasons lost to histor congress enacted statute to prohibit the issuance of injunctions by federal courts to stay state court proceedings while construction of this statute has varied over the years112 it remains as an indication that congress has the power to regulate such judicial process and remedies113 during this century the propensity of the federal continued disavowing marathon then in granfinanciera s v nordberg 492 us 33 1989 the court veered back toward marathon whatever these cases may stand for they do recognize that congress may vest jurisdiction over matters of public rights mainly under federal statutes in nonarticle iii tribunals 109 see south carolina v katzenbach 383 us 301 33132 1966court upheld the provision of the voting rights act of 1965 that made special threejudge district court in the district of columbia the exclusive avenue of relief for states seeking to remove themselves from the coverage of the act 110 while the courts have some inherent authority over its procedures congress has regulated such processes as the power to hold persons in contempt to issue writs and many other matters since the judiciary act of 1789 111 see eg miller v french 530 us 327 35051 2000souter j concurringarguing that

purported to be the original intent in contrast to the usual congressionaljudicial confrontation congress immediately amended the statute announcing its intention to restore th pretoucey

management114 led congress to adopt the norrislaguardia act115 forbidding the issuance of injunctions in labor disputes except after compliance with lengthy hearing and factfinding process116 although earlier case law appeared to recognize due process objection to such restraint117 the supreme court had difficulty sustaining the constitutionality of the law in lauf v g shinner co 118 congress power to confer withhold and restrict both jurisdiction and equity authority was also powerfully revealed in the cases arising from the emergency price control act of 1942119 fearful that the price control program might be nullified by injunctions congress provided for special court in which persons could challenge the validity of price regulations issued by the government from which appeals from the court to the supreme court could be taken the constitutionality of the act was sustained in lockerty v phillips 120 although those skeptical of the breadth of the law note that the court itself referred to the fact that it arose in the exigencies of war121 one modern example of congressional control over the processes of the federal courts122 is the prison litigation reform act plra of 1996 for the last 20 30 years many prisons and jails in this country have been enjoined to make certain changes based on findings that the conditions continued law through other avenues 114 this often occurred during the era following the courts decision in lochner v new york 198 us 45 1905striking down law restricting employment in bakeries to ten hours per day and 60 hours per week as violation of the right to enter into contract see constitution annotated supra footnote 22 at 158283 115 29 usc 10115 116 this process required the district court to determine that only through the injunctive process could irremediable harm through illegal conduct be prevented 117 see truax v corrigan 257 us 312 1921 118 lauf v g shinner co 303 us 323 330 1938there can be question of the power of congress thus to define and limit the jurisdiction of the inferior courts of the united states but by the time lauf was decided however lochner was effectively dead as in so many of these precedents the actual holding may not permit congress to go as far as it might wish 119 see eg scrippshoward radio inc v fcc 316 us 4 910 1942 quoted in miller v french 536 us 327 360 2000justice breyer dissenting 120 319

regulation and foreclosed plea of invalidity of any such order or regulation as defense to any criminal proceeding under the act in any regular district court whether or not the person proceeded against had ever made use of the special court 121 outside the scope of wartime price control measure the court has viewed similar preclusions of judicial review as raising serious due process problems resulting in constr uction that bypassed the constitutional issues see eg adamo wrecking co v united states 434 us 275 1975 united states v mendozalopez 481 us 828 1987 122 another modern example involves prisoners seeking habeas corpus relief convicted person is entitled to relief if court finds that federal right has been violated but it is not up to the court to issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the state court acted contrary to federal law instead congress has instructed federal courts in 28 usc 2254d that the writ may issue if the prisoner demonstrates that the adjudication of his claim by the state courts 1 resulted in decision that was contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 2 resulted in decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence in the state court proceedings the court has not passed on constitutional claims based on this standard but it has in several cases applied the standard sometimes unanimously without any suggestion that constitutional question may be presented see eg price v vincent 123 s ct 1848 2003 and cases cited therein

inmates many of these injunctions came as result of consent decrees entered into between inmates and prison officials and endorsed by federal courts so that relief was not necessarily tied to violations found many state officials and members of congress have complained of the breadth of relief granted by federal judges as these injunctions often required expensive remedial actions the plra was designed to curb the discretion of the federal courts in these types of actions thus the central requirement of the act was provision that court shall not grant or approve any prospective relief unless the court finds that such relief is narrowly drawn extends further than necessary to correct the violation of the federal right and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the federal right124 the most pointed provision of the plra in this context is the socalled automatic stay section which states that motion to terminate prospective relief shall operate as stay of that relief during the period beginning 30 days after the filing of the motion extendable to up to 90 days for good cause and ending when the court rules on the motion 125 in miller v french 126 inmates attacked the constitutionality of the automatic stay provision127 as violation of separation of powers128 by 5to4 vote the supreme court reversed the court held that the plra did not set aside final judgment of federal court but rather it operated to change the underlying law and thus required the altering of the prospective relief issued under the old law 129 secondly the court noted that separation of powers did not prevent congress from changing applicable law and then imposing the consequences of the courts application of the new legal standard finally the court held that the stay provision did not interfere with core judicial functions as it could not be determined whether the time limitations interfered with judicial functions through its relative brevity130 123 generally these rights include freedom from cruel and unusual punishment or the right to due process 124 18 usc 3626a1a under plra the same criteria apply to existing injunctions whether entered after trial or through approval of consent decree 18 usc 3626b3 to ensure that an injunction granting prospective relief does not remain in effect during the months or years that trial of prison conditions case typically takes the act requires courts to rule promptly on motions to terminate prospective relief with mandamus available to remedy failure to do so 125 18 usc 3626e2 thus the statute expressly provided for the suspension of existing prospective relief within 30 days or 90 days from the filing of motion to terminate the prospective relief that suspension continues only until the court conducts trial and makes the findings the act requires of it but this period will doubtless be for an extended time given the complexities of the trial that must be conducted 126 530

separation of powers the due process argument was not before the court thus the constitutiona lity of the plra overall and of the automatic stay in particular is as yet undetermined although the courts opinion seems disposed to measure of acceptance httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32926g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g146g152g151g138g149g561g3g158g157g145g152g155g146g157g162g561g17g159g142g155

the prescribed authorities to interpret the constitution and to establish precedents131 congress is relatively limited in its ability to change constitutional holdings the primary route by which congress can implement such changes is also difficult one proposing an amendment to the constitution and working to secure ratification the eleventh amendment the first sentence of section 1 of the fourteenth amendment the sixteenth amendment the twentyfourth amendment and the twentysixth amendment were all directed to overturning the results of court decisions the alternative method of amendment set out in article v the congressional calling of constitutional convention upon petition by twothirds of the states has never been successfully used although an effort to call convention to propose an amendment to override the one person one vote decision of reynolds v sims 132 fell just one state short133 congress has of course passed legislation which was intended to change the results or effects of judicial decisions although the supreme court considers itself bound by stare decisis it is in effect loosely bound and thus is in position to consider the positions of its coordinate branches on constitutional issues nonetheless this qualification has not appeared to have concerned the court in most cases as the court has generally invalidated statutes that congress has enacted to set aside constitutional decisions by the supreme court 134

and robertson is matter of degree and congress walks close to the line when it legislates against the background of decided case 140 136 plaut v spendthrift farm inc 514 us 211 227 1995 the court explained that the concept of finality did not alone depend on the actions of single court because ar ticle iii as implemented by congress creates not collection of unconnected courts but judicial department composed of inferior courts and one supreme court within that hierarchy the decision of an inferior court is not unless the time for appeal has expired the final word of the department as whole 137 ibid at 22627 this has long been established law see eg united states v schooner peggy l cr 5 us103 1801 138 18 how 59 us 421 1856 139 503 us 432 1992 140 but the peril may be enhanced if the court follows certain dicta in plaut as noted in the discussion of separation of powers the court often varies between flexible test and strict test the language in plaut suggests that as prophylactic measure the court would not require proof of actual or threatened congressional intent to tread on judicial turf when congress acted in the face of judicial decisions thus even if it is sometimes impossible to discern any actual threat to separationofpower concerns when congress seeks to instruct courts respecting decisions that is irrelevant because the doctrine of separation of powers is structural safeguard rather than remedy to be applied only when specific harm or risk of specific harm can be identified plaut 514 us at 239

specific court case or cases141 such as recent attempt by congress to intervene in the case of theresa marie schiavo despite court findings that she had previously expressed her desires to not receive medical treatment under certain circumstance142 an argument could be made that congressional legislation that applies to specific court case may be construed as imposing additional burdens on the litigants involved legislation that identifies specified individuals to bear additional legal burdens raises issues of due process and equal protection for instance in news america publishing inc v fcc 143 the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia applied heightened scrutiny to an act of congress that singled out with the precision of laser beam corporation controlled by rupert murdoch murdochs corporation had appl ied for and received temporary waivers from the fccs crossownership rules so that the co rporation could acquire two tv licenses one in boston and the other in new york144 subsequently congress passed law that prevented the fcc from extending any existing temporary waivers at the time murdochs corporation was the only current beneficiary of any such temporary wa ivers the corporation sued arguing violation of equal protection in the context of the first amendment based on this argument the court evaluated the law under heightened scrutiny standard and struck it down 145 g344g495g561g4g146g149g149g561g152g143g561g3g157g157g138g146g151g141g142g155g561 if congress does legislate regarding particular court case this may also raise the issue of the prohibition on bills of attainder 146 under this provision congress is prohibited from passing legislation which applies either to named individual or to easily ascertainable members of group in such way as to inflict punishment on them without judicial trial147 generally the prohibition on bills of attainder is intended to prevent congress from assuming judicial functions and conducting trials148 the two main criteria which the courts will look to in order to determine whether legislation is bill of attainder are 1 whether specific individuals are affected by the statute and 2 whether the legislation inflicts punishment on those individuals149 the supreme court has held that 141 pl 104205 treatment of certain pending child custody cases in superior court of district of columbia provided for specific procedures to be followed in resolving child custody cases in the district of columbia superior court but was written so narrowly as to apply to just one case involving elizabeth morgan and eric foretich 142 see pl 1093 for the relief of the parents of theresa marie schiavo providing that either parent of theresa marie schiavo shall have standing to bring suit in federal court regarding court decision to allow withdrawal of nutrition and hydration from patient in persistent vegetative state it should be noted that except for some dicta see eg schiavo v

person or group of people who are described by past conduct150 which would seem to include participation in court case the mere fact that focused legislation imposes burdensome consequences however does not require that court find such legislation to be an unconstitutional of bill of attainder rather the court has identified three types of punitive legislation which are barred by the ban on bills of attainder 1 where the burden is such as has traditionally been found to be punitive151 2 where the type and severity of burdens imposed cannot reasonably be said to further nonpunitive legislative purposes152 and 3 where the legislative record evinces congressional intent to punish an opinion by the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia specifically addressed the issue of whether congressional bill addressing pending court case was bill of attainder in foretich v united states 153 the court considered legislative rider to the 1997 department of transportation appropriations act that provided for specific procedures to be followed in resolving child custody cases in the district of columbia superior court but was written so narrowly as to apply to just one case154 this case involved protracted custody battle where allegations of sexual abuse by the husband had been made because the child in the case was longer minor the issue of removal of custodianship was declared by the court to be moot however the court found that act imposed punishment under the functional test because it harmed the fathers reputation and because it could not be said to further nonpunitive purpose 150 selective service system v minnesota public interest group 468 us 841 847 1984 151 the supreme court has identified various types of punishments which have hist orically been associated with bills of attainder these traditionally have included capital punishment imprisonment fines banishment confiscation of property and more recently the barring of individuals or groups from participation in specified employment or vocations 433 us at 47475 there are indications by the court that harming persons reputation or intervening in guardianship rights is type of punishment traditionally engaged in by legislatures as means of punishing individuals for wrongdoing 152 the supreme court has indicated that some legislative bur dens not traditionally associated with bills of attainder might nevertheless functionally serve as punishment 433 us at 475 the court has stated however that the type and severity of legislatively imposed burden should be examined to see whether it could reasonably be said to further nonpunitive legislation purpose kennedy v mendozamartinez 372 us 144 16869 1963 nixon v administrator of general services 433 us at 476 153 351 f3d 1198 2003 154 the act provided in any pending case involving custody over minor child or the visitation rights of parent of minor child in the superior court which

has wide range of tools available to it to exercise its legislative authorities with respect to the judicial branch and these powers may be used to alter almost all aspects of how the federal courts are organized and administered however as with other constitutional authorities these powers are subject to some constitutional limitations although the exact parameters of these limitations have not been established it is likely the supreme court would impose limitations on congressional legislation that did not comply with dictates of due process equal protection and separation of powers
