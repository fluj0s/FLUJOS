auditor selfcriticism lecture given on 4 february 1964 all right how are you today audience good fine well im glad to see you too we have date here whats the date audience fourth of february fourth february 1964 the ad what audience fourteen all right all right ill get close to it here saint hill special briefing course all right well enough of this goofing off enough of this goofing off i wasnt speaking about the beginning of the lecture im speaking about auditing this is lecture on the use of selfcriticism in auditing now some of you some of you have been the source of deep wailing crying in the kleenex many puzzled looks on jennys face incredible remarks in the instructors conference and incredulous gasps because the subject of selfcriticism of ones own auditing is very very very misunderstood at this particular moment and the reason its misunderstood of course is because its too simple now ive just been over the high spots in r6 in the month of january and my theory being it was better for to knock ead off than for everybody to knock their eads off this being theory i work on but sometimes it deprives you of lectures and this body of some years of future life now weve we got this one pretty well taped and r6 is of complexity r6 is of such complexity that well its impossible to learn it its impossible to do it and yet you have to its complexities are sufficient to fill the most avaricious appetite of any complexicator so we might as well just lay aside complexity until we get to r6 theres where it lives r5 seems complex but r6 is incredible and yet its one little doable action the running out of the actual gpm all right thats very complex and by the way well be rolling that unit here any minute now and starting in with dull thud and what im about to give you what im about to give you by the way is germane to it because this point has to be reviewed and completely aside from all other levels if you havent got basic auditing as required in smoothness at the level of r6 you dont lay eggs you dont lay eggs you lay ostrich eggs and emu eggs and other large varieties which have sharp corners so in actual fact you can call this lecture for lower levels and so it is its something that you should learn in lower levels but its peculiarly germane to r6 and you can call this the first r6 lecture now whats this thing this thing called selfcriticism of ones own auditing well this is very simple this is this is too simple and it misses horribly and everybody gets very tanglefooted in it and i have seen some of the most remarkable responses i think that anybody could ever add up and these responses are in answer to the question what happened in the session theyre theyre really gorgeous i should have stack of papers here in front of but i will spare you that embarrassment what went on in the session week after week week after week papers were handed in to and everybody was trying to find out what i meant and what i wanted oh im actually fairly easy to please but i just couldnt seem to be pleased by any of these reports what r6 requires is one thing but selfcriticism of auditing applies to all levels in actual fact from iii up ii thats getting well you should know it in ii but its quite bit to teach at ii iii it becomes absolutely vital youll still get some results without it at iv it becomes pretty confoundedly pressing because youre going deeper into the case at v well youd better have it pretty well and at vi youre not going to get anyplace without it in other words the deeper you reach into case the more expert your auditing has to be and when i mean auditing i mean your basic auditing the deeper you go into cases the higher up the level the deeper you go into the case of course and your auditing is must comparably keep pace in other words the more the more reach the processes have the more vital it becomes that the basic auditing be perfect or as near perfect as it can be made in other words somebody could get away at levels i at level 0 i something like that can get away with some pretty fantastic flubs before i finish that let just tell you selfcriticism is simply making tape of your own session listening it back and say what went wrong i mean that thats the whole thing how could you improve your own auditing after listening to tape of one of your sessions how could you improve your auditing and thats all there is to selfcriticism and well go into that at much greater length but you understand that at level 0 or i in coaudit in poughkeepsie somebody can sit down and say well what what solutions have you had to your lumbosis and just sit there and run it off its not its not going to do too much because if the basic impingement of the auditor is not very great youre not running very deep into the case anyway and if the auditor makes any flubs well the flub isnt impinging either you see see laughter so therefore it sometimes looks very mysterious to one of you operating as an auditing supervisor in coaudit to have all these brand new people fresh off the street sitting there yippetyyapping at each other and everybody happy and arc breaks and nothing going on at all well of course theyre not reaching any deeper than molecule and the auditing flubs of course have more impingement than the auditing question see so therefore it looks good it looks good and you say well why cant veteran auditors audit this smoothly well the veteran auditor of course is going in with pickax hes going much deeper in the case hes doing openpit mining and hes got himself quite battery of processes and he starts using one of these processes on the pc and hes longer dusting it off one molecule thick he and the process are making an impingement man and what he says has an effect on the pc so of course his auditing flub has an effect on the pc proportionately right well so much that would be at repetitive level so it the bum pieces of auditing which recur at level ii also have an impingement see they have an impingement as great as level ii has and level ii with tremendous number of repetitive process mary sue is doing chart of these things and were doing guidebook to scientology processes and shes been digging up some from yars and yars ago and i never knew there was that wealth of repetitive processes thats about the wealthiest level that anybody ever had anything to do with good heavens there are processes that id forgotten and put to bed ages ago and so forth did you do you remember viewpoint processing well you may have and may not have because i didnt and mary sue promptly produced big sheet that she had salvaged out of an acc shes really done wonderful job keeping odd bits of records and that sort of thing and shed salvaged this sheet out of her papers and i looked at this whats this you know well those just repetitive processes but frankly they were enough to tear anybodys head off see viewpointrehabilitation of the pcs space for gods sakes krrrr so well thats quite bit of impingement and so we consequently with that much impingement of process were going to get that much impingement of flub and so we have to have trs in pretty good condition in order to run that particular level person isnt going to get much results well go into results in minute if he doesnt have his trs in such position now lets take our old friend here the emeter and lets take level iii with this emeter now this emeter will dig its all right for the pc to sit there and say yes hmhm that was in 1952 that was when my dog bit aunt agnes thats all right thats fine but now were going to find out the subitsa and as soon as we get the meter we start mining in subitsa now were just mining in itsa at level ii its what can the pc remember and the only improvement we get of the depth of itsa is brought about by the repetitive nature of the process you see ah but now we go into level iii and we are longer doing mere openpit mining with picks and shovels and chinese wicker baskets you see we have moved in large crane called an emeter and its taking bites out of the earth at tremendous rate and the pc doesnt know whats going to be bit up just take an innocent question like this in this session has anything been suppressed pc says all right ill check that on the meter in this session has anything been suppressed im sorry that reads it does oh oh oh well yes i suppressed when you said start of session i suppressed it the session never started well now how did we arrive at that we didnt arrive at that simply by asking the pc question and getting the snap offthecuff answer which was sitting there ready to be delivered we asked the pc and he couldnt see anything so we looked at the meter to see if it could see something and of course it mines below his itsa level it will read below where he can see well now were getting into an area of more impingement arent we were going deeper and the impingement being greater the handling of the auditing must be better because now the impingement of the meter plus the process is sufficiently great that the pc of course is impinged upon by the flubs that much more heavily so he begins to mind these flubs much worse now this really has nothing whatsoever to do with whether one pc is touchy or another pc is untouchy it has to do with the fact that the pc is being mined more deeply and therefore the impingement is greater now one of the things which happens when you run somebody over his level this is only true by the way up to level iv but when you mine somebody above his level youre running him on some process type and so forth that he is not accustomed to you hes over his head every time you pick up an answer it leaps fullarmed and slays him see bong you see this person ought to be audited on ordinary itsalevel i you see so they chatterchatter the protective defenses of the mind are not disarmed hes perfectly careful he really doesnt have to talk to the auditor he can sort of say well its all right if i say i did this because the auditor really isnt there anyway hes got all kinds of things you see that he can dodge away from but as weve moved it up the line as weve moved it up the line he longer can do this and when you go into with crash and ask something that he finds it very difficult to confront youll get things like bypassed charge accumulating and he says the picks on these little bits of rough auditing see and the he minds these things hes very upset about them and when somebody is audited well above his level you can count on consistent and continual arc breaky sessions it doesnt mean that arc breaky sessions totally stem from being audited above the level dont you understand because if you want to see real prize arc breaky session do an r6 with wrong goal youre going to have sufficiently arc breaky pc to please the most masochistic auditor ever made it doesnt matter who it is you see hes just being audited wrong its not above his level but this is true up to level iv that if you run pc above his level you have greater tendency to have arc breaky sessions so up to level iv the best handling of quote arc breaky pc is reduce his level somebody whos consistently arc breaky you simply reduce his level thats all thats the best handling because when were assessing cases we arent necessarily looking over the quality of the auditing and we assume that the auditor was there doing his best but certainly the level of impingement of the error was much greater than the pc could tolerate thats only true up to level iv you understand because at level v and level vi the only thing that cures arc breaks the only thing that cures arc breaks is picking up the bypassed charge that has been bypassed you reduce his level hes just going into sad effect you know you got somebody with wrong goal so you hes arc breaky so you reduce his level cut your throat man that wrong goal is just going to sit there from there on out and week later and month later and three months later and six months later hell still be in the sad effect from this wrong goal so levels v and vi are not included in that reduction of level because the person who has been booted up to levels v and vi jolly well ought to be able to tolerate auditing because he should have been audited up to point where he is not frightened of having problems and hes not frightened of the horrible censor who stands over with lion skin on and club in his hand that freud put there the censor was an item invented by sigmund freud we are very indebted to mr freud and im never say anything that is really to be taken in derogatory fashion about freud but i can never fail to remark some of these things which going further in the work have suddenly revealed some of these gaping holes have you have you ever audited psychoanalyzed pc that is ball man the only thing you get off the psychoanalyzed pc is psychoanalytic computations and the auditor that will sit there and take these i dont know this is bunch of bunk you see what it is is invented items youll find that person who is given wrong goal will dramatize it more than his right goals you tell somebody he has goal to lasso bulls on the pampas see to lasso bulls on the pampas you see well of course such goal is lot of bull but we can go we can get this fellow then short time afterwards hes sold on it and hell just keep talking about having to go to the pampas you know and riding his horse while hes telling you you know and hes got to lasso bulls on the pampas this is most remarkable thing and eventually youll pick it up that its wrong goal and he longer dramatizes it in other words you have an installed goal and because it is wrong wrongness has been invalidated and of course doesnt asis but beefs up now you find the persons right goal he will dramatize it less this is one of the ways of telling what is right goal not very effective way but little cute trick that lies alongside of the thing you tell this fellow you tell this fellow he has goal to sneeze and all the next day he does nothing but sneeze you can conclude at the end of that time that that is wrong goal because if youd found the goal to sneeze he would now sneeze less if it was an actual goal you see but if you found wrong goal to sneeze you have validated an error and he will now sneeze worse youve given it wrong source if you date somatic with wrong date it wont go away thats for sure but an auditor can come along shortly afterwards and find the wrong date of the somatic and get very nice meter reactions and reduction of the somatic you understand what i just said an auditor comes along and he wrongly dates somatic on pc this pc didnt get any better see in fact his somatic probably got little worse and then another auditor comes along shortly afterwards can find the wrong date of the somatic and even though he uses that as the date he runs off the charge of it having been wrongly dated you understand and the somatic slightly reduces and he thinks hes got the right date you understand very cute now of course if he went ahead and found the right date the somatic would go completely you understand well this is the validation of an error and person tends to dramatize validated error more than an actual aberration which has been contacted this is very mysterious but is something for an auditor to watch for because hell sometimes see some very amusing examples of this theyre very amusing the very often he will get pc from some coaudit or from some other area who has been told something of this sort and the pc will sit there with this big sell your best thing to do is do case analysis on it find out where he got this idea see where hes sitting hes sitting over there where he got the idea of course get the considerations off of the thing and then find out where it really is or if it really is true see and youll find out these things will go away well now you could do the same thing with psychoanalytic patient ive told this story many times but the most unkind thing i did i think to ever did to pc from his own point of view was the associate editor of colliers magazine back in the early days and he had been psychoanalyzed and psychoanalysis had kept him going for number of years when the psychoanalyst picked him up he had ulcers he had ulcers so you could see daylight through him you see and he had ceased to have ulcers oddly enough apparently but he had to be very careful this is always true of person who has been had errors validated by some psychotherapy or medical treatment or something of the sort they have to be careful thats the common denominator that is something you want to watch for in pc what is he being very careful of thats why that careful button is so gorgeous whats he being careful of you know well he has to he has to have nineteen hours sleep night he has to be very careful to get nineteen hours sleep night you trace that back with some kind of case analysis youll get into some of the most amusing ramifications you ever heard of and finally you will find out that this was piece of advice that he got to cure his insomnia or something and it was validated error that wasnt what was wrong with him at all see somebody has found the wrong combo of the case and worked it around and now the fellow will dramatize it well this associate editor at colliers magazine had been psychoanalyzed since he was small boy and he was being very careful he if he if he didnt ride on certain kinds of trains maybe i exaggerate this little bit you see and if he didnt if he was very careful to drink only out of square tumblers and if he only thought the right thoughts and if he sat in certain way in chair he could live you see he wanted to know what this dianetics was all about and i gave him session and the first thing i did was take him back to the beginning of his psychoanalysis and scan him rapidly through to the from the first session to the last session he had ever had at the end of the first scan his ulcers were on full gave him back every symptom that psychoanalysis had cured him of every single symptom was there glaring him in the face we used to audit in those days on couch he got up he got up off the couch and he staggered into the bathroom and he was dreadfully ill in about eight different directions i scanned him through it another time or two and it cased the symptoms and that sort of thing but the poor fellow now had nothing to hold on to he had nothing to hold on to so he didnt write good article about dianetics you see wed taken away his id and his ego and his mother complex and his censors and how it was looking through cracks in the bedroom window that had aberrated him dont you see and wed just taken all these things and torn the whole thing up and thrown it in the air and given him back his ulcers in full but the man could breathe he didnt recognize in himself that he was now freer than hed been for seven years and oh he got subsequent auditing im sure but personally i myself was not terribly fascinated because he was only supposed to be demonstration and he kept comparing dianetics to psychoanalysis which i think was awfully fatal for him he knew at the end of that time that we were sufficiently powerful to be able to tear up another psychotherapy naturally the course of action would have been to just erase the psychoanalysis just by chain scanning and return him into proper cycles of processing and put him back together again and get him into some kind of condition so that he could function obviously his ulcers were not from his id having skidded into his ego see so i remember then that was fabulous some other auditor took him on they did quite bit for him afterwards but the point startled i hadnt recognized myself the frailty of psychoanalysis the tremendous frailty of it in other words this thing was by inventedness it was cure by inventing new evils and the cure by invention is an alteris and sometimes you can do things with it but remember it would be very very grim sort of an approach that if this fellow had serious headaches to give him an awful stomachache so he took his attention off of bis headache but dont you think that that hasnt been done and many times and several therapies can be attributable to it but theres very shallow draft thats very shallow draft and actually telling somebody about his ids and skiddings and the censor and how he had evil thoughts all the time and he just thought evil thoughts all the time but had to suppress them and he was very close to suppress as button dont you see all of these things had added up into very shallow draft action which had simply submerged the actual symptoms well now what do you think an auditors flub failure to acknowledge or something like that would have done at that level of case operation nothing the auditor could have failed to acknowledge or acknowledge or double acknowledge or tripleacknowledge or walked out of the room or sat on the desk with leaning back with his feet higher than his head snoring and it wouldnt have had much bearing on the case dont you see case was just plunging himself in with overcommunication of some kind or another thats the psychoanalytic approach you see we dont do anything quite as light as that in other words thats negative itsa see the person is examining things that never existed well lets look at this you get an emeter loose amongst case and you can start pulling case up by the roots and this is getting pretty doggone fundamental you just ask this fellow since the last time i audited you week ago has anything been suppressed and he comes up with his problems and upsets and so forth but he himself is buried this is sufficiently true that you wont care to use many since mid ruds at level vi the reason for that is of course they are sitting all the events of the last week are sitting on the last item you left him in its going to take you about well five or ten minutes to list and blow that item why spend half an hour you see what i mean now by depth lets take those two extremes all the events of the past week are sitting on this item well youre going to blow the item see it just happens to be the item hes sitting in so you dont pay much attention to it in other words youre now mining so deep that the shallow mining hasnt got very much bearing on it well lets take the intermediate step level iv level iv now were going for service facsimiles were going for long chains of stuff were going for assessmenttype things were going to plow around in this case and find out what combo of this and that reads and were going to do something with this with the emeter and were going to take up this guy by his roots and were going to say how are you making people wrong now that is very accusative level of auditing i must assure you but its nevertheless very factual level of auditing now if the fellow hasnt graduated up through the levels as pc to point where he can take enough responsibility to have been wrong occasionally or catch himself out doing something antisocial he isnt going to buy this at all you see so the auditors error is crashing shock to him see youve got that much charge that much more charge at level iv than we had at level iii because weve got that much more charge we can bypass it more easily and bypassed charge is usually bypassed by session flub its the session flub that will key in the bypassed charge it doesnt create the bypass that was done by technical error but it doesnt some very often doesnt key in until somebodys made session flub so we have at level iv greater opportunity to mine deeper and miss more now at level v we find the pc in very nasty cantankerous mood anyway first place he doesnt like to be run at the idea of total effect he doesnt consider this healthy its not inducive to his fine independence of thought and that hes going around on little post being banged at from all different directions it gets real enough to him after while but he doesnt appreciate it as an activity so you leave one of these ris little bit charged or you havent studied your emeter book at level ii and dont realize that pcs sudden exhalations can cause rocket reads you havent studied body movement effects on the emeter you dont realize that pc shoving his feet about on the floor can give you some very gorgeous rocket reads and some pcs simply by stretching can give you some of the nicest blowdowns you ever wished to see having missed this chapter on the emeter book you let the pc shout the items you see so you get beautiful rocket reads for each one of the items but theyre all remaining there completely charged now the auditor gives sort of halfacknowledgment he falls down on the trs just pinwidth you see he looks differently out of his left eye than his right eye dont you see bang arc break see why the opportunity for an arc break is the bypassed charge its tremendous so any little auditor flub and so forth precipitates it so therefore the ability to handle the basics of auditing becomes very very critical indeed by level v now lets move into level vi well whole implant gpm sequence of twentysix goals twentysix implanted goals would undoubtedly produce less commotion if totally and suddenly keyed in on the pc than one actual ri the amount of charge which youre handling looms like the atlas mountains to the pc one of these items is standing up there in its pristine ferocity ready to swoop and all he does is regard the fact that he is going to list on it and hes got it right in the chops you ask him one of the new auditing questions for level vi it delivers the item something like shooting it out of roman catapult it almost cant cant help but list the right item all the auditor does is ask the question and the item is there because youre dealing with the basic complete pattern of the actual gpm and it has ferocity now im not just talking for advertising purposes you see for three years up to august of 1963 we were insufficiently close to an actual gpm to cause much trouble you could find goal all right you could run oppose on the goal and on one goal i ran seventy items out of the goal and ran it the other day with the actual pattern of the goal with the actual command necessary to run those cases and there wasnt one single ri had been touched it hadnt even been jostled in other words you could run all over the top of the thing and so forth and get lot of charge off and feel fine get rid of your lumbosis and everything was swell of course we didnt have it set enough to put the pc into the middle of it whu thats not the case that actually hasnt been the case since august and thats when you saw close the gate on r6 hastily we were hanging in august between being able to safely run them and to hell with it with the old r3 processes and we were right in the middle we didnt have it sufficiently canned to run them absolutely accurately and we had it sufficiently close to tear the pcs head off now going all the way through and running the actual pattern with the actual commands kabang bang bang you actually can get away perhaps with little more cycle flub than if you were running the notquite correct commands of this middle band which delivered in nothing but arc breaky sessions one right after the other you see because everything just stirred up and bypassed you see but the auditor fails to clear the auditing command with the pc oh my god how stupid years since you cleared the auditing command with the pc as serious operation bang arc break why listing from the incorrect goal as an ri into the next top oppterm and the auditor never occurred to the auditor to say is it all right if i ask you this auditing command see but simply asked it that was enough see because of course it was wrong auditing command because those goals werent adjacent look at the niceties we are now dealing with the auditor doesnt understand what the pc has said and wraps the pc around four telegraph poles because the pc has said second terminal from the bottom and the auditor thought the pc had said fourth terminal from the bottom and the auditor started to repair the fourth terminal from the bottom which was all right yanking the pc two terminals up the chain and producing yoyo effect of the ri the pc was sitting in see auditor failed to understand what the pc said elementary isnt it oh man youre getting down to basics now youre really getting down to basics now you know what these things are all about and as you come up handling each level in turn handling each level and running through that level you tend to get cocky toward the end of the level because your auditing has come up to potential of being able to handle that level so you get up to the next level and you say well my basic auditing is now perfect i am smell like lilies all the time and i improvement possible you know you cant improve perfect work of art and you go up into the next level and with crash you all of sudden find yourself unable to handle the pc and i mean whats all this happening well its simply flaw the undetected flaw in the basic auditing and thats what it is and you can of course to that is added unfamiliarity with the technique unfamiliarity with how pc should act and it all looks very clumsy and youre liable to overlook this little interesting factor is the reason its happening is because new strain has been put on your basic auditing new things are being demanded of your basic auditing so thats why some scientologists think they have to be retrained all the time techniques are advancing their auditing cycle has to advance with it now i invite any one of you particularly when he thinks it on day on day when you feel your auditing is at its absolute lowest ebb see youve practically blown the session youve chopped the pc to ribbons so forth you actually looked at the meter you looked at the meter and you said all right why are you such lousy pc laughter you see i mean youve done your assessment laughter at your very worst at your very worst here at saint hill i wish you could simply transport yourself you will be able to do in not too distant future suddenly and instantly into the beginners classes of an academy somewhere youd start immediately thinking of yourself not as work of art but youd see that they had long way to go so the division of scientology into levels is actually dictated by what is demanded of the pc primarily whats demanded of the pc and almost parallel with that whats demanded of the auditor now you think its divided because its primarily whats demanded of the auditor and secondarily whats demanded of the pc its not quite that way its really whats demanded of the pc and then whats demanded of the auditor actually very educated pc who is fully and thoroughly trained could guide rather lousy auditor over an awful lot of rocks and shoals in r6 and fairly welleducated auditor at level iv can drag pc who is auditing him through lot of muddy water he can suddenly say hey wait minute did you get blowdown on that assessment the auditor says im im sorry i i i dont think i did well i dont think we ought to be running it you getting any tone arm action now well i havent gotten any for little while well all right lets lets look over that assessment list lets look over that assessment list where did the tone arm dip while you were assessing oh that was back there at the beginning of the list well read it over to again and see if you get read there oh yeah all right you got you got some tone arm there oh oh all right all right well lets use that one and the auditor says okay laughter well what do you know see thats your educated pc and i dont know i dont know self auditing selfauditing is absolutely out i just put in series of tests and so forth on this we had to know this point could an individual run out his own actual gpm with onehand electrode could you do this well this is something like tackling lions and tigers barehanded while being painted with bait and i was able to get through i was able to get through one bank before it fell in and you cant do it i dont care if i got through the bank it cant be done why cant it be done because the mechanics of the situation is that an auditor giving himself the auditing command does not produce tone arm action huh huhhuh horrible isnt it so you get down toward the bottom of the bank and youve left every item charged behind you because really none of them blew it takes the impingement of an auditor calling the items to deliver the tone arm action out of the gpm oddly enough you can plot your own goals plots you can plot your own goals plots this is not talk on selfauditing and ill have to give you talk on selfauditing someday its something that everybody says you mustnt do it is usually the upper limits of the thing there is certain amount of selfauditing possible and every auditor does it you burn your finger you stand there and run the incident out or you keep touching the thing you burned your finger on after it cooled down or you give yourself assists and that sort of thing you wonder sometimes what it was that kind of made you creak in the last session then you suddenly remember it was soandso and soandso well what is that thats sort of type of selfauditing isnt it and but selfauditing becomes very interesting as you go up through the levels because theres nobody there but you handling your mind well thats something to think of isnt it thats something to think of thats thats something to know you mean youre going to be out here eighteen lightyears beyond arcturus sitting on satellite enjoying life and comet goes through you or something like this youre going to get session are you youre there holding youre there in charge of your own mind and when you come up to certain level you are less the effect of the mind and are very definitely cause over the mind there is point ive been trying to discover where this point is see at what point does person become total cause over his own mind it occurs somewhere in level vii it doesnt occur early on in level vi but up to that point an auditor is necessary which is the point i am making here you can straighten out an arc breaky session there are things you can do with selfauditing which are quite remarkable youve had an arc breaky session as pc well you can go reeling off and get yourself under control one way or the other and say let see you know maybe i ought to run little ow on the auditor finally you get sensible enough to do something like that what did i do to the auditor and what did i withhold from the oh hell i had withhold thats why im blown up and all of sudden you feel all right see youve spotted the charge or something like that youve puttied yourself back together again to that degree well thats all very well but that is all assisttype approach and youre in perfect order to use assisttype approach on your own mind but what it doesnt do is produce tone arm action it doesnt produce tone arm action thats the only thing about it well why doesnt it produce tone arm action well youre up against magical thing called the two terminal system of this universe and when person is this enmeshed into this universe he is part of the twoterminal system of this universe this is twoterminal universe and because hes up against this twoterminal system one terminal all by itself is inert in this universe and thetan has become sufficiently enmeshed in this universe and has taken sufficiently the universes characteristics as his own that he actually follows to large degree such things as newtons laws the laws of interaction and so forth these things are only applicable to the mind when person himself is pretty confounded mesty but then anybody who is smeared into the universe to this great degree is pretty mesty so hes following the laws of mest to large degree well its utter magic then that the communication cycle does produce tone arm action but that is what produces tone arm action and thats what blows charge and it is charge being released that is the primary source of persons eventual freedom there are two things which hold person down one is significance and the other is mass these are the two things that hold person chained that is why you are in body that is all there is to it really now to mass you of course can add the ramifications of energy and space but the and time and so forth but these things are not of primary consideration you can just say mass the things which give you the psychosomatics you get are mass its the significance that makes you think youre nuts all the think this is from way back there were two effects person either could go sort of screwy mentally or he could go crazy physically this is from 1950 two types of insanity some people seem to be able to throw it into physiological basis and some people threw it into crazy basis and so forth there was lot of discussion of that at that time at level vi this breaks down much more simply there are two things contained in gpm thought and mass there are other things contained in it such as space and energy and that sort of thing but mass disintegrates into energy but it doesnt translate purely into energy you get the right item in the right place in the right gpm and youll get vanishment which is so startling as to leave you blinking for instance here sits mass you get the right item in the right place compared up to the right things in the gpm and its just as magical as that you say where the hell did it go gone here is this towering this huge overwhelming piece of mass which if it hit you in the teeth or got crisscrossed on the track or in juxtaposition with some other item would practically break your neck for you would and youve gotten the right idea in the right mass and you get bong you see there it is there it isnt its just like that bang bang its astonishing so it isnt dissipation even though you get resultant heat from it it isnt dissipation because of course its being created by the unit called thetan and the second he triggers that combination he longer creates it so you dont have the idea of mass dissipating into energy and disappearing you have yes when you contact it theres heat but thats just symptom of contact when you get the idea and its location and arrangements you see with the rest of the gpm you just get nocreate of it anymore and itll go psssswww its its without any pyrotechnics or fireworks dont you see its gone see it is it isnt because youre dealing with the unit of course that is making it when youre dealing with the pc all right lets lets look at this lets look at this theres thought or significance and theres mass and these are the two dominant phenomena in the mind now you can change thought change thought change thought but you might not make anybody well because his illness is being occasioned by the mass now each gpm is surrounded by so many ramifications and locks so many things are hung up on these things theres such an endless parade of things that you actually come out through all of your levels and the levels are really just touching them going little deeper into the locks swinging little deeper in with prepchecks going little deeper with running service facsimiles and then running off implants at level v that surround it and then at level vi just crashing in on the middle of the thing and tearing it up and throwing it away person by the way hasnt dogs chance of getting to the actual gpm successfully and continuously through all of that overburden unless he has to some degree progressed up through the levels he just hasnt got dogs chance in the first place he has insufficient mental stamina he understands too little of his mind he gets too worried too upset too concerned about the various things happening furthermore he gets an all of sudden his chest caves in something goes little bit wrong and his chest caves in oh my god if you were to take some man up here on the street and hes walking along and all of sudden his chest caves in augh same velocity as though hed just been hit with cannonball you see blaugh well man hed be up here to the doctors insisting they operate and take xrays and hed worry and hed sit home and hed gloom and hed what is it and hed be very upset about it all and he would be unable to eat or sleep or anything else because of this very peculiar thing thats happened to him for instance i know of girl scientologist now but i knew her long time ago and she sat in the house for several years because shed walked into an office one day and found terrific mass of energy suddenly settle over her head and down around her body with sudden thud she just sat down in this office and there was all of sudden this terrific mass of energy hit her from all sides and it frightened her so that she went home and didnt go out of the house for seven years you going to youre going to run this character huh oddly enough somebody ran her ran out an engram straightened her up little bit she got outside and she got along on early days but what was that that was an ri maybe only lock on an ri but thats what hit her and it worried her to that extent that it immobilized her in life she quit doing everything she was doing everything else all right so fellow has to become kind of accustomed to living with the tiger dont you see and you take scientologist whos been processed quite bit hes talking to another scientologist i got an awful somatic hell say the other fellow will say yeah where oh i side well lets go have lunch ive seen ive seen medical doctor ive seen medical doctor go ohhh augh augh put him in bed put him in bed look at him look at him you know absolute hysterics im not exaggerating it bit in fact it was worse guy was running session and he turned on some heat i never saw such an hysterical response in my life fascinating in other words in other words one has to become to some degree familiar with whats going on in the mind or in life or and so forth before one can handle it to some degree and the levels are subject of familiarization with what can knock your ead off you learn how to handle these things you get little bit of cause over these things you learn to grapple with these things well youve graduated upstairs and it doesnt scare you out of seven years growth when all of sudden you feel your whole body wrapped around with glowing redhot energy that is liable to melt you to the bone any second and you go on listing and then you say to the auditor i think weve overlisted here thats my item nothing to it you see compare this type of poise and response in the auditing chair to the girl who had to go home and stay in the house for seven years because she suddenly felt little energy touch her from all sides get the idea thats why the levels exist as levels well whats all this got to do with selfcriticism well it has this to do with selfcriticism is selfcriticism is based on the same auditing cycle all the way its the same cycle i dont care whether the person doesnt know it at level 0 knows it only slightly at level i or is using it at level vi it is still the same auditing cycle and it must exist as an auditing cycle because this is twopole universe and without an auditor you dont get tone arm action adequate to case resolution that is all there is to it you can look on it as the auditing cycle is totally magical if you want to and it sure looks magical but it is the basic discovery of dianetics and scientology is the auditing cycle and all by itself it does things to people in comm courses do birds fly do birds fly do birds fly and all of sudden the guys got one less somatic or something or hes got three new ones but thats the auditing cycle at work and you should recognize the auditing cycle as fundamental as an extremely fundamental part of your auditing tools and recognize that it is all right to use perfectly sloppy auditing cycle at level i remember its got to be less sloppy at level ii and its got to be less sloppy and more neat at level iii and its got to be far more neat and expert at level iv and its got to be great deal more expert at level v and its got to be smooth as glass at vi its the degree of charge that can be bypassed its the depth that youre looking into the case but its the same auditing cycle and that auditing cycle is with you all the way from level 0 to level vii and only ceases to be necessary somewhere in level vii still necessary in level vi youve you get so that you can juggle gpms around little bit and you can list up your goals plot and you can do this and you can do that and pretty soon youre sitting there looking at the meter and you realize that tone arm has had 25 bd in the last fifteen minutes that youve been sitting there with onehand electrode plotting goals see ohohohohoh oh oh oh oh that is not enough tone arm action to care for the amount of charge you are restimulating so whats that meter going to do very shortly it is going to pack up its going to send that tone arm up to about 525 and its going to lock up that needle very nicely and its going to leave you with some horrible crushing somatic some way or another and yet you actually had progressed up through the levels to point where you were actually able to lay out and get accurately which goal followed which goal with onehand electrode on meter see even though youd progressed to that extent the auditing cycle was necessary because youre still in twopole circumstance to the rest of the universe if you havent got an auditor you dont get tone arm action every once in while you hear of somebody plotting his goals out or something like that well dont blow your brains out say fine fine good good better get an auditor thats thats the the way you find somebody trying to selfaudit implant gpms you know well id wait till i was well above level v before i attempted that i wouldnt attempt it from level ii or something but you get at level vi you should be able by that time to be sufficiently competent with regard to this sort of thing to lets see i wonder if that i wonder if thats an implant gpm that i dont know i dont know joe found this gpm i dont know whether it was really an implant gpm or not im not im not satisfied 100 percent you could pick up meter and you could say nix absoluteably spit rocket reads its an implant gpm skip it you say what wild abandon actually if you were to take some pc as he started in on level v and say to him nix absoluteably spit you know this actually is not even the top of the implant dont you see youve just slammed him one down hed go creak creak ow ow whats this brrrr im cold as ice he would be too you get the idea familiarity familiarity is operating here youre not afraid of the tiger youve had several tigers eat out of your hand you walk up to the edge of the jungle and you say whsst hey come here puss in your first approach to the beginning of level v you crept up with whole safari full of howdahs three elephant guns handy you heard monkey cough and knew it was tiger and turned loose with howitzers difference of level of familiarity difference of charge handleable but how did you get up to that point actually its discharged charge not only must you get the familiarization as an idea but you must also discharge charge if you havent got lot of charge off your case you cant do anything with it its like trying to batter through bulletproof armorplated walls you cant get any answers you take somebody with charge off you might be lucky and find an actual gpm on him but if you tried to move the gpms around so that you could find an actual gpms gluuuh theyd think they were being attacked by an army it would be too frightening to them now whats the whats the final whats the final word here on selfcriticism well it selfcriticism must be that the auditors auditing must be adequate to the level he is running his handling of the auditing cycle is the only thing which is delivering tone arm action into the session and i know we say its process i know we say its this i know we say its that i know we say its the other thing but it isnt go back to what i told you its twopole system selfauditing would be perfectly feasible if it delivered tone arm action and it doesnt run an actual gpm on yourself get two tone arm divisions of charge off in twenty items you know whats available on an actual gpm hundred and seventy five ta divisions down therefore youve stirred up and left on the case hundred and seventythree ta divisions down gluuuu youll feel like it too all right an auditor sits there and he audits an im regular actual gpm and he gets the hundred and seventyfive divisions why because hes an auditor sitting there thats the magic of the auditor is the two pole nature of the situation the auditors auditing we get tone arm action by the simple fact of his being there and following the communication cycle in the necessary in the session and that gives us tone arm action so if an auditor well regardless of technique or any of these other considerations if an auditors sitting there auditing his handling of the communication cycle with the pc must be adequate to that level so that it doesnt interfere with the auditing but produces tone arm action now this doesnt say that the fellow at level iii has to be as expert as hell have to be at level vi but it says he has to be expert enough to handle level iii but its all the same cycle in back of all auditing we have that very interesting discovery and it is basic discovery i made many many years ago and this brought about the development of trs and other things but remember it is peculiarly native and original thing to dianetics and scientology its only in scientology see that one thing and thats peculiar to it it is an understanding of this thing that permits cases to get better its very important bit of stuff but because it sounds so this or so that or some other thing well you have tendency to overcomplicate it for the level youre running how complicated do you think my auditing cycle would be to mary jo ann who has just walked in from the poughkeepsie coaudit and im going to give her an assist how adequate do you think that auditing cycles going to have to be first place she isnt going to hear any much in the first place shes not going to be able to pay much attention to what im saying anyway ill tell you what has to be adequate is your tr 2 you can produce more magic with tr 2 than you ever saw thats very very magical wouldnt matter how long you carried on or what you said or what form your response took if you could bring home to her that somebody had heard her and that she had been acknowledged for it if you could bring home this one fact you would probably get big send on her case see why your auditing cycle could be pretty crude and you could get away with it but that would be level to think reason to think that you were now the worlds greatest geewhizzer on the subject of the auditing cycle now lets move on up through the line lets get little bit later lets move on up the scale and lets take some selfsatisfied totally successful neverhadanythingreallyroughhappeninanyofhiscases auditor and we say we is grooming you up and we want you to run service facsimiles well i dont know that ive ever run any service facsimiles but i can handle this hahahaha arc breaky pc what what the hell obviously cant be his auditing cycle because thats always been perfect that has never been left wanting ah but it is it is because the auditing cycle which is being demanded of him at this particular level of penetration into the case is very senior to what has been demanded of him before and he doesnt see it as necessity to change or smooth out his auditing cycle i myself have fallen into the trap so were all talking here together with our hair down i found out when i started to audit level vi i was getting dirty needles on pc and i said well this pc so and so and so wha wha just like you do you know laughter and the pc pcs this the pcs that and so forth the pc would just get enough rest you know pc would just get enough rest why be all right and we wouldnt have all these upsets in session after 130 at in the afternoon the pcs tone arm gets sticky smell what corn the this pc is always sleepy after dinner and never gets good tone arm action after dinner in the evening and thats why im not getting good tone arm action on the pc because the pc is the pc is the pc is the pc is the pcs house is not in sufficient juxtaposition to the current position of the sun and saturn is out of nodule phase to mars so therefore were having arc breaky sessions you get the idea well the funny part of it is completely aside from everything that i have given you as the reason why this gets overlooked and the reason why its important theres another fact the auditors error is always prior to the rough part of session and therefore the error being at the time it is at is not therefore easily discernible as having come from the auditors action in other words its after the fact the pcs roughness is after the fact of the error sufficiently that the auditor cant spot it easily and you get in this selfcriticism some of the most remarkable things but selfcriticism should be run in this particular fashion well get down to cases now an auditor should sit up set up session and run routine session with microphone on the desk and the session being recorded preferably preferably very normal session not stunt session just to do this but one of his regular sessions and he ought to have couple of hours of tape or at least an hour and half of tape to run off three and threequarters speed and so forth and the pcs voice particularly discernible and the auditors voice particularly discernible on the tape and you should always put microphone little bit closer to the pc than the auditor ordinarily all right the session goes forward the auditor carefully notes in running whatever hes running any rough moment in the session he notes it on his auditor report he makes note of it or he notices any dirty needle or any sticky ta any other significant you might call bad indicator which occurs in the session any natteriness by the pc any point of criticism any point of hecticness or anxiety on the part of the pc any worry any appearance of ptp on the part of the pc he should note all of those things on his auditors report as they happen quite honestly just going on auditing not because hes taping it withdrawing everything that he can withdraw from the auditing session because it might get on the tape just go on and audit normally and make an honest record of everything thats happening in the session now that record that record has level of importance which is quite remarkable see the session is on the tape but remember what isnt on that tape is visual observation of the pc visual observation of the meter behavior visual observation of the tone arm those things are not on that tape so therefore you make very good record of that on your report and having brought the session to successful or unsuccessful close you let the pc pack it up and it is now between you and the tape and your auditors report and you dont give history of the session we do not care what was run in the session and the reason we dont care is weve got lots of processes but we have very few good auditors now listen lets take this tape and just leave it there as unit but with some idea of its time of run you started the tape at 102 therefore the first moment on that tape is 102 isnt it lets look down here and we see we had dirty needle at 116 actually you can figure this out its so many feet of tape per minute but you see what was happening in that session you run off about sixteen minutes worth of that tape dont you see you get lets pick up that point on the tape were not interested in the auditor listening for one minute to his session consecutively from beginning to end scrub it who cares we want him to find these points but we just want him to find some points on this tape so were going to run off sixteen minutes or fourteen minutes of that tape and were going to get this point when the pc was talking about yipsnoo as of 116 and now were going to go backwards in the session few inches at time until we find the breakdown of the basic auditing that caused it because the auditor is never aware of it until he hears it on the tape youre going back there minute thirty seconds minute two minutes three minutes five minutes and you will find it you will find it it is what the auditor failed to carry out in his communication cycle and you listen back there and you will find the auditor gave an auditing command wrong way to and upside down hes been saying do fish swim he all of sudden actually said this would be pretty corny he said do fish float see this is awful corny well find the mistake so lets take this report now and on tape what caused it see what what caused it lets write that on the report what point in the tape caused it see now lets take another one of these points see lets take another one of these points pc toward the end of the session all of sudden said but i didnt say soandso and soandso well this is an interesting you know the pcs being disputive there something about goals auditor says to himself well obviously he didnt make his goals nope damn see lets forget about the figurefigure see lets forget about all this figurefigure the only reason that pc snapped or snarled in any way at all about his goals or had present time problem was the auditor did something minute two minutes three minutes before that point you understand this really makes citizen out of you man wow this is rough on you and you take hold of it and you say aha there was snappy moment there just at the beginning of the goals pc pc anxious about goals see or whatever we put down on the report lets find that point now lets roll it back lets roll it back on the tape and listen forward and roll it back boy youre going to find piece of corn and youre going to say did i do that because ordinarily when you did it you thought you got away with it but it took it little while to show up and it will always show up and if you do it this way you pick up the bad indicator and then roll your tape to the point of the bad indicator and then roll it back and listen to it to the point you will find the breakdown in the auditing cycle and were only studying the auditing cycle were studying the auditors delivery of the command the pcs receiving the command the pcs answering it and the auditor acknowledging it dont you see were only studying that pc originates the auditor understands it and acknowledges dont you see we were thats all were studying were just studying actually the basic trs 0 1 2 3 4 thats all were studying how where where did one of those break down that caused the pc reaction and this becomes the wildest thing you ever wanted to see you wont believe it until you yourself have done it with your own auditing or have done it on some other auditors you wont believe it pc never has any independent reaction in session independent of the auditor never thats the wildest thing you ever wanted to see listen pc can be sitting there on the bypassed charge of wrong goals and wrong items and everything upside down and audit smooth as baby carriage arc break going on reasonably talking to the auditor everything pleasant feeling sick but everythings pleasant aaahh nothing wrong with the needle tone arm running okay everything fine all the good indicators pcs cheerful little sick at his stomach but hes cheerful and youre going to find something youre going to find that the pc never causes confounded thing in the session and the pcs environment never causes confounded thing in the session and this is shock theres only one thing that causes anything in session and thats the auditor and this is not an exaggerated viewpoint that im trying to give you to persuade you to be all of you perfect auditors i dont care if youre not perfect auditors trying to make perfect auditors out of you im trying to make effective auditors out of you and youre in for shock if you follow that selfcriticism through you will find out that theres only one source of session and that is the auditor and it has nothing to do with the moon was in saturn it had nothing to do with the pc not eating supper right it had nothing to do with the lateness of the hour it had nothing to do with how the bank had been sloshed up by joe blow another auditor that pc behaves exactly in response to the auditing he is receiving now so he comes into session hes got present time problem body hasnt had any supper well there isnt any reason why this should be handled in any other way than perfectly cheerful way with all the good indicators in and he handles the present time problem thats great thats what auditings for the personal problems pc so hes just been jilted by his girl or something of the sort so hes been jilted so what he might cry for little while but if he isnt consistently getting better emotional reaction straight on up through to fairly high tone as he comes through that session well of course you can say the right process isnt being audited on him but lets leave the right process out of it hes the wrong process is really not going to make him misemotional it would be insistence on running the wrong process without getting it cleared and okayed with the pc that would make him emotional isnt it its not accepting the pcs answer i dont understand the process and i havent got any answers to it and you say well im going to ask it again here youre going to have mess on your hands man because you havent got an auditing cycle where you dont have an auditing cycle you havent got session and where you have pc that isnt sitting there with all indicators in and the tone arm flying then the auditor thinks its because the sun is not properly arranged in the house of leo that the session is going wrong this is effort on my part to suddenly bring it home and put it in your lap im telling you about technical technical discovery i know when i graduated up in levels i found that my auditing cycle had to be improved and therefore this gives the courage to tell you that as youre graduating up in levels i think your auditing cycle could be improved but i think it is one of the most astonishing experiences an auditor can have to do selfcriticism on piece of tape against timed session of an ordinary kind its one of the most startling experiences he can have and after hes done it bit maybe two or three times something like that he may not have to do it two or three times he knows now why and he doesnt go looking for the lateness of the hour he flubs an acknowledgment he knows what is going to happen nooowwww so he probably puts it right before it has chance to happen and it is quite an experience its quite an experience and ive had the experience and it was great shock to i used to be able to believe that it had something to do with the lateness of the hour when somebody told that their pc was restive every evening i used to believe these things i dont believe them anymore because i know my pcs arent reacting that way theyre reacting very precisely and exactly against the communication cycle of the auditor and theyre not exacting acting against any other slightest thing under the sun moon and the stars thats what theyre reacting to and thats all theyre reacting to and youre as good an auditor as you can handle the communication cycle youre as skilled an auditor as you can choose processes to throw onto that communication cycle line and when youve said those things youve actually said it all so thank you very much good night
