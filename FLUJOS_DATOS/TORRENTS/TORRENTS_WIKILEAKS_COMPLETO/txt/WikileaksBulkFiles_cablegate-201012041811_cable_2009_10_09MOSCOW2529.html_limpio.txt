political minister counselor susan elliott for reasons 14 b d 1 c summary during consultations with gor officials on september 30 assistant secretary of defense asd for international security affairs alexander vershbow discussed ways to implement bilateral cooperation in number of key areas of mutual interest both sides praised progress since the reset in usrussian relations during the first obamamedvedev meetings though both agreed that concrete actions are necessary to realize true cooperation asd vershbow emphasized that the reset needs to be reciprocal and noted that iran would be critical test case both sides expressed interest in further cooperation on afghanistan especially in the sphere of counternarcotics while the administrations missile defense announcement has met with generally positive reaction in the russian media duma and security council representatives made clear they had questions about the later phases of the new us plan and questioned whether the us would be prepared for cooperation going beyond information exchange russian interlocutors acknowledged the dangers posed by irans nuclear program but stressed moscows skepticism about sanctions throughout the meetings asd vershbow emphasized that russias efforts to assert regional sphere of influence posed threat to the reset in bilateral relations and reiterated the us commitment to the sovereignty independence and territorial integrity of georgia ukraine and other partners in the region end summary 2 c overview of meetings asd vershbow met with the following gor officials viktor mikhaylovich zavarzin defense committee chairman of the state duma aleksandr gorbunov chief of the main directorate for international military cooperation of the ministry of defense general yuriy nikolayevich baluyevskiy deputy secretary of the security council and former chief of defense aleksey nikolayevich borodavkin deputy minister of foreign affairs and grigoriy borisovich karasin first deputy minister of foreign affairs and state secretary he also met informally with academic experts and pundits and gave an interview to interfax usrussian cooperation words are not enough 3 c at all meetings asd vershbow and his russian interlocutors noted that usrussia relations since the reset have been moving in the right direction with opportunities for increased bilateral cooperation in areas of mutual interest the bilateral presidential commission and associated working groups will be useful to inject momentum into our work however asd vershbow stressed that words alone or mere information exchanges are not enough and the reset must be reciprocal both sides need to take action to implement agreements already concluded and to pave the way for additional areas of work and to identify concrete projects for cooperation mechanisms for enabling these efforts need to be established eg the ministry of defense is currently undergoing major organizational reform which has hampered efforts for implementing the previously approved 2009 militarytomilitary work plan and both sides need to ensure that planned events are conducted 4 c asd vershbow agreed that next steps must be taken in other areas where we have agreed to cooperate previously eg implementing ballistic missile joint threat assessment joint data exchange center and the lethal transit overflight in support of efforts in afghanistan that was agreed to at the july summit the us and russia must be united in addressing common threats such as the nuclear and ballistic missile programs of iran and north korea 5 c during his meeting with mod international military cooperation chief gorbunov asd vershbow emphasized that transparency should be major aspect of cooperation vershbow observed that dod has been very open with the russians about sensitive issues for example dod has shared information about efforts to help prepare georgian troops for deployment to afghanistan in support of isaf efforts however the russians have not reciprocated in this vein eg their zapad 2009 and ladoga exercises 6 c both duma defense committee chair zavarzin and security council deputy secretary baluyevskiy stressed that they are ready to work on all areas of mutual interest on the bilateral cooperation iran afghanistan missile defense militarydefense cooperation condition that russias voice be heard in particular zavarzin cited the natorussia permanent joint council 19972002 in which russia claims its views were ignored the natorussia council the pjcs successor in which russia still did not have full say and russias interest in working on antimissile defense since 2000 which did not pan out asd vershbow acknowledged that both nato and russia bore responsibility for areas where cooperation was not successful but suggested that we need to look ahead rather than debate the past russian defense ministry reform poses challenges to miltomil cooperation 7 c the russian ministry of defense mod is in the midst of major reform international military cooperation chief gorbunov described the main goal of the reform as the creation of the most effective military force in the world despite existing limitations eg demographics large landmass and borders resources and various threats along the borders he identified two distinct processes as part of the reform building of the armed forces and control of the forces today russia is focusing on building the forces including large influx of civilian personnel in management and specialist roles improving paybenefits of service members improving quality of equipment and trying to change decisionmaking processes at all levels gorbunov emphasized that these changes are intended to make russia strong competitor but also reliable partner 8 c gorbunov explained that the reform process is having significant impact on the main directorate for international military cooperation gumvs at the mod the foreign liaison directorate uvs is being closed on october 1 and new international liaison directorate is being created because of these changes correspondence will be slow over the next six weeks or so which will impact the attache corps in moscow gorbunov offered his personal assistance during this period 9 c asd vershbow raised the bilateral defense consultations bdc which the us had proposed for november and suggested the possibility of broader dialogue between the mod and dod on policy and strategy issues to complement statemfa exchanges vershbow explained that dods proposed bdc topics including confidencebuilding measures and transparency risk reduction and notification procedures expanded military technical cooperation etc were carefully considered but we welcomed russias suggestions for additional topics gorbunov responded that the mod agrees with the general notion of the bdc but stipulated that the general staff needs to identify the right experts to address topics to be discussed and they plan to propose other topics for consideration he gave indication as to when response would be provided afghanistan narcotrafficking terrorism illicit finance 10 c asd vershbows meetings with deputy foreign minister borodavkin and mod international cooperation chief gorbunov particularly focused on afghanistan borodavkin mentioned that russia views afghanistan not only as threat but as an opportunity for cooperation with the us and other countries eg nato and suggested that isaf could play an important role in fighting illegal drug trafficking he recalled that the us and nato had participated in the march 2009 conference held in moscow at which counternarcotics was top priority 11 c when asked by borodavkin about whether more us troops will be sent to afghanistan asd vershbow explained that general mcchrystals assessment is being reviewed at the highest levels he noted that while the situation in afghanistan has not gone as well as hoped over the past six months the us cannot allow the taliban to regain control expansion and training of the afghan national security forces ansf improving governance and economic assistance are all still essential components of the us strategy in afghanistan and we will continue to seek cooperation in these areas 12 c borodavkin introduced number of proposals for increased russian contribution he said that russia would like to launch cooperation with the us on the economic rehabilitation of afghanistan and referred to clause in the july summit joint statement that without economic improvement terrorism and other threats cannot be eliminated borodavkin suggested tripartite cooperation russiausafghanistan to reconstruct the sovietera salang tunnel to provide much needed reliable transportation route the russians have already undertaken technical study on this project and borodavkin said that with adequate resources it would be useful cooperative effort note borodavkins staff confirmed that the mfa has submitted proposal to the state department on the salang tunnel 13 c russia considers narcotrafficking to be its highest priority visavis afghanistan borodavkin said russia is ready to help the afghan national police anp and interior ministry in these efforts he noted that russia is already providing counternarcotics training to the afghans at the domodedovo center and mentioned russian counternarcotics chief ivanovs statement that he is ready to provide increased assistance on bilateral and multilateral levels such as nato and the osce both borodovkin and vershbow agreed that while the us and russia are currently working together on this and the related issue of threat financing through the bilateral presidential commission we need to address these problems more forcefully illicit financing has been raised at shanghai cooperation organization sco and osce meetings offering one area of possible cooperation 14 c at his meetings at the mod and mfa asd vershbow expressed appreciation for russias expression of interest in providing weapons and equipment to the ansf and requested that any such help be made in the form of donations with fees attached as those charges would have to be paid for by the us he underscored that some of the equipmentweapon donation requests provided to russia are intended to support counternarcotics efforts so the us hopes russia will be able to provide this support asd vershbow also asked that russia work with the combined security transition command afghanistan cstca to ensure that ansf priority requirements are met and provided list of requirements 15 c borodavkin said that russia will be able to supply limited numbers of weapons to the anp as aid and will consider selling more weapons to the anp and the afghan national army ana he also expressed concern that there are unlicensed counterfeit russian weapons on the market which are of inferior quality gorbunov explained that donating equipment and weapons to afghanistan is presidential decision which would entail president medvedev asking the military services to donate items from current stocks 16 c borodavkin also asked asd vershbows perspectives on the european proposal for conference on afghanistan after the new afghan government is established asd vershbow said the us saw merit in this idea as means of seeking additional international support for afghanistan but noted that the timing of the initiative will depend on afghanistans domestic politics given the problems with the presidential elections conditions were not yet right 17 c borodavkin mentioned the work of the afghanistan subworking group under the bilateral presidential commission and stated that the foreign ministry is hoping that amb holbrooke can reschedule his planned visit to moscow borodavkin requested that asd vershbow pass on the invitation to amb holbrooke 18 c asd vershbow also raised the lethal transit agreement signed at the july summit in his meetings with gorbunov borodavkin and zavarzin he underscored the importance of timely duma decision now that the general authorization has been delivered asd vershbow expressed hopes that the inaugural flight of the agreement could take place prior to secretary of state clintons visit to moscow on october 1214 zavarzin thought the duma would approve the agreement without any problem borodavkin confirmed that the ministry of foreign affairs is working on the request but warned that they do not have the sole voice on this matter missile defense decision neither concession nor threat to russia 19 c asd vershbow discussed the recent us missile defense decision during each of his consultations in his meeting with duma defense committee chairman zavarzin asd vershbow observed that the russian press may have been overly positive in its assessment of the september 17 announcement focusing on the cancellation of the program of record rather than the new md architecture while the new phased adaptive approach to md does not pose threat to russia there will likely continue to be missile defense elements in centraleastern europe with an sm3 site in poland if the government of poland agrees however the physical characteristics of the new system are different from the old and the us believes russia has basis for concern that the system could threaten its strategic forces the new architecture will be more effective and be able to provide protection to vulnerable parts of europe more quickly vershbow emphasized that the us intends to be open about the new architecture citing information available through congressional testimony and other open sources the us aim is to make this project for nato because the system is designed to protect all of natos territory starting in southeastern europe where the current threat is but eventually covering all of nato 20 c asd vershbow affirmed the us also views missile defense as an opportunity for cooperation with russia against common threat noting secretary of defense gates support for cooperation on missile defense vershbow emphasized to zavarzin and security council deputy secretary baluyevskiy that we should begin by implementing the joint data exchange center jdec on which the russians had postponed decision until after the us missile defense announcement vershbow told zavarzin and baluyevskiy that linking radars could follow which could then lead to broader areas of cooperation that could be implemented either bilaterally or within the natorussia council nrc framework he suggested that us and russian experts explore concrete ways to implement military technical cooperation noting that such cooperation would be mutually beneficial and would send strong signal to iran that could help in resolving the nuclear issue 21 c zavarzin acknowledged that the russian political elite has illusions about missile defense and understands this was us decision with quid pro quo expected from russia security council deputy secretary baluyevskiy noted that the systems planned capability to intercept icbms does raise some of the same concerns russia has had before zavarzin agreed that we need to identify specific projects to work on together but that russia wants to ensure its voice will be heard both zavarzin and baluyevskiy stressed the need to develop bilateral cooperation methods potentially by linking existing us and russian early warning systems to gather and share information about threats they also asked whether the us was prepared to go even farther to include joint technology projects which would of greater interest to russia than information exchange usrussian unity on iran 22 c asd vershbow discussed the serious test that irans nuclear program will pose to both russia and the us in the coming months noting that our interests coincide in many ways even if they are not identical the us he stated wants to see if diplomacy can succeed but we need to be realistic and be prepared for tougher measures if diplomacy fails citing the recently exposed covert nuclear facility and the recent missile tests vershbow described the situation as urgent and said that the us was encouraged by president medvedevs recent comment that sanctions might become necessary 23 c asd vershbow mentioned that the islamic world is very concerned about irans nuclear program eg several of its arab neighbors have asked the us for patriot missiles and other measures to protect them against iranian attack the ability of the us and russia to work together on the iran challenge over the next few months will be just as important as our work on missile defense will be over the next few years asd vershbow stressed that if we fail to stop irans pursuit of nuclear weapons we could have volatile possibly explosive situation in the middle east 24 c in their respective meetings duma defense committee chairman zavarzin and security council deputy secretary baluyevskiy agreed that iran is concern but said that russia continues to work closely with them and that sanctions cannot be pursued until after diplomatic efforts have been made deputy foreign minister borodavkin expressed concern that sanctions could be ineffective citing past experience in iraq and could have negative impact on the wider islamic world russias sphere of privileged interest 25 c asd vershbow stated in several meetings that our interaction in the postsoviet space continues to be sensitive issue and if not handled carefully could undermine recent gains in bilateral relations in this regard president medvedevs proposed amendment to the law on use of russian forces overseas has raised many questions duma defense committee chairman zavarzin said that russia will not interfere with the us as it engages with nations in the region and that there is cause for concern regarding the legislation about use of russian forces it is intended to protect russian citizens living in those countries and that other countries have similar provisions 26 c ukraine asd vershbow spoke of his visit to ukraine immediately preceding his arrival in moscow and cited ukrainian concerns about russian respect for ukraines sovereignty and borders vershbow stated that the us continues to support the 1994 budapest memorandum on security assurances and ukraines freedom to choose its security relationships and encourages russia to reaffirm its adherence as well he suggested that president medvedevs open letter to ukraine had been counterproductive the us favors close and mutually beneficial russianukrainian relations this is not zerosum game 27 c deputy foreign minister karasin said that ukraine is russias closest neighbor and is key partner in international activities russia is not trying to influence ukraine but wants stable ukraine and secure neighborhood he also said that russia cannot ignore attempts to depict it as major threat to ukraine foreign minister lavrov will be visiting ukraine this week to meet with ukrainian acting foreign minister khandogiy and there even is possibility that medvedev and ukrainian president yushchenko will meet at summit of cis countries shortly after that karasin said that russia wants to deal with ukraine in normal way and that ukrainian citizens are the ones to decide what they want 28 c georgia security council deputy secretary baluyevskiy zavarzin and karasin asked why the us is providing military assistance to georgia when it threatens stability in the caucasus region this causes concern and russia cannot allow renewed aggression against abkhazia and south ossetia asd vershbow explained that as matter of principle the us will help georgia protect its sovereignty and independence but stated that the us is not rearming georgia as russia has repeatedly alleged since the august 2008 war there has been us lethal assistance to georgia dod funds were transferred to the state department for humanitarian purposes in the short term the us is proceeding with great care and focusing on training education and helping prepare georgia to participate in afghanistan under the command of us forces at the same time georgia is sovereign state with the right to selfdefense we do not accept any arms embargo and we may provide weapons to georgia in the future 29 c zavarzin made point of saying that russia does not dispute georgias sovereignty but it cannot allow new acts of aggression regional consensus is necessary karasin said that in russias view the current georgian leadership is irresponsible asd vershbow reiterated that the us had made clear to georgia that there is military option regarding abkhazia and south ossetia and that the georgians need to take long view on reintegration of the territories karasin noted some successes in repairing relations since last august including the geneva talks that enable the georgians to talk directly to the abkhaz and ossetians vershbow said that stability in the caucasus and creating conditions to help improve georgianrussian relations is very important to the us 30 c karasin mentioned the eu independent report on the august 2008 conflict in georgia which had just been released on the afternoon of september 30 asd vershbow mentioned that he looked forward to reading the report and stressed that even if we do not agree completely on the reports findings we need to look ahead and promote stability in the region including an international presence in the territories karasin said that international presence in abkhazia and south ossetia must be discussed with the abkhaz and the ossetians not the russians russia has bilateral agreements with them and russian border guards are protecting them to help restore stability 31 c karasin asked whether the us intends to establish military presence in georgia by contributing personnel to the eu monitoring mission eumm this would be serious problem for russia as they believe it would send the wrong message to president saakashvili that he could use force again asd vershbow said there has been lots of speculation on this subject that was not based on fact if the eumm did make such request in the future the us would consider it but this would likely involve civilian monitors vershbow added that russia needs to fully withdraw its forces from positions beyond the line of the outbreak of hostility per the medvedevsarkozy agreement since this noncompliance was continuing source of tension karasin insisted that russia was in compliance while acknowledging that the us does not see it that way other issues 32 c european security treaty in response to baluyevskiys inquiry about president medvedevs proposed european security treaty asd vershbow acknowledged there could be ways to improve the effectiveness of existing conflictprevention mechanisms but that the us and most of our allies did not see need for new structures or new treaty however the us is ready to engage with russia on this issue in the corfu process and other fora 33 c central asia karasin inquired about the manas transit center and the numbers of us military personnel that would be deployed under the new arrangement asd vershbow said that he did not have precise figures however in contrast with the previous agreement security for the facility is now being provided by the kyrgyz which reduced the us presence somewhat 34 u asd vershbow has cleared this cable
