united states foreign intelligence surveillance court honorable reggie b walton presiding judge honorable patrick j leahy chairman committee on the judiciary united states senate washington dc 20510 dear mr chairman washington dc july 29 2013 i am writing in response to your letter of july 18 2013 in which you posed several questions about the operations of the foreign intelligence surveillance court the court as you requested we are providing unclassified responses we would note that as general matter the courts practices have evolved over time various developments in the last several years including statutory changes changes in the size of the court and its staff the adoption of new rules of procedure in 2010 and the relocation ofthe courts facilities from the department of justice headquarters to secure space in the federal courthouse in 2009have affected some of these practices the responses below reflect the current practices of the court i describe the typical process that the court follows when it considers the following i an applicationor an order for electronic surveillance under title i of fisa 2 an application for an order for access to business records under title v of fisa and 3 submissions from the government under section 702 of fisa as to applications for orders for access to business records under title v of fisa please describe whether the process for the courts consideration of such applications is different when considering requests for bulk collection of phone call metadata records as recently declassified by the director of national intelligence each week one of the eleven district court judges who comprise the court is on duty in washington as discussed below most of the courts work is handled by the duty judge with the assistance of attorneys and clerks office personnel who staff the court some of the courts more complex or timeconsuming matters are handled by judges outside of the dutyweek system at the discretion of the presiding judge in either case matters before the court are thoroughly reviewed and analyzed by the court rule 9a of the united states foreign intelligence surveillance court rules ofprocedure honorable patrick j leahy july 29 2013 page 2 fisc rules ofprocedure1 requires that except in certain circumstances ie submission pursuant to an emergency authorization under the statute or as otherwise permitted by the court proposed application must be submitted by the government later than seven days before the government seeks to have the matter entertained2 upon the courts receipt of proposed application for an order under fisa member of the courts legal staff reviews the application and evaluates whether it meets the legal requirements under the statute as part of this evaluation court attorney will often have one or more telephone conversations with the governmene to seek additional information andor raise concerns about the application court attorney then prepares written analysis of the application for the duty judge which includes an identification of any weaknesses flaws or other concerns for example the attorney may recommend that the judge consider requiring the addition of information to the application imposing special reporting requirements4 or shortening the requested duration of an authorization the judge then reviews the proposed application as well as the attorneys written analysis5 the judge typically makes preliminary determination at that time about what course 1 copy of the fisc rules of procedure is appended hereto as attachment the rules are also available at httpwww uscourtsgov uscourtsrulesfisc20 i 0 pdf 2 proposed application is also sometimes referred to as read copy and has been referred to in this manner in at least one recent congressional hearing proposed application or read copy is nearfinal version of the governments application which does not include the signatures of executive branch officials required by statutory provisions such as 50 usc 1804a6 and 1823a6 as described below in most circumstances the government will subsequently file final copy of an application pursuant to rule 9b ofthe fisc rules of procedure both the proposed and final applications include proposed orders the process of using proposed applications and final applications is altogether similar to the process employed by other federal courts in considering applications for wiretap orders under title ill of the omnibus crime control and safe streets act of 1968 as amended title ill which is codified at 18 usc 25102522 3 in discussing court interactions with the government throughout this document i am referring to interactions with attorneys in the office oflntelligence of the national security division of the united states department of justice 4 pursuant to 50 usc 1805d3 and 1824d3 the court is authorized to assess compliance with the statutorilyrequired minimization procedures by reviewing the circumstances under which information concerning united states persons was acquired retained or disseminated 5 for each application the court retains the attorneys written analysis and the notes made by the judge so that if the government later seeks to renew the authorization the judge who considers the next honorable patrick j leahy july 29 2013 page 3 of action to take these courses of action might include indicating to court staff that he or she is prepared to approve the application without hearing indicating an inclination to impose conditions on the approval of the application determining that additional information is needed about the application or determining that hearing would be appropriate before deciding whether to grant the application staff attorney will then relay the judges inclination to the government and the government will typically proceed by providing additional information or by submitting final application sometimes with amendments at the governments election for the courts ruling pursuant to rule 9b ofthe fisc rules ofprocedure in conjunction with its submission of final application the government has an opportunity to request hearing even if the judge did not otherwise intend to require one the government might request hearing for example to challenge conditions that the judge has indicated he or she would impose on the approval of an application if the judge schedules hearing the judge decides whether to approve the application thereafter otherwise the judge makes determination based on the final written application submitted by the government in approving an application judge will sometimes issue supplemental order in addition to signing the governments proposed orders often supplemental order imposes some form of reporting requirement on the government if after receiving final application the judge is inclined to deny it the court will prepare statement ofreasons pursuant to 50 usc 1803al in some cases the government may decide not to submit final application or to withdraw one that has been submitted after learning that the judge does not intend to approve it the annual statistics provided to congress by the attorney general pursuant to 50 usc 1807 and 1862b frequently cited to in press reports as suggestion that the courts approval rate of applications is over 99reflect only the number ofjinal applications submitted to and acted on by the court these statistics do not reflect the fact that many applications are altered prior to final submission or even withheld from final submission entirely often after an indication that judge would not approve them6 most applications under title v offisa are handled pursuant to the process described above however applications under title v offisa for bulk collection of phone call metadata records are normally handled by the weekly duty judge using process that is similar to the one described above albeit more exacting the government typically submits proposed application of this type more than one week in advance the attorney who reviews the application spends application has the benefit of the prior thoughts of the judges and staff and written record of any problems with the case 6 notably the approval rate for title iii wiretap applications see note 2 above is higher than the approval rate for fisa applications even using the attorney generals fisa statistics as the baseline for comparison as recent statistics show that from 2008 through 2012 only five of 13593 title iii wiretap applications were requested but not authorized see administrative office of the united states courts wiretap report 2012 table 7 available at httpwww uscourtsgov uscourtsstatisticswiretapreports20 12table 7 pdf honorable patrick j leahy july 29 2013 page 4 greater amount of time reviewing and preparing written analysis of such an application in part because the court has always required detailed information about the governments implementation of this authority the judge likewise typically spends greater amount of time than he or she normally spends on an individual application carefully considering the extensive information provided by the government and determining whether to seek more information or hold hearing before ruling on the application as described above the majority of applications submitted to the court are handled on sevenday cycle by judge sitting on weekly duty schedule applications that are novel or more complex are sometimes handled on longer timeline usually require additional briefing and are assigned by the presiding judge based on judges availability section 702 ie 50 usc 1881a applications7 would typically fall into this category where the courts process for handling section 702 applications differs from the process described above it is largely based on the statutory requirements of that section which was enacted as part ofthe fisa amendments act of2008 faa pursuant to 50 usc 1881 agl g2di prior to the implementation of an authorization under section 702 the attorney general and the director of national intelligence must provide the court with written certification containing certain statutorily required elements and that certification must include an effective date for the authorization that is at least 30 days after the submission of the written certification to the court8 under 50 usc 1881aib the court must review the certification as well as the targeting and minimization procedures adopted in accordance with 50 usc 1881ad not later than 30 days after the date on which the certification and procedures are submitted the statutorilyimposed deadline for the courts review typically coincides with the effective date identified in the final certification filed with the court the governments submission of section 702 application typically includes cover filing that highlights any special issues and identifies any changes that have been made relative to the prior application the government has typically filed proposed read copy section 702 applications approximately one month before filing final application proposed section 702 applications are reviewed by multiple members ofthe courts legal staff at the direction of the presiding judge or judge who has been assigned to handle the section 702 application the 7 section 702 application is used here to refer collectively to section 702 certification and supporting affidavit as well as to the statutorilyrequired targeting and minimization procedures 8 if the acquisition has already begun eg pursuant to determination of exigent circumstances under 50 u sc 1881 c 2 or the effective date is less than 30 days after the submission of the written certification to the court eg because of an amendment to certification while judicial review is pending pursuant to 50 usc 1881ailc 50 usc 1881ag2dii requires the certification to include the date the acquisition began or the effective date of the authorization i i i f i i t i i honorable patrick j leahy july 29 2013 page 5 courts legal staff may request meeting with the government to discuss proposed application also at the direction of the presiding judge or judge who has been assigned to handle the section 702 application the court legal staff may request additional information from the government or convey judges concerns about the legal sufficiency of proposed section 702 application following these interactions the government files final section 702 application which the government may have elected to amend based on any concerns raised by the judge the judge reviews the final section 702 application and may set hearing if he or she has additional questions about it if the judge finds based on the written submission alone or the written submission in combination with hearing that the certification contains all of the required elements and that the targeting and minimization procedures adopted in accordance with 50 usc 1881ad are consistent with the requirements of those subsections and with the fourth amendment to the constitution of the united states the judge enters an order approving the certification in accordance with 50 usc 1881ai3a as required by 50 usc 1881ai3c the judge also issues an opinion in support of the order if the judge finds that the certification does not contain the required elements or the targeting and minimization procedures are inconsistent with the requirements of 50 usc 1881ad or the fourth amendment the judge will pursuant to 50 usc 1881ai3b issue an order directing the government to at the governments election and to the extent required by the courts order either correct any deficiency identified by the courts order not later than 30 days after the date on which the court issues the order or cease or not begin the implementation of the authorization for which the certification was submitted subsequent review of any remedial measures taken by the government may then be required and may result in another order and opinion pursuant to 50 usc 1881ai 2 when considering such applications and submissions please describe the interaction between the government and the court including both judges and court stajj including any hearings meetings or other means through which the court has the opportunity to ask questions or seek additional information from the government please describe how frequently such exchanges occur and generally what types of additional information that the court might request of the government if any please also describe how frequently the court asks the government to make changes to its applications and submissions before ruling the process through which the court interacts with the government in reviewing proposed applications seeking additional information conveying court concerns and adjudicating final applications is very similar to the process employed by other federal courts in considering applications for wiretap orders under title iii discussed in notes 2 and 6 above under fisa practice the first set of interactions often take place at the staff level the courts legal staff frequently interacts with the government in various ways in the context of honorable patrick j leahy july 29 2013 page 6 examining the legal sufficiency of applications before they are presented in final form to judge indeed in the process of reviewing the governments applications and submissions in order to provide advice to the judge the legal staff interact with the government on daily basis these daily interactions typically consist of secure telephone conversations in which legal staff ask the government questions about the legal and factual elements of applications or submissions these questions may originate with legal staff after an initial review of an application or submission or they may come from judge at the direction of the presiding judge or the judge assigned to matter court legal staff sometimes meet with the government in connection with applications and submissions the court typically requests such meetings when proposed application or submission presents special legal or factual concern about which the court would like additional information eg novel use of technology or request to use new surveillance or search technique the frequency of such meetings varies depending on the courts assessment of its need for additional information in matters before it and the most conducive means to obtain that information court legal staff may meet with the government as often as 23 times week or as few as 12 times month in connection with the various matters pending before the court pursuant to 50 usc 1803a2a and rule 17a ofthe fisc rules ofprocedure the court also holds hearings in cases in which judge assesses that he or she needs additional information in order to rule on matter the frequency of hearings varies depending on the nature and complexity of matters pending before the court at given time and also to some extent based on the individual preferences of different judges hearings are attended at minimum by the department of justice attorney who prepared the application and fact witness from the agency seeking the courts authorization the types of additional information sought from the government through telephone conversations meetings or hearings include but are not limited to the following additional facts to justify the governments belief that its application meets the legal requirements for the type of authority it is seeking eg in the case of electronic surveillance that might include additional information to justify the governments belief that target of surveillance is foreign power or an agent of foreign power as required by 50 usc 1804a3a or that the target is using or about to use particular facility as required by 50 usc 1804a3b additional facts about how the government intends to implement statutorily required minimization procedures see eg 50 usc 1801h 1805a3 1824a3 1861cl 1881ai3a and 1881 c c 1 c additional information about the governments prior implementation of court order particularly if the government has previously failed to comply fully with court order or additional information about novel issues of technology or law see rule 11 of fisc rules of procedure in typical week the court seeks additional information or modifies the terms proposed i t l i l honorable patrick j leahy july 29 2013 page7 by the government in significant percentage of cases9 the court has recently initiated the process of tracking more precisely how frequently this occurs the judge may determine for example that he or she cannot make the necessary findings under the statute without the addition of information to the application or that he or she can approve only some of the authorities sought through the application the government then has the choice to alter its final application or proposed orders in response to the judges concerns request hearing to address those concerns submit final application without changes or elect not to proceed at all with final application if the government files final application the court may on its own make changes to the governments proposed orders or issue totally redrafted orders to address the judges concern about given application the judge may choose for example to make an authorization of shorter duration than what was requested by the government or the judge may issue supplemental order imposing special reporting or minimization requirements on the governments implementation of an authorization 3 public fisa court opinions and orders make clear that the court has considered the views of nongovernmental parties in certain cases including provider challenge to the protect america act of 2007 describe instances where non governmental parties have appeared before the court has the court invited or heard views from nongovernmental party regarding applications or submissions under title title v or title vii of fisa lf so how did this come about and what was the process or mechanism that the court used to enable such views to be considered fisa does not provide mechanism for the court to invite the views of nongovernmental parties in fact the courts proceedings are ex parte as required by the statute see eg 50 usc 1805a 1824a 1842dl 1861cl and in keeping with the procedures followed by other courts in applications for search warrants and wiretap orders nevertheless the statute and the fisc rules of procedure provide multiple opportunities for recipients of court orders or government directives to challenge those orders or directives either directly or through refusal to comply with orders or directives additionally as detailed below there have been several instances particularly in the past several months in which nongovernmental parties have appeared before the court outside of the context of challenge to an individual court order or government directive there has been one instance in which the court heard arguments from nongovernmental party that sought to substantively contest directive from the government specifically in 2007 the government issued directives to yahoo inc yahoo pursuant to section 1058 ofthe protect america act of 2007 p aa yahoo refused to comply with the directives and the government 9 this assessment does not include minor technical or typographical changes which occur more frequently honorable patrick j leahy july 29 2013 page 8 filed motion with this court to compel compliance the court ordered and received briefing from both parties and rendered decision in april 200810 as noted above the fisc rules of procedure and the fisa statute provide opportunities for the appearance of nongovernmental parties before the court in matters pending pursuant to titles i v and vii of the statute for example rule 19a of the fisc rules of procedure provides that if person or entity served with court order fails to comply with that order the government may file motion for an order to show cause why the recipient should not be held in contempt and sanctioned accordingly thus nongovernmental party served with an order may invite an opportunity to be heard by the court through refusal to comply with an order with respect to applications filed under title v offisa 50 usc 1861t2ai provides that person receiving production order may challenge the legality of that order by filing petition with the court the same section of the statute provides that the recipient of production order may challenge the nondisclosure order imposed in connection with production order by filing petition to modify or set aside the nondisclosure order rules 3336 of the fisc rules of procedure delineate the procedures and requirements for filing such petitions including the time limits on such challenges to date recipient of production order has opted to invoke this section of the statute with respect to applications filed under title vii offisa 50 usc 188lah4a provides that an electronic communication service provider who receives directive pursuant to section 702 may file petition to modify or set aside the directive with the court sections 188lah4ag ofthe statute as well as rule 28 ofthe fisc rules of procedure delineate 10 yahoo thereafter appealed the courts decision to the foreign intelligence surveillance court of review fiscr see in re directives redacted pursuant to section 105b of the foreign intelligence surveillance act 551 f3d 1004 fisa ct rev 2008 this is not the only instance in which nongovernmental entity has appeared before the fiscr in 2002 the fiscr accepted briefs filed by the aclu and the national association of criminal defense lawyers as amici curiae in in re sealed case 310 f3d 717 fisa ct rev 2002 while yahoos identity as the provider that challenged these directives was previously under seal pursuant to the fiscrs decision in in re directives 551 f3d 1004 101618 the fiscr issued an order on june 26 2013 indicating that it does not object to the release of yahoos identity and ordering among other things new declassification review of the fiscrs opinion in in re directives the fiscr issued this order in response to motion by yahoos counsel and after receiving briefing by yahoo and the government yahoo also recently filed motion for publication of the courts decision that was appealed to the fiscr resulting in the published opinion in in re directives the court granted the motion documents related to yahoos recent motion to this court are available at httpwwwuscourtsgovuscourtscourtsfiscindexhtml under docket 1 05bg 070 i honorable patrick j leahy july 29 2013 page 9 the procedures and requirements for such challenges relatedly 50 usc 188lah5a provides that if an electronic communication service provider fails to comply with directive issued under section 702 the attorney general may file petition with the court for an order to compel compliance which would likely result in the service providers appearance before the court through its legal representatives section 1881ah5 as well as rule 29 of the fisc rules of procedure provide further detail on the procedures and requirements for the enforcement of section 702 directives finally 50 usc 1881ah6 and rule 31 ofthe fisc rules of procedure allow for the government or an electronic communication service provider to appeal an order ofthis court under 1881ah4 or 5 to the fiscr to date electronic communication service provider has opted to challenge directive issued pursuant to section 702 although as noted above yahoo refused to comply with government directives issued under the p aa which resulted in the government invoking provision under that statute to compel compliance as noted above there have been number of other instances in which nongovernmental parties have appeared before the court outside of the context of direct challenge to court order or government directive particularly recently those instances are as follows in august 2007 the american civil liberties union aclu filed motion with the court for the release of certain records the court ordered and received briefing on the matter from the aclu and the government and rendered decision in december 2007 see in re motion for release of court records 526 f supp 2d 484 fisa ct 2007 on may 23 2013 the electronic frontier foundation eff filed motion with this court for consent to disclosure of court records or in the alternative

all documents filed in this docket are available at httpwwwuscourtsgovuscourtscourtsfiscindexhtml under case misc 1304 4 please describe the process used by the court to consider and resolve any instances where the government notifies the court of compliance concerns with any of the fisa authorities pursuant to 50 usc 1803h the court is empowered to ensure compliance with its orders additionally rule 13a of the fisc rules of procedure requires the government to file written notice with the court immediately upon discovering that any authority or approval granted by the court has been implemented either by government officials or others operating pursuant to court order in manner that did not comply with the courts authorization or approval or with applicable law rule 13a also requires the government to notify the court in writing of the facts and circumstances relevant to the noncompliance any modifications the government has made or proposes to make in how it will implement any authority or approval granted by the court and how the government proposes to dispose of or treat any information obtained as result of the noncompliance when the government discovers instances of noncompliance it files notices with the court as required by rule 13a because the rule requires the government to immediately inform the judge of compliance incident the government typically files preliminary notice that provides whatever facts are available at the time an incident is discovered the legal staff review these notices as they are received and call significant matters to the attention of the appropriate judge in instances in which the noncompliance has not been fully addressed by the time the preliminary rule 13a notice is filed the court may seek additional information through telephone calls meetings or hearings typically the government will file final rule 13a notice once the relevant facts are known and any unauthorized collection has been destroyed however judges sometimes issue orders directing the government to take specific honorable patrick j leahy july 29 2013 page 11 actions to address instances of noncompliance either before or after final notice is filed and less frequently to cease course of action that the court considers noncompliant this process is followed for compliance issues in all matters including matters handled
