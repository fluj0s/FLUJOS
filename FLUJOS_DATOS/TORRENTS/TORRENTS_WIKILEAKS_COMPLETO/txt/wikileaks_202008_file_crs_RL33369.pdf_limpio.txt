the disaster prior to these events in july 2005 secretary michael chertoff had announced reorganization of the depa rtment of homeland security dhs including fema in the aftermath of hurricane katrina the administration proceeded with the reorganization initiativ after congress signaled its approval1 as result of concerns about the eff ectiveness of the fe deral response after hurricane katrina congress is continuing to rethink the organizational arrangements for carrying out federal emergency manageme nt functions the release of reports by the house senate and white house on th response to hurrican katrina may lead to further examination of these issues legislation has been introduced in congress bearing upon these arrangements as of july 17 20 06 15 such bills had been introduced prior to its incorporation into dhs in 2003 fema was an independent agency and eight of the 15 bills would reestablish fema as such the seven remaining bills would reorganize emergency management functions

outgrowth of decades of emergency preparedness and civil defense arrangements since the nd of world war ii congress and presidents have debated formulated and revised administrative responsibilities for emergency management the major organizational velopments of that period are shown in table 1 in the appendix some of the issu debated during the past 60 years have included the following what should be the boundaries or limitations of the matters subject to the jurisdiction of the agency department or office charged with the management of emergencies should certain emergencies eg nuclear facility incidents transportation accidents hazardous material spills be the jurisdiction of agencies with specialized resources is it necessary to distinguish between natural threats floods earthquakes etc and those cause d by human action or inaction are all attacks on the united states whether by military action or terrorist strikes emergencies th at require coordinated response from agencies other than the partment of defense or the department of justice how should federal policies be c oordinated with state policies what are the boundaries between federal responsib ilities and those held by the states under the 10th amendment to the constitution how should responsibility for new or emerging threats be established are federal statutory policies sufficient to enable the president and administration offici als to address adequately the unforeseen emergency conditions these and other questions have regained currency as some have argued that the failures associated with the response to hurricane katrina reflected an inability of dhs to balance competing policy matters for example one former fema official reportedly stated that federal state nd local natural disaster response capabilities have been weakened by diversion into terrorism3 in testimony before congress former fema director mich ael brown agreed with this position on the other hand secretary chertoff and other administration officials contend that dhs and fema continue to adhere to an allhazards mission that enables federal agencies to respond to natural disast ers as well as terrorist attacks and

republic to 1950 congress enacted legislation that directed federal disaster relief largely on an ad hoc basis laws unique to each disaster author ized the amount of funds to be distributed the type of federal equipment to be sent or the personnel to be allocated to stricken areas4 for the most part federal emergency assistance consisted of disaster relief authorized to provide specific relief to victims after disasters occurred5 departments and agencies holding resources and personne l most pertinent to the given emergency often the armed forces or federal financing entities were charged by congress with providing disaster assistance as general rule the office for emergency management oem in the executive office of the president eop provided advice to the president on emergency responsibilities6 the federal approach changed when the disaster relief act of 19507 became the first comprehensive federal di saster relief law the act authorized federal agencies in any major disaster when directed by the president to provide assistance to states and localities by lending federal equipment supplie s facilities personnel and other resources by distributing through th red cross or otherwise medicine food and other consumable supp lies by donating surplus fe deral property and by performing protective and other work ssential for the preservation of life and property clearing debris and wreckage repairing and mporarily replacing damaged or destroyed local public facilities and providing grants to states and localities for these purposes after the president determined that natural catastrophe had overwhelmed state and local capabilities federal aid was to be provided the act authorized the president to coordinate related agency activities prescribe related rules and regulations and exercise any power or authority conferred on him by the act either directly or through such federal agency as he may designate the president and agenci were also

discussed below civil emergency preparedness although civil defe nse was perceived to be state responsibility during world wa r ii federal organi zations evolved in response to several warre lated concerns these included the following continuity of government adequacy of critical resources nd capacities such as food medicine communications and transportation industrial mobilization for military response needs in time of war and national security emergency and civil defense localized emer gency protective and response measures in the event of an attack the governmental capacities called for to address these concerns overlap with but often have been distinct from those nece ssary to prepare for and respond to natural disasters federal civil defense func tions were housed in seve ral different organizations in rapid succession in the aftermath of world war ii first they were handled by the army then by the office of civil defense planning in the depa rtment of defense and then by

library of congress 1989 p 326concluding observations the complexities of the emergency management process the lack of consistent and generally accepted statutory definition of homeland security in federal policies and the difficulty of formulating administrative structures are some of the factors that challenge members of the 109th congress as they consider organizational options in the wake of hurricane katrina some c ontend that fema should be removed from dhs and reestablished as an independent federal entity others argue that it should remain in the department because the pr oblems encountered af ter hurricane katrina reflect leadership and operational not organizational challenges the preceding historical overview i ndicates that reorganizing fede ral emergency management civil defense or homeland security entities may address certain shortcomings and problems but the challenges go beyond ch changes remaining cognizant of maxim of hl mencken110 congressional agreement on the best organizational structure will be part of the solution to the question of how to ensure the effective implementation of emergency management responsibilities the extent to which reorganization contributes to the improve ment of problems evident after hurricane katrina is matter of debate at the outset of this report see evol ution of organizational arrangements issues concerning the scope

of the evolution of federal emergency manageme nt now homeland security policy since world war ii reveals that some concepts have not change d just as the debate over the federal role in civil defense

likely to affect present day policymaking some questions arguably require furt her examination is it important to distinguish between natural and humancaused events what are the limitations of the allhazards concept should the role of the department of defense be reexamined the bush administration and the 109th congress have acted to address problems that became apparent in the response to hurricane katrina other issues remain on the agenda for future solution there is little or doubt that the white house including the president will be directly involved in the response to future
