reasons 1 4 b and d 1 s summary moroccan ministry of foreign affairs chief of staff and director general of multilateral relations nasser bourita told the charge on december 28 that the health of wounded guinean junta leader captain moussa dadis camara has improved and that he has sought to leave morocco bourita reiterated that dadis camara arrived without prior consultation with the gom but he was allowed into morocco for treatment of his wounds charge noted that guinea seems to have become calmer in camaras absence and stressed that it would be helpful if he were to remain out of the country bourita stated that the gom shared us concerns about the stability of guinea and the region and wished to help find solution but he added that there are grounds upon which to keep camara any longer he urged the us and france to avoid making any public request that morocco keep dadis camara end summary 2 snf in meeting on december 28 moroccan mfa chief of staff nasser bourita told charge and apolcouns that dadis camara had wanted to leave morocco last week but that the gom decided to keep him here until the end of the month for continuing medical treatment he added that guinean minister of national defense sekouba konate is due to arrive about 2030 gmt on december 28 to visit dadis who is still the leader of guinea bourita suggested that konate was not preparing to take over that role konate has wanted to see dadis for some time presumably to make his own assessment of dadis health xxxxxxxxxxxx corroborates that plane carrying konate has left conakry 3 c in explaining the goms desire to help find peaceful solution to the problems in guinea bourita said moroccos relations with guinea and other countries must be taken into consideration it is not for morocco he said to turn dadis camara over to the icc he added that were security council resolution forthcoming it would put the gom in difficult position but would of course be binding bourita asked rhetorically whether out of guinea meant in morocco or that morocco should help find thirdcountry location for dadis camara bourita stressed that the us and france should avoid any public request for morocco to keep dadis bourita further urged that the us and france should maintain contact with foreign minister taieb fassi fihri while the minister is in tripoli libya for the arab maghreb union ministerial december 28 to 30 4 c echoing comments made to apolcouns several weeks ago by the mfa director of african affairs bourita went on to say that it would be better to find way to deal with dadis camara in guinea he noted that dadis still enjoyed considerable support in the country and stressed the need to keep dadis calm and confident about his future to do otherwise he said risked more violence and more bloodshed 5 snf xxxxxxxxxxxx declared that dadis return to guinea would lead to significant problems he said he learned from doctors attending to dadis that he was doing quite well and he confirmed that konate was on his way to rabat to meet with the junta leader and perhaps return with him to guinea xxxxxxxxxxxx said he had contacted general mamadouba toto camara in conakry and was told dadis imminent return to guinea was lie rabat 00001009 0022 of 002 6 c comment while we understand both from bourita and from french ambassador joubert that french president sarkozy planned to discuss guinea with king mohammed vi during their family dinner8 on december 27 there do not appear to have been any breakthroughs 7 snf we believe bourita is sincere in expressing the goms desire to help guinea however with legal or medical basis to keep dadis here and without any country other than libya prepared to accept him on legal or medical basis bouritas suggestion that dadis be dealt with in guinea may be the only viable option end comment 8 u tripoli minimize considered visit embassy rabats classified website httpwwwintelinksgovgovwikiportalmoro cco jackson
