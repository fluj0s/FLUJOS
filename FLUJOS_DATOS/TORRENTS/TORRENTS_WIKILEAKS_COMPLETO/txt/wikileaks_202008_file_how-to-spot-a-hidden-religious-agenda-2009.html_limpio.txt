censored new scientist article how to spot hidden religious agenda amanda gefter new scientist sat 28 feb 2009 2235 utc as book reviews editor at new scientist i often come across socalled science books which after few pages reveal themselves to be harbouring ulterior motives i have learned to recognise clues that the author is pushing religious agenda as creationists in the us continue to lose court battles over attempts to have intelligent design taught as science in federally funded schools their strategy has been forced to well evolve that means ensuring that references to pseudoscientific concepts like id are more heavily veiled so i thought id share few tips for spotting what may be religion in sciences clothing red flag number one the term scientific materialism materialism is most often used in contrast to something else something nonmaterial or supernatural proponents of id frequently lament the scientific claim that humans are the product of purely material forces at the same time they never define how nonmaterial forces might work i have yet to find definition that characterises nonmaterialism by what it is rather than by what it is not the invocation of cartesian dualism where the brain and mind are viewed as two distinct entities one material and the other immaterial is also red flag and if an author describes the mind or any biological system for that matter as irreducibly complex let the alarm bells ring misguided interpretations of quantum physics are classic hallmark of pseudoscience usually of the new age variety but some religious groups are now appealing to aspects of quantum weirdness to account for free will beware this is nonsense when you come across the terms darwinism or darwinists take heed true scientists rarely use these terms and instead opt for evolution and biologists respectively when evolution is described as blind random undirected process be warned while genetic mutations may be random natural selection is not when cells are described as astonishingly complex molecular machines it is generally by breathless supporters of id who take the metaphor literally and assume that such machine requires an engineer if an author wishes for academic freedom it is usually id code for the acceptance of creationism some general sentiments are also red flags authors with religious motives make shameless appeals to common sense from the staid there is nothing we can be more certain of than the reality of our sense of self james fanu in why us to the silly yer granny was an ape creationist blogger denyse oleary if common sense were reliable guide we wouldnt need science in the first place religiously motivated authors also have bad habit of linking the cultural implications of theory to the truthvalue of that theory the id crowd for instance loves to draw line from darwin to the holocaust as they did in the documentary film expelled intelligence allowed even if such an absurd link were justified it would have zero relevance to the question of whether or not the theory of evolution is correct similarly when fanu writes that darwins on the origin of species articulated the desire of many scientists for an exclusively materialist explanation of natural history that would liberate it from the sticky fingers of the theological inference that the beauty and wonder of the natural world was direct evidence for designer his statement has bearing on the scientific merits of evolution it is crucial to the publics intellectual health to know when science really is science those with religious agenda will continue to disguise their true views in their effort to win supporters so please read between the lines
