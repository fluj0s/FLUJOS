not agr eed to budget resolution by then prior to 1997 section 303 applied to any meas ure as reported only consequently measure that was amended on the floor to contain budgetary provi sion for fiscal year in which congress had not agreed to budget resolution would not be subject to this point of order as long as the measure as re ported did not itself contain such

section 3a2 of hres 5 108th congress 12 section 303b3 of the cba provides an exce ption to the section 303 point of order for any unreported bill or joint resolution presumably the separate order also would supersede this exceptionprovision8 moreover measure that as repor ted contained such budgetary provision would remain subject to this point of order even though special rule liminated the violating provision by making in order as th text to be amended an amendment in the nature of substitute that omitted the provision the budget enforcement act of 1997 title x of pl 10533 balanced budget act of 1997 added new section to the cba th at was intended to correct this anomaly9 section 315 provides that the wo rds as reported in titles iii and iv of the cba refer to the text made in order for the purpose of amendment or the text on which the previous question was ordered directly for passage the bea of 1997 however also eliminated the words as reported from section 303 of the cba consequently there has been some ambiguity about whether or not section 303 applies to text made in order by special rule as was intended for example during the 105th congress the house continued to waive the point of order agains t reported measures that violated section 303 even though the violation was corrected by th special rule making in order different text for purposes of amendment10 section 3a2 of hres 5 renews for the 109th congress separate order also agreed to at the beginning of the previous three congresses11 to provide that the section 303 prohibition applies to the xt made

entitlement authority as the authority to make payments including loans and grants the budget authority for which is not provided for in advance by appropriations acts to any person or government if under the provisions of the law containing that authority the united states is obligated to make such payments to persons or governments who meet the requirements established by that law andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22021crs5 13 measure that provides new entitlement authority that is to become effective after the current fiscal year is not subject to this point of order 14 in the senate section 401b requires such measure to be referred to the senate appropriations committee instead of simply provid ing the authority to do so as in the house 15 see the annotations to section 401 of the cba in house rules and manual pp 10151018 16 ibid p 1018 also see congressional record vol 138 mar 26 1992 pp 72027203 17 the separate order agreed to in the 106th congress sec 2a3 of hres 5 expired upon the adoption of the fy2000 budget resolution whereas the orders agreed to at the beginning of the 107th section 3b2 of hres 5 and 108th section 3a2 of hres 5 congresses applied to the entire duration of the congresses 18 for further information on the congressi onal budget process see crs report rs20095 the congressional budget process brief overview by james v saturnob the food stamp program section 401b of the cba prohibits the c onsideration of measure that provides new entitlement authority that is to become effective in the current fiscal year13 i n addition if committee reports measure that violates this prohibition and the amount of such spending exceeds the committees spending allocation also referred to as its section 302a allocation asso ciated with the most recently adopted budget resolution the measure may be referred to the house appropriations committee for period not to exceed 15 days14 if the appropriations committee does not act within the 15 days the measure is discharged automatically and placed on the appropriate calendar within the 15day period however the appropriations committee may report the measure with an amendment that limits the amount of spending several house precedents have estab lished the meaning of new entitlement authority as defined by the congressional budget act15 among them in 1992 the chair ruled that an amendment creating new executive position at specified level of compensation subject to appropriation was not new entitlement authority because payment would occur absent an appropriation16 section 3a3 of hres 5 effectively ma kes this ruling standing order for the 109th congress the house also agreed to this separate order at the beginning of the previous three congresses17 specifically the separate or der provides that provision in measure that establishes prospectively for federal office or position specified or minimum level of compensation to be funded by annual discre tionary appropriations shall not be considered as providing new titlement authority unde r section 401 of the congressional budget act of 1974 therefore during the 109th congress such provision presumably would not be subject to point of order under section 401b of the cba and it also would not be subject to the 15day referral to the house appropriations committee enforcement of the fy2005 budget resolution each year congress is required to adopt budget resolution setting forth spending revenue and debt levels which are then enforced primarily through points of order during the consideration of budgetary legislation18

included provision in the special rule section 2 of hres 649 108th congress governing the consideration of the conference report to sconres 95 deeming the conference report to have been agreed to by cong ress for budget enforcement purposes20 as result the provisions of the conference report and the joint explanatory statement such as the committee spending allocations commonly re ferred to as 302a allocations and the subsequent appropriations committee subdivi sions commonly referred to as 302b allocations could have been enforced in the house under the procedures of the congressional budget act but only during the 108th congress section 3a4 of hres 5 provides that the conference report on sconres 95 hrept 108498 agreed to by the house in the 108th congress be considered to have been adopted by the 109th congress and continue to serve as the basis for budget enforcement in the house under this d eeming resolution as with the 2004 resolution the enforcement procedures of the
