federal funding for the education of children with disabilities and requires as condition for the receipt of such funds the provision of free appropriate public education fape originally enacted in 1975 by pl 94142 the act responded to increased awareness of the need to educate children with disabilities and to judicial decisions requiring that states provide an education for children with disabilities if they provided an education for children without disabilities4 idea has been amended several times most recently by pl 108446 in 20045 the act both authorizes federal funding for special education and related services6 and for states that accept these funds7 sets out principles under which special education and related services are to be provided the requirements are detailed especially when the regulatory interpretations are considered the major principles include the following requirements states and school districts make available free appropriate public education fape8

children with disabilities regardless of the severity of their disability to determine which children are eligible for special education and related services each child receiving services has an individual education program iep spelling out the specific special education and related services to be provided to meet his or her needs the parent must be partner in planning and overseeing the childs special education and related services as member of the iep team to the maximum extent appropriate children with disabilities must be educated with children who are not disabled states and school districts must provide procedural safeguards to children with disabilities and their parents including right to due process hearing the right to appeal to federal district court and in some cases the right to receive attorneys fees idea has detailed requirements that states receiving funds under the act are required to follow however idea also allows some flexibility for states for example state may but does not have to define group of children aged three to nine or any subset of that age as children with disabilities if they are experiencing developmental delays 10 this flexibility allows for more state discretion under idea whereas the nondiscrimination mandates of section 504 and the ada are more uniform

is brief essentially section 504 prohibits discrimination against an otherwise qualified individual with disability solely by reason of disability in any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance or under any program or activity conducted by an executive agency or the us postal service11 this prohibition goes far beyond the provision of education and also includes all levels of education including colleges and universities which are not covered by idea12 generally although there are some differences which will be discussed subsequently regarding k12 schools the department of education ed has interpreted the section 504 compliance standards for schools to be the same as the basic requirements of idea13 in addition the tenth circuit court of appeals in 1982 decision held that continued 1982 held that this requirement is satisfied when the state provides personalized instruction with sufficient support services to permit child to benefit educationally from that instruction and that this instruction should be reasonably calculated to enable the child to advance from grade to grade idea does not require that state maximize the potential of children with disabilities 9 part c of idea 20 usc 1431 et seq provides for grants to states and localities to enhance the development of infants and toddlers with disabilities 10 20 usc 14013b 11 29 usc 794

activities receiving federal assistance by nancy lee jones 12 the application of section 504 and the ada to colleges and universities is beyond the scope of this report 13 these requirements include the provision of free appropriate public education in the least restrictive setting see 34 cfr part 104 appx subpart d

statute prohibiting discrimination against individuals with disabilities15 as stated in the act its purpose is to provide clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities 16 as with section 504 the ada covers far more than k12 education it also covers employment public services and public accommodations which include educational facilities like section 504 the ada covers colleges and univ ersities but unlike section 504 such schools do not need to be in receipt of federal funds the ada was recently amended by the ada amendments act pl 110325 which rejects certain supreme court interpretations of the ada definition of disability 17 generally the ada and section 504 are interpreted in the same manner regarding the coverage of k12 education the partment of education ed notes that the office of civil rights ocr enforces both sect ion 504 and title ii of the ada the standards adopted by the ada were designed not to restrict the rights and remedies available under section 504 the title ii regulations applicable to free and appropriate public education issues do not provide greater protection than applicable section 504 regulations18 g7g149g146g144g146g139g146g149g146g157g162g561 g3g144g142g561g20g142g154g158g146g155g142g150g142g151g157g156g561 idea part b covers the education of schoolage children while

specifically listed disabilities who are in need of special education while section 504 and the ada are more general and encompass all ages and are not limited to the provision of education child who is covered under idea would be covered under section 504 and the ada but some students not covered under idea would be covered under section 504 and the ada several of the most common disabilities of students included under section 504 and the ada but not always covered under idea are attention deficit hyperactivity diso rder adhd diabetes asthma and dyslexia 21 it should also be observed that the number of students covered under idea is much larger than those covered solely under section 504 and the ada in k12 schools22 idea defines child with disability in the following manner in general the term child with disability means child i with mental retardation hearing impairments including deafness speech or language impairments visual impairments including blindness serious emotional disturbance referred to in this title as emotional disturbance orthopedic impairments autism traumatic brain injury other health impairments or specific learning disabilities and ii who by reason thereof needs special education and related services 23 in contrast the ada and section 504 do not list disabilities and define an individual with disability in functional manner the ada definition was amended by the ada amendments act of 2008 adaaa pl 11032524 and defines the term disability with respect to an individual as physical or mental impairme nt that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual b record of such an impairment or c being regarded as having such an impairment as described in paragraph 325 although this is essentially the same statutory language as was in the original ada pl 110325 contains new rules of construction regarding the definition of disability which provide that the definition of disability shall be construed in favor of broad coverage to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the act the term substantially limits shall be interpreted consistently with the findings and purposes of the ada amendments act

it would have substantially limited major life activity when active and the determination of whether an impairment substantially limits major life activity shall be made without regard to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures except that the ameliorative effects of ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses shall be considered 26 the ada amendments act specifically lists examples of major life activities including caring for oneself performing manual tasks seeing hearing eating sleeping walking standing lifting bending speaking breathing learning reading concentrating thinking communicating and working the act also states that major life activity includes the operation of major bodily function the rehabilitation act is amended by the ada amendments act to reference the definition of disability in the ada the senate statement of managers noted the importance of maintaining uniform definitions in the two statutes so covered entities will generally operate under one consistent standard and the civil rights of individuals with disabilities will be protected in all settings 27 the senate statement of managers also observed the following we expect that the secretary of education will promulgate new regulations related to the definition of disability to be consistent with those issued by the attorney general under this act we believe that other current regulations issued by the department of education office of civil rights under section 504 of the rehabilitation act are currently harmonious with congressional intent under both the ada and the rehabilitation act 28 the implications of the changes in the definition of disability under section 504 and the ada for the coverage children in k12 schools is not entirely clear in senate hearing testimony sue gamm consultant and former special education chief in chicago argued that the change in the definition will greatly expand the number of 504ada children29 while jo anne simon assistant professor at fordham university school of law argued that courts generally had not interpreted the definition of disability in section 504 and the ada in restrictive manner and that concerns that the adaaa w ill compel schools to provide services to students who dont really need them are misplaced30 perry zirkel lehigh university education and law professor argues that the adaaa would result in more students in k12

receiving services under idea must have an individual education program iep spelling out the specific special education and related services to be provided to meet his or her needs 43 although detailed analysis of the interpretation of fape is beyond the scope of this report it should be noted that the supreme court in board of education of the hendrick hudson central school district v rowley44 observed that implicit in the congressional purpose of providing access to free appropriate public education is the requirement that the education to which access is provided be sufficient to confer some educational benefit upon the handicapped child 45 the court concluded that the basic floor of opportunity provided by the act consists of access to specialized instruction and related services which are individually designed to provide educational benefit to the handicapped child46 however the states are not required to maximize each childs potential47 if the child is progressing from grade to grade making measurable and adequate gains the fape requirement is met section 504 and ada also require the provision of free appropriate public education48 although the idea regulatory requirements are more detailed49 one court has noted that the provision of fape under section 504 is conceptually different from the provision of fape under idea while both the individuals with disabilities education act and section 504 mandate that local education agencies provide fape to children with disabilities the scope of protection afforded under each of these statutes is somewhat di fferent section 504 provides relief from discrimination whereas the idea provides relief from inappropriate educational placement decisions regardless of discrimination50 some courts have found that in order to establish section 504 violation plaintiff must demonstrate bad faith or gross misjudgment in addition to the denial of fape51 an appropriate education under section 504 is defined as the provision of regular or special education and related aids and services designed to meet individual educational needs of children 40 34 cfr part 104 appx 41 42 usc 12201 42 20 usc 1412a1 43 20 usc

disabilities are met and that comply with procedural requirements52 note that idea requires the provision of special education and related services while section 504 requires the provision of regular or special education and related aids and services thus child with section 504 plan could be receiving regular education with related aids and services while child with an iep under idea must be in receipt of special education courts have applied the rowley standard to section 504 and found that an appropriate education is one that is reasonably calculated to enable the child to achieve passing marks and advance from grade to grade53 section 504 like idea also requires that child with disability be placed in the regular educational environment to the maximum extent appropriate to the needs of the student with disability54 section 504 unlike idea does not require the implementation of an iep however an iep developed in accordance with idea is one means of meeting the section 504 requirements55 the plan developed under section 504 is often referred to as 504 plan56 unlike idea section 504 regulations do not provid detailed requirements about how 504 plan is created for example idea specifies that the iep team include the childs parents57 while there is similar requirement in section 504 or its regulations section 504 and the ada contain the requirement of reasonable accommodation for purposes of determining if there has been discrimination in employment58 there is reasonable accommodation requirement in idea ed has not read the reasonable accommodation limitation into the section 504 or ada title ii regulations on education and has stated reasonable accommodation limitation on the responsibilities of recipients is contained in subpart b of the regulation which covers employment see 34 cfr 10412 subpart which covers postsecondary and vocational education contains similar limitation on the recipients obligation to modi fy its academic requirements to ensure that they do not discriminate or have the effect of discrimination on the basis of disability if recipient can demonstrate that an academic requirement is essential to the program or instruction being pursued by the student with disability or to directly related licensing requirement failure to modify the requirement will not be regarded as discriminatory see 34 cfr 10444 such limitations are not contained in subpart d covering elementary and secondary education we conclude therefore that the re gulation writers intended to create different standard for elementary and secondary students than

students with disabilities can be denied access to accelerated programs such as advanced placement and international baccalaureate classes ed found such deni violates section 504 the ada and idea

disability may be subject to disciplinary procedures for violation of code of student conduct is complex and complicated generally under idea child with disability is not immune from disciplinary procedures however these procedures are not identical to those for children without disabilities 61 if child with disability commits an action that would be subject to discipline school personnel have several options child with disability who violates code of student conduct may be removed from her current placement to another setting or suspension for up to 10 school days the child may be placed in an interim alternative education setting for up to 45 school days for situations involving weapons drugs or if the student has inflicted serious bodily injury upon another person while at school and hearing officer may be asked to order child be placed in an interim alternative educational setting for up to 45 school days if the hearing officer determines that maintaining the current placement of the child is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or others 62 if the local educational agency lea seeks to change the plac ement of child with disability b ecause of violation of code of student conduct either on an interim basis or on longterm basis except for 10day suspension manifestation determination review must be conducted to determine whether the conduct in question was caused by or had direct and substantial relationship to the childs disability or was the direct result of the leas failure to implement the iep if the childs behavior is not manifestation of disability longterm disciplinary action such as expulsion may occur except that educational services may not cease 63 the issue of whether these detailed idea requirements are also required by section 504 and the ada is not clear the section 504 regulations require system of procedural safeguards and note that compliance with the procedural safeguards of idea as described above is one means of meeting the section 504 requirement64 however this does not mean that all the idea requirements are therefore required under section 504 in cenntenial school district v phil l and lori

regulations do require several procedural safeguards that are similar to idea provisions including notice an opportunity to examine relevant records an impartial hearing that includes the opportunity to be represented by counsel and review procedure 96 but the ada does not have any similar provisions both section 504 and the ada allow parties to file complaints with the respective agencies that oversee the statutes enforcement but neither statute creates state complaint system similar to the system found in idea the parties generally have much less time in which to file their complaints than they have under idea under both statutes the parties must file complaint within 180 days of the alleged discrimination unless the deadline is extended for good cause 97 section 504 and ada also create an administrative remedies process that similar to idea involves attempts at resolution throughout the process for section 504 complaint if ocr concludes that school district is out of compliance it first will attempt negotiation with the school district to bring it into compliance98 if negotiation is not successful ocr may terminate the school districts federal funding or refer the case to doj

not contain as many options for resolving complaints as idea section 504 and the ada do allow parties to file private right of action far earlier in the resolution process than is allowed under idea under both section 504 and the ada party may file private right of action at any time without exhausting administrative remedies105 additionally the statutes permit the court to award reasonable attorneys fees to the prevailing party106 however despite these provisions multiple appellate courts have held that parties must exhaust all administrative remedies for claims brought under section 504 or the ada when those claims could have been brought under idea107 the courts have all cited to ideas statutory language in 20 usc 1415l108 noting that the law requires parties seeking relief that is also available under idea to exhaust their remedies under idea prior to bringing suit under section 504 or the ada this exhaustion is limited to claims that would seek relief that is available under idea however the court in charlie f v board of education of skokie school district 68 noted that this available relief may be relief for the events condition or consequences of which the person complains not necessarily relief of the kind the person prefers 109 in other words party cannot bring claim under section 504 or the ada that also would fall under idea solely because the party can receive relief under section 504 or the ada that is not available under idea such as compensatory damages
