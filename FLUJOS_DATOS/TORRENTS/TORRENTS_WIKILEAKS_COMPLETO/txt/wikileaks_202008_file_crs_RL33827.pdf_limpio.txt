resources policy january 7 2009 abstract the wilderness act generally prohibits commercial activities motorized uses and infrastructure developments in congressionally designated wilderness areas however the wilderness act and many subsequent laws designating wilderness areas also contain provisions authorizing activities that do not conform with these general prohibitions the general prohibitions and the authorized uses are important because controversies persist over permissible and prohibited activities in wilderness areas and because bills often seek to modify existing areas or activitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33827g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and committees of congress g561

establish national wilderness preservation system on federal lands where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man where man himself is visitor who does not remain as of december 31 2007 the system totaled 694 units with 1066 million acres see crs report rl31447 wilderness overview and statistics by ross w gorte congress has taken two basic approaches to protecting the wilderness attributes on certain federal lands while allowing some uses that might alter the pristine character of the lands one approach described here is to explicitly allow uses in congressionally designated wilderness areas that do not conform with the wilderness acts general management guidance the other not covered in this report is to designate areas by some other label with special management direction for those areas in the laws creating them 1 the wilderness act directly and by crossreference in subsequent wilderness statutes generally prohibits commercial activities motorized uses and roads structures and facilities in units of the national wilderness preservation system designated by acts of congress specifically 4c states except as specifically provided for in this act and subject to existing private rights there shall be commercial enterprise and permanent road within any wilderness area designated by this act and except as necessary to meet minimum requirements for the administration of the area for the purpose of this act including measures required in emergencies involving the health and safety of persons within the area there shall be temporary road use of motor vehicles motorized equipment or motorboats landing of aircraft other form of mechanical transport and structure or installation within any such area this section thus prohibits most businesses commercial resource exploitation such as timber harvesting and motorized or mechanical entry via cars trucks offroad or allterrain vehicles bicycles aircraft or motorboats except in emergencies

usually subject to regulation by the secretary 2 specifically 4d1 allows the use of aircraft or motorboats where these uses have already become established subject to desirable restrictions 4d1 also allows such measures as may be necessary in the control of fire insects and diseases subject to desirable conditions 4d2 allows mineral prospecting conducted in manner compatible with the preservation of the wilderness environment 1 there has also been substantial debate over administrative andor legislative protection of the inventoried roadless areas in the national forest system for information see crs report rl30647 national forest system roadless area initiatives by kristina alexander and ross w gorte 2 the wilderness act generally referred to the secretary of agriculture because the act initially only designated wilderness areas in the national forest system subsequent wilderness laws refer to the secretary of agriculture or secretary of the interior depending on who has jurisdiction over the designated areas c httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33827g25g146g149g141g142g155g151g142g156g156g561g14g138g160g156g497g561g18g142g155g150g146g157

subject however to such reasonable regulations governing ingress and egress as may be prescribed consistent with using the land for mineral development and with leases permits and licenses containing such stipulations as may be prescribed for the protection of the wilderness character of the land consistent with the use of the land 3 4d4 allows the president to authorize water project development including road construction and use 4d4 also allows livestock grazing where established prior to the effective date of this act subject to such reasonable regulations as are deemed necessary and 4d6 allows commercial services which are proper for realizing the recreational or other wilderness purposes of the areas in addition access for livestock and wildlife management have fostered concerns over the years after discussions in several congresses the 101 st congress provided detailed guidelines in hrept 101405 the interior and insular affairs committees report on the arizona desert wilderness act of 1990 pl 101628 appendix pages 4143 is grazing guidelines and states among other provisions the maintenance of supporting facilities existing in an area prior to its classification as wilderness including fences line cabins water wells and lines stock tanks etc is permissible in wilderness where practical alternatives do not exist maintenance or other activities may be accomplished through the occas ional use of motorized equipment such motorized equipment uses will normally be permitted in those portions of wilderness area where they had occurred prior to the areas signation as wilderness or are established by prior agreement the construction of new improvements or replacement of deteriorated facilities in wilderness is permissible if in accordance with these guidelines and management plans governing the area involved the use of motorized equipment for emergency purposes such as rescuing sick animals or the placement of feed in emergency situations is also permissible appendix b of hrept 101405 pag 4451 is wildlife management guidelines it provides guidance similar to the grazing guidelines in appendix of hrept 101405 and reads in part this language 4c of the wilderness act is viewed as direction that all management activities within wilderness be done without motor vehicles motorized equipment or mechanical transport unless truly necessary to administer the area or are specifically permitted by other provisions in the act it means that any such use should be rare and temporary that roads can be built and that wilderness managers must determine such use is the minimum necessary to accomplish the task any use of motorized equipment or mechanical transport requires advance approval by the administering agency flowmaintenance dams water developments water diversion devices ditches and associated structures and other fish and wildlife habitat developments necessary for fish and 3 the authority to establish new mineral rights expired in 1983 attempts to establish new rights were attempted until the reagan administration and then congress included provisions in the interior appropriations acts prohibiting establishing new mineral rights until the wilderness acts expiration of that authority httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33827g25g146g149g141g142g155g151g142g156g156g561g14g138g160g156g497g561g18g142g155g150g146g157

otherwiseprohibited activities in some circumstances many subsequent laws designating units of the national wilderness preservation system have authorized specific uses or activities that do not
