what clearing is lecture given on 20 april 1963 hiya thank you thank you female voice three cheers for ron hiphip audience hooray female voice hiphip audience hooray female voice hiphip audience hooray that did it now i know im in england well now look mary sue has been working very very hard to make an ot out of and been working at it and working at it and she didnt make the grade i wanted to get ot today so i could give you some nice weather and i just didnt make it im sorry i only got thirteen banks back and got stuck you know well im really awfully glad to see you here i been waiting quite while to give you some of the announcements 1 want to give you in this congress quite few years actually youve been over as many jumps most of you about this stuff as i have so congratulations for lasting it through this congress actually celebrates quite few things we have received congratulations and wishes for very good congress here from various organizations and i didnt bring all of the telegrams but theyre all with you now the news the news that comes through is highly practical clearing highly practical clearing and that is the news now if you think this is just another one of ron keeping up the hope factor on you why ask the students down here in z unit and few weeks ago these were about the saddest people you ever saw you know i mean z unit thats the final clearing unit here on the saint hill special briefing course and these were sad people theyyou know he says its supposed to go this way you know and theyd sit there sneeringly you know trying to reason all this thing outputting in time putting in time in the auditing session just because they were supposed to you know and pc arc breaking and blowing and so forth and the auditing supervisor spending most of his time on the road between saint hill and london recovering students that were blowing you know very grim you know see them outsidei will say this i will say this they might have been snarling at their instructors but when theyd see why theyd give cheery hello i appreciate that but they were slugging along and you know the hope factor had completely worn out clearing well theyd probably never make it probably nobody else would either maybe we ought to go into subub you know very grim very grim maybe this buddhistic methodmaybe this buddhistic method of sitting there regarding your navel for twenty years maybe thatd work better than sweating over an emeter that never found reliable item you see and thenthen something happened then something happened we have had something that stood somewhat in our way and that was we have been too little evaluative and preclear working through clearing all the way through clearing today just cantjust cant find his way around thats all he just cant do it the ability to confront is proportional to the amount of charge that has been taken off the bank not proportional to the amount of confronting done on the bank you might or might not understand what i mean by that but it means that the charge of aberration on person is so great that when it comes to the exact things which prevent him from being clear when it comes to those exact things he cant see you could drill him all you wanted to you could educate him all you wanted to you could let him list actually as one fellow did i think eightyseven pages and so forth and he still wouldnt put down the item youve got to have so i had to break timehonored thing had to break the auditors code slightly its still not all right to evaluate for the pc and tell him whats wrong with him and allthat sort of thing i had to break the auditors code slightly and tell the pc what he should be looking for and the moment i started that it worked and little more important than that to and you eventually it made it necessary to have the exact pattern of the bank and boy are you lucky youre just lucky thats all i mean if the pattern was varied from person to person and from aberrative reactive mind to reactive mindif human beings were each superindividualized on this single pointoh well i dont know how many thousand hours it would take to clear somebody it would just be absolute agony and youre just lucky its all the same its all the same bank to bank person to person it doesnt matter what goal you get it doesnt matter what person you grab ahold of because ive sampled enough of them thereweve got couple of students on the course here that arent human and they all work on these principles and that made you very lucky if you had any idea of the amount of agony involved in getting what is called reliable item wrong way tolisted wrong way to the pc feeling like hes being crushed everything descending on him hydraulic presses moving in from every side and the poor auditor sitting there saying ohoh oh what am i doing to this poor pc you know and the pcs groaning and hes getting flatter and flatter you know and his face is turning blacker and blacker and hes going down further and further and finally theres tremendous arc break and he gets sick and everything goes to pieces and thats that well weve left that day behind us its not just clearing that i am announcing but very easy clearing because weve got the pattern of the bank i went back 216 trillion years after not clearing the first eight banks at all but just taking the charge off the goal putting my head back on and eventually we got the basic pattern and the basic pattern is terribly simple and now we find the truth of the matter english is an inadequate language you know of all the things i expected to find that wasnt one of them you know i thought well we of the anglosaxon race dominating earth have of course the best possible language and its got holes in it it has concepts that cannot be easily expressed so your pc occasionally gives you something that sounds like absolute gobbledygook and its not in foreign tongue its in englishbut youd swear it was ill give you an example here is reliathey arent all like this fortunately theyre all water or cat whisker or catch catfish you see theyre all very simple in the most part except in the top of the bank the very part which prevented people from getting clear and there you find such words on goal that contains capitalism you find word there capitaltivity and the pc cognites like mad you see and you sit there and you say and then the main liability of clearing today is you cant pronounce some of them to read the question to the pc i was so glad to get off of an ri the other night reliable item and get onto the next one that i practically erased it off the line plot you know lets see if i can remember what this thing was its the same goal capitalistishness now if you can say that with break in between youre linguist capitalistishness i got pretty good at it you try it the ri form in that particular place has to be ishness and thats all it can be so its got to be whatever the goal ending is ishness and lord help these people that have goal like to skate up the side of the empire state building and dive into the local pool where is the ishness is it after the pool does skate become skut but these problems are very easy ones these problems are veryvery pleasant problems the problem of seeing the pc just sort of disappear from sightarc break go out and tell all of your neighbors that you murder babiesthat problem was too much for us and we could never have survived it in actual fact so we have the pattern and the students over in z unit walked around this thing they walked around every quarter of it and they looked at it and sniffed at it suspiciously and they said its just some more hope factor and couple of them said well i dont think its right for ron to invade our banks this way and tell us what word should be there and that was before they found their proper top oppterm as its called as soon as they did that sniffsniff top terminal ssss second top oppterm hey hey and then several auditors started getting worried it was too easy so they started going back to the top oppterm did they have the right one and so forth and you knowspend couple of sessions the pc getting blacker and blacker you know then he got back on the line again did it work was it this way was it that way did this fit in here did that go in there and it did so on and not very long ago mary sue walked into the z unit down here and pc you know insession usually you can tell pc who is insession you know because they dont look up when the instructor comes in you know but in this particular casein this particular case why the pc looked up and leaned over as mary sue came in the door and says we got three ris already and the auditor turned around and beamed you know and he said yeah we got three ris yeah and these characters couldnt be tied down with an anchor right now i think now you dont have to take my word for it ask them theyre around youll see them theyre the ones that are smiling in spite of the weather but it got easy it got easy and how did it get easy well because there is standard patternthere is standard pattern to the reactive mind it is so standard as to absolutely stagger you you wont believe it yourself we have the meter that will do the job we have the auditor techniques that make it possible for it to happen and our main thing right now is developing methods to find ris faster well you dont have to find them faster youve already got them the problem is is how do you write that fast thats right that is that is and breakfast this morning mary sue and i were going over this id dreamed it up that you could take platenand we were discussing how we would do this and you could take platen and put it over the line plot and on one side of it it gives you the question by which you treatwith which you treat an opposition terminal and it has hole in it you know in the platen and on the other side on the same sheet there is the one that fits the question that fits for terminal you see and its actually now streamlining down the wording you could put number in here and put number over here on list and then do your list from that number like fortyone you seeodd numbers would be opposition terminals fortyone and then take what the pc says and when youve got it transfer it instantly right in the middle of this platen you see and then ask that question and get the next one you see and thats fortytwo and write 42 and list the three or four or five items that the pc gives you get the right one there pick that up and put it into that platen and we possibly will be able to get it up to an ri minute thats what were looking for an ri minute now two ris week was what the z unit was shooting for that was fifteen hours and i kept pushing them along and pushing them along and making them get more interested in this and they got it down to halfhour or something like that and mary sue was already leading considerably on this and she got it down to one every eighteen minutes one everyi think her last average was nine minutes and now were hoping to bring it down to one minute why why thatsthe length of time it takes to clear is now not dependent upon the speed or the nonsense that you have to go through in terms of can the pc do this or can the pc do that dont you see the pcs sitting there with line plot ending in front of his face he simply puts the next one down on the line you know he may have to word it two or three or four different ways but when he gets it he knows hes got it so the speed of clearing depends on the length of time it takes to find goal plus the number of minutes it takes to find an ri now why are we talking about this and im in high level of technical for some of you i know and you possibly wont find it terribly interesting but it means the speed with which man can achieve all the way up because firstgoal clear secondgoal clear thirdgoal clear these are meaningless terms there are about twenty or thirty banks back there and in thirteen banks you have 650 items now if you found an itemwell figure it out yourselfyou found an item every ten minutes it would take you 150 hours and if you found an item every minute it would take you fifteen hours speed of advance dont you see because heres the news you cant stop short of ot you cant stop yes you can find persons first goal yes he feels wonderful yes everything is fine yes hes better than ever he was before but youve already got him in the next bank hes not any longerhes longer interested in this goal to shoot sparrows see hes longer interested in that goal thats dead thats gone thats longer part of his life hes now interested in thatthis goal to preserve wheat see this is the one you know and he sits there and he talks to you about preserving wheat and preserving wheat and you say well how about this how about this goal to shoot sparrows you know thisthis goal to shoot sparrows now on that goal has anything been suppressed well yes lots has been suppressed on that well now about wheat all right as soon as you got him all out of that area about wheat everything is fine and so forth goal finding is nothing inside the bank absolutely nothing i mean ive got this taped all you do is do final oppose list and it gives you the next goal bang just like that all right now you go through it on that pattern you get to the end of that bank you do your next final oppose list youve got your next goal do you understand oh yes youve got to keep them cleared up oh yes youve got to do this and that yes youve got to brush it all up but will the pc let you thats the question there is stopping immediate direct stopping short of now thats technical information so what is this thing called clear so what is this thing what does it amount to in the final analysis well if you realize that under this term clear comes the heading of every hope man has ever had and every effort he has ever made to attain freedom every concept he has had that people are in trouble every concept hes had that he is sick that he doesnt like where he is that he doesnt like what hes doing that he cannot exist or survive in his present environmentall of those things one right after the other are lined up against clearing all of those things what in essencewhat in essence was some messiah selling way back on the track i dont care how far back what was he selling he was selling being clearbeing clear of earth he was selling being happy not being aberrated not being upset not being worried not being trapped he had to invent new trap called heaven in order to accomplish this where you sat endlessly strumming on harp and so forth and im not against people having heaven people say that im antireligious im not antireligious im proreligious im against people who are antireligious because this dream about strumming the harp you see for eternity doesnt appeal to i have an ri which didnt get well discharged called conventional music anyway the facts of the case are that you are dealing with commodity you professional auditors and students you are dealing actually with commodity which is as old as man isin fact older youre dealing with his hopes to be free or to be happy now whatever bank he is in whatever goals or purposes he may have these things are dominated by these other things in spite of the fact that hes postulated himself goal to go to jail he in actual fact wants to be free man wants to be free wants to be happy what are the common denominators of mans hopes well these are it now those that are totally overwhelmed will only hope for those things which are in their reactive minds they themselves have further volition as individuals they are totally dictatedto totally dominated people and you see these chaps around now of course the worst thing that can happen to spirit is to become totally enmeshed in the physical universe so that every time he touches something he cant get off of it and every time he is in something he cant walk out of that and so forth so naturally youd expect the blokes around who are causing the most uproar about the human spirit and getting clear will be scientists because these poor fellows have been shoved by their educational pattern just deep into the physical universe as you possibly can gettheyre around so oni wonder if ergs go twitch or if they go twatch what is happening with these ergs and so forth and they get closer and closer to this you know and they eventually think well there is such thing as freedom there is just standing here watching this electric bang you know and they tend to turn around and say well you cant be free that there is individual and you know you think this is something new you think this is something new i was back on the track 196 trillion years on the pattern and what do i find there what do i find there the complete conceptthe complete concept that man was evolved from mud and there is spirit i mean they really worked at it for long time but even those fellows are in the same category as the atheist if you ever want to have fine religious argument talk to an atheist because if there is any man who believes in god its an atheist youll hear old priests and so forth tell you this give an atheist any day rather than lukewarm believer these fellows of course must be admitting the existence of god in order to contest him with that violence and validyou see i mean hell say he doesnt exist you know and thats all they do you know they keep going around he doesnt exist you know and well the atheist of our times of course is the scientist or the fellow who is in there with his scalpel making copy for tv programs he is worried about health hes worried about care of the body hes worried about these things he is so immersed into the idea of the physicalness of things that he cannot even conceive of the nonphysical things he cant conceive of nonphysical existence and if you think about it for moment thatyou present it to somebody and say think of nonphysical existence and the guy will think lets see being in the country and not having anything to do thatsno thats country and hell work at it and hell work at it see but to others of you with more confront on the line and less bowed down by all this why it becomes very simple you can conceive of nonphysical existence well you ask scientist who isor doctor of medicine or something like this to conceive of nonphysical existence and he cant make the grade so what are we doing we must be healing or we must be doing something to the body or we must be doing this or we must be doing that and one poor auditor over in virginia was actuallythey never sentenced him by the way the judge kind of looked kind of shamed and forgot about the whole case and i think it was years ago and i dont think theyve ever called him back to court but they proved conclusively that he was guilty by grabbing off some people he had cured of things and they said he must be healing because he has been curing people well you say that proves itself and it proved itself to the court and everything but this auditor wasnt trying to heal anything in other words by getting person little less immersed into the physicalness of things and by getting person up so that he could look around and find there was something else about it all why people got well and naturally this made scientology healing science well it is it is but these chaps who are terribly immersed in the physicalness of it all will be the only people who give you any argument theyre the people who argue with you about scientology and about clearing theyre the people that clearing cant be defined to so you try to downgrade what clearing is and that sort of thing and you try to make it so that they can comprehend it and youll find yourself eventually getting into healing you say well if youre cleared you dont have sore spine and the fellow says well thats good thats good see thats fine he understands that he cant conceive of not having spine see he thinks this would be terrible he thinks this would be awful he cant conceive of having comfortable spine that he doesnt have to be in contact with you see all he can conceive of is sore spine in other words his attention is so riveted on his difficulties that scientology redefines itself down into what you do for his difficulties do you see that see he hasnt any breadth of view to see anything else so you get clearing defined as an adding machine term you say well theres the helddown five you know the old example you say this machine has something stuck in it and every time you try to solve problem on this computer the mind why it adds five or it multiplies the thing by five and by multiplying these things by five of course you get nothing but wrong answers wrong answers wrong answers now if you go into it and take up this piece of solder or correct this fault it will then give you correct answers and that is clearing and the guy will say gosh you know thatthats right thats right clearing then is staying inside of the necessity to use computer clearing is having to have mind that figures things out for you in good working condition without its fives held down by stray piece of solder you get the complicated definitions you get into and thats why you will always see tremendous number of definitions of clearing but man in essence in the final essence on the full track has always looked at this can he be happy does he have to be trapped can he be free does he have to be where he is does he have to walk on this treadmill of life does he have to grind along the way hes going now and hes always had little spark that said he always has kept with him some tiny little shadow of feeling that it might not necessarily be so it might not necessarily be impossible to achieve freedom or to be happy hes always kept this with him and hes expressed this in various ways hes expressed it via religion hes expressed it inwell even in psychoanalysis he has expressed it in all manner of odd practices here and there all of these various humanitarian efforts of some kind or another hinge over slightly into clearing now how do you get somebody into some sort of shape how do you get somebody squared around well what are you trying to square around youve got limited view on the part of the person youre talking to and that persons attention is fixated on the problems which he has right now those are the important problems the second you shift his attention by clearing up those problems his attention goes on to another set of problems which gave psychology total defeatism and it said it was good trying to do anything for anybody because if you cured up one thing they got something else wrong with them they didnt realize that they were walking chain from this wrongness to that wrongness to that wrongness if they cleared up each one in turn they would eventually have come to the end of the road and there wouldnt have been any more wrongnesses to clean up any of you as auditors who have ever run process like tell problem tell problem tell problem tell problem know that sooner or later you run to sort of an end of chain and the fellow looks around and he says well i feel much better about my problems see youve gotten this chain of lineups and youve directed his attention to this one to this one but something else was happening you were as ising these problems you were actually clearing now anybody here could simply sit down and ask somebody tell your problem and when they said it dont try to do anything about it say thank you very much tell your problem see tell your problem thank you tell your problem just that much discipline and the next thing you know theyd have walked through whole chain of problems and the person wouldnt be so worried he wouldnt have all these problems i think thats quite interesting because that you see is clearing what are you doing youre clearing chainlittle chain of problems all right now lets magnify this little bit further and lets take this individual and do book one clearing hes had great many traumatic experiences and hes fallen downstairs and bumped his head and done this and done that and the funny part of it is you can run each one of these things out as mental image picture or an engram you can run each one out you can take every time he fell downstairs and bumped his head and you could run him through that experience of bumping his head and what do you know you can feel it again this is by the way what gets psychiatrists this really fascinates them oh this upsets them about dianetics and scientology but it really doesnt upset them they become terribly intrigued you can reexperience pain hey and you can show them on meter you can pinch psychiatrist and go ahead pinch hardand show him that when you pinched him it made the meter go flick and then say return to the moment i pinched you and run him through the pinch and hell see meter go flick again and he can see the registry of his own being pinched and then he says there is such thing as psychic trauma freud was right so he goes studies freud every physical experience every misemotional experience person has been through is in itself sort of trap where he has been impinged upon the physical universe or his associates to such degree that he cannot get free from that point you have an automobile accident the fellows still stuck in the automobile accident all right you run the engram of the automobile accident what have you done you have cleared an automobile accident now what we have actually done is walk up this gradient scale tell problem the engram weve walked further into other things and finally have found the personalities person has formed for himself and we can run them out now at one minute easiest auditing you ever did you dont have to go through them you dont have to check them you dont have to do anything with them its just if they reacted on the meter and you can oppose them and youve got your proper meter blowdown if the signs were there that was it and boom and what do these things amount to look in the top present time area of persons reactive mind you will find in matter of four or five of these reliable itemsjust that many great numberyou will find all of his hidden standards all of the things by which he judges everything by you know does scientology work all right hell be sitting there saying does scientology work does scientol hes not being processed hes saying does scientology work does scientology work well that auditing command made the pain in my ear little more intense so the end of the session yes he had some gains he knew scientology might possibly work because the pain in his ear became more intense that was his total frame of reference he realized thaton auditors reports that your pc is sitting there comparing everything that is happening toward the hidden standard he must have what would have to happen for you to know that scientology worked that is one of the most amazing questions youve ever asked anybody and im sure youve asked them that what would have to happen and hell give you some wild hidden standard well thisthis feeling of heart palpitation i have would have to stop and if you checked back youd find out every time he was ever audited to find out whether or not he had done the auditing command he consulted his heart palpitation it told him whether or not scientology was valid now i dont care for the opinion of heart palpitation and to that degree why weve been driven on forward because pcs are that way and they act that way so there must be more to it there must be more to them well all right heart palpitation tells him whether or not scientology works now whats his chronic present time problem by that i mean whats he worry about all the time what does he worry about all the time well actually he doesnt know but he will have something like mother or he will have something like boss or he will have something like the terrible state of the london underground and this is just worry worry worry worry and all contained in this top hamper of ris well thats interesting because weve suddenly put our fingers on two almost unsolvable problems for the auditor the auditor has had these problems walking at his side every time he ever audited pc he says to this pche says to this pc from where could you communicate to the back of your head and the pc says yes there what has the pc done he hasnt just elected spot there hes asked his heart palpitation where he should be located to communicate to the back of his head some weird mechanism has gone on by which he consulted something in himself to find out if there was any rightness to anything he was doing how has this boy been living his life should he take the new job well why well when he thinks about taking the new job he gets worse heart palpitation should he eat an ice cream cone yes why well when he thinks about an ice cream cone it doesnt increase his heart palpitation these is his total standards of correctness do you see he feels chill coming over him and he does the things which dont turn on the chillget the mechanismand doesnt do the things which turn on the chill and this is the way hes living his life why because his life is miserable life and he doesnt want to have anything to do with it yet this is the sort of life hes living but you as the auditor have this person in the auditing chair and you are saying have you made any of your gains in this session and the person exteriorizes from the heart palpitation just to this degree was the heart palpitation better or worse during the session if it was better hell say yes i made lots of gains in the session if it was little bit worse he will say i didnt make any gains in the session and you havent asked human being whether or not scientology gave him any gains in that session youve asked heart palpitation i consider this quite interesting when you figure out how hard you work so therefore it actually calls for technology which gives total defeat to these mechanisms now you cure up this personthis person comes in with chronic present time problem hes worried about his marital affairs and he comes in and you give him some auditing and so forth and you have to work like mad to clear up this situation and the funny part of it is you can clear up his heart palpitation the funny part of it is you can clear up his chronic present time problems and so forth with older scientology technology but you could also miss and it could also come back on you in the form of the pc saying well he got along fine for two years but now all of sudden just because hes got new mistress his wife is complaining and you say in other words if you continued to deal in auditing with the tiny little things the persons attention simply goes on to other little tiny things that are also wrong and you have an absolute endless concatenation of tiny little things which just never seemed to clear up and you just have endless processing and so forth well therefore clearing is relative term at what level do you clear well we have understood clearing at the level of book one fine still valid still valid thats about the equivalent of firstgoal clear with this slight exception in view of the fact you have him in his reactive mind and are going on to the next goal you actually dont get much of an opportunity to turn on his sonic and visio and so forth hes too interested in the next bank you could of course haul off with forte main and give him prepcheck of that first goal and straighten it all out and you could undoubtedly come close to attaining the exact requirements of firstgoal clear his chronic present time problems thats gone his hidden standards are gone he can think on the track his education is more available to him all of these various things are factual but hes got another bank and hes got another bank he hasnt got an infinity of banks they are fantastically long they considerthe various aspects of existence are considered in terms of trillions one of these banksits trillionswhich is quite interesting when you get bank present timelet us say this is this lifetime you see just this little span here have you any idea as an auditor how many problems he has in one lifetime how many engrams he has in one lifetime how many times hes fallen down how many steps on how many stairs in one lifetime how many worries and upsets and various considerations hes had in one lifetime youve got an idea of that havent you its large number well this lifetime if we drew line here representing the number of ages which an individual has actually come up through andthere are some liabilities to whole track clearing and one of them is the fact that you slapping the idea of past lives and everything else gets slapped right at the person best thing to do is say nothing about them just go on and audit the pc he comes up after while and he i think that uhsomething very disturbing about this it seems to like thisthis item weve just found here this item weve just found toto fly spaceships its spaceship pilot itits quite while ago is that all right you dont have to tell him word about it you dont have to operate as any salesmanship anyway if this was the line which represented the whole track i could not make mark with this pencil or dot tiny enough to represent one lifetime now thats the magnitude of your problem i just couldnt make tiny enough mark to go up against seventy years versus trillions its too too microscopic now one of theseif this was the whole track gpma goals problem mass part of the reactive mindis about so they tend to get longer yet you can useone of these sections here actually represents one of these gpms and they are very finite number theyre very small number i dont know exactly what the number is justim just giving you an educated guess they vary from person to person but the educated guess would beand dont hold to this later onbut twentytwo twentyfive something like that i consider that quite interesting very few of these well you get back into the whole mechanism of human beingness and human livingness and you get back into all of the aspects of personality and all that sort of thing and to conquer all these things at one fell swoop and to deliver into mans hands in one fell swoopbangthe idea that he can accomplish the goal of every religion of all of his own desires to survive and to be happy and to be free and these things can be delivered into his hands in something likewell lets be reasonable three hundred hours plus the time necessary to find the first goal that would be the most reasonable estiand thats an estimate i would make today based on auditing of two weeks ago but not on this weeks auditing i wouldnt base it on this because thats just little bit faster but nevertheless you get into some amounts of difficulties trouble in running one of these things is if you make mistake early on in it and then go halfway through ityou know twentyfive reliable items later you have to go back to ri one and correct the mistake and then refind the same items but youve got to refind every one of them in sequence down to where you finally had gotten to its selfpunishing mechanism youve got to be accurate if youre not accurate youve got to go all the way back to the beginning and go all the way through to that item again well this amounts to what this amounts to an absolutely overwhelming incredible completely unbelievable unacceptable announcement because im not announcing that you can clear somebody in three hundred hours plus the time necessary to find the first goal thats not what im telling you see im not announcing that probably following these exact techniques it might take you upwards to twentyfive hours to make firstgoal clear if you had the first goal thats twentyfive hours actual auditing time if you were very expert and didnt run into any hard luckplus the time necessary to find the first goal youd have firstgoal clear its getting in under the heading of with an expert auditor twentyfivehour hgc intensive makes one firstgoal clear plus the length of time necessary to find the first goal now that is the bug and ill talk to you about that later this afternoon finding that first goal it takes timetakes about two and half hours to do source list and null it to find the second goal see thats nothing thats all there once youve got him in the middle of the hurricane why its very easy to find the additional clouds but when hes standing without knowing there even is hurricane its very hard to find the first one and thats highly variable figure and ive been working on that like mad and ive got it condensed down quite bit but it is the variable figure on how long it takes to clear were not actuallyim not actually telling you this about clearing im talking to you about ot and this is an ot congress and its just sort ofi dont even think the students on the course are aware of the fact that they are not involved in clearing theyre involved in oting weve gotyou see why clearing is relative statement any time youve run problems intensive on somebody youve cleared himof what youve cleared him of some problems any time that you have run any other type of auditing activity on the individual you have cleared him of something you see viewed from that standpoint we can finally walk up to the noun clear now what do we mean by clear well just take it arbitrarily as the book one definition just take book one as it describes clear well call that clear then theres clear above this theres clear of body we call that theta clear but there are actually two kinds of clears and this is what i had better talk to you about you can key out clear now there are two waysthere are two ways to handle man and river one get him far enough away from the river so he isnt getting wet and the other one is to let him swim the thing so he can get familiar with it and so he doesnt have to worry about rivers every clear we have made up to this yearand we have made clears every one has been keyedout clear the techniques we had simply removed him from the immediate proximity of the bank and when that needle went free he was in fine shape and he was very happy and he might be that way for three months and he might be that way for three years and some i made lord knows how long ago may still be clear as bell but thats keyedout clear that is pulling the individual out of the entrapment but leaving him with it there floating in the distance somewhere in his bank very worthwhile state if we couldnt do anything else we could do that and thats why you havent heard too much from from clearing because we could have madeyou know i havent been going around saying soandso and soandso about clearing because we could have made at any time keyed out clears and i could have worked or researched in that direction but i knew there was river to swim what keyed these fellows in what did they come up against what was this huge black thing that they would sometimes run into what were these black fives what was all this sort of thing and i knew there was something there now not only found out what was there but found out what it was composed of and how to get rid of it and how to get through it and how to get across it and so forth that has all been discovered so we have the actual stable state of firstgoal clear hell never get that first bank back dont worry about that thats gone how about the next bank though hes worried about that now well the mystic had what they call the abyss the buddhist had certain things about all this but the abyss was very interesting we had plateau low plateau and then there was higher plateau where man could be happy or more cheerful or more able freer and so forth where he could attain his various ambitions and lying between these two plateaus was deep chasm an enormous chasm bottomlessly deep and the trick was to get across that chasm without dropping into the abyss this actually is older than buddhism the buddhist not only fell into the abyss but deified it thats nirvana you would laugh if it werent so sad imagine this fellow trying by meditation by being silent by being good by never causing anything by this by that by fantastic practices imagine his final goal he can get into the gpm without an auditor map nothing you read the buddhistic descriptions of nirvana after youve been through gpmyou take look at those and youll say hey those characters are talking about gpm theyre talking about these personalities and theyre talking about this and theyre talking about that and how its all this way and how its all that way and and you look at buddhist picture sometimesits not accurate for an auditing map but you wantclip one out of book sometime if the pc wants to know what his gpm looks like just take buddhist nirvana and say well there thats it camels and horses and little men sitting around man total reward now therethere is the illusion of the abyss in other words you can get well if you dont fall in and this was the message of the mystic and thats perfectly accurate message and is perfectly true today you had to go through however you had to go through and across and over this chasm and that chasm still exists and what is it well its the reactive bank and its certain number of items and we know exactly what it is and it hurts like the dickens and it knocks your head on and off again and on again and the pc sits there and he goes huch and you say whats the matter and he says ohoh i just got nice somatic you know he gets plenty of somatics going through this thing well inexpert auditing could drop him into the middle of the abyss partial knowledge of this thing could drop him into the middle of the abyss an inability to handle the pc could drop him into the abyss dont you see so the mystics ancient ancient illusion is still with us thats very good i said at the end of book one i said for gods sakes build better bridge remember well we did been working ever since and when you can run engrams i dont know how long space one item covers but it covers an awful long term in time and when you can run all the engrams in half thousand lifetimes by saying to the pc what opposes catfish catcher and the pc looks and he says aa catfish catcher tschsss whats that which way did that go whats this the meter goes boom bang rocket read blowdown and so forth what have you just done its utterly fantastic youve taken the central fixation which was with him for many lifetimes and on which he operated for many lifetimes and youve now vanquished the enemy and the person who thought that was an enemy and youve unfixated his attention across those spans of lifetimes in just that flashtwo minutes thats why i tell you the things incredible absolutely incredible its unbelievable dont try to believe it do it funny part of it is that if we went down to mohammedan churcha mosqueleft our slippers outside and told the girl auditors they couldnt come inwomen dont have any souls in mohammedanism thetans theyre thetanless bodies walking aboutand we went in and we talked to the muezzin or whoever it is and we said hey you know you can clear people oh yes yes hed say just spread your prayer rug and bend to the east five times day wash your hands regularly follow the koran and you got it made you say yeah yeah yeah thatsthats right thatsthank you thank you thank you very much now what i said was you probably didnt hear mewe can clear people well hed say yeah whats that youd say well weve found that some of your people havent gone to heaven theyre still around earthbound they dont take off hed call in some wise men and theyd consult about it and after while hed come out and hed say to us how can we get our hands on them not going to heaven this waythe way theyre supposed to you see and giving them total defeat youd say well you have to clear them well how do you do that well you say you get an auditor and an emeter and you do this and you do that and hed say well i dont know thats pretty heretical thats pretty horrible and besides this idea of these people still being around yes we can appreciate that we can appreciate that and they shouldnt be they should have gone to heaven or they should have goneat least had the good graces to go to hell or wherever it is mohammedans go and then hed have thought this is rival activity theyve got their own private heaven theyre trying to ship people to and theyre trying to ship some of our people to their heaven and he would have understood it then totally in the framework of mohammedanism and then we would have had long and involved arguments the funny part of it is if wed talked to mohammed hed say is that so oh really hoho hey what do you know and youd say yeah yeah you know man isnt his body and just like you said you know he goes out of his head and so forth and by the way it was great shock that the radio listening population of new york had just few weeks ago you knowyou know that thomas wife exteriorized professor he part of the new york organization over the radio one of the more popular radio programs and he told this professorthe way i get the story rather fragmentarilyto be try not to be three feet back of his head and the guy was three feet back of his head and what did that do to his materialism and that was done before its estimated about million new yorkers must have been quite shock but everybody who heard that got different interpretation on it because they interpret it in their own variety of trap dont you see but there somebody can go outside of his head you could show mohammed how you actually could exteriorize and so forth and he would have thought this was pretty interesting we could have talked to buddhawe could have talked to buddha with the greatest of ease now buddha was the first boy to bring this up and popularize it here on earth he probably got it from about ten thousand years ago the monk dharma had certain things about it and they were talking about clearing and buddhaif you talk to buddhist talk to him about not clearing but becoming bodhi and hell say oh yeah yeah if you dont cause anything you know theres where the bank is really stuck where the individual has said he will cause nothing why if you want to find nice big black lump in bank find where the individual decided never to cause anything or to be very wise and to oppose nothing hed be stuck right in nirvana anyhow if wed talked to buddha about this he would have said hey now you mean we arent going to have to sit and look at our navels for twenty years you mean you sit on that side of that and you go out of your head and these various things and the cycle of birth and death then cease and boy he would have been right with us see he would have been right with us the buddhist today might regard us with little more suspicion but hed understand this what are we communicating to here on earth we are communicating to people who are fixated on things they dont want to be on and clearing to them means becoming unfixated from those things they dont want to be fixated on thats clearing thats what it means to these people what it means to us may be an entirely different broader wider thing we sense the possibilities of this we know where were going as we go along we get greater and greater realities on thistheres hardly any of the oldtimers here who hasnt at one time or the other bunged somebody out of his head and had momentarily theta clear on his hands and sometimes theyd bung somebody out of their head and he got stuck against the ceiling and they had nontheta clear theyve done all sorts of tricks with these things but these tricks are now all possible and feasible without anything else going on we have moved so far ahead of anything that we were with that now we understand everything we know and thats something that nobody else has done for long while on this track and where we try to communicate clearingwhere we try to communicate clearing where we try to put it across were going to be understood to the degree that the listener is fixated on certain problems that he himself has and to that degree we will communicate what clearing is we have the embarrassments many embarrassments go forward with us many embarrassments whole track and past lives thats very embarrassing because it makes it necessary for the individual to sort of say well youve lived before and this can be contested so you dont to clear somebody even have to tell him hes lived before you start running him through the bank he finds it out bang you dont have to tell him anything about it dont broadly try to sell it because its an incredible action youve got plenty to say you just say well were going to clear you the fellow understands what you mean he understands perfectly youre going to get him so that he doesnt have to he doesnt have to have an itchy end of his nose and that will be the frame of reference by which he understands it we dont have to talk about you have lived before but great deal of knowing great deal of technology tremendous amount of knowledge comes into the hands of person being cleared its fantastic fantastic how much knowingness all of sudden comes into his hands heshisoh golly i remember in earlier clearing and so forth an old lady sitting there telling the auditortelling the auditor how you commanded space vessel dear old lady got little bonnet ribbon on her chin shed gone into the session like creeping mouse and she came out stamping down the steps in her space boots the point is you dont have to educate them you only have to start in clearing them and actually the point of clearing may begin with tell problem and the guy gets cleared to some slight degree from the problems he is engrossed with or entangled with now what lies up beyond that becomes as ive been telling you incredible and unbelievable it is incredible and unbelievable because youre telling man all in one breath everything that man or life has hoped for on the track whether through religion or anything has now been realized today hell say youre mad hell believe you if you say you know those problems youre worried about well i could audit you out of them how do you audit it out well were going to find your goal oh my goal hey thats getting interesting and when youve got the goal now were going to find your top oppterm oh thats very interesting yes its soandso after youve told him what it is by the way if its wrong it wont work on the meter i mean thats the big trick it isntit doesnt work because we say so and whats your top terminal and whats that second oppterm and whats the second terminal and whats that third oppterm and whats that third terminal if you got him down few more and just left him there he might not even suspect that there is some forty more hes got to find all of his present time problems are gone everything is gone hell be sailing up in the air you can even do this thing wrong ive made the test as to whether or not its safe these various things youve been doing at long reach can be done rapidly but can they be done safely well yes yes and i did make that test to make sure that you werent going to knock somebody off in sudden moment of enthusiasm one way or the other you can find wrong items wrong goals run wrong goals upside down backwards forwards run whole bank you can actually run eight banks without finding any more in them than half dozen items in each bank leaving some fortysome unfound items in the bank but discharging the goal all of these things can be done wrong and the pc will still live he will scream he will say you have killed him just dont believe him because hes still alive it is very painful it is very upsetting he goes into lassitudes he begins to not care whether life goes on or not he gets into weird mental states but he will neither go mad nor kick the bucket its necessary for us to know that the toughest banks on the track are as old as life itself and ive run one through one of these things with everything upside down and backwards and i lived through it and what do you know the auditor did too anyway i wanted to bring you up to date on clearing i wanted to give you about where it set youre going to be asked lots of questions about clearing and i tried to give you in this lecture vignette an understanding between thee and what clearing is what you tell people it is is your own business you can refer them to books you canpamphlets descriptions anything else thats fine they want to know what clearing is they are going to receive what clearing is to the extent of what they want to be cleared from out there in the street so its just up to you to tell them what you please to make it clear to them and then know what clearing is too okay thank you very much thank you
