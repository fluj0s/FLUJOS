bridge publications inc newsletter date being closer to truth level and its only up around 200 that youll see people producing poltergeist you know you tell something to move by thinking about it and it moves thats why you dont see the phenomena very often in the western world and so that people in the western world dont think it exists that by the way is the usual bottomlevel reaction if i havent implanted it on facsimile for in the physical universe it does not exist whereas as you go up the band you give the person reasons why and the person will all of sudden figure it out and he will know because hes closer up to truth level or not whether it is or it isnt hell know instinctively whether it is or it isnt l ron hubbard excerpted from the scientology milestone one lectures valences and the life continuum an article by l ron hubbard from the scientology milestone one lectures now regret that one has killed or maimed or injured results in another phenomenon the phenomenon of life continuum an auditor must know this phenomenonlife continuum when person has done an overt act to another he conceives that he has taken on the responsibility and responsibilities of this other person including this other persons responsibilities in lifehis goals his physiology his infirmities his computations his methods of doing business all of these things every single one of them can form up into the lifecontinuum pattern now youll find that this phenomenon also exists grandma dies and after that grandma is to be foundin terms of mannerismsin the grandchild this is almost as though grandmas soul has transmigrated or reincarnated into the child on grandmas death not so all this child has done has looked at the fact grandma is dead i dont want grandma to be dead because this is nonsurvival on the dynamics therefore how can i undead grandma all right the way i undead grandma is to figure out what was done to grandma and undo that and then i can undead grandma its rather strange computation but it exists and it exists just in that order so he says to himself lets start with alwayswhat have i done to kill grandma he does the trick then of going into grandmas valence valence is very interesting manifestation an individual will suddenly turn around and become like another individual and stay that way an individual has himself and then he has valences and he can go into dozens of valences theres all sorts of valences theres synthetic valences theres bedpost valences theres yeah thats right youll find people in insane asylums in the valence of bedpost or in the valence of brick wall or something of the sort and then theres composite valences then there is imaginary people valences like practically every girl in america at one time or another has gone into the valence of movie actress sat there and one of the reasons why people go to see picture shows is to steal the valences of the actors and use themgo into those valences the whole subject of acting is actually bound up in the subject of valences an actor only must be able to go into the valence of his charactersee his character well and then step into that valenceand thereafter he will act almost automatically now therefore this manifestation of valences is something with which an auditor will have to deal in addition to that he can actually predict the behavior of those around him by knowing whose valence theyre inif he knew the characteristics of the other valence for instance they say life father like the chances are fair that the is to some degree in fathers valence or to some degree completely out of fathers valence and on opposite polarity like im never going to be like my father if its the last thing i ever do irorrrorrrorrrorr and so he becomes opposite to everything father can do father happens to be good businessman so the of course becomes terrible businessman therefore person can stay out of valences perforce and stay away from everything that is characteristic of that valence or he can be in the valence or he can just leave it alone best thing to do is for an individual to be in his own being thats pretty hard for an individual to do most of the complaints you will get from preclears as fact is i cannot be myself and the people they hate most are the people who inhibited them from being themselvespeople who interfered with them being themselves l ron hubbard from the lecture effort and countereffortovert acts excerpted from the scientology milestone one lectures test your knowledge of the scientology milestone one lectures click
