seriously set back russias efforts toward establishing market ec onomy perhaps for years to come the direct cause of crisis has been the russian governments failure to address fiscal imbalances less

which in turn has led to terioration in genera l economic conditions the crisis has occurred against the bac kdrop of weak russian economy struggling to restructure and rebuild after the collapse of

setback for the russian economy which had realized manag eable inflation rate of 11 in 19973 high inflation rates as high as 2500 in 1992 had been major challenge to russian economic policymakers ever

of 1998 the russian unemployment rate had reached close to 12 having increased from 70 in 19945 while the current crisis cannot be blamed entirely for the unemp loyment problem the decline in economic growth has set back attempts to reduce it high interest rates for critical period in 1998 russian interest rates increased sharply as sign of loss of inve stor confidence in may 1998 interest rates on gkos that is russian treasury bills used to finance government budget deficits roughly doubled from 278 the month before to 548 they continued to climb and peaked at 1353 in august 1998 other critical interest rates also climbed to very high levels the russian central bankss refinancing rate spiked at 150 during the week of may 27 to june 4 1998 while rates have decreased they nevertheless remain

and related to the deterioration in russias domestic economic conditions has been worsening in number of russias external economic indicators exchange rates foreign reserves and trade these trends help to define the crisis fall in value of the ruble and decline in foreign reserves the value of the ruble on foreign exchange ma rkets plummeted at the end of july 1998 the exchange rate was 1r6235

stood at around 123r commensurate with the sharp depreciation of the ruble has been the decline in russian government holdings of foreign rese rves including foreign currencies until august 1998 the russian government tried to maintain stable exchange rate for the ruble but to do so required the russian central bank to sell foreign exchange for rubles when the ruble was facing downw ard pressure

november 1998 russian foreign reserves were at 82 billion9 fall in oil prices and burgeoning pressures on the current account world prices for oil and other raw ma terials have been declining largely because of the asian crisis russia is h eavily dependent on exports of these products for its foreign reserves in 1998 fuel that is crude oil and pe troleum products plus natural gas accounted for 43 of russian exports10 on january 22 1999 the price of russian crude oil urals grade 32 was 1120barrel down from 1579barrel on january 1 1998 and down from 2285barrel on january 1 199711 due to the inefficiency in russian energy producti on and transmission the current oil prices may be less than the average producti on costs for russian oil which underscore russias need for foreign technology and investment to boost productivity in the energy sector the fall in oil prices has decreased russian export revenues causing the russian current account to go from 39 billion surplus in 1997 to an estimated 45 billion deficit in 199812 domestic turmoil signs of financial crisis have been showing up and contributing to domestic insecurity for example payments to coal miners and other workers in staterun companies have been delayed by many m onths creating discontent and insecurity miners have staged strikes blocking th operation of the transsiberian railway effectively dividing the country in half and cutting the countrys main transportation system miners and others have staged pr otests in front of the russian white house demanding payments furthermore the nonpayment of wages to russian soldiers has contributed to morale problems in the russian military causes of the crisis in dissecting the current crisis and trying to explain the reasons it developed two sets of related causes emerge the most immediate and direct causes are the governments financial imbalances and russian fiscal policies that have made russia very vulnerable to the vagaries of the gl obal financial markets the less direct but deeper causes concern the incomplete rest ructuring of the russian economy that has left large part of the economy nonmonetiz ed and run by barter thus making it difficult to resolve the imbalanceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98578crs5 13 economist intelligence unit 4th quarter 1998 p34 14 office of management and budget budget of the united states analytical perspectives fiscal year 1999 p 245 15 russian central bank 16 stevensonimmediate cause government fiscal imbalances russias immediate financial problems center on its fiscal situation the russian government has r persistently high budget deficits while general government expenditures that is expe nditures of the fe deral and regional governments plus extrabudget expenditure s have declined some areas of public spending have not been ade quately controlled the govern ment has not been able to cover its expenditu res with revenues from 1995 and until recently the governme nt had financed much of its budget deficit by borrowing in capital markets and issuing treasury bills known by the russian acronym gkos and bonds on the upside borrowing allowed the government to dramatically reduce infl ation from peak annual rate of 2500 in 1992 to around 11 by the end of 1997 howe ver the low inflation rate may be superficial given that many state employees are not being paid and parts of the economy have increased bartering and ve relied on other nonmonetary means of payment such as interenterprise debt on the downside the russian government had to offer high yields on its treasury bills and bonds in order to attract the necessary capital as result the borrowing added new and heavy debt service burden to the russian budget debt service expenditures have accounted fo r more than 30 of total russian expenditures13 in comparison the us federal government carries debt service burden equal to 15 of the us federal budget14 in 1997 and the beginning of 1998 russian treasury bill rates were av eraging more than 25 per annum adjusting for inflation would make the real interest rate around 10 during the late part of may and beginning of june 1998 the russian government had to boost interest rates on bonds and bills even higher15 notably most russian domestic debt was shortterm with an average maturity of around 11 months that meant the debt had to be constantly rolled over making the russian government highly vulnerable to shortterm fluctuations of capital markets about 13 of the debt is held by foreign investors16 the government also has not been able to rein in subsidies to agriculture the residents of the far northern regions and th oil and gas industries it also has not adequately dealt with social payments to the aged disabled and others who require financial safety net the increasing burden of debt service made it difficult if not impossible to address other budgetary prioritie s payments to workers soldiers pensioners and contractors were deferred build ing up arrears

created the current crisis in sum the russian government surviv ed financially until recently by accruing ever growing debt and government nonpaym ent of fiscal obligations to workers soldiers and others these practices ma sked the weaknesses in the governments ability to rein in subsidies and raise revenues it managed to continue as long as investors were willing to renew shortterm debt but the asian financial problems and other factors created uncertainty in emerging capital markets on the part of investors and slumping oil prices made hard currency re venues scarcer bringing the crisis to head fundamental problem the tax regime and the virtual economy the growth in government financial imbalances and borrowing practices largely explain the suddenness of the current financia l crisis in russia but how russia got to this point of vulnerability analysts ex plain by citing more fundamental problems with russian economic polic and economic structure one such problem has been the inability of the russian government to collect revenues adequate to match expenditures many an alysts and russias western creditors have pointed to russias tax regime as being inefficient and factor in the lack of sufficient tax revenues the ru ssian system has consisted of some 200 different types of taxes at various levels of government federal regional and local making administration of the regime duly burdensome the governments have frequently changed regulations on implementing the tax regime making compliance even more burdensome in addition the governments have granted tax exemptions to favored sectors and enterprises reduci ng the potential revenue analysts have pointed out that the division of tax author ity among the various levels of government has been unclear and conf licts have erupted making tax administration and compliance arduous importantly the gove rnment has not had the resources such as sufficient number of tax inspectors to administer tax collection17 some experts suggest that even if russia manages to reform its tax regime fundamental problems with the structure of the economy will prevent the government from attaining fiscal balance in recent study two experts clifford gaddy and barry ickes describe and analyze what they call russias virtual economy this economy is one in which barter bills of exchange and other nonmonetary means of exchange have largely replaced currency according to the article more than 50 of payments among all industrial enterpri ses in russia are conducted by barter in 1997 the russian federal government receive d 40 of its tax revenues in the form of nonmonetary forms of payment such pa yments system is inherently inefficient and as the authors point out has led to masking of the true value of output which tends to be substantially below what prices indicate in terms of public finance thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98578crs7 18 gaddy clifford and ickes barry w russias virtual economy foreign affairs

soca lled oligarches the group of individuals that have amassed great deal of wealth and who control the major banks and enterprises response of the russian government and the international finance community the crisis came to head on august 17 1998 when the government of then premier sergei kiriyenko ab andoned its defense of strong ruble exchange rate against the dollar forced restructuring of government domestic debt and placed 90day moratorium on commercial external debt payments essentially placing the russian government in default those actions put president yeltsin in precarious position po litically he had nnounced just three days earlier that the government would maintain the value of the ruble on august 23 1998 yeltsin dismissed kiriyenko and his government political dispute ensued between yeltsin and the duma as the latter twice rejected yeltsins initial candidate fo rmer prime minister chernomyrdin placing the country on the brink of constitutional crisis

government individuals largely considered to be less inclined to pursue economic reforms than had the previous governments in the meantime the russian government appealed to the international financial community for assistance after significant deliberations the imf on july 13 announced agreement on new package of 17 billion in new credits the package included new loans totaling 116 billion from the imf 40 billion from the world bank and 15 billion from japan the credits were scheduled to be distributed through 1999 combined with committed but undistributed imf credits of 56 billion the package was to provide russia with 226 billion the imf subsequently turned over to russia 48 billion as the first tranche from the package19 but the imf has ceased making further payments

rate of 30 an exchange rate of 20r1 cooperation in getting foreign debt rescheduled the budget includes only 95 billi on for debt servicing out of 175 billion that is due perhaps most critically the

policymakers choose to manage it has already had an immediate economic impact on russia and w ill have longer term implications for the russian economy and russias efforts to become market economy

zerocoupon bonds and fourfive year coupon bonds paying interest at variable rates beginning around 30 in the first year23 while the foreign banks were not happy with the situation it is not clear that the russian governments financial straits allowed either side much choice the russian government also faces payments of 175 billion due in 1999 on its debt to foreign government and comme rcial creditors including payments due on russian issued eurobonds and repayments to the imf on previously issued credits it also includes payments due on debt ru ssia inherited from the soviet union and which had already been rescheduled wh ile foreign government creditors paris club and commercial creditors london club may eventually agree to reschedule some loan repayments russias financial situation both in terms of its domestic and foreign debt makes it unlikely that it will be able to secure new credits in the foreseeable future absent bt rescheduling russia will be in default on sovereign debt which could intensify and prolong the credit squeeze deepening russias general downward spiral related to the problem of servicing debts the government must immediately address the difficult issue of establishing spending priorities within the constraints of revenues the government faces pressu res on the one hand from the international financial community led by the imf to constrain spending and on the other hand from legislators and others who demand that the governme nt provide more subsidies to industries and defense and alleviate the financial burdens on the elderly and impoverished changing government expe nditure priorities nd increasing revenues will not be easy to reduce expenditures the government must grapple with some politically difficult issues cutting subsidies to agriculture to the norther regions of the country and other favored sector s rationalizing already reduced military expenditures and establishing an economica lly regional social safety net for those unable to make it in the transition to market economy the russian government must also deal with fundamental reform of the tax regime these reforms would have to be passed by the duma
