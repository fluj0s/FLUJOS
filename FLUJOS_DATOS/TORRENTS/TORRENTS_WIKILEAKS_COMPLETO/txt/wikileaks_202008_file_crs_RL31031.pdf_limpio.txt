appropriated more funds for research and development rd than requested by the administration for fy2001congress appropriated 900 billion for rd 92 above the fy2000 level in addition legislation passed the senate in the 106th congress calling for doubling of federal funding for nondefense rd over the next 11 years despite this seemingly favorable climate for federal rd funding however concerns have been raised about the composition of the federal rd portfolio in particular there are questions about whether the funding growth is distributed most effectively among the various fields of science and engineering most of the recent growth in federal nondefense rd funding has been in the life sciences from fy1995 to fy2001 constant dollar funding for healthrelated rd increased by 62 while that for the remaining nondefense rd agencies increased by 95 healthrelated rd now constitutes 45 of all nondefense rd funding up from 35 in fy1990 and 25 in fy1980 for basic and applied research alone the share allocated to the national institutes of health nih which supports nearly all of the federallyfunded health science research rose from 18 in fy1971 to 48 in fy2001 this situation however is not unique during the 1960s funding for space rd absorbed 63 of the growth in federal nondefense rd funding from fy1962 to fy 1968 during the 1970s funding for energy rd accounted for 45 of the growth in federal nondefense rd funding from fy1973 to fy1979 the ratio of the growth of nih funding to that of the rest of the nondefense rd for the fy1995 to fy2002 period however is unprecedented in recent months many observers including supporters of increased funding for health care rd have expressed concern about the fact that the growth in federal funding for physical science and engineering research critical to the nations economic future has not kept pace with that for the life sciences they point out that many important advances in health care and health science in recent years such as magnetic resonance imaging have depended on research findings from the physical sciences and engineering also some observers note that this difference in rd funding growth rates may be contributing to decline in graduate school enrollment in the physical sciences and engineering which could intensify possible shortfalls in the number of engineers and scientists needed by the nation these concerns are likely to appear in at least three formats this congress first legislation to double federal nondefense rd funding over the next 10 to 11 years version of which passed the senate in the last congress is likely to be reintroduced second the administrations fy2002 budget request includes 135 increase for nih while reducing the remaining nondefense rd funding by 3 many in congress have already expressed concern about the latter and attempts may be made to increase funding for several of those other agencies third debate over the allocation of federal rd funding among the various

development portfolio background over the past several years congressional support for federal funding of research and development has grown substantially for each year from fy1997 through fy2001 congress has increased federal research and development rd funding above the administration request over that period federal funding for rd grew by nearly 22 in the last session of the 106th congress the senate passed legislation s 296 calling for doubling of federal funding for nondefense rd for 16 agencies over the next 11 years similar legislation was considered in the house because significant proportion of the growth in rd funding over the last five years has been in the health sciences however questions have arisen about whether the federal rd funding is allocated most effectively among all fields of science the questions do not so much focus on whether health rd is getting too much funding but whether the nonhealth fields are getting adequate support this report addresses that allocation issue recent report from the national science foundation nsf noted that while research and development expenditures have never exceeded 3 of the united states economy rd has been widely recognized as key ingredients for economichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31031crs2 1national science foundation division of science resources studies sixth year of unprecedented rd growth expected in 2000

director of the office of science and technology policy under the clinton administration noted that both public and private investments in rd have generated new knowledge and new industries created new jobs reduced pollution improved medical treatment helped to educate future scientist and engineers and increased living standards for all americans number of economists including those in the current administration attribute much of the nations prosperity in the 1990s to increased productivity stemming in large part from technological development arising from scientific research2 support

contributed 68 of all funding with the federal government contributing 27 and universities and non profits the remaining 5 the end of the cold war growing budget surpluses and the dramatic surge in private sector support for rd have raised questions about the appropriate role the federal government should play in the nations rd enterprise given the private sectors recognition of the important role rd plays in helping to fuel the new high tech economy it is unlikely that the federal government will ever again be the predominant supporter of rd funding as it was in the past nevertheless in recent new york times article allan bromley science advisor to former president george h w bush wrote that technological innovation depends upon the steady flow of discoveries and trained workers generated by federal science investments in universities and national laboratories these discoveries feed directly into industries that drive the economy its straightforward relationship industry is

missions of the funding agencies has contributed to advancements in medicine and health care superior defense technology energy efficient technologies and cleaner air and water the changing federal rd portfolio while it is very likely that the federal government will continue to play crucial role in supporting the nations rd enterprise number of critics in the scientific community as well as some members of congress have raised concerns about the current trends in the federal rd budget portfolio specifically their concerns center around the relative rate of the growth of government research support for the life sciences through the national institutes of health nih as compared to other fields of research primarily in the physical sciences and engineering these critics argue that because the latter have not kept pace with the former the nation runs the risk of having inadequate scientific and technical resources in the physical sciences and engineering while congress appears to be in the process of doubling the funding for nih between fy1998 and fy2003 those agencies that primarily support other fields of science such as the physical sciences engineering and mathematics have seen their funding remain flat or increase less than 5 in constant dollars between fy1998 and fy2001 according to most recent data from the office of management and budget omb nih accounts for 45 of all federal nondefense rd funding in fy2001 up from 35 in 19905 charles wessner member of the national research councils board on science technology and economic policy noted that number of prominent scientists and engineers including harold varmus former nih director have argued for more federal research funding for other scientific disciplines to more closely match the gains in federal healthrelated rd funding dr wessner stated that scientific progress and importantly commercial development often require investments in physics and chemistry and new materials past progress on

spending reveals that setting the nations rd priorities was often crisis driven7 despite the establishment of the national science foundation in 1950 and calls for greater federal support for nondefense rd it was not until the launch of sputnik in 1957 and the creation of the national aeronauti cs and space administration nasa in 1958 that funding for federal nondefense rd begin to expand rapidly in 1955 total federal nondefense rd was 2 billion in fy1996 dollars by 1962 however total federal nondefense rd spending was 13 billion and reached 315 billion by 1966 all in constant fy1996 dollars8 as indicated in figure 1 space science and technology dominated federal nondefense rd funding through the 1960s absorbing 66 of all federal nondefense rd dollars in 1966 after 1970 funding for space rd in constant dollars continued to decline until the challenger accident in 1986 as funding for space rd declined in the 1970s the oil embargo of 1973 1974 led to calls by the congress and

establishment of the department of energy doe and helped to further accelerate energy rd spending between fy1972 and fy1980 energy rd increased 255 in constant dollars however 1980 marked the highwater point for energy rd as it reached 24 of total nondefense rd funding the same percentage as health research that year the election of president ronald reagan in 1980 changed federal rd funding priorities again the reagan administration did not support many of does alternative energy rd activities believing that such efforts should be funded primarily by the private sector thus as indicated in figure 1 funding for energy rd declined to nearly 1974 levels in constant dollars by 1988 concomitantly the reagan administrations creation of the strategic defense initiative sdi along with greater investments in variety of defenserelated technologies led to resurgence of funding in dods and does defenserelated rd programs figure 2 next page compares federal nondefense and defense rd spending since the early 1960s in constant 1996 dollars prior to the 1960s defense rd9 dominated the federal rd portfolio and accounted for over 70 of all federal rd funding however as indicated in figure 2 by fy1966 the disparity between defense and nondefense rd funding had closed significantly federal rd funding remained evenly divided between nondefense and defense activities through the 1960s and most of the 1970s by about 1986 however defense related rd amounted to 68 of all federal rd spending nondefense rd funding even though basic research funding increased in constant dollars during the reagan years declined to pre1964 levels in constant 1996 dollars the end of the cold war in 1991 and the election of president clinton in 1992 marked the beginning of different focus for federal rd10 the clinton administration tied much of its rd strategy to economic growth and technological innovation one of the objectives of the new administration was to increase nondefense rd funding while concomitantly slowing the growth of defenserelated rd as indicated in figure 2 parity between nondefense and defense rd spending was restored in the fy2001

nondefense and defense rd fundingmost of the resurgence of nondefense rd spending however occurred since fy1996 during period of growing budget surpluses the major recipient of the growth in nondefense rd funding was the health sciences primarily the national institutes of health nih figure 1 page 3 illustrates how healthrelated rd has come to dominate nondefense rd funding since 1986 federal health rd funding has increased from 33 of total nondefense rd to an estimated 45 in fy2001 figure 3 next page gives another perspective of theses changes in federal rd funding priorities using comparative federal rd funding data over selected sixyear intervals of the total growth in federal nondefense rd funding between fy1962 and fy1968 63 went to space related rd and 37 to all other nondefense rd of the total growth in federal nondefense rd funding between fy1973 and fy1979 43 went to energy rd while 57 went to all other areas figure 3 also illustrates the extent to which the growth in defenserelated rd dominated total federal rd spending during the early 1980s between fy1979 and fy1985 defense rd received 92 of the growth in all federal rd funding that took place over that period consequently over those six years in constant dollars defense rd funding increased 70 while nondefense rd declined 22 during the most recent sixyear interval fy1995 to fy2001 healthrelated rd in response to major advances in molecular biology and the growing health concerns of an aging american population received 75 of the total increase in federal nondefense rd funding this is the largest such increase for any nondefense rd research area over six year time frame since 1945 it is instructive to compare the 19621968 period with the 19952001 period from different perspective than is presented in figure 3 this is done by comparing the actual constant dollar increases in the space 19621968 and healthrelated 19952001 rd to the actual constant dollar increases of all other nondefense rd fields during those two periods during the 19621968 period constant dollar funding for space rd increased 168 while for all other nondefense rd it rosehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31031crs7

accounted for 64 of all federal nondefense rd funding by contrast during the 19952001 period constant dollar funding for health rd increased by 62 while for all other nondefense rd it grew by 95 healthrelated rd is now estimated to constitute 45 of all federal nondefense rd therefore while the healthrelated rd increase has been substantial compared to other nondefens rd over the last six years the former does not dominate all rd funding the way space rd did during the 1960s nevertheless the ratio of the growth in healthrelated rd funding during the last six years to all other nondefense rd funding is considerably greater than the comparable ratio between space rd funding and all other nondefense rd funding during the 1960s it is this latter fact that appears to be of most concern to critics who argue that funding for physical sciences and engineering rd is being left behind by that for healthrelated rd it is not that healthrelated rd is faring too well that is the crux of their argument it is that the other fields do not appear to be faring well at all federal research funding this overview of changes in federal rd priorities illustrates the extent and diversity of those changes and how historical events along with congressional and presidential responses to those events have helped to shape federal rd policy over the last 40 years clearly other factors such as international competition environmental concerns demographics and changing political philosophies have also influenced the direction of federal rd programs given that federal rd portfolio has undergone many significant changes over the past 40 years it is worth asking why has so much attention been given to the recent growth of healthrelated research in particular

dramatically by concentrating on the research both basic and applied portion of the rd budget11 nearly all of the funds going to life science rd and nih in particular are classified as research figure 4 illustrates the extent to which nihs funding increases have changed the distribution of the research portion of all both defense and nondefense federal rd expenditures among five major federal research agencies12 the chart which is based on nsf data shows the change that occurred in each agencys share of total federal research funding comparing fy1971 to fy2001 total federal expenditures for research funding grew from 5123 billion in fy1971 to an estimated 42752 billion in fy2001 the five agencies in figure 4 account for 80 of all federal research expenditures in fy2001 up from 75 in fy1971 as indicated in figure 4 nih has enjoyed substantially greater increase in its share of federal research funding than any of the other agencies some of whom have seen their share drop looking at the absolute changes between 1971 and 2001 and between 1985 and 2001 for these five agencies in figure 5 next page shows that in constant dollar terms nih has dominated over both intervals between

growth in research funding in nih has dramatically outpaced all other agencies and has been doing so since 1971 this longer term trend has been masked to some extent by the fact that the yeartoyear growth rates for nih were generally only few percentage points higher than the other agencies until the last few years those yeartoyear growth rates for nih however did not vary great deal over time while as noted above they flucuated substantially for the other agencies sometimes becoming negative as consequence the current allocation of total research funding by agency is heavily dominated by nih as noted in this report some members of congress and representatives of the scientific community have voiced concerns about these changes first they argue that the nation needs to accelerate and maintain the growth in federal funding for all fields of science and engineering not just health science they note that federally funded research has played crucial role in the generation of new knowledge technological innovation and the education of scientists and engineers they also point out that the federal research budget consists of broad array of generally long term high risk activities with potential payoffs that may not materialize for many years in the future because the outcomes of such research are unpredictable and have extended time frames it is unlikely that the private sector will support such research on consistent long term basis according to number of reports federal support of basic and applied research has been crucial for numerous technological advancements that have contributed to the nations overall economic growth and prosperity for example federally funded basic research in optics coupled with advancements in lasers led to the development of fiber optics which helped to build the nations modern telecommunications network13 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31031crs10 13continued technological innovation through variety indirect

engineering fall 1999 nsf 01315 feb 2001 30the relationship between the results of physical science and engineering research and advances in the health sciences raises second concern some analysts argue that funding imbalance between life sciences and all other fields of science could weaken this linkage to the detriment of continued advances in biomedicine they note that breakthroughs in health research are often dependent on advances or combination of advances in the fields of engineering mathematics and the physical sciences and that growing support for the latter are also needed if the promises of health research are to be fulfilled magnetic resonance imaging is an example of how physical and engineering sciences underpin advances in medical science14 third concern relates to the increasing interdisciplinary nature of modern scientific research in recent science magazine editorial donald kennedy wrote that an increased proportion of important science and technology challenges will require an interdisciplinary approach15 he noted that advancements in nanotechnologies neuroscience information technology climate change sciences and bioengineering are dependent on disciplines as diverse as chemistry physics mathematics and engineering he argued that scientific gains derived from sequencing the human genome will not only be dependent on molecular biologists but on specialists in bioinformatics trained in mathematics and computer sciences fourth concern raised by the differential growth rates in federal research funding between the life sciences and the physical sciences and engineering is related to the important role played by such funding in educating future scientists and engineers current nsf data on graduate enrollment by field of science suggest that continued funding disparity between health and nonhealth related rd may be affecting graduate enrollment in other fields of science according to nsf data16 the number of graduate students in engineering mathematics and the physical and earth sciences grew from 1975 to 1993 and then declined by 144 from 1993 to 1999 the number of graduate students in the biological sciences on the other hand increased from 1975 to 1999 although there was essentially change from 1993 to 1999 it is possible that the growing publicity in scientific circles given to the large increases in the nih budget relative to other agencies over the last few years may have discouraged some students in the physical sciences and engineering from staying in graduate school because they perceived relatively poor prospects for research funding for those fields when they completed their studies at the same time thosehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31031crs11 17national science foundation data brief science and engineering enrollment in science and engineering increase for the first time since 1993 nsf 01312 jan 112001 2 18it should be noted however that some observers have expressed the view that the growth in nih funding is excessive they argue that the agency cannot effectively spend all of the funding increases it is receiving and in addition may have great difficulty adjusting when the doubledigit growth rates ceaselarge increases do not seem to have triggered proportional increase in graduate enrollment in the biological sciences while graduate student enrollment in engineering mathematics and the physical and earth sciences increased in 1999 for the first time since 1993 the increase was small and was entirely attributed to growth in nonus citizen enrollments graduate school enrollments of us citizens in science and engineering has dropped 9 since it peaked in 199317 some have expressed concern about the u s ability to continue to compete in the global market place if these science and engineering graduate education trends particularly in the physical sciences and engineering are not reversed soon despite these arguments it is not clear that these funding trends are causing serious problems for the nations science and technology enterpri while the premises for each of the four concerns expressed above may be valid there at present does not appear to be any data supporti ng the notion that physical science and engineering research is suffering because the growth in federal funding for those areas is not keeping pace with that for life science research18 new diagnostic technologies are still entering the market witness the advent of the fullbody ct scan and the issue at present appears to be more whether the nation can afford such technologies there has also been fairly rapid expansion of funding for interdisciplinary research in recent years particularly in information technologies and nanoscience and technology in addition it is important to note that declining graduate enrollments may be due to other factors such as strong economy that has lured potential graduate students particularly from the physical sciences and engineering into the workforce growing numbers of minority high school students who have traditionally been under represented in the science and engineering fields and lack of student interest in pursuing fields of study that are considered too academically challenging finally with the pervasiveness and expansion of healthcare concerns in the nation and world significantly more rapid growth rate for health research than other fields over given period of time may be justified nevertheless if this large growth rate differential were to continue for too long the problems outlined above could come to fruition the resources available for federal research funding are not unlimited and eventually these trends could result in damaging shift of such resources away from the physical sciences and engineering research at present it appears that percentage funding increases for nih will fall back to below double digits after 2003 when the current doubling phase is complete it is possible however that even then nih funding growth on average may outpace the other agencies as has been the case over the last three decades see figure 5 congressional issueshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31031crs12 19in the 105th congress

senate and house bills contained similar provisions the bills call for the doubling of basic scientific biomedical and precompetitive engineering research for 16 nondefense agencies including nih dod research activities are not included in the bills over an 11year period further language in the bills pointed out the desire of obtaining balanced research portfolio because of the interdependence the various science and engineering disciplines according to the legislation balanced research portfolio would be achieved by allowing each agencys rd budget to grow 55 per year in order to reach the overall doubling target under this provision if an agency receives an annual increase of more than 8 its total budget may not be counted against the total recommended spending level of all 16 agencies for the following fiscal year for example because nih received 15 increase in fy2001 under this provision its total would not be included as part of the recommended annual funding total for the remaining 15 agencies in fy2002 thus the remaining agencies could increase an average of 55 without exceeding the recommended fy2002 funding level of 45160 billion if nihs fy2001 funding level was included total spending could exceed the fy2002 target and potentially limit the growth of the other 14 agencies the senate bill s 2046 passed by the senate last year recognizes that health research has emerged as national priorityand that the pattern of substantial budgetary expansion begun in fy1999 should be maintained the bill supports the position that rapid growth in nih funding could be maintained while at the same time increasing funding for the remaining 15 agencies contained in the legislation the bill also recommends that by 2011 nondefense rd funding should be 10 of federal discretionary spending up from 7 in fy2001 the house did not pass this legislation in either the 105th or the 106th congress some members expressed concern that the bills may circumvent the

space representative james sensenbre nner then chairman of the house science committee wrote that he could not support longterm authorization bill that includes single annual blanket authorization for

tough questions including how would we know if nih was overfunded in either relative or absolute terms given the public concern with health and the advances in biology shouldnt nih get larger share of the pie chairman boehlert noted that in the past federal rd funding priorities have been driven by other national concerns such as the cold war and the space race while he indicated he was kindly disposed toward doubling bill it would not preclude the committee asking pointed questions such as why double what are we going to get for the money how will we know if we are under or over spending in any field the chairman suggested that passage of such bill would put congress on record that science spending is priority finally he did note that passing such bill should not obscure the fact that doubling will never become reality if we cant make much more solid case to the appropriators at this point comparable legislation has been introduced in the 107th congress

budget will double by fy2003fy2002 rd budget request the administration has requested 952 billion for federal rd spending in fy2002 58 increase over fy2001 included is requested 88 increase for dods rdte budget that would be the first installment of the administrations goal of increasing dods annual rd funding by 20 billion over the next five years the administration also proposed 136 increase in nihs budget maintaining efforts to double the nih budget by fy2003 these two agencies account for the total proposed increase in federal rd spending for fy2002 absent nih funding for all other nondefense rd programs would decline by about 6 in constant dollars the enacted tax cut and the administrations desire to limit the growth of discretionary spending to 4 overall appear to have confined efforts to increase nondefense federal rd funding to keeping the nih budget on pace to double by fy2003 several members of congress have raised concerns about the proposed fy2002 rd budget request at senate budget committee hearing on nih senator domenici then chairman of the committee told health and human services secretary tommy thompson that to increase nih 20 percent and not to increase nsf 100 millionthose are not going to mesh in about five years youre going to have the medical scientists clamoring for where are the physical scientists where are the people that work on the newest physics of machinery and engineers and nano engineers 23 other members expressed concerns that the proposed budget would end parity between defense and nondefense rd and would further exacerbate the growing imbalance between biomedical rd and the physical sciences some members noted that the budget request could stop congressional efforts that began in fy 2001 to double nsfs budget in five years the budget request also maintains the deparment of energys doe science programs which received 15 increase in fy2001 at that years level dear colleague letter is circulating in the house that urges an increase in funding for does science programs in response to these concerns the senate adopted an amendment to the fy2002 budget resolution s res 20 that would provide an additional 674 million for nsf continuing efforts to double nsfs budget 469 million for doe science and 518 million for nasa24 the housepassed budget resolution mirrored the administrations proposed fy2002 budget maintaining 4 increase for discretionary spending while the senate approved an 8 increase the house and senate conference report h res 83 h rpt 10755 provides 5 increase in discretionary spending

2001 p 34introduced hr 1472 which proposes an annual 15 increase in the nsf budget from fy2002 to fy2005 together with 13 increase nsf received in fy2001 this legislation would double the agencys budget by fy2005 at senate omb confirmation hearing senator lieberman asked omb deputy director sean okeefe about the growing disparity in research funding between the life and physical sciences while arguing that the two fields are mutually dependent deputy director okeefe responded by noting that the presidents budget continues to invest in research both at nih and at other agenciesthe nation needs balanced portfolio of research funded by the federal government and the private sector in both defense and nondefense areas and across fields of science for example balanced portfolio of research looked very different during the cold war than it does now we believe that the current portfolio is balanced but we expect to further refine this balance as we assess new and ongoing research opportunities in future budgets25 while the administrations proposed budget projects 15 billion increase for all nondefense discretionary spending in fy2003 over its fy2002 request between fy2004 and fy2006 it projects an average annual increase for all nondefense discretionary spending of 8 billion over the past four years nondefense rd funding has averaged about 14 of all nondefense discretionary spending if this percentage were to be maintained and if the administrations outyear spending projections were to be enacted funding for nondefense rd would likely increase around 2 billion in fy2003 and then drop to slightly more than half that amount over the next three years from fy1998 to fy2001 the average annual increase for nondefense rd was 3 billion in speech to the aaas chairman boehlert discussed the challenges of the administrations proposed outyear spending levels26 he argued that growth in discretionary spending for 2003 and beyond is only enough to cover inflation while acknowledging the actual numbers will be higher he stated that competition for federal dollars will be fierce the house science committee chairman told the aaas audience that supporters of science need to be reinforcing their arguments for science investments he then further defined reinforcing as providing good solid arguments for special levels of spending not just throwing the word doubling around as if it cast magic spell and it means providing good solid thinking about what it may mean to have balanced federal research portfolio establishing federal research and development priorities critics have argued that despite calls from members of congress the white house and the scientific community coherent system for establishing rd spending and programmatic priorities across the federal government does not exist they state that the current approach for allocating funds for federal research is an incremental processhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31031crs16

national science policy committee on science us house of representatives 105th congress september 1998 committee print 105b p 56that may not be model for rational decision making and that there appears to be little coordination within the executive and legislative branches of government in reviewing and establishing federal rd budgets according to study by the national science board the federal rd portfolio for research is treated as an accounting device that aggregates the research portfolios of the individual departments and agencies funding st27 many policymakers in both the executive and legislative branch generally agree that the federal rd budget is not treated or managed as single broad based portfolio of science and technology investments aimed at meeting broad based federal responsibilities past administrations have used the federal coordinating council for science engineering and technology fccset to help establish and coordinate multiagency rd initiatives as well as to help develop policies for effective planning and administration of science technology and engineering across the federal government in 1993 president clinton established the national science and technology council nstc as successor to fccset among its various responsibilities the council assisted in developing recommendations for federal agency rd budgets aimed at accomplishing important national objectives and advising omb about individual agencies rd budget priorities the nstc was responsible for coordinating multiagency research initiatives such as for information technologies and nanotechnologies the council played key role in the establishment of the 21st century research fund multiagency research initiative including dod that the clinton administration hoped would help it promote more balanced research portfolio number of reports have suggested that the current congressional process for establishing rd priorities is disjointed and lacks mechanisms for systematically reviewing and establishing rd priorities across the federal government 1998 house science committee report unlocking our future toward new national science policy 28 noted that decisions about science policy and agencies research priorities are made in large number of congressional committees and subcommittees which can impede the progress and coordination of important projects commonly referred to as the ehlers report it suggested that at minimum congress and the executive branch should improve their internal coordination process to more effectively manage execute and integrate oversight over these kinds of programs while the office of management and budget can fill this role in the executive branch such mechanism exits in congress in 1995 report the national academy of sciences recommended that httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31031crs17 29allocating federal funds for science and techno logy national academy of sciences committee on criteria for federal support

theme by william c boesman crs report 95 235 spr february 3 1995 6pcongress should create process that examines the entire fst federal science and technology budget before the total budget is disaggregated into allocations to appropriations committees and subcommittees29 in apparent recognition of these concerns s 2046 the federal research investment act contains provision that would require the office of science and technology policy to produce an annual report that verifies that the presidents budget for nondefense rd contains focused strategy that is consistent with the funding projections of this title title i for each future fiscal year until 2011 including specific targets for each agency that funds nondefense research development further the legislation directs that the report should examine how any differences in agencies recommended funding levels will affectthe ability of the agencies covered by this act to perform their missions while number of proposals including establishing department of science and technology30 and some attempts have been made over the last several decades to strengthen ombs and ostps role in rd priority setting the success of such efforts has always depended on the extent to which the president believes they are needed or warranted there has been and continues to be support to keep the process decentralized in order to ensure rd priorities for given agency best match that agencys mission and to encourage the diversity inherent in the existing system furthermore while many members of congress recognize that the current legislative process for identifying rd spending priorities is cumbersome and disjointed they argue that such process reflects general belief that power within congress should be decentralized and not placed in the hands of limited number of members such an approach they argue helps to serve the diversity of constituents that members of congress represent and is the best way to ensure that rd funding best serves the broader missions of the agencies conclusion the difference between the rate at which rd funding for nih is growing compared to the rest of federallyfunded nondefense rd is substantial while the existence of such difference between one research field and the others is not unique in the history of federal rd funding since world war ii in some ways the current gap is unprecedented some critics have argued that if this growth rate gap does not shrink by enhancing funding growth rates for physical science and engineering research there could be negative consequences for the nations longterm economic wellbeing and even for continued advances in health care they assert that continuation of the gap as suggested by the fy2002 rd budget request could result in an excessive shift of resources away from physical science and engineering research towards the health sciences such shift however is by means assuredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31031crs18 and it may be too soon to tell whether this growth rate gap is creating any problems for the nation furthermore there appears to be substantial support for maintaining high level of funding for health research in order to attack major health problems that are afflicting growing number of people as the nations population ages in any event congress will have chance to address the issue when it considers the fy2002 budget request and possibly legislation to double nondefense rd funding for most agencies early indications in congress suggest that some members already consider the gap potential problem that can be best addressed by increasing rd funding for other nondefense agencies
