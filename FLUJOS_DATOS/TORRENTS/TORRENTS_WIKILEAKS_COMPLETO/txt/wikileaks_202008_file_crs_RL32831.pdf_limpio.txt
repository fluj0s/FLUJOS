l provisions federal and state laws and political party practices known as the electoral college system1 despite occasional close elections this system has delivered uncontested results in 47 of 51 elections since adoption of the 12th amendment effective in 1804 in three elections the electoral college awarded the presidency to candidates who won fewer popular votes than their principal opponents but majority of electoral votes in fourth the house of representatives decided the cont est by contingent election in this case electing candidate who won fewer popular and electoral votes than his principal opponent2 the most recent instance in which the popular vote runner up received majority in the electoral college occurre d in 2000 when george w bush was elected president over hi s opponent gore jr despite having won fewer popular votes than gore nationwide extremely close nd highly contested results in the pivotal state of florida led to bitter and protracted struggle that continued for over month following election day supreme court decision3 ended further recounts leading to certification of bush electors in florida and the republican candidates subsequent election following the 2000 presidential election bot h the electoral college system and the shortcomings of election administrati on and voting technolog particularly in florida were widely criticized while substantive action was taken on electoral college proposals congress ddressed the latter issue with the enactment of the help america vote act hava pl 107252 116 stat 1666 in 2002 this act established

hava contrast ed with almost complete lack of legislative activity in recent congresses on proposed constitutional amendments that would eliminate or reform the electoral college system and served to highlight the comparative difficulties faced by wouldbe electoral college reformers the fundamentals of the electoral college system were established by the constitution and can only be altered by the much more difficult process of constitutional amendment rather than by legislati on moreover havas prospects for enactment were boosted by the fact that while few would defend the failures in voting administration and technology that helped promote the act th electoral college would arguably be enthusiastically s upported in congress nd the public forum by its various advocates and defenders notwithstanding these hurdles however amendments have been proposed to alter or eliminate the elector college in almost every congress since 1789 this report examines and analyzes alternative proposals for change presents pro and arguments and identifies and analyzes related proposals introduced in the 109th congress alternative approaches direct popular election v electoral college reform wide range of proposals to reform pr esidential election procedures have been introduced over time in recent decades they have fallen into two categories 1 those that seek to eliminate the electoral college system entirely and replace it with direct popular election and 2 those that seek to repair perceived defects of the existing system direct popular election the direct election alte rnative would abolish the electoral college substituting single nationwide c ount of popular votes the candidates winning plurality of votes would be elected president and vice president most direct election proposal s would constitutionally mandate the joint tickets of presidentialvice presidential candidates alr eady adopted in state law5 some would require simply that the candidates winning the most popular votes would win others however would set minimum number of votes necessary to win election generally at 40 of those cast but in some cases majority in the event presidentialvice presidential ticke t were to attain the 40 or majority threshold these direct elec tion measures generally require the two tickets thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32831crs3 6 for further information on the successi on question please consult crs report rl30804 the electoral college an overview and analysis of reform proposals by l paige whitaker and thomas h neale 7 in contingent election the president is elect

senator casting single votereceived the most votes to compete in subsequent runoff elec tion alternatively some versions would provide that congress meeting in joint session elect the president and vice president if ticket received 40 of the vote direct popular election pro and pro proponents of direct popular elec tion cite number of factors in support of their proposal at the core of their arguments they assert that their process would be simple national and democratic they assert that direct popular ection would provide for single democratic choice in which all the nations voters would directly elect the two highestranking officials in the united states government the president and vice president further the candidates who won the most popular votes would always win the election under some direct election proposals if one received at least 40 of the vote the voters would be able to choose between the two tickets who gained the most votes in runoff election other direct election proposals would substitute election by joint session of congress for runoff if ticket received at least 40 of the vote every vote would carry the same weight in the election matter where in the nation it was cast direct election would eliminate the potential complications that could arise under the current system in the event of presidential candidates death between elec tion day and the date on which electoral vote results are declared since the winning candidates would become president and vice presidentelect as soon as the popular returns were certified6 all the various and complex mechanisms of the existing system such as provisions in law for certifying the electoral vote in the states and the contingent electi on process would be supplanted by these simple requirements7 electoral college defenders attempt to refute these arguments pointing to what they assert are flaws in direct electionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32831crs4 8 bushcheney 2859764 kerryedwards 2741165 ohio secretary of state website at httpwwwsosstateohus 9 for more detailed information on these reform options consult crs report rl30804 the electoral college an overview and analysis of reform proposals by l paige whitaker and thomas h nealedirect election proponents claim thei r plan is more democratic and provides for majority rule ye t some direct election proposals require that victorious candidates gain as little as 40 of the vote in order to be elected others moreover include minimum vote threshold at all how ask its critics could such plurality presidents be reconciled with the concept of strict majority rule enshrined by direct elections proponents further they assert that direct election would foster acrimonious and protracted postelection struggles rather than eliminate them for instance as the presidential ection of 2000 demonstrated close results in single state in close election are likely to be bitterly contested under direct election those favoring an electoral college claim every close election might resemble the postelection contests in 2000 not just in one state but also on nationwide basis as both parties seek to gain every vote such rancorous disputes could have profound negative effects on po litical co mity in the nati on and in the worst case might undermine the stability and legitimacy of the federal government to those who suggest that the struggle over floridas popular vote returns in 2000 was unique they could cite the example of ohio in 2004 where multiple legal actions were pursued even though the popular vote margin for the winning candidates exceeded 118 0008 electoral college reform reform measures that would retain the electoral college in some form have included ra nge of different proposals the most popular of which are listed below 9 most versions of these plans would eliminate the office of elector and award electoral votes directly to the candidates and would retain the requirement that majority of electoral votes is necessary to win the presidency in common with direct election most would so require joint tickets of presidential vice presidential candidates practice whic h is currently provided under state ballot laws the automatic plan this reform proposal w ould award all electoral votes in each state directly to the winning candidates who obtained the most votes statewide in almost all versions plurality would be sufficient in individual states to win the states electoral votes while most versions provide for some form of contingent election in congress in the event candidate wins nationwide majority of electoral votes this alternative would constitutionally mandate the general ticket or winnertakeall system currently used to award electoral votes in 48 states and the district of columbiahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32831crs5 10 presidents and vice presidents elected with an electoral vote majority but fewer popular votes than their major opponents 11 the district plan is permissible st ate option under the constitution which does not specify any particular method for awarding electoral votes in fact the district plan was widely used in the 19th century 12 the question of what district s would be used under distri ct plan has been considered over time the use of either ad hoc presiden tial election districts or existing congressional districts could be mandated or states could be offered the option of using either method the ad hoc district variant of the district plan would empow er the states to create special presidential election districts one for ev ery seat the state holds in the house of representatives while rewarding the two senat orial electors to the statewide vote winner further variation might be to eliminate the senatorial electors and establish number of presidential election districts equal to the total senate and house delegations in each state any such districts would undoubtedly need to confor m to existing supreme court mandates that they be as equal in population as po ssible in order to assure that the doctrine of one person one vote is observed th minimal population differences between congressional districts and the fact they are ready in existence might argue for their use on the other hand in contemporary practice congressional districts do not always follow the boundaries of existing pol itical subdivisions recognized regions or less formal communities thus vitiating one of the argument s in favor of the district system that it takes into effect the different political leanings of different parts of state these options continuedproponents of the automatic plan argue that it would maintain the present electoral college systems balance between federal and state power and between large and small states proponents note that the automatic plan would eliminate the possibility of faithless electors further the automatic plan would help preserve the present twoparty system under st atebystate winnertakeall method of allocating electoral votes this they assert is strength of the existing arrangement because it tends to reward parties that incorporate broad range of viewpoints and embrace large areas of the nation oppone nts on the other hand note presidential elections are still indirect under the automa tic system they further assert that minority10 presidents could still be elected under the automatic system and it still provides electoral vote recognition of th views and opinions of voters who chose the losing candidates the district plan this reform proposal would continue the current allocation of electoral votes by state and in common with most reform plans would eliminate the office of presidential elector it would award one electoral vote to the winning candidates in each congressional di strict or other ad hoc presidential election district of each state the additional two ectoral votes reflecting the two constant or senatorial electoral votes assigned to each state would be awarded to the statewide vote winners this alternative would constitutionally mandate the system currently used to award elect oral votes in maine and nebraska11 proponents of the district plan argue that it would more accurately reflect the popular vote results for presidential and vi ce presidential candidates than the winner takeall method or the automatic pla n because by allocating electoral votes according to popular vote results in congressi onal districts it would take into account political differences within states12 they also suggest that in states dominated byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32831crs6 12 continued might open an opportunity for experiment on the states as laboratories for the nation model 13 the constitution does not currently provide for fra ctions or parts of electoral votes so strict proportional system would require constitutional amendment since rounded proportional plan or system woul d award whole electoral votes it is currently permissible state option under the constitutionone party the district plan might provide an incentive for greater voter involvement and party vitality because it would be po ssible for the less dominant party to win electoral votes in districts where it enjoys higher level of support eg upstate new york versus the new york city metropolitan area or northern california vs the angeles and san franci sco metropolitan areas oppone nts would note that the district plan retains indirect election of the nations chief executive that the potential for minority presidents would continue and that it might actually weaken the two party system by encouraging parties that promote narrow geographical or ideological interests and that may be concentrated in certain areas in fact they might suggest that adoption of the district plan woul d encourage gerrymandering as the parties maneuvered for advantage in presidential elections the proportional plan this reform proposal would award electoral votes in each state in proportion to the percentage of the popular vote gained by each ticket some versions known as str ict proportional plans woul d award electoral votes in proportions as small as thousandths of one vote that is to the third decimal point while others known as rounde d proportional plans woul d use various methods of rounding to award only whole numbers of electoral votes to competing candidates voters in colorado rejected proposed state constitutional amendment amendment 36 at the november 2 2004 general election that would have established rounded proportional system in that state13 for further informati on on this proposal please consult crs report rl32611 the electoral college how it works in contemporary presidential elections by thomas h neale proponents of the proportional plan argue th at it comes closer than other reform plans to electing the president and vice president by popular vote while still preserving the state role in presidential elections they also assert that the proportional plan reduces the likelihood of minority presidents those who win with majority of electoral votes but fewer popular votes than their chief opponent they also suggest that it would more fairly account for public preferences by allocating electoral votes with in the states to reflect the actual support attained by various candidates particular ly in the strict as opposed to rounded version of the proportional plan while still re taining the role of the states opponents again suggest that it retains indirect election of the president which they assert is inherently less democratic than direct popular election they also note that the proportional plan could still result in minority presidents and vice presidents and by eliminating the magnifier effect of the automatic and district plans might actually result in more frequent electoral college deadlocks situations in which candidate receives the requisite majority of electoral voteshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32831crs7 14 for additional information on the voting power theory please consult crs report rl30804 the electoral college an overview and analysis of proposals for change by l paige whitaker and thomas h nealeelectoral college and electoral college reform pro and pro defenders of the electoral college either as presently structured or reformed offer various ar guments in its defense they reject the suggestion that it is undemocratic electors are chosen by the voters in free elections and have been in nearly all instances since the first half of the 19th century the electoral college system prescribes federal election of the president by which votes are tallied in each state the founders intended that choosing the presiden t would be the action of citizens of federal republic in which they participate both as citizens of the united states and as members of their state communities while electoral vote allocation doe s provide the constant two or senatorial electors for each state regardless of population defenders believe this is another federal element in our constitutional system and is less justifiable than equal representation for all states in the senate moreover the same formula also assigns additional electors equal in number to each states delegation in the house of representatives which more than compensates for any minor distortion further defenders reject the sugge stion that less populous states like alaska delaware montana nort h dakota south dakota vermont and wyoming as well as the district of columbia each of which casts only three electoral votes are somehow advantaged when compared with california currently 55 electoral votes these 55 votes alone they note constitute more than 20 of the electoral votes needed to win the presiden cy thus conferring on california voters and those of other popul ous states voting power advantage that far outweighs the minimal arithmetical edge conferred on the smaller states14 the electoral college system promotes political stability they argue parties and candidate s must conduct ideolo gically broadbased campaigns throughout the nation in hopes of assembling majority of electoral votes the consequent need to forge national coalitions having wide appeal has been contributing factor in the moderation and stability of the twoparty system they find the faithless elector phenomenon to be specious argument only nine such electoral votes have been cast against instructions since 1820 and none s ever influenced the outcomehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32831crs8 15 for more detailed information on the contingent election process please consult crs report rl32695 election of the president and vice president by congress

slim possibility for mischief by eliminating the office of elector supporters of direct election and critics of the electoral college counter that the existing system is cumbersome potentially antidemocratic and beyond saving the following asserted failings are frequently cited the electoral college direct election supporters assert is the antithesis of their simple and mocratic proposal it is they contend philosophically obsolete i ndirect election of the president is an 18th century anachronism that dates from time when communications were poor the liter acy rate was much lower and the nation had yet to develop the durable sophisticated and inclusive political system it now enjoys moreover they find the 12th amendment provisions that govern cases in which candidate attains an electoral college majority contingent election to be even less democratic than the primary provisions of article ii section 115 by providing fixed number of ectoral votes per state that is adjusted only after each census they maintain the electoral college does not accurately reflect state population changes in intervening elections they assert that the two constant or senatorial electors assigned to each state regardless of population give some of the nations least populous jurisdictions dispr oportionate advantage over more populous states from this viewpoint the office of presidential elector itself they note and the resultant faithless elector phenomenon16 provide opportunities for political mischief and deliberate distor tion of the voters choice they argue that by awarding all electoral votes in each state to the candidates who win the most popular votes in that state the winner takeall system effectively disen franchises everyone who voted for other candidates moreover this same arrangement is thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32831crs9 17 us constitution article ii section 1 clause 2 each state shall appoint in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct emphasis added number of electors equal to the whole number of senators and representatives to which the state may be entitled in the congress 18 number of election proposals in recent years have suggested that inhabitants of these jurisdictions should also have the right to vote for president and vice president based largely on the fact that they are us c itizens see for instance hjres 109

additional information on this proposal please consult crs report rl32612 the continuedcenterpiece of one category of elect oral college reform proposal the automatic plan critics further note that although ll states currently provide for choice of electors by popular vote st ate legislatures still retain the constitutional option of taking this decision out of the voters hands and selecting electors by some other less democratic means17 this option was in fact discussed in florida in 2000 during the post election recounts when some mbers of the legislature proposed to convene in special session and award the states electoral votes regardless of who won the popular cont est in the state the survival of this option demonstrates that even one of the more democratic features of the electoral college system is not guaranteed and could be changed arbitrarily by politically motivated state legislators finally the electoral college system has the potential to elect presidential and vice presidential candidates who obtain an electoral vote majority but fewer popular votes than their opponents as happened in 2000 1888 and 1876 while system that allows such miscarriage of the popular will mig ht have been acceptable in the 19th century opponents maintain that it has place in the 21st reform proposals in the 109th congress hjres 8 hjres 8 the every vote counts am endment was introduced on january 4 2005 by representative gene green and was cosponsored by representatives brian baird and william d delahunt the amendment sought to provide for direct popular election of

electoral college reform proposals in the 108th congress by thomas h neale 19 see footnote 5 20 although hjres 8 did not specify vehi cle by which congress could effect these changes statute law seems to be the likely candidate since the amendment referred explicitly to presidential elections only further constitutional amendment would probably be required if these provisions had applied to ot her elections as well such as those for state and local elected officialselection section 4 established in the constitution the joint candidacies currently provided in state law19 section 5 empowered congress to provide by law for 1 the death of candidates prior to election day and 2 any tie vote in presidential election this language appeared to gi ve congress broad authority in these situations extending to such options as rescheduling elections in case of candidate vacancies that occurred cl ose to election day or providing for second round election or election by congress in the even t of tie it is less clear whether the amendment would have made an implicit grant of authority to congress to intervene in the process of replacing party candi dates under such circumstances process which the parties historically have addressed thr ough internal procedures if so this would have constituted considerable departure from current practice and political tradition by empowering congress to intervene in the internal workings of the political parties section 2 contained three elements relating to voter qualifications first it specified that voters for president and vice president shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of nators and representatives this sentence built on and explicitly extends to the presidential electorate existing constitutional voter qualifications stated in article i section 2 for the house and the 17th amendment for the senate and as further defined and guaranteed by the 14th 15th 19th 24th and 26th amendments next it empowered the states to set less restrictive qualifications with respect to residence in contemporary practice most states have reduced voting residence requirements to an average of 30 days since the states already possess the power to reduce or eliminate these periods this section may perhaps be regarded as providing encouragement admonishment or constitutional imprimatur to efforts to adopt shorter residency re quirements for voters or to eliminate them altogether finally section 2 sought to empower congress to establish uniform residence and age requirements here again this provision would have constitute mandate for potential expansion of congressional power voting residence requirements as noted previously have been traditionally state responsibility but the amendment would have vested in cong ress authority to supersede state laws in this area at least for presidential elections similarly congress would have been empowered by the amendment to establish lower voting age for presidential elections20 section 6 of the proposed amendment set the time when it would come into force if ratified that is for the first presidential election that occurred one year or longer after the date of the amendments ra tification for instance if the amendment were successfully proposed by congress nd ratified by the states in 2009 it would be effective with the pr esidential election of

would have provided for direct popular election of the president and vice president and also included various other election administration provisions section 1 proposed to establish direct popular election of the president and vice president by us citizens its second ntence specified that us citizens may vote in state without regard to whether they reside in the state so long as they were registered in that state the import of this sentence was not entirely clear it did not prohibit state residence requirements for voting registration but it appeared to supersede any residence requirement for the act of voting itself at least in presidential elections the first part of section 2 would have established procedures for 1 state action on popular vote results 2 transmission of returns to washington and 3 the joint session of congress at which the st ate returns would be counted and the president and vice president declared elect ed this section would have superseded existing statutory provisions governing elect oral votes contained in 3 usc 218 the second part of section 2 would blish 40 of the popular vote as the minimum required to win the presidency if joint ticket of candidates for president and vice president received at l east this percentage then the amendment required second election contested by the two sets of candida tes who received the highest number of popular votes this pr ovision which was intended to guarantee that any person elected president d the support of substantial plura lity if not majority of the voters was been in cluded in many earlier reform proposals section 3 would have requi red congress to enact legislation that would 1 establish presidential election day as national holiday and 2 set national standards for voting registration for the presidential elections both these provisions would have broken new ground for federal invol vement in elements of election administration that have traditionally been the responsibility of state governments proposals to establish election day as lega l public holiday have been discussed for many years proponents argue that this woul d lead to higher voter participation rates while opponents assert 1 that it would have only limited effect since the holiday would probably be observed pr imarily by public sector employees 2 that there is guarantee that time off would

ratification date of the amendment section 5 defined the term state as including the several states the district of columbia and any other commonwealt h territory or possession of the united states this section would thus have expanded the presidential vote to include such us territories as guam and the us virgin islands as well as the commonwealth of puerto rico it also arguably intended that the proposed amendment extend presidential voting to american samoa which is also us territory and to the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands which is in political union with the united states it should be noted however that the inhabitants of american samoa are us nationals rather than citizens and the inhabitants of the commonwealth of the northern marianas can be either us

provide for direct popular election of the president and vice president by the citizens of the united states specifying single vote for joint candidacy for those offices it further specified that the election shall be conducted without regard to whether the citizens are residents of state the implications of this latter provision were arguably substantial for instance it could be interpreted to require that state and local election authorities accept the vote of any person who could prove citizenshiphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32831crs13 23 for instance in four of the 12 elections held between

date of the amendment hjres 36 was referred to the h ouse judiciary committee on march 2 2005 further action was taken during the balance of the 109th congress hjres 50 hjres 50 was introduced on may 12 2005 by representative zoe lofgren representatives jim mcdermott fortney pete stark jose serrano and lynn c wolsey joined as cosponsors on the same day section 1 of the resolution would have provided for election of the president by the people of the several states and the district of columbia section 2 would have established voter qualifications similar to those set by the constitution for the house of representatives ie those who are eligible to vote for the most populous branch of the legislatur of the state the section also went further however by empowering congress to establish uniform age qualifications to vote this language would give congress authority to change the voting age for the presidency by law section 3 sought to incorporate the long standing practice of joint presidential candidacies for into the constitution thus eliminating the potential for president and vice president of differe nt parties or political groups it also would have eliminated one of the more archaic features of the electoral college system by removing the prohibition against voting fo r only one candidate who might be from the same state as the elector this provision was originally included in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32831crs14 24 the electors shall vote by ballot for pr esident and vice president one of whom at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves us constitution 12th amendment the language here is identical to that found in the original at article ii section 1 clause 3 of the constitution 25 the question of congressional authority over federal elections is discussed at greater length in crs report for congress rl30747 congressional authority to standardize national election procedures by kenneth r thomas interestingly this report notes in pages 36 recent court decisions concerning the help america vote act hava pl 107 252 that suggest congress already possesses this powerconstitution24 to discourage presidential elect ors from voting for candidates only from their own states the founders intent he re was to encourage or rather require electors to broaden their horizons to cons ider candidates from other parts of the nation and is best understood in the contex t of the time when the constitution was written there was little national political consciousness or community and beyond george washington the indispensable man there were few if any nationally known political figures the original language as supplanted by that of the 12th amendment has generally been regarded as obsolete for many years and this provision of section 3 although it applies to voters rather than presidential electors under the electoral college system could be described as minor perfecting change section 4 would have established simple plurality of popular votes as sufficient to elect it makes provision for vote threshold or for runoff election although section 6 would empower congress to provide by law for procedures in the event of tie vote using language identical to that found in article 1 section 4 clause 1 of the constitution concerning congressional elections section 5 of the proposed amendment sought to empower congress to provide for the times places and manner of holding such presidential elections this would supersede the existing language of article i secti on 1 clause 5 which empowers congress to determine the time of chusing the electors and the day on which they shall give their votes which day shall be th same throughout the united states25 arguably the most important element of the propos ed language was contained in the word manner which could be in terpreted to include an exceptionally wide range of activities it could be argued that the changes pr oposed in section 5 would have provided necessary symmetry giving congress id entical authority over both congressional and presidential elections and again that broad national aut hority is required to administer national election insuring unifo rmity and equality of election rules and regulations in order to guarantee the fairest and most accurate expression of the public will opposition would have likely centered again on charges this provision would lead to the usurpation of traditional state and local functions that contrary to the above assertion one si ze fits all approach is not appropriate for federal republic that embraces 50 different states nd federal district and that further potential outcome would be the imposition of costly unfunde d mandates on the states and local governmentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32831crs15 26 the1980 independent candidacy of rep john b anderson in particular resulted in range of court decisions striking down some of the more stringent state requirements 27 for additional information on these procedures consult crs report rl32969 presidential succession an over view with analysis of gislation proposed in the 109th continuedin addition section 5 would also ve provided congress the additional authority to determine entitlement to inclusion on the presidential general election ballot this provision could arguably have resulted in further expansion of federal authority into an area traditionally left to the states the states through their legislatures have controlled ballot access on all levels since the earliest years of organized political parties and they have been criticized for almost as long on the grounds that the legislatures enact laws that favor estab lished parties at the expense of new or minor parties and independent candidates although ballot access requirements for such candidates have eased in recent decades26 existing arrangements were criticiz ed by proponents of the perot candidacy in 1992 and by supporters of ralph naders two r ecent presidential bids in 2000 and 2004 supporters of this proposal and others like it could argue that here again federal standard is required to insure that existing minor parties new parties and independent candidates for the presidency are fairly represented on the ballot for our only national election broader range of choices they might suggest would stimulate public interest in and debate on policy alternatives leading to more engaged national electorate and increas ed voter turnout conversely opponents could raise arguments against congressional interference in what has traditionally been state and local responsibility si ngle standard for ballot access they might argue would be awkward and perhaps unwor kable in nation with such diverse local political traditions and cultures it would enhance national power at the expense of the federal principle and as noted earlier would lead to the imposition of unfunded mandates on the states and local governments finally they might suggest that congress like the state legislatures is also dominated by the two major parties and it too might be influenced to use power over ballot access to discriminate against or in favor of different groups for political purposes another interesting point in connection with section 5 of hjres 50 was the particular language similar to that of hjres 8 granting congress authority over the times places and manner of holding such elections and entitlement to inclusion on the ballot it stated that all these objects shall be determined by congress emphasis added rather than the more common formulation congress shall provide by law emphasis added the appropr iate vehicle would seem to be public law but the question could be raised as to the intent and implications of this wording was the difference inadvertent or intentional if so could it be interpreted to provide some vehicle other than public law by which congress could exercise these powers section 6 would have given congress the power to provide by law for instances in which any candidate died or was disqua lified before the election or if there were tie in the popular vote the former pr ovision if exercised could have affected existing party procedures for filling vacanci on the ballot prior to the election27httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32831crs16 27 continued congress by thomas h neale see especially under succession during presidential campaigns and transitionshere again the language appeared to give congress broad authority in these situations extending to such options as rescheduling elections in case of candidate vacancies that occurred cl ose to election day or providing for second round election or election by congress in the even t of tie as noted above it is less clear whether the amendment would have made an implicit grant of authority to congress to intervene in the process of replacing party nominees under such circumstances process which the parties hist orically have addr essed through internal procedures if so this would have constituted considerable departure from current practice and political tradition by empowering congress to intervene in the internal workings of the political parties section 7 was technical prescribing that the amendment would be effective one year after the first day of january following ratification hjres 50 was referred to the house committee on the judiciary on may 12 2005 further action was take n during the balance of the 109th congress sjres 11 sjres 11 was introduced by senato r dianne feinstein on march 16 2005 and has been cosponsored by senator barbara bo xer section 1 of this proposal sought to establish direct popular election of th president and vice president eliminating the electoral college system section 2 would have established the sa voting qualifications for president as for representative in congress in effect citizens 18 years of age or older the section continued with language almost identical to that of hjres 8 allowing the states to set less restrictive residence qualifications and so empowering congress to establish uniform residence and age qualifications for voters in presidential elections here again this language would have offered the potential for considerable expansion in federal aut hority over aspects of election previously exercised by the states as noted previously in this report most states have reduced voting residence requirements to an average of 30 days since the states already possess the power to reduce or eliminate these periods this section may perhaps be regarded as providing encouragement admonishment or constitutional imprimatur to efforts to adopt shorter residency re quirements for voters or to eliminate them altogether finally section 2 also empowered congre ss to establish uniform residence and age requirements this provision would have constituted mandate for potential broad expansion of congre ssional power voting reside nce requirements as noted previously have been traditionally st ate responsibility but the amendment would have vested in congress authority to supersede state laws in this area at least for presidential elections similarly congress would have been empowered by the amendment to establish lower voting age for presidential elections section 2s lasthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32831crs17 sentence sought to empower congress to tablish qualifications for voters in the district constituting the seat of government of the united states that is the district of columbia this provision would not have added to cong resss powers since article i section 8 of the constitution already establishes congressional authority to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever over the seat of government section 3 in its first sentence would have confirmed and enhanced congressional authority over sc heduling for presidential elections giving it the power to determine the time pl ace and manner of holding such elections language similar to that governing elections for representatives and senators also existing language in article 2 section 1 clause 4 of the constitution currently states the congress may determine the time of chusing the electors and the day on which they shall give their votes wh ich day shall be the same throughout the united states this section of the proposed amendmen t would also have empowered congress to regulate the process of counting votes and declaring the results in law of these two functions the former has traditionally been performed in the states and localities according to state requirements the grant of authority in this case would have enabled congress to establish by law uni form requirements for vote tabulation and by extension for challenges rec ounts and other related activities two points are suggested here first as noted elsewhere in this report legislation establishing broader federal control over the election administration process might be criticized both as an unfunded federal mandate as well as an intrusion into responsibilities tr aditionally performed at the state and local level second point is that the amendment if ratified would cover only elections for president and vice president leaving the potential for cumbersome twotiered structure of election laws and practices one for presidential ections and another for congressional state and local contests in response it could be argued that presidential elections are the ultimate expr ession of the voters will in the united states and that they are properly regulate d at the federal leve l moreover such arguments could continue the recurrence of election irregularities or allegations of irregularities in 2004 make compelling case for simple nationwide process to govern this most important exercise in democratic self rule with respect to two tiered system of election ad ministration such cumbersome and costly structure would almost certainly be avoided by states which would likely conform their practices to those enacted by congress finally it could be noted that this and other arguably controversial grants of potential authority over election admin istration to congress could only be accomplished by law requirement that brings into play all the timehonored elements of the nations system of legislative checks and balances section 4 would have established within the constitution the longstanding practice of joint candidacies for president and vice president as noted elsewhere in this report this would prevent the anomaly of president and vice president of different parties in the interests of uniformity the section also required that the same two candidates would appear as team on the ballot in every statehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32831crs18 28 for an account of action in both the 94th and 95th congresses consult neal r peirce and lawrence p longley the peoples president the electoral college in american history and the direct vote alternative rev ed new haven ct yale university press 1981 pp 198206section 5 of the proposed amendment also followed the example set in hjres 8 it would have empowered congress to pr ovide again by law for the death of any candidate or for tie vote in the election here again as noted earlier in this report this language arguably appeared to give congress broad authority in these situations extending to such options as rescheduling elections in case of candidate vacancies that occurred close to election day or providing for second round election or election by congress in the event of tie it is less clear whether the amendment would have made an implicit grant of authority to congress to intervene in the process of replacing party candidates under such circumst ances process the parties historically have ddressed through internal proce dures if so this would have constituted considerable departure from current practice and political tradition by empowering congress to intervene in the internal workings of the political parties section 6 included standard language providing that the amendment would come into force one year after the twenty first day of january following ratification sjres 11 was read twice in the senate on march 16 2005 and immediately referred to the senate committee on the j udiciary further action was taken during the balance of the 109th congress concluding observations trends in electoral college reform proposals although the volume of electoral colle ge reform proposals introduced has remained generally steady over the past veral congresses two trends are noticeable to the long term observer first the volume of proposed amendments that would reform the electoral college as opposed to those that would eliminate the electoral college and substitute direct popular electi on has declined almost to zero second the scope of proposed direct popular elec tion amendments is arguably evolving in the direction of greater complexity and detail it is unclear whether the first developm ent reflects decline in support for the electoral college either as it exists or reformed lack of organized interest in these reform proposals or simply the absence of sense of urgency on the part of members who might be inclined to s upport or defend the current system in some form it is arguable indeed likely that if direct election amendment gained broad congressional support and bega n to move through congress toward proposal to the states members who support the current syst em in some form would coalesce in ad hoc groups to defend the electoral college alternatively they might be spurred by the prospect of action to propose reform measures this was the case the last time direct election amendment came to the floor in the senate during the 95th congress 1979198028httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32831crs19 29 see for instance hjres 17and sjres 11 above and hjres 103 and hjres 109 in the 108th congress 30 for further discussion of the hurdles faced by electoral college reform proposals see crs report rl30844 the electoral college reform proposals in the 107th congress by thomas h nealeanother apparent trend is that more recent reform pr oposals go beyond the concept of simply substituting direct election for the electoral college in the past two to three congresses these amendments have been more likely to include provisions that would enhance and extend the power of the federal government to regulate in such areas as residence standards definition of citizenship national voter registration inclusion of us territories and associated areas in the presidential election process establishment of an ection day holiday ballot access standards for parties and candidates etc29 this trend almost certainly reflects frustration on the part of many voters and their elected representatives over the uncertainties and inconsistencies in local election administration procedures that were revealed in the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections if the amendments in which such proposals have been incorporated were proposed and ratified they could be used to set broad national election standards p rovided such legislation were enacted which would supersede many current stat practices and requirements this eventuality raises two possible issues the first is the question of whether such federal involvement in trad itionally state and local practices would impose additional costs on state and local governments and thus be regarded as an unfunded mandate one response by the state and local governments might be to call for federal funding to meet the increas ed expenses imposed on them by federal requirements precedent for this exists in the grant program incorporated in hava second issue is related and centers on perceptions as to whether such an amendment would be regarded as fe deral intrusion into state and local responsibilities for instance more farr eaching scenario might include the gradual assumption of the entire election administration structure by the federal government in this hypothetical case questions could be raised as to 1 the costs involved 2 whether national election administration system could efficiently manage all the varying nuances of state and local cond itions and 3 under these circumstances what would be the long term implications for federalism conversely it could be argued that national election administration structure is appropriate for national elections and that state or local concerns are counterbalanced by the urgent requirement that every citizen be enabled and encouraged to vote and that every vote should be accurately counted prospects for change in the contemporary context some observers assumed th at action of the electoral college in 2000 in which george w bush was elected with slight majority of electoral votes but fewer popular votes than gore jr would lead to serious consideration of proposals to reform or eliminate the electoral college notwithstanding these circumstances however none of the proposals introduced in either the 107th through 109th congresses received more th an routine committee referral30 in the 107th congress attention focused on proposals for elec tion administration reform resulting inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32831crs20 31 for additional information on the help america vote act please crs report rl23685 election reform the help america vote act and issues for congress by eric fischer and kevin j coleman 32 article v of the constitution also provides for amendment by convention which would assemble on the application of the legislatures of twothirds of the states any amendments proposed by such convention would also require approval of threefourths of the states this alternative method however has never been used 33 these conditions have been met in some cases only after long period of national debate for example the 19th amendment which extended the right to vote to women was the culmination of decades of discussion and popular agitation in other instances amendments have been proposed and ratified in the wake of sudden galvanizing event or series of events an example of this may be found in the 25th amendment providing for presidential succession and disability which received tremendous impetus following the 1963 assassination of president john f kennedy 34 the exceptions as noted earlier we re the elections of 1876 1888 and 2000 when candidates were elected who had majority of electoral votes but fewer popular votes than their major opponents the one case in which the electoral college was hopelessly deadlocked occurred in 1824 when contingent election resolved an electoral college deadlock even in this case the president john quincy adams was able to govern successfully despite criticism that he was selected in the house of representativespassage of the help america vote ac t pl 107252 116 stat 1666 in 2002 this legislation as noted earlier in this report substantially extended the role of the federal government in the field of voting systems and election technology through the establishment of national standards in th areas and the provision of aid to the states to improve their registrati on and voting procedures and systems31 other factors may also contribute to the endurance of the electoral college system perhaps foremost is the fact that the us constitution is not easily amended stringent requirements for proposed amendm ents including passage by twothirds vote in each chamber of congress and approval by threefourths of the states generally within sevenyear time frame have meant that ccessful amendments are usually the products of br oad national consensus sens that certain reform is urgently required or active longter m support by congressional leadership32 in many cases all the aforementioned factors contributed to the success of an amendment33 further while the electoral college has ways had critics its supporters can note that it has ratified the peoples choice in 47 of 51 presidential elections held since ratification of the 12th amendment success rate of 92234 in the final analysis given the high hurdles both constitutional and political faced by any proposed amendment the electoral college system seems likely to remain in place unless or til its alleged failings become so compelling that large concurrent majorities in congress the states and am ong the public are disposed to undertake its reform or abolition
