yesterday trafigura finds it improper to answer questions to the media as long as the criminal charges in norway are still under investigation by økokrim however certain of the additional questions and statements in your email of this morning are biased and can not be left unchallenged trafigura is in process of producing written statement as response to the questions raised by nrk we will forward this statement to you during the course of business tomorrow and kindly ask that you refrain from publishing anything before having had the opportunity to carefu lly examine the response from trafigura your questions of today do also reveal the fact that you are in possession of draft preliminary expert opinion produced by minton treharne davies ltd and that you appear to be ready to disclose information from this report trafigura looks very serious upon this as disclosing any information from this report would be clear breach of confidentiality and privilege the report is clearly privileged and confidential and was obtained unlawfully by whoever is responsible for it coming into your possession please be aware that on friday of last week our clients sought and obtained an injunction in relation to this document and information contained in it against the guardian newspaper and persons unknown pending further hearing for your attention we have attached hereto copy of

to your obligation not to publish document which has been obtained unlawfully that the document was as we say draft and it is clear from its text that it was produced generically without reference to the underlying ev idence we can also assure you that its generic conclusions have long since been wholly superseded by the analyses of the probo koala slops by independent experts best regards vogt

broadcasting corp oration hello thank you for your reply does this mean that trafigura do not wish to comment on anything we will publish i would like to point out that some of the questions do not deal with the probo emu as such but are of more general nature in addition to the questions vi sent to trafigura on september 10 we would also like to give trafigura the opportunity to comment on the following in the report from john minton of the company minton treharne davies ltd dated 140906 it is written that the waste that ended in the ivory coast contained large amounts of toxic substances including h2s in the report it also says that the waste could be fatal trafigura has earlier confirmed that this waste was identical to what the probo emu brought to sløvåg what is trafiguras comment to this why did trafigura not inform vest tank and norwegian authorities of this the minton report is based on analysis of the waste on the probo koala in the report it says that the waste can lead to nausea diarrhea skin problems headaches respiratory problems unconsciousness and death trafigura has had this report since september 2006 the company has still vigorously denied that the waste could lead to illness and death what is trafiguras comment to this the autopsy report of 12 people from the ivory coast shows they died of h2s poisoning what is trafiguras comment to this your reason for not wanting to give an interview to the norwegian broadcasting corporation is that there is an ongoing police investigation in norway why have you not made yourself available for questioning by the

our law firm represents trafigura and we have been asked to address your enquiry on behalf of trafigura it should be noted that these matters are still subject to investigation in norway trafigura has not been indicted for any offence and økokrim has not yet questioned any employee of the company despite several applications trafigura has not been granted access to the police documents at this time
