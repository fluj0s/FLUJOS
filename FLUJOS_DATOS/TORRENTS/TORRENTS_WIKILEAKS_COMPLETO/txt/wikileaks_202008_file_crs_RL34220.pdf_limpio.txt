regardless of the location where the income was earned1 the internal revenue service irs appears to base this conc lusion on the theory that congress did not designate indian tribes as taxable entities within section 11 of the internal revenue code irc2 this exemption extends to income generated by tribal corporations federally chartered under sec tion 17 of the indian reorganization act of 1934 ira3 or section 3 of the oklahoma indian welfare act4 nonetheless the irs has indicated that the exemption does not exte nd to tribal corpora tions chartered under state law5 it should be noted

directly from allotted lands background under specific circumstances indians enjoy tax exemption on income derived directly from allotted restricted lands held in trust by the united states government the leading case on this issue is squire v capoeman which held that the general allotment of act of 1887 contained language evincing congressional intent to grant such an exemption15 the general allotment act of 1887 so commonly called the dawes act authorized the president to allot portions of reservation lands to individual indians16 title to the allotted lands was to be held in trust by the united states government for period of 25 years which the president had the option to extend by executive order17 at the end of the trust period the nd would be conveyed to the indian in fee discharged of said trust and free of all charge of incumbrance whatsoever18 alternatively the act authorized the secretary of the interior soi to issue patentin fee simple to any allottee competent of managing his own affairs and thereafter all restrictions as to sale incumbrance or taxation of said land shall be removed and said land shall not be liable to the satisfaction of any debt contracted prior to the issuing of such patent 19 until an indian was certified as competent which meant capable to manage his affairs as an independent landowner his allotted land remained in trust and was therefore restricted20 however the allotment policy was repudiated by the ira in 193421 the ira prohibited further allotment of tribal land22 provided that allotted land held in trust would continue in trust until congress provided otherwise23 and authorized the secretary of the interior to take land into trust for tribes and tribal members24 congress would later apply these provisions

indefinitely26 in capoeman the issue was whether proceeds from the sale of timber grown on lands allotted pursuant to the general allotment act were subject to the federal tax on capital gains27 the indians who held the allo tment were deemed noncompetent moreover during the tax year in which the income from the timber was realized the land allotted was still held in trust by the united states government and not subject to either alienation or encumbrance by the indian allottee28 the court concluded that the language in sections 5 and 6 of the general allotment act expressed an intent by congress to exem pt from federal taxation all income derived directly from allotted lands still held in trust by the united states government29 first the court agreed with th proposition that tax exemptions must be clearly expressed30 the court then referenced section 5 of the general allotment act which ordained that when allotted lands were conveyed to indians in fee they be free of all charge or incumbrance whatsoever though the provision as the court conceded was not expressl couched in terms of nontaxability the court nonetheless surmised that the term charges and incumbrances might well include taxation31 furthermore the court cited th language in section 6 stating that all restrictions as to sale incumbrance or taxation of said land shall be removed and then conclude d that the language clearly expressed congressional intent to exempt the allotted lands from th reach of federal ta xation until title to the allotted lands was c onveyed to the indian allottee in fee32 in capoeman the court ruled that the literal language of the proviso of the general allotment act evinces congressional intent to subject an indian allotment to all taxes only after patent in fee is issued to the allotee33 relying on capoeman the irs has published series of revenue rulings adoptin g its holding and in many ways expanding its scope though the reach of the capoeman holding is limited to lands allotted under the ge neral allotment act of 1887 the irs has taken the position that the tax exemption not only pplies to noncompetent indians allotted restricted land held under that specific act but also nd held under acts or treatieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34220crs5 34 rev rul 67284 19672 cb 55 35 id 36 id 37 id 38 cohen supra 679 2005 39 rev rul 70116 19701 cb 11 see also

series of additional rulings the irs has also eluc idated further contours of this exemption addressing two specific areas of concer n which lands qualify for the exemption outlined in capoeman and what types of income derived from allotted lands are exempted lands that qualify for tax exemption the irs will recognize the exempt status of restricted lands held under the gene ral allotment act of 1887 or lands held under acts or trea ties containing an exemption provision similar to the general allotment act35 the irs applies five tests to determine whether income from the land in question will qualify for the exemptions with the failure of any one of the five tests resulting in denial of the exemption36 the tests are whether 1 the land in question is held in trust by the united states government 2 such land is restricted and allotted nd is held for an individua l noncompetent indian and not for tribe 3 the income is derived directly from the land 4 the statute treaty or other authority involved evinces congressi onal intent that the allotment be used as means of protecting the indian until such time as he becomes competent and 5 the authority in question contains language indicating clear congressional intent that the land until conveyed in fee simple to the allottee is not to be subject to taxation37 it appears that lands located outside indian reservations fall under the capoeman exemption since the general allotment act authorizes allotments located outside of reservations and capoeman makes distinctions between allotted lands located within or outside of reservations38 capoeman applies to allotments issued pursuant to tribespecific allotment statutes regardless of whether the general allotment act applies to those allotments or not39 the exemption for restricted lands also applies to individual trust property wh ich is transferred to s ubsequent allottee by gift devise or inheritance40 furthermore property that d been purchased in an arms length

allotted land is removed the income derived from the land becomes taxable42 the definition of derived directly in capoeman the court citing professor felix s cohen declared the sc ope of the tax exemption found in sections 5 and 6 of the general allo tment act of 1887 to include income derived directly from restricted lands allotted under the act43 because of this language in order for income to be exempt the income must d erive directly from the restricted land the irs has enumerated several sources of income that satisfy the derived directly test these sources include but are not limited to rentals including crop rentals royalties proceeds from the sale of the natu ral resources of the land income from the sale of crops grown upon the land and from the use of the land for grazing purposes and income from the sale or exchange of cattle or other livestock raised on the land44 the irs also recognizes that proceeds from the sale of restricted allotted land whilethe fee title is still held by the government in trust for the indian are exempt from federal taxation 45 federal appellate courts have also recognized variety of sources of income that satisfy the derived directly test income from farming and ranching46 bonus income from signing oil and gas leases47 timber harvests48 royalties from mineral deposits49 and rental and sales of chattel from land50 however courts have also concluded that other sources of income fail the test namely income from businesses building rentals and smokeshops51 furthermore courts have so rejected exemptions for rental income derived from nds used as tourist site52 and income derived from the lease of the restricted land to smokeshop53 in essence the courts appear to have delineated the limits of the derived directly test by exempting income from taxation only if the income is derived from the lands natural resources while taxing income derived from the commercial deve lopment of restricted lands54httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34220crs7 54 continued their land to the profitable use which appears contrary to federal policy 55 see hoptowit v commr 709 f2d 564 9th cir 1983 jourdain v commr 617
