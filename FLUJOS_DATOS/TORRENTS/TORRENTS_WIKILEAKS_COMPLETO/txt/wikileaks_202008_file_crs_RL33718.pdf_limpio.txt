of how to calculate the federal estate tax liability for taxable estate of any given size using the schedule of graduated marginal tax rates and the applicable ex clusion amount or the applicable credit amount for the year of death the app licable exclusion am ount is the amount of any decedents taxable estate that is free from tax it is known informally as the estate tax exemption the applicable credit amount or unified credit is the corresponding tax credit it is equal to th tax that would be due on taxable estate that is the size of the applicable exclusion amount simplified method can be used to ca lculate the tax due on the estates of decedents dying in 2006 through 2009 this is because the applicable exclusion amount for those years reaches the top marginal tax bracket consequently the estate tax liability can be calculated simply by multiplying the amount of the taxable estate in excess of the applicable exclusion amount for the year of death times the maximum estate tax rate for that year the applicable exclusion amount is 2 million for 20062008 nd 35 million for 2009 the maximum tax rate is 46 for 2006 and 45 for 20072009 more formal method is required to cal culate the tax liability for years before 2006 or for 2011 and beyond this is because more than one marginal tax rate applies to taxable values in excess of the exclus ion amount first the tentative tax that would be due on the entire taxable estate is calculated from the marginal tax rate table for the year of death then the applicable credit amount for the year of death is subtracted from the tentative tax in order to determine the estate tax due numerical example is presented in the text and in worksheets for 5 million taxable estate of decedent dying in 2007 or 2008 both the simplified and formal methods are used to calculate the tax lia bility blank worksheets are also provided the economic growth nd tax relief rec onciliation act of 2001 pl 10716 egtrra gradually lowered the maximum estate tax rate and substantially raised the applicable exclusion amount over the years 2002 through 2009 the maximum tax rate fell from 60 under pr ior law in 2001 55 margin rate on taxable estate values over 3 million plus 5 surtax from 10 million to 17184 million down to 45 in 20072009 the applicable exclusion amount rose from 675000 in 2001 in steps up to 35 million in 2009 egtrra repealed the estate tax for decedents dying in 2010 all provisions of egtrra are scheduled to sunset on december 31 2010 unless changed beforehand in 2011 the w will revert back to what it would have been had egtrra never been enac ted under provision of the taxpayer relief act of 1997 pl 10534 in 2011 nd beyond the applicable exclusion amount would be 1 million in contrast to 675000 in

aug 14 2001 calculating estate tax liability 2001 to 2011 and beyond introduction this report provides basic explanation of how to calculate the federal estate tax liability on taxable estate of any given size it uses the schedule of graduated marginal estate tax rate s and the applicable excl usion amount as provided in 2001c of the internal revenue code and the corresponding applicable credit amount for the year of death the report does not address how to determine the value of the taxable estate except to note here that deductions from the gross estate are permitted for funeral expenses costs of administering the debts and mortgages owed charitable bequests and bequests to the surviving spouse nor does the report explain the accompanying tax on gifts made during persons lifetime or the generationskipping transfer tax1 the economic growth nd tax relief rec onciliation act of 2001 pl 10716 egtrra pronounced eggtra phased out th federal estate tax over the years 2002 2009 egtrra lowered the top marginal tax rate gradually and raised the applicable exclusion amount and conseque ntly the corresponding applicable credit amount in large increments over the pha sedown period egtrra repealed the estate tax for decedents dying in 2010 but the estate tax repeal and all other provisions of egtrra are sche duled to sunset on december 31 20102 unless changed beforehand in 2011 the law will reve rt to what it would have been had egtrra never been enactedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33718crs2 3 the unified estate tax credit is nonrefundable that is it cannot reduce estate tax liability below zero consequently taxable estates that are smaller than the applicable exclusion amount are not able to take full advantage of the available credit 4 less than half of estate tax returns filed each year from 1998 through 2006 were taxable calculated by crs from unpublished estate tax data by f iling year from the internal revenue service statistics of income soi available on the irs website httpwwwirsgovapplicable exclusion amount and applicable credit amount it is common parlance to say that cer tain amount of decedents assets is exempt from the estate tax mathematically however the applicable exclusion amount is not subtracted from the value of the taxable estate before applying the schedule of tax rates instead the exclus ion amount is converted into tax credit known as the applicable credit amount or unified credit the credit is equal to the tax that would be due on taxable estate the size of the applicable exclusion amount for the year of death this tax cr edit is subtracted from the tentative tax liability on the entire taxable estate to determine the net estate tax unlike deduction which is worth more to taxpayers in higher marginal tax rate brackets the maximum value of the applicable credit is the same regardless of the top tax rate that an estate faces3 the applicable exclusion amount also rves as the tax filing threshold that is an estate tax return must be filed if the gross value of the estate exceeds the applicable exclusion amount for the year of death this filing requirement holds even if the estates taxable value falls below the applicable exclusion amount after subtracting eligible ductions such that estate tax is owed4 table 1 presents the applicable excl usion amount and the corresponding applicable credit amount for each year from 2001 to 2011 and beyond in 2001 before egtrra the applicable excl usion amount was 675000 it was scheduled to rise gradually to 1 million for 2006 nd beyond under provisions of the taxpayer relief act of 1997 pl 10534 tra egt rra raised the applicable exclusion amount to 1 million immediately for 2002 and 2003 it raised the amount further to 15 million for 2004 and 2005 2 million for 2006 through 2008 and finally 35 million for 2009 it repealed the estate tax for 2010 only the provisions of egtrra are scheduled to sunset on d ecember 31 2010 if the sunset provision is not repealed or the law is not otherwis changed beforehand in 2011 estate tax law will return to what it would have been had egtrra never been enacted under the provisions of tra of 1997 that would mean an applicable exclusion amount of 1 million for the years 2011 and beyond not the 675000 that prevailed in 2001 the applicable credit amount was calculate d by crs by using the estate tax rate schedule to determine the tentative tax on taxable estate the size of the applicable exclusion amount it is based on the underlyi ng set of graduated marginal tax rates shown in the tables in the appendix for the estates of decedents dying in 2002 or 2003 the applicable credit amount was 345800 corresponding to the estate tax onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33718crs3 1 million for 2004 and 2005 the applicable credit amount was 555800 corresponding to the estate ta x on 15 milli on for 2006 2007 and 2008 the applicable credit amount is 780800 corres ponding to the estate tax on 2 million for 2009 the applicable credit amount wi ll be 1455800 corresponding to the estate tax on 35 million for 2011 and be yond the applicable credit amount is scheduled to return to 345800 the amount that was in effect for 2002 and 2003 corresponding to the estate tax on 1 million table 1 applicable exclusion amount and corresponding applicable credit amount 2001 to 2011 and beyond calendar year of deathapplicable

title 26 of the us code is also referred to as the internal revenue code the applicable credit amount was calculated by crs marginal tax rates the tables in the appendix present the graduated sche dule of federal estate tax rates for each year from 2001 through 2009 the example here in the text uses the rates that apply to decedent dying in 2007 or 2008 shown in table a7 rising marginal tax rates apply to different segments of the taxable estate each table of the appendix contains an explanatory row that indicates where the applicable exclusion amount for that year of death falls within the rate schedule and what the corresponding applicable credit amount or unified credit is taxable estate values up to the applicable exclusion am ount are protected from tax by the credit to help illustrate their invisible role the rows of marginal tax rates that apply to estate values below the excl usion amount are shown in italic s those graduated rates are incorporated in determin ing the value of the unified credit in contrast the operative marginal tax rates that affect the changes in tax liability associated with deductions from or additions to the taxabl estate are those that apply to estate values above the exclusion amount thes rows are shown in regular typefacehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33718crs4 for 2007 and 2008 the graduated marginal tax rates range from 18 for taxable value from 1 to 10000 up to 45 for taxable value over 15 million because the applicable exclusion amount of 2 million for both years falls in the top bracket only the top marginal rate of 45 affects the change in tax liability associated with deductions from or additions to the taxa ble estate in earlier years when the exclusion reached lower in the rate schedule more marginal tax rates played an active role calculating estate tax liability simplified method can be used to calcula estate tax liab ilities for the estates of decedents dying in 2006 through 2009 this is because the applicable exclusion amounts of 2 million for 2006 through 2008 and 35 million for 2009 fall in the top marginal tax rate bracket for the year this means that the estate tax liability for 2006 through 2009 can be calculated simply by multiplying the amount of the taxable estate in excess of the applicable exclus ion amount for the year of death times the maximum estate tax rate for the year for 2006 the applicable exclusion amount was 2 million and the maximum tax rate was 46 for both 2007 and 2008 the applicable exclusion amount remains at 2 million but the maximum tax rate falls to 45 for 2009 the applicable exclusion amount will rise to 35 million but the maximum tax rate will remain at 45 table 2 illustrates the simplified method of calculating the estate tax liability for taxable estate of 5 million of deced ent dying in 2007 or 2008 first subtract the applicable exclusion amount of 2 milli on from the taxable estate value of 5 million yielding difference of 3 million then multiply that 3 million times the tax rate of 045 to determine the tax liability of 135 million table 2 simplified calculation of estate tax liability for taxable estate of 5000000 of decedent dying in 2007 or 2008

same numerical example used in table 2 of an estate with taxable value of 5 million for decedent dying in 2007 or 2008 table 5 is blank worksheet provided for readers to make th eir own calculations the formal method set forth in tables 4 and 5 is needed to compute estate tax liability for years before 2006 and for 2011 and beyond for those years the marginal tax rate continues to rise above the bracket that contains the applicable exclusion amount for 2006 through 2009 the formal method produces the same tax liability as the shortcut but requires more computations two basic steps are involve d in calculating the estate tax liability first calculate the tentative tax due on taxabl estate of the size in question based on the tax rate schedule in the appropriate table in the appendix for the year of death second subtract from the tentative tax the applicable credit amount for the year of the decedents death calculating the tentative tax involves four steps 1 in the appropriate tax rate table find the amount of tax due at the bottom of the bracket in which the estate value falls 2 calculate the amount of in excess of the bottom of the bracket 3 multiply that excess amount by the margin tax rate to dete rmined the additional tax and 4 add that additional tax to th tax due at the bottom of the bracket httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33718crs6 in table 4 the value of the taxable estate 5 million is entered on line 1 column step 1 to determine th tentative tax on the estate of decedent dying in 2007 or 2008 look down the first column of table a7 and find the bracket that encompasses the taxable value of the estate for an estate of 5 million that is the top bracket beginning with 15 million column c of the last row of table a7 shows that the tax on 15 million is 555800 th is equals the sum of the taxes due from all of the preceding brackets in the table enter this amount on line 2 column b of table 4 step 2 calculate the amount of the estate in excess of 15 million the bottom of the tax rate bracket in column of table 4 subtract line 2 from line 1 and enter the difference of 35 million on line 3 this 35 million is taxed at marginal rate of 45 as shown in the last

b add the additional tax of 1575000 on line 5 to the 555800 on line 2 and enter total tentative tax of 2130800 on the 5 million estate on line 6 of table 4 next find the applicable credit amount corresponding to the year of the decedents death for person dying in 2007 or 2008 the tax credit is 780800 enter this amount on line 7 this corres ponds to the tax that would be due on an estate of 2 million the applicable exclus ion amount for 2007 or 2008 subtract the applicable credit amount of 780800 on lin 7 from the tentative tax of 2130800 on line 6 and enter the resulting net tax liability

tax credits and deductions can affect the final federal estate tax liability for example prior to egtrra an estate could claim credit subject to limit for state death taxes paid on the estate egtrra phased out the state tax credit by 25 percentage points per year from 2002 through 2004 in 2005 the credit was replaced with duction because of the sunsetting of egtrra the full state credit is scheduled to be reinstated in 2011 credits may still be claimed for foreign death taxes and for federal estate taxes paid on property that was transferred to the decedent within th past 10 years subject to phaseout limits from 1998 throug h 2003 estates w ith qualified fa milyowned business interests qfobi could claim special deduction of up to 675000 that could in combination with the applicable ex clusion amount equal 13 million egtrra repealed this special deduction as of 2004 when the applicable exclusion amount for all estates reached 15 million the qfobi deduction would be reinstated in 2011 under egtrra the estate and gift taxes remain partly unified from 2002 through 2009 the amount of taxable gifts5 that may claim the gift tax exclusion is subject to cumulative lif etime limit of 1 million for 2002 and thereafter the exclusion claimed for taxable lifetime gifts is subtracted to determine the applicable exclusion amount remaining available to persons estate at death the amount of taxable lifetime gifts is included in the base used to calculate the tentative estate tax but the estate is credited for gift taxes previously paid in 2010 the gift tax is scheduled to remain in place when the tax is repealed the lifetime applicable exclusion amount for gifts will remain at 1 million the maximum rate of tax will be 35 on cumulative gifts over 500000 u nder the return to prior law in 2011 the fully unified estate and gift tax w ould be reinstated the single combined exclusion of 1 million could be applied to gifts andor bequests separate tax is
