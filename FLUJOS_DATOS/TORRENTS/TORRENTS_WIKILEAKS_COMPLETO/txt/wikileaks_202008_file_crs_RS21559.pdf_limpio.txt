824d 6allowed revenue would typically permit an operating company to recover its costs and reasonable rate of returnof whether ferc tariff delegating discretion to the regulated entity to determine

may not reconsider the rate entergy louisiana inc eli is one of five public utilities owned by entergy corporation eli operates in louisiana and shares capacity with other entergy utilities operating in arkansas mississippi and texas this arrangement allows company to access additional capacity when needed but the costs associated with keeping excess capacity available must be allocated the co st allocation is an important component of the setting of retail rates by state regulators entergyallocates costs through system agreement approved byferc under section 205 of the federal power act5the formula for the agreement contains an automatic adjustment clause necessary because of the possible monthly change in the cost allocation and this clause is exempted from t he federal power acts usual requirements for rate changes the cost allocation determination was based not simply upon the power used from generating facilities rather certain generating units shut down because of overcapacity but which could be brought back up if necessary were also figured into the cost allocation an operating committee was given the discretion to determine the status of these mothballed units because of this allocation eli often found that its cost equalization payments were increased in december 1993 ferc initiated proceeding to determine for formula purposes whether the mothballed generating units should be treated as available ferc found that although the units should not have been classified as available for purposes of the formula refund was not warranted because the cost allocations had not been unjust unreasonable or unduly discriminatory ferc also approved an amendment to the system agreement to allow mothballed unit to be treated as available if the operating committee determined that at future date it intended to return the unit to service eli filed with the louisiana public service commission lpsc in may 1997 its annual rate contes ted issue in the filing was whether the cost of mothballed generating units should be included or xcluded from its revenue requirement6the lpsc confined its review to payments ma after august 5 1997 the date on which fercs order allowing inclusion of the mothballed units as just and reasonable had been issued despite concluding that it was preempted from determining whether the filing was just and reasonable because of fercs authority over the matter the lpsc held that it was not preempted from disallowi ng as imprudent these costs after august 5 1997httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21559crs3 7815 so 2d 27 2002 8476 us at 971elis petition for review in state district court was denied eli then appealed to the supreme court of louisiana which upheld the lpscs decision7t h u p r m ec u r t of louisiana held that the lpscs order was not barred by preemption because the lpsc was neither attempting to regulate interstate wholesale rates nor challenging fercs declining to order refunds the louisian supreme court also stated that ferc had not ruled on whether continuing after august 5 1997 to include the cost of the mothballed units was prudent the united states supreme court granted elis petition for writ of certiorari to determine whether the lpscs order was preempted the united states supreme court reversed the louisiana supreme court innantahala light andmississippi power light the court applied the filed rate doctrine in holding that ferc mandated cost allocations could not be modified by state regulators the court stated in nantahala nantahala must under ncucs order calculate its retail rates as if it received more entitlement power th an it does under fercs order and as if it needed to procure less of the more expensive purchased power than under fercs order portion of the costs incurred by nantahala in procuring its power is therefore trapped8 applying these earlier decisions to the facts in entergy louisiana the court held that the lpscs order impermissibly trapped cost s allocated in ferc tariff the court went on to state that because congress had specifically allowed the use of automatic adjustment clauses in the federal power ac t the louisiana supreme courts conclusion that leaving the classification of the mothballed generating units to the discretion of an operating committee could substantially limit fercs flexibility in approving cost allocation arrangements as for the louisiana supreme courts upholding the lpscs order based upon its belief that ferc had not specifically approve d the cost allocation after august 5 1997 when it issued its order the court stated tha t the louisiana supreme court had revived the same erroneous reasoning used by the mississippi supreme court in mississippi power light in that case the court stated the mississippi supreme court erred in adopting the view that the preemptive effect of ferc jurisdiction turned on whether particular matter was actually determined in the ferc proceedings we have long rejected this sort of casebycase analysis of the impact of state regulation upon the national interest in power regulation cases nantahala 476 us at 966 quoting fpc vsouthern california edison co 376 us 205 215216 1964 congress has drawn brigh t line between state and federal authority in the setting of wholesale rates and in the regulation of agreements that affect wholesale rates states may not regulate in areas where ferc has properly exercised its jurisdiction tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21559crs4 9mississippi power light at 374determine just and reasonable wholesale rates or to insure that agreements affecting wholesale rates are reasonable9 finally the court addressed the argument by respondents that the inclusion of the mothballed generating units in the rate calculations violated the amended system agreement and that therefore the lpscs order cannot be preempted the court is uncertain as to why respondents advanced this argument since the lpscs prior holding stated that it did not have jurisdiction to determine whether the system agreement was violated and since the louisiana supreme c ourt accepted that position therefore the court stated that it had r eason to address the question
