acres in size that greeks call imia and turks call kardak previously nations flag flew there and military forces were present the ships captain initially refused assistance from greece because he said

tansu ciller insisted we cant let foreign flag fly on turkish soil the flag will come down by january 29 both nations had dispatched naval vessels to the vicinity of the islet and greek forces were put in the highest state of alert on january 30 the greek defense ministry reported that the entire greek fleet is sailing in the aegean and that at least eight turkish navy vessels had been deployed greek defense minister yerasimos arsenis said that greek warships had warned turkish frigate to leave greek waters greek planes had intercepted turkish planes violating greek airspace at various times up to 20 vessels were reported around kardakimia turkey requested that greek troops be recalled from the rocks and that all signs attempting to prove greek sovereignty be removed it claimed that it had only normal amount of ships in the area prime minister simitis responded the turkish claims have basis at all there is space for negotiations in matters which concern our sovereignty early on january 31 turkish commandos landed on an adjacent outcrop where they planted turkish flag turkish foreign minister denis baykal said that the troops would be removed when greek forces withdrew from the neighborhood the united states detected signs that greece had plans to reinforce the islet and that turkey had plans to take it2 and sought to keep the dispute from igniting on january 31 us mediation achieved agreement on mutual withdrawal and restoration of status quo including flags on the islet while withdrawing greek navy helicopter crashed killing three crew members the only lives lost during the crisis the withdrawal was completed within hours defense minister arsenis observed any incident could have led to allout war legal issues athens says that imia is greek by virtue of the 1923 lausanne treaty of peace with turkey the protocol to 1932 convention between turkey and italy and the 1947 treaty of peace with italy in article 15 of the lausanne treaty turkey renounced in

establish decades old legal framework and status quo concerning sea borders in the southeastern aegean and prove incontrovertibly that imia is greek ankara contends that possession of small islands islets and rocks in the aegean has not been determined clearly by agreement it claims that league of nations covenant article 18 required members to register all treaties with the secretariat and that the 1932 protocol was not registered5 moreover greece had tried to include reference to the protocol in the 1947 peace treaty but was unsuccessful turkey maintains that kardak rocks are neither adjacent to the named islands nor islets as the terms are used in the 1947 treaty ankara also notes that the treaty stipulates that the dodecanese shall be demilitarized since greece according to turkey has failed to fulfill this obligation it cannot selectively invoke other alleged treaty rights moreover turkey finds that its fishermens longterm uncontested use of the islet adds to its legal case minutes of the 1947 peace conference indicate that the 12 islands were named in the treaty in response to greek amendment proposed to avoid ambiguity as to the expression isles of the dodecanese6 perhaps not foreseeing that islets could be ambiguous or relying on internat ional legal definitions of the time further the treaty commission suggested that greece propose draft map defining maritime frontiers of the dodecanese in lieu of accepting greek amendment referring to the 1932 convention and protocol7 greece says that it never drafted map because it had succeeded to all rights previously pertaining to italy concerning boundaries of the dodecanese the 1932 protocol appears to be the crux of the legal dispute other unresolved bilateral issues centuries of mistrust afflict greekturkish relations some date tensions to the 15th century when the ottoman empire conquered constantinople the heart of the greek byzantine empire others to 1828 when greece became the first nation to achieve independence from the ottomans in modern times unresolved bilateral issues have festered to worsen relations in 1974 in response to coup in cyprus instigated by military junta then ruling greece turkish troops landed in cyprus and eventually seized the northern third of the island cyprus remains divided with greek cypriots controlling the internationally recognized government and the southern twothirds of the island and turkish cypriots in the northern third governed by selfdeclared but internationally unrecognized turkish republic of northern cyprus two decades of negotiations have failed to resolve the issue httpwikileaksorgwikicrs96140crs4 other differences concern territorial rights in the aegean sea where there are over 2300 islands islets and rocks mostly uninhabited but important for defining borders imiakardak may be added to this list greece claims 10mile airspace limit rejected by turkey and other parties greece repeatedly protests turkish violations of airspace the continental shelf between the two neighbors has not been delimited greece in possession of most aegean islands maintains that islands have continental shelf while turkey argues that the continental shelf is geological extension of its anatolian mainland the two also differ over greeces right to militariz several islands in the eastern aegean territorial waters are potent issue in may 1995 greece ratified the law of the sea treaty which would allow it to claim 12nautical mile territorial sea limit greece asserts it has the right to declare 12 miles but has not exercised it turkey has not signed the treaty and says that greek declaration of 12 miles would be an act of war greek islands fringe turkeys anatolian coast therefore turkey contends that expanding the islands territori waters would impede its access to the high seas in response to the greek treaty ratification the turkish parliament gave the government the power to go to war if greece declares 12mile limit ethnic or religious disputes continue greece complains about turkeys alleged mistreatment of the greek orthodox church headquartered in istanbul and turkey protests greeces alleged mistreatment of its muslim populace whom turkey refers to as turks ankara also charges that athens supports separatist kurdish terrorist group that has waged an insurgency since 1984 charge greece denies domestic situations weak greek and turkish governments appear in part to have been provoked into action over imiakardak by nationalistic media the greek government had just ended two months in limbo during the protracted illness of former prime minister andreas papandreou culminating in his resignation papandreou an historic and charismatic figure had dominated greek politics the new simitis government was barely week old seeking to establish its own identity when the crisis erupted on the other side turkey had an inconclusive national election in late december and competing politicians had been unable to agree on new coalition government the opposition islamist refah party was the largest votegetter and hovered over the negotiations and other events ciller headed caretaker government without mandate until new one was formed the uncertain political climate in athens and ankara made each vulnerable to provocations by exploitative press causing the crisis to spiral rapidly out of control ironically greece and turkey accused each other of taking advantage of its domestic uncertainty for aggressive purposes us policy the united states sought to prevent military confrontation between its two nato allies and to restore the status quo on january 30 the state department urged both governments to exercise restraint and to draw back the highest level us officials intervened to defuse the crisis with assistant secretary of state for european affairs richard holbrooke mediating actively greece and turkey eventually made withdrawal reassurances to the united states because they would not make them to each other httpwikileaksorgwikicrs96140crs5 8reuters february 6 1996 9reuters february 7 1996 10foreign broadcast information service daily report western europe fbisweu96 021 hereafter fbisweu january 31

department spokesman said on february 1 that there may be other islands or islets on which the united states takes position on sovereignty and promised to produce list of them greeks were outraged because they believed that their territori sovereignty was being questioned several days later the department retracted its statement saying that there was list while expressing concern that the united states was being labeled as part of the problem rather than part of the solution 8 on february 7 us official said that since the validity of at least one of the documents ie the 1932 protocol that bear on the question of ownership and sovereignty was disputed the united states believed that the best venues for addressing questions would be the international court of justice icj or another consensual impartial body9 the state department refused comment on whether other bilateral aegean disputes should be brought to the court aftermath greeces domestic and foreign affairs were unsettled by the crisis despite its abatement without violence the government which claimed success from the disengagement of forces and deescalation of the crisis was weakened by what was perceived at home as national humiliation questions were raised about who authorized the flag to be lowered and why there had been response to turks landing on nearby rocks opposition leader miltiades evert said that the withdrawal of greek forces and the flag lowering constituted an abandonment of national territory and an act of treason10 the opposition boycotted vote of confidence to confirm the new government the government which has parliamentary majority won on february 8 the greek chief of staff was fired mostly for commenting publicly on government discussions during the crisis many greeks blamed the united states assessing its neutrality as equivalent to siding with ankara at the end of the crisis holbrooke had said that he would travel to greece and turkey to defuse tensions11 after the state departments february 1 comment about disputed islets greek government spokesman observed that state department positions ie failing to recognize greek sovereignty create the basis for permanent source of tension in the area12 on february 5 the prime minister announced that holbrookes visit did not fit the governments schedule since greek officials had said that sovereignty was nonnegotiable and

its aggression broke commitment under the accord to have amicable ties with eu members prime minister simitis said that greece would cooperate with the eu once turkey agreed to icj jurisdiction but that turkey must initiate an appeal to the icj since it is questioning greek rights the european parliament supported greeces view on sovereignty but eu foreign ministers simply urged the parties to solve differences amicably some eu members are concerned that greeces moves against turkey would violate the customs union accord and interfere with developing ties and access to turkeys market the
