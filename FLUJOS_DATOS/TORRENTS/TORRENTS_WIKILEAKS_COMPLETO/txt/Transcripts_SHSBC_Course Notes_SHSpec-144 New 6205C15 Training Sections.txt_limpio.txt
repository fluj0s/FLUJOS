6205c15 shspec144 new training sections see hcopls 3may62 practical auditing skills 14may62 training sections issue ii training classes of auditors new thing has happened since the start of teaching the briefing course year ago new training pattern laid down in the academies new course materials have been added but practical section has been added to get people to confront doingness as well as thought data is very important but its application in doingness is harder to confront so we are putting in practical section to make sure that correct application occurs practical has always been there in the comm course and upper indocs this adds practical to the actual auditing along with added trs etc you could learn great deal about the mind and reactions of pcs if your technical procedure was perfect your understanding of the mind at present is blurred by the lack of an absolutely perfect application of scientology to the pc because of distractions entered in by imperfect auditing one stable datum is when confronted by the unusual do the usual every pc thinks his case is different from everyone elses actually he is thetan and he is here his case operates like everybody elses as far as fundamentals go the pc will give you sales talk on his unusuality on all his differences it is his privilege to come up with unusuals nonduplicates of everyone else of course he will with the bank he has got the moment the auditor buys the pcs unusualness he is teamed up with the reactive mind and the bank the auditor process the pc thenceforth if your application of auditing is wild and variable and everything looks all different to you you will get wild ideas about the human mind one could be blamed for varying procedure if they didnt know that standard auditing exists this is now know everything pc can do has standard auditor response that handles it it is the fact that these auditor responses do work in all cases that makes them standard responses universities sometimes have courses where the subject is hidden the students are there the professor is there but the course is double talk there is real subject eg art appreciation music appreciation domestic relations people confuse education with thinkingness you can go through school without ever understanding anything furthermore early classroom training is all data practical so giving doingness along with theory tends to break up the automaticity that equates education with total think education has become huge practical joke theory practical auditing gives two thirds doingness and one third think that is about what it takes there would be new tr for each new activity the result will be very smooth effortless auditing there will be uncertainties because the auditor knows the correct cause for every pc response and the proper response for very pc action this means that there is need or place for cleverness in handing pc only standardness in handling pcs there are certain stable data in the theory if you didnt have these you wouldnt know where you were going or why these stable data are the fundamental things there are certain practical actions that you must be able to do and few auditing skills to be used in auditing processes these things can be organized to go together and to complement each other to some degree see hcob 3may62 practical auditing skills for summary of practical auditing skills ie the student should learn 1 the basic fundamental precepts few bits of inescapable theory 2 certain basic practical actions basic to auditing 3 auditing skills that are relatively easy to do these three will be tied up together so that they complement each other class ia processes include op pro by dup scs and assists op pro by dup was originally invented solely as training process for auditors to teach them that duplication wouldnt kill them it enabled auditors to give repetitive commands without alterising so instead of asking do birds fly the auditor wont go off and ask are our feathered friends airborne it gets rid of obsessive change scs runs out bad control people must have been miscontrolled to object to control but the auditor must control the pc or he fails utterly control and duplication are the roughest hurdles for an auditor to get over student auditors should both give and receive op pro by dup and scs as first action see hcob 14may62 case repair for more data on op pro by dup and scs assists are the other basic auditing action to teach beginning auditors they can give spectacular results all these processes teach body mauling which is good thing now that upper indocs are removed because they lead people to misrun cchs and none of these processes goof up the pc if done wrong they all repair themselves if they are done right to repair the wrongly done process unlike engram running for instance which is not selfcorrecting these three processes constitute class ia class ib is arc sw in model session plus havingness this is sit down process that gives verbal repetitive think processing it will occasionally make someone sane who didnt know he was nuts and it gives the auditor reality on banks and timetracks as he sees the pc cycle in time you can run it positively and negatively which handles someone who winds up in agony when you try to run pleasure moments this process has tremendous horsepower class iia is prepchecks and cchs prepchecks at this level are preferably done by forms 3 and 6a form 3 hcopl 22mar61 the only valid sec check for new students the joburg form 6a hcopl 3feb62 auditor processing check shortened form of form 6 for students who have done fair amount of auditing form 6 hcopl 7ju161 processing sec check here the case would start to get good case advances class iib is where the student acquires complete command of the fundamentals of sessions and emeters at an advanced level including all meter and needle phenomena and all elements and ruds of model session see hcopl 14may62 issue 2 training classes of auditors classes iic and iid include complete mastery of all thislifetime processes as well as very advanced general auditing skill at class iiia you have havingness getting ruds in dynamic assessment prehav assessment problems intensive and any kind of assessment you could dream up none of it has therapeutic value except havingness and lots of ruds to get someone up to doing routine 3 processes without doing any 3dxx he would have to do assessments of some kind that is bit of puzzle at present but you could do assessment by elimination on problems intensive for instance at class iiib the student would do goals assessment at class iiic the student audits routine 3 processes with skill see hcopl 14may62 issue 2 as above also see this pl for the theory and practical requirements for each class
