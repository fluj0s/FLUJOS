rachel w kelly domestic social policy division updated december 18 2002 abstract there have been widespread accounts of hospitals nursing homes and other facilities having great diﬃculty attracting and retaining nursing and paraprofessional personnel this problem may be the result of variety of factors including the strong economy which has increased competition among providers within the health care sector and expanded opportunities for work in other sectors studies have shown that such diﬃculties can also be attributed to relatively low wages limited or employee beneﬁts and insuﬃcient opportunities for professional development such as promotions and training opportunities oﬀered to paraprofessionals these problems are especially acute in the longterm care sector where nursing homes and home health agencies play major role this report focuses on the care provided by these providershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31090congressional research service the library of congressreport for

individuals in range of institutional nd community settings widespread accounts of problems health care providers have had in attracting and retaining nursing personnel have led to concern within the h ealth care sector and have attracted the attention of lawmakers there are reports that the demand for registered nurses licensed practical nurses nurse aides and other professional personnel exceeds supply health care practitioners nursing educational institutions and researchers suspect that this problem will worsen the difficulty attracting and retaining nurses and paraprofessionals may be the result of variety of factors including competing job opportunities for women relatively low wages limited or benefits stressful working conditions and insufficient oppor tunities for profe ssional development the demand for qualified nurse s and paraprofessionals is expected to increase as babyboomers swell the older populati on currently about 9 million adults age 18 and older receive longterm care services in community settings or in institutions registered nurses licensed practical nur ses and paraprofe ssionals home health aides nursing aides and personal care nd home care aides provide the majority of longterm care supportive and health services to individuals who have lost some or all capacity to care for themselves aging babyboomers and increased life expectancy will increase the demand for these services and for the nurses and paraprofessionals who provide them medicare and medicaid are the largest public sources of financing for care provided in nursing facilities and by home health care agencies the importance of these programs has led policymakers to evaluate how they can be modified to address inadequate staffing levels on august 1 2002 the nurse reinves tment act pl 107 205 was signed into law having been passed by the house on december 20 2001 and by the senate on july 22 2002 pl 107205 addresses issues concerning recruitment training and retention of nurses and pa raprofessionals through amendments to the nursing workforce development act title v iii of the public health service act the 107th congress has also considered addressing nurse staffing in number of other ways proposals introduced by members of congre ss included changing payment rates under medicare and medicaid to encourag more nurse training prohibiting mandatory overtime expanding tax incentives to encourage family members to act as caregivers and further facilitating the use of foreign nurses none of these latter proposals were enacted into

for longt erm care supportive and health services for persons who have lost some or all cap acity for selfcare according to the 1994 national health interview survey about 39 million persons age 65 and older and 34 million persons age 1864 receive care in home and communitybased settings and about 16 million persons receive care in nursing facilities by 2020 estimates predict that the total number of elderly individuals using home care and institutional services will increase by about onethird1 the majority of direct care providers include registered nurses rns licensed practical nurses lpns and paraprofessionals home hea lth aides nursing aides personal care and home care aides as the need for longterm care services grows policymakers will be faced with pressures to expand longterm care funding even without changes to current law at the core of these challenges are issues concerning quality of care and adequacy of the supply of those nurses and paraprofessionals who play central role in providing longterm care services already longterm care providers report an insufficient number of direct service personnel this probl em is projected to worsen in the future there have been widespread accounts of hospitals nursing homes and other facilities having great difficulty attracting and retaining nursing and paraprofessional personnel this problem may be the re sult of variety

2000 medicare outlays were 187 b illion and medicaid outlays were 503 billion over half of the nations total spending for longterm care6 the important role played by these programs has led some policymakers and advocacy groups to evaluate how they can be modified to address inadequate st affing levels among nurses and paraprofe ssionals in the longterm care sector traditionally medicare and medicaid laws have included provisions to establish framework for staffing and quality standards for care paid for by the programs the statutory authority pertaining to nursi ng homes participating in

longterm care labor market at congressional hearing in februa ry 2002 experts detailed the current difficulties in meeting the demand for nurses and paraprofessionals and explained that the problem is

quality first better health care for ll americans final report to the president 1999 figure 1 nursing and paraprofessional personnel 1998 employment and projected 2008 employment workforce issues variety of labor market indicators suggests that the health care sector and especially the longterm care sector is facing challenges in retaining nursing personnel and in attracting ne w personnel to the profession one such indicator is high staff turnover in the longterm care sector studies have found that annual turnover rates in nursing f acilities range from 55 to 65 for rns and reach nearly 100 for nursing aides home care agen cies have annual rnover rates between 40 and 6010 difficulty in retaining workers is costly for health care providers consumers and workers for health care providers frequent turnover of staff means high recruitment costs the use of tem porary replacements who are more expensive and lower profits high turnover may also cause patients care to be disrupted or inadequately providedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31090crs5 11 directcare health workers the u nnecessary crisis in longterm care the aspen institute january 2001 p 6 figure 2 projected home health agency demand for nursing services 20002020 while there is significant variation in work environments salaries and employersponsored benefit packages acro ss states and longterm care providers there are some common themes in the probl ems facing nursing personnel possible explanations for the high turnover rates among nursing personnel in the longterm care sector include relatively low wages limited or benefits and greater physical and emotional exertion than is required of ma ny other jobs in the health care sector health care workers at all levels have cited the lack of supportive supervisory environment as another problem results of focus groups indicate that many nurses and paraprofessionals do not feel that their knowledge and insights into patients conditions are respected and valued by their supervisors they do not feel satisfied with their level of partic ipation in decisions made about care provided to their patients11 working conditions high turnover rates may also lead to poor working conditions nurses and pa raprofessionals in workplaces with large numbers of vacancies must compensate for the lack of employees reduced staff may cause nursing personnel to have ss time to spend with each patient since each employee may be responsible for an increased numbe r of patients within each shift this burden could reduce the quality of care they provide to patients in addition health care providers have been requiring mandatory overtime as means of coping with fewer personnel these adaptations to staffing shortages may limit the availability of mentors to

frustration the physical health of nurses and parapr ofessionals can also be affected some believe that the effect of low morale combined with complaints of low salaries and increased work demands has made nursing less attractive career option both for individuals considering nursing as profession and for those already in nursing who may leave the field for work in other professions for example common responsibility for home care and pers onal care aides is ssisting patients out of bed back injuries from lifting or m oving patients are the most common types of injury to health care workers an an alysis of injuries in the home health care sector found that the injury rate was 50 hi gher than the workrelated injury rate in hospitals and 70 higher than the rate for all industries12 education and training the increased use of technology as well as the more rapid discharge of pa tients from hospitals have led to more demands being placed on nursing professionals and paraprofessionals the changing environment requires the education and skills of nurses to change as well the institute of medicine has recommended that nursing programs focus more on interdisciplinary education and team approaches to care communitybased care managed care and home care to respond to the changing needs of patients and the industry13 the national advisory council on nu rsing education and practice has recommended increasing the proportion of nurses with baccalaureate or higher degree from its current level of 30 to 66 by 2010 to ensure that the nursing workforce is capable and qualified to meet future demands14 however national enrollment in nursing programs has declined 5 over the past 5 years15 explanations for the decline include changing image of the nursing profession expanded employment opportunities for wome n in other fields and insufficient financial support loans grants and schol arships for individuals who enroll in nursing programs related problem is the
