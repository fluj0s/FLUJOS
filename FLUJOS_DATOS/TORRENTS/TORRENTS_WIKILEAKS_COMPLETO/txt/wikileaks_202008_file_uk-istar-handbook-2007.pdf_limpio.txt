coordinated acquisition processing and dissemination of timely accurate relevant and assured information and intelligence which supports the planning and conduct of operations targeting and the integr ation of effects and enables commanders to achieve their goal s throughout the spectrum of conflict 2 or put simply istar provides information and intelligence to support the commander and his decision making process 3 it is critical that commander s at all levels understand the type and quantity of istar products available to them in any operation they must also underst and how they can use these to support their decision making process and how they can be used to provide immediate battlefield suppor t to troops in contact this handbook is designed to act as quick reference guide for commanders within land formations and aims to explain briefly how istar works within formations who is responsible for conducting istar what products are available to commanders at all levels and how to bid for them the capabilities of istar collection assets restricted 6 restricted purpose of istar istar command and control 4 uk doctrine states that operations shoul d be intelligence led and

assessment of information llowing the incorporation of new information into old intelligence to provide product that is greater than the sum of its parts the aim should be for processing to be as responsive to the situation as the collection fleet recognising the relative importance of one piece of information or intelligence over another so that decision makers can be informed in the right timeframe d dissemination7 the dissemination regime will depend on the information and communications technology ict provided but customers and intelligence staff must work together to ens ure that

prioritisation of co llection exploitation of raw data processing and dissemination ac tivities it allows irm staff to identify the need for either an rf i or collection task the irm staff are therefore key to the direction process 10 collection coordination this involves selecting the most appropriate means to satisfy ir s order and optim ise collection activities amongst istar resources whilst conflictingsynchronising with coll ection activities of higher headquarters and flanks the cc requires knowledge and experience of istar capabilities and processes as well as an appreciation of battlespace management bm issues the collection coordination cell will need to work closely with irm the all source assessment cell asa c and representatives from indigenous and supporting istar assets 11 data exploitation many istar platforms are able to conduct first phase data exploita tion in order to generate first phase intelligence reporting that can be easily understood by an all source analyst this element may be either inside or outside the army hq or even within the asac depending on its nature and size exploitation elements and istar assets may also be grouped for practical reasons such as shared communications infrastructure 12 all source analysis all source analysis should be just that involving material from unclassified open sources to top secret strap

range of threats by comparison the number of co llection assets is limited and competition for them is high as result national intelligence structures are not always able to support intelligence requirements in theatre to the gree that deployed forces would like 16 in operational theatres mo st though not all of the intelligence collection assets are military capabilities designed to provide products for deployed forces competition for them is still high and some are allocated at the highest level us combatant commands it is important to r ealise that battlegroup in theatre may be the

to achieve his effect as seen in fig 05 at most levels istar is managed by chief istar who directs the mutually supporting activities of collection and assessment the principal respon sibilities of the chief istar when leading the g2istar group are numerous but the main ones include 21 direction and guidance this ultimately rests with chief g2istar who will need to manage the process resources

24 collection and assessment are independent but mutually supporting functions this document will not cover the specific skills of the assessment cell which is largely an intelligence discipline below how ever are the key points to consider for collection management which is an operations speciality 25 manage collection requirements there will inevitably be competing collection requirem ents these can include the commanders standing intelligence r equirements irs for current and future operations and target ing support the star coord cell must manage the collection pl an so that these are answered in priority order but without missing an opportunity to collect where an opportunity arises 26 manage collection operations this may involve dynamic retasking of both or ganic and nonorganic assets the collection manager will select the most appropriate means to satisfy irs order and optimise co llection activities as well as synchronise with collection activi ties of neighbouring formations and higher headquarters includi ng joint and national istar resources for this the collecti on cell will need to work closely with g3 over bm issues all isr bids from unitssubunits for

from within organic assets and he has drawn up provisional collection plan he needs to submit istar bids critically if the requirement cannot be met from within organic assets an istar planner should either pose an intelligence question or bid for an istar product he should not bid for an asset in so doing he allows the collection managers further up the chain to determine t he best platform to answer the question and thus maximise collection capability with the limited assets available there are two processes for bidding for istar products although these may vary in different theatres 35 requests for information this is the preferred process and is used in theatres by units and sub units to ask for intelligence from formations and above it can be used to ask for piece of information the recipient is known to have such as locations of previous operations it can also be used as tool to ask for piece of information that the recipient is known not to have ie although it is called request for information it can be the tool by which units submit re quests for intelligence support to future operations it is also the format in which strategic intelligence questions to dis and other ogds are presented 36 when making an rfi the following key information must be included an example of an rfi is included at fig 09 task details customers must decide above all what question they wish to ask justification background details and non ambiguous questions will allow the right assets to be tasked and prevent wasted collection restricted 26 restricted b product requirement customers must make clear in what form they want the answer to be presented in so doing they must be as accurate as possible for example they should not ask for 10hrs of fmv if they only need 4hrs if in doubt they should include as much information as possible to maximise the chances of the mission managers finding an appropriate platform c impact statement customers should explain the impact of the intelligence not being received on time eg flagstaff will not receive fu ll brief or the operation will not take place or serious degradation to operational capability etc this will assist in the prioritisation of assets d distribution customers should list the names of everyone to whom the res ponses are to go including name email address with system full postal address or callsign classification required customers should state clearly the classification at which they can receive an answer they should also clearly identify preferred medium for that answer eg hard copy or email f required by date customers should never offer asap as required by date the analysts need firm date to which to wo rk short deadlines may be accommodated but as rule ll rfis take 96 hrs from the time of receipt from formati on level until the platform is allocated this is to allow fo r the theatre ccirm process to be followed see below restricted 27 restricted 37 isr requests this is the format by which formation headquarters or equivalent submit their consolidated bids for istar assets to higher headquarter s in many cases units may be forced to fill in isr requests themselves they stand much better chance of receiving an asset to support them if they are completed accurately 38 the isr nomination form is available to bdes on nato secret and siprnet the procedure for getting isr nomination forms from bdes to units and sub uni ts will vary in each theatre so2 istar in each bde will direct units as to how they can pass isr requests to bde headquarters withi n the constraints of their local it systems normally th is will be done on jocs or the theatre bg secret it system when filling in an isr request form the following should be considered location of the task to be given in latlong where possible b description of the target to include as much information as possible including the reason for the task this will help confirm t he most appropriate collection platform and allow for assessment by the correct agency if necessary c type of product this is key correct description of the requirem ent will allow the mission manager to get the most out of his assets customers should not bid for more than they want and include description of how they intend to use the product in many restricted 28 restricted cases mission managers may not be able to meet the exact requirement but will offer something else instead d dissemination customers must always be clear how they wish to receive the product and in what time frame 39 an example of an isr form is at fig 10

by which rfi or products are collated prioritised and allocated to platforms the process is largely similar in operational and non operational theatres although loca l variations exist and the system is evolving continuously in basic terms the system in operational theatres is as follows units bid to bde using the rfi or isr format for product bde submits its consolidated bid to division rc s or mnd who will prioritise bids then allocate an asset if they can support it or pass it to corps hq similarly corps hq mnci or hq isaf will allocate an asset or pass to the combi ned air ops centre caoc

of intelligence for troops in theatre are imint sigint masint geoint and humint ther is also group of istar capabilities whose products are less clearly defined but whose capabilities provide va luable force protection or surveillance benefits such as weapon locating systems 42 listed in the following pages are some of the capabilities and limitations of each of the product types listed above and some of the considerations for customers bidding for these products restricted 35 restricted istar products imint 43 imagery intelligence imint is available in several forms some imint products are kept in archive at national or coalition level the most obvious example is google earth on open source other products need to be collected for specific operation before bidding for imint it is critical that the customer understands what he wants to learn from the imagery and confirms that he has viewing platform capable of supporting the product imint product is categorised either according to its position in the electromagnetic spectrum or the capability it provides the main media for imint products are electrooptical eo this covers all forms of colour and black and white dayli ght imagery it can include full motion video fmv or phot ographic stills taken on either wet film or by digital processor most aerial imint platforms including uavs carry an eo sensor and many can remote the imagery realtime to ground control station gcs or remote view ing terminal rvt b infrared thermal ir this is available as fmv or stills although the image def inition and range is often poorer than eo it can give cl earer imagery in poor light and weather conditions many aerial eo platforms also have an ir sensor which can be downlinked to the same ground station c synthetic aperture radar sar this can be categorised as both imint and masint and good resolution picture will give similar imagery to black and white eo it is employed in poor weather conditions and has the ability to see

taking digital photographs in transit can easily hand over the images after the flight other stills and fmv require more planning 45 fmv is available as streaming video realtime imagery near real time nrt with 4 to 20 second delay or recorded streaming video will require an rvt which can achieve handshake with the relevant sensor nrt digital imagery can be sent from digital cameras over data networks eg from an op to an ops room recorded imagery is downloaded assessed and disseminated on completion of the mission customers should consider dissemination time and platform in their planning 46 photographic stills can be taken using wet or digital film or by satellite the advantage of usi ng satellites is that the product can be assessed to answer the correct intelligence question at the appropriate agency in the uk this is done at national level by the joint aerial reconnaissance centre jaric who have rep in the oisg and may have others at task force level and below restricted 37 restricted istar products sigint 47 sigint is an invaluable tool for providing information on enemy locations and intentions and is often the cue for tasking imint or physical surveillance tasks although there are three types of sigint land forces ar only likely to be exposed to the products from communication s intelligence comint the nature of operations in ir aq and afghanistan does not often require electronic intelligence elint and foreign instrumentation and signals intell igence fisint for operational intelligence 48 comint often used in lieu of the term sigint comint can be collected from the tactical patrol level up to the strategic coalition level on range of pla tforms each of these platforms can collect against number of communications systems ranging from small hand held pushtotalk radios to fixed and mobile telephone networks the principal uses of comint include identifying local and immedi ate threats to forces on the ground b identifying and confirming the location actions and intentions of possible targets c identifying targets for future intelligence collection dissemination of sigint 49 the collection of sigint can be complicated and sigint dissemination to customers will depend on the request and operational environment this can vary from specialist attached restricted 38 restricted istar products support with sigint equipment at patrol level to formal response to an rfi in general dissemination to customers is done in one of the following ways lewt the light electronic warfare team is an ew sect which is held at formation level but usually attached to subunit or unit to provide tactical ew support this is most commonly used to provi tactical intercept and df capability to subunit operations both in identifying local insurgent activity and identif ying local networks b so2 istar this appointment acts as the point of contact and conduit for all ot her sigint within the bde although it may come from number of sources land organic sigint is coordinated in the the electronic warfare coord cell ewcc and disseminated to the appropriate customer by the istar cell sigint material varies but commonly includes names and locations including traces of possible targets c gco the government co mmunications officer acts as the link for all sigint collected and assessed above land organic level this includes uk joint and coalition assets as well as sigint originati ng from ogds and foreign allies restricted 39 restricted istar products masint 50 much of the capability covered by measurement and signals intelligence masint is classified secret and above masint works on the principle that everything on the earths surface leaves form of signatur that is measurable in some way for example changes in patte rns of movement over certain areas can be measured by masint 51 ground moving target indicator gmti form of masint which requires specialist analyst although on many coalition collection platforms th is can be done at the point of collection because of analysis nd connectivity limitations the product is generally relayed to bespoke gcs and disseminated to the customer thereafter it is useful for identifying movement patterns over wide area for ex ample identifying routes over land borders dissemination of masint 52 because of the requirement for specialist analysis the product is generally not available via rvt to remote locations rather it is downlinked to gcs in theatre or specialist analyst out of theatre and disseminated to the customer via secure it network thereafter restricted 40 restricted istar products geoint 53 geospatial intelligence geoint gives the customer an intelligence product which visually depicts physical features and geographically referenced activity on or just below the earths surface it can combine imint products taken from range of platforms with mapping or other geo data which allows the analyst to detect physical change ov er period of time change detection can be as simple as di sturbed earth but may answer an ir relating to local activity 54 collection platforms include uavs aerial isr platforms government satellites and even commercial satellite imagery the necessary product fusion required to produce valuable geoint means that it must inevitably come from trained analyst although some coalition aerial platforms carry an analyst on board 55 common uses of geoint include identification of patterns of activity such as movement of people or vehicles over an area over period of time or even i pb support to offensive operations 56 basic geoint can be produced locally some bgs even have geo cell although this tends to be equipped only to produce basic geo products more commonly the requirement for multi product fusion means it will probably be analysed at fusion cell or agency level and distributed back in to theatre through accredited it systems ie delivery to fobs must be considered when asking for this productrestricted 41 restricted istar products humint 57 human intelligence humint covers all intelligence derived from human sources it is difficult to plan large scale collection but it can pr ovide critical and unique insights in to local patterns and networks humint is commonly used to identify hostile planning and to cue fu rther collection against suspect targets the number of possi ble humint sources is often underestimated some of the most common include 58 strategic humint strategic humint can be derived from combination of humint sources but is most commonly collated and assessed by sis fo r national strategic audience content tends to target national po litical and diplomatic trends or individuals but it can also iden tify intelligence with operational and tactical significance strategic humint products and requests for support will normally be provided through the oisg 59 field humint field humint teams fhts are generally only deployed in operational theatres and are normally organic to the land component they can work in both an overt and covert posture and the intelligence they provide is at the operational and tactical level the majority of it is derived form agent contacts debriefs and interrogation because of the necessary autonomy within their role they are diffi cult to task directly but the intelligence they produce can be fed back in to the formation quickly restricted 42 restricted istar products 60 routine patrolling when routine green patrols have contact with the local populati on they can collect valuable humint collection opportunities will be determined in part by the environment and the raw information must not be treated as intelligence until it has been assessed for accuracy and reliability iintelligenc from routine patrols can be used to cue further directed collection and i dentify patterns which have operational significance 61 walkins walkins usually refers to information provided voluntarily and unexpectedly by local source this intelligence can be unique source with knowledge of imminent activity or threat but the collector must balance this with the need to assess and corroborate the information which includes assessing the motives of the source the qualit of information from walkin can also be limited by the sour ces fear of compromise and retaliation whilst walkins can be vary valuable the act of recruiting and running agents s hould only be done by trained specialists restricted 43 restricted istar products 62 private security companies pscs pscs frequently recruit former members of the milit ary and relations either formal or informal can often have useful intelligence dividends it should be stressed that units must not trade intelligence the classification of any informati on must be applied rigorously dissemination of humint 63 almost all humint will be disseminated via the j2 cell within the formation headquarters and down through the appropriate intelligence representat ives rfis should also be directed to the j2 cell through the istar representative if that is the system employed in that theatrerestricted 44 restricted istar products weapon locating and force protection 64 in addition to the products listed previously in section 4 there exist number of other capabilities which do not comfortably fit into any product category this includes capabilities which provide force prot ection at security force bases such as cctv and weapon locating equipment capable of identifying the launch site of i ndirect fire weapons it is common for mutually supporting assets to form force protection bubble around given location 65 most force protection assets provide real time eo andor imagery in given radius and can be used to cue other assets such as indirect fire in some cases tactical sigint systems have also been used to identify threats to specific base and have been incorporated in to the force protection bubble 66 weapon locating is normally conducted by either radar or acoustic sensors and allows oper ators to identify an assessed firing point to sufficient accuracy to be able to direct fire on to it most systems are operated by specialists and are land organic assets 67 more information about system s in both these categories is included in section 5 restricted 45 restricted istar assets section 5 istar assets 68 this section contains info rmation on the capabilities of number of istar collection asse ts the information includes the type of platform and sensors carried and the level at which the asset is held and tasked the three levels are 69 coalition the highest level coalition assets are controlled by the caoc at udei d in qatar from here they are allocated to theatre of operations this can include major theatres such as iraq and afghanis tan or any other theatre considered to be strategically im portant allocations are made on priority basis by mission mangers for each product type ie imint sigint etc 70 uk joint the uk air component commander uk acc has control over all uk owned assets and sits in the caoc acting effectively as uk to the caoc on receipt of an isr request he will always attempt to answer it using uk assets when this is not possible it is passed up to the caoc 71 land organic these are assets which are held by uk land forces either at formation unit or sub unit level an istar planner should always aim to satisfy isr requests from within his organic resources and when making an isr bid should have conplan for filling istar gaps if t he assets are withdrawn at short notice this is common in iraq
