6608c23 shspec77 organization business org pattern wouldnt fit scientology org because business orgs have never isolated the principles of organization in scientology org you are handling life as commodity and you are handling life with vessel made out of life this is like trying to pour water into pitcher made of water in this situation you will find out every frailty in an organization but one law businesses have not violated any organization is better than organization individuals as such operating together will fall apart when they collide with an organized group brilliant leadership can only go so far it needs execution otherwise it fails an organization will normally win unless it is confronted with superior organization an organization consists of group of individuals with common goal or purpose there will never be an org that is perfect because it is composed of individuals who are to greater or lesser degree informed of the rules and in agreement with the purpose an organization must to some degree consist of sentient irreducible individuals it must depend on the individuals for instance literacy is prerequisite for democracy england does better than some other democracies because it has high level of education individuals in the us have so many and varying prejudices that none can really take hold it also has high level of education therefore it is the richest country in the world business management in the us is very tight in spite of bad leadership that will eventually cause trouble the us is doing well organization also has drawbacks 1 limited power of choice of the individual 2 an organization often swallows up the talents and potential contributions of the individual 3 it often plays hobb with the very principles that it is trying to forward 4 wrongly led an organization becomes machine that goes straight over the cliff to destruction but the plus points prevail over the outpoints organizations endure better than individuals on the whole track orgs best survived when led by keyedout ot you would think that these individuals would be unorganizable because of their differences of opinion yes they do have differences of opinions but they still realize that it is better to be organized than not they also recognize the liabilities of orgs higher posts shift lot in ot organizations the ots are minority group in charge of fantastic majorities an individual who puts together an organization without knowing how to do it makes mess law of organization large organization is composed of groups and small organization is composed of individuals when large org is composed of individuals the individual gets devalued you get lack of comparability between the individual and the group of which he is member therefore the individual feels oppressed the people vs john jones makes paranoid therefore the ideal form of organization is individuals composed into subgroups if you try to produce group that is all composed of individuals and expand it it goes all to pieces an org will remain small group as long as it is composed of individuals income tax is violation of this principle because the individual must report to the government once year thus quite apart from the economics of income tax eg penalizing up stats this will make the country grow smaller each person can be jumped on by the government without buffer you must cut out the situation of having an organization vs an individual and stick to the situation of the organization vs group group does have an optimum size seven or eight subordinates is lot if person had only two subordinates he would loaf so the optimum is somewhere between two and eight so we can say that five is optimal big group then would be ten and small group would be two or three by the time you are getting up into group of seven or eight it is best to split things up into two groups the members of each section look to their section leader this also means that an executive spends one sixth of his time consulting with higher management and five sixths of his time dealing with his five subordinates director only looks to his section leaders and an executive secretary only looks to directors danger condition would consist of an exec sec giving orders to section leaders bypassing the director when this happens the org will get smaller you could move this organizational scheme out to where the org could contain the population of the planet size means nothing if you know this law of organization therefore you need an expandable and contractable system the lowest number in group should be five to six people two people isnt really group it is pair when the state breaks down the family as group the church etc the state shrinks when manager becomes overworked his area wont expand therefore if you want to expand make sure your manager isnt overworked you cant have section that is independent of other sections if you try to have such section it will float free and collapse it must have service and communication connections with the rest of the group there are seven divisions on the org board the org board is cylinder circle to show this fact we put the seventh division in front of div 1 you enter the org board at the first department of the first division the org board is organized to impel particle from the first division on out through the back door any particle entered early will shunt late div 7 doesnt necessarily catch what is ejected at div 6 so there is way out of the org board if you violate the position of anything on this chart you cut your throat the order of departments was found by trial and error earlier on we got into trouble because we tried to put origin or construction in dept 9 now 1976 the department of records assets and materials in div 3 it belonged at origin so construction had to be back towards source if something is mispositioned on the board it will be nonfunctional and will cease to work the order of the divisions is 1 hco you have to start with communications 2 dissem dissemination is necessary with the communication you must tell people what you are going to make 3 organization division treasury this is the division that organizes the mest for the assembly of products 4 tech this division has to do with production 5 qual this division deals with correction or adjustment 6 distribution this division is to get rid of the product this is also sales division when they are busy getting rid of the product they are also making new customers that enter at div 1 7 executive the first department would be the office of the ed or general manager the problem in an organization is one of succession but if you get management you dont need succession the lrh comm approves anything that is not against policy that the ed wants to do the us should have the office of george washington each department should have less than or equal to five sections or it should be written up again then you get subsections units subunits etc the org board is flow chart an other primary law of management the fastflow system of management dont inspect before it goes wrong this just holds up the activities of the organization and puts in arbitraries you dont run an organization by being supernervous you let something happen then you act dont put in permanent preventers let the flow go an organization must produce something everyone must have stat the org pattern would do for government it is far more socialistic than socialism and far more communistic than communism socialism and communism are relatively conservative in comparison you would introduce individual companies into your organization as service or production units the reason why divisions are in units of three departments is that you have the head of the division representing the thetan and the three departments representing the mind body and product respectively
