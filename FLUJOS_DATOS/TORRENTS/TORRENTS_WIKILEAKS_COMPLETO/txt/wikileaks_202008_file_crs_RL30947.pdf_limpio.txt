industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30947us tobacco production consumption and export trends summary examination of historical tobacco data reveals declining longterm trend in the utilization of tobacco by us manufacturer s and leaf exporters while world tobacco exports increased over the past two decades us leaf tobacco exports declined in relative and absolute terms cigarette manufacturers have been increasing the use of less expensive foreign tobacco and decreas ing the use of more costly usgrown tobacco now actions taken as result of the 1998 master ttlement agreement between cigarette manufacturers and states attorneys general are further diminishing the consumption of tobacco products in th united states cigarette exports also have been declining recently in contrast to history of growth total utilization of usgrown tobacco has been declining since 1975 from 1941 billion pounds to 1121 billion pounds in 2001 42 drop in the farm weight exports of tobacco leaf peaked in 1978 at 765 million pounds farm weight and then declined to an estimated 399 million pounds in 2002 this decline occurred during time when world exports were growing the us share of world exports has declined from 27 in 1969 to 7 in 2002 even when us cigarette manufacturing output was growing the use of domestic leaf was declining manuf acturing use declined from 16 billion pounds in 1952 to 688 million pounds in 2001 use of domestic leaf tobacco has declined because the amount of tobacco in each cigarette is now about 40 less than what it was 45 years ago the total number of cigarettes consumed in the united states has declined from 640 b illion in 1 981 to an estimated 420 billion in 2002 and ciga rettes now contain only about 52 domestic tobacco while they once contained more than 90 reflection of the declining competitiveness of usgrown tobacco the only growth market for us t obacco since 1984 has been through the export of cigarettes cigarette exports climbed from less than 60 billion in the early 1980s to 244 billion in 1996 this market has since declined to 127 billion in 2002 the drop in cigarette ex ports is the equivalent of about 119 million pounds of usgrown tobacco the federal tobacco price support progra m keeps us tobacco prices higher than they would otherwise be and encour ages the use of less expensive foreign tobacco foreign producers have been increasing the quantity and improving the quality of their tobacco in 2002 im ported cigarette tobacco was delivered to the united states for about 40 of the cost of usgrown tobacco the farm price of tobacco and the to tal value of produc tion have trended upward when measured in current dollars however since 1980 reduced output and inflation have caused dec line in the inflationadjusted

supply and demand situation for us tobacco in the context of historical trends1 an examination of historical patterns combined with the knowledge of current forces sh aping domestic and export demand for us tobacco underscores the pessimis m heard from farmers about prospects for the future farmers and rural communities in tobacco regions have received some and are seeking additional economic adjustment assistance and the reasons why are made obvious by the data graphical presentations of historical da ta show the time path that has brought the us tobacco industry to its current s ituation in addition with the aid of linear regression techniques trend lines are pl otted that project through the year 2005 these trend lines are not intended as predictions of the future and they are not constructed from explanatory models of the tobacco economy the trend line projections assume that the forces in place in the past will continue without change changes in consumer preferences changes in regulations or laws that affect consumption or international trade or large changes in purchasing power if they occur can be expected to substantially alter the projections from the trend lines2 number of forces already are in place and others could arise that likely will shift the utilization of us tobacco below th historical trend it is not the purpose of this report to analyze these forces but some of the obvious ones are listed and should temper any evaluation of the timeseries projectionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30947crs2 contributing to an outlook of substan tially reduced us demand for tobacco products is the november 1998 master settlement agreement msa between cigarette manufacturers and states attorneys general the msa requires manufacturers to pay 206 billion over 26 year s to states the manufacturers have raised wholesale prices 67 pe r pack primarily to help meet their msa obligations furthermore while states individually w ill determine how to spend the funds some portion likely will be used to discourage smoking tobacco farmers anticipated that th msa would negatively impact production and therefore the economic welfare of themselves and their communities in fact the utilization of usgrown tobacco has dr opped more than expected from domestic cigarette price increases alone in 1997 us tobacco production was 1787 billion pounds and by 2002 it was down to 890 million pounds 50 decline in five years federal and state excise taxes also continue to increase the federal excise tax increased to 034 per pack on january 1 2000 and to 039 on january 1 2002 state and local excise taxes vary widely but the weighted average was 042 per pack over the 200102 period the highest tax rate as of january 1 2003 was 151 per pack in massachusetts and the lowe st was 25 per pack in virginia health education and antismoking effo rts are developing in many other countries and these could negatively infl uence global consumption and trade in may 2003 the world health organization adopted the framework convention on tobacco control fctc aimed at curb ing tobaccorelated deaths and disease us leaf tobacco has long been losing competitive strength in global export markets the primary reason is the high pr ice for us tobacco caused by the federal price support program the quality character istics that have long made us tobacco more valuable than tobacco from other c ountries are becoming less important the quality of foreign tobacco is improving also cigarette manufact urers have learned how to utilize lower quality tobacco in ci garettes without adve rsely impacting on the final product export markets long have been the gr owth opportunity for usmanufactured cigarettes now it appears that world cigarette markets are likely to be supplied the light blend american style cigarette fro m overseas plants many owned by us companies tobacco farmers and their communities wa nt and have received some assistance to help offset the decline in sales re venues associated with reduced production while not included in the msa the manufacturers did agree to give tobacco farmers 515 billion over 12 years as compensation in or der to help them adjust

are now examining range of alternatives to provide assistance in the future farmer assistance options range from compensatory payments for quota reduc tions as was done for the 1999 and 2000 crops to quota buyouts an option debated by congress in 1998 2002 and 2003 see crs report rl31790 tobacco quota buyout proposals in the 108th congress other suggestions include helping farmers to shift to alternative agricultural enterprises nonfarm business development training for nonfarm oc cupations household income support and possibly even support for the economic infrast ructure and social services that will suffer with shrinking tobacco economy in general future prospects for us tobacco growers do not look good the states feeling the greatest impact of the declining tobacco pr oduction

the tobacco price support pr ogram which has ttempted to stabilize supplies by limiting production through acr eage allotments and marketing quotas tobacco production has shown substantial fluctuations from year to year figure 1 these wide annual fluctuations reflect weather impacts on yield as well as administered marketing quota changes inte nded to bring longerterm supply into balance with demand over time production has necessa rily followed downward trend that nearly matches the utilization trend line shown in figure 6 tobacco production in 1950 totaled 2030 billion pounds and in 2002 it was 881 million 46 decline wide fluctua tions in production from year to year give the trend line little or shortterm predictive value primary data source usda ers trend r2 63httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30947crs6 figure 2 us tobacco acreagethe decline in production is reflected in the decline in acreage tobacco harvest declined from 1599000 acres in 1950 to 428660 acres in 2002 73 decline figure 2 tobacco yields have gradually increased over time and for that reason the decline in acreage is greater than the decline in production in percentage terms primary data source usda ers trend r2 84 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30947crs7 figure 3 farms growing tobacco in the ustobacco farming long has been consolidating into fewer but larger farms but the scale of production remains small compar ed to other crops the number of farms growing tobacco decreased from about 512000 in 1954 to about 90 000 in 1997 shown in figure 3 the average tobacco acreage of 93 in 1997 shown in table 1 is 210 increase over the 3acre average in 1954 primary data source us census of agriculture various issues trend r2 98httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30947crs8 figure 4 average farm price for leaf tobaccothe average annual price received by farm ers for all tobacco has increased over time and at relatively steady rate figure 4 this is predictable because the federal price support program has created floor under market prices since the 1930s see crs report 95129 for more detailed explanation of th program manufacturers and exporters of usgrown tobacco must outbid the support price at the auction sale or farmers tobacco is placed in storage and held off the market until market prices increase tobacco does not deteriorate in storage but rather must be aged cured before it is suitable for manufacturing fa rmers receive the federal support price with funds borrowed from the usdas commod ity credit corporation ccc the stored tobacco serves as loan collateral this is called putting tobacco under loan the 2003 crop support price is 1656 per pound for fluecured tobacco and 1835 for burley tobacco primary data source usda ers trend r2 92 by law the tobacco price s upport program must operate at net cost to taxpayers the ccc is assured of recovering the loan principal plus interest because nonetcost assessment is levied on all domestic tobacco as well as imported tobacco the assessment proceeds are held in reserve to offset any future losses should the loan tobacco fail to bring sufficiently high price in the future the support price for tobacco is calcula ted according to formula written into law the formula includes the support price of the preceding year adjusted byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30947crs9 figure 5 farm value of tobacco productionchanges in the 5year moving average of market prices excluding the highest and lowest and changes in the costofproduc tion index the element of the formula that continuously pushes the support price up with occasional interruptions is an index of tobacco growers cost of producti on the prices paid index on occasion congress has acted to retard the rate of increase in the tobacco support price this has happened when inventories of loan tob acco have reached such high levels that large loan losses appear inevitable congress most recently enacted relatively sharp cut in the support price in the mid1980s because the market price for tobacco is heavily influenced by the federal support price and because the pport price can be altered by legislative fiat the trend line projection of average prices received by farmers has little value as forecast short of legislative change the tobacco support program loan operations keep the average market price from falling below the mandated loan price the farm value of tobacco crop is qual to production times the average price received by farmers this calculation does not exactly equal farm cash receipts but it does serve as an approximation in spite of the downward trend in production the trend in crop value has been upward figure 5 this has happened because the increasing support price has more than offs et declining production the farm value of the 2002 tobacco crop is estimated to be about 1726 billion this is about half the 35 billion peak of 1981 and 1982 primary data source usda ers trend r2 63httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30947crs10 figure 6 deflated average farm price for leaf tobaccoeven with the tobacco price support prog ram farmers claim they have trouble paying their expenses and making profit this concern has some merit despite the data showing crop values tr ending upward in fact the average market price has gone up very little over the past 15 years while inflation has eroded its purchasing power figure 6 from 1950 through the 1970s the inflation adjusted price of tobacco did not drop very much below the 1950s equivalent of about 350 per pound in 2002 dollars however by 2002 th purchasing power was down to 192 trend r2

co mparatively sharp drop after 1980 figure 7 certainly an assessment of farmers ec onomic condition require s an examination of costs and net revenues but these ar beyond the scope of this report trend r2 85 the historical data on tobacco producti on prices and crop value show tobacco farm sector struggling to maintain itsel f since 1980 but sometimes not able to keep up with inflation even prior to the 1998 master settlement ag reement there was little reason to expect future growth the longterm trend in production of us tobacco has been downward which matches the declining utilization of usgrown tobacco by manufacturersas necessary to balance supply with demand the 1998 msa envisions drop in us cigarette c onsumption particularly among teenagers and children financial terms of the settlement imply higher cigarette prices reduced consumption in response to the higher prices and reduced use of leaf tobacco by the manufacturershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30947crs12 figure 8 utilization manufact ure and export of usgrown tobaccoutilization of usgrown tobacco more than 94 of the tobacco grown in the united states is used in the manufacture of cigarettes either domestically or overseas the remainder is processed for chewing snuff cigars and pipe s for the most part data in this report include all tobacco unless the focus is limite d to cigarette tobacco but even when the data apply to all tobacco ciga rette tobacco overwhelmingly dominates the manufacture and export of usgrown tobacco fluctuated ar ound 20 billion pounds until around 1975 since then utilizati on has followed declining longterm trend dropping to an estimated low of 688 million pounds in 2001 as shown in figure 8 there have been substantial depart ures from the trend line to better appraise the likelihood of fu ture utilization prospects it is helpful to separately examine the leaf export and domestic manufacturing markets primary data source usda ers trend r2 85httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30947crs13 figure 9 exports of usgrown tobaccous tobacco leaf exports exports of unmanufactured tobacco have shown large am ount of annual variation with fluctuations of 10 to 15 being quite common this annual variation eliminates any predictive value of statistical trend line however it does appear that tobacco leaf exports were increasing through 1978 when they reached peak of 765 million pounds and then began to decline figure 9 estimated exports of 399 million pounds in 2002 are 48 below the 1978 peak primary data source usda ers trend r2

nation was the worl ds leading exporter of unmanufactured tobacco it held the leading position until 1993 when brazil moved ahead the united states is now distant second expor ting 36 as much as brazil however the historically dominant export position of the united states belies the longterm loss of export share figure 10 in 1960 the united states accounted for 27 of world exports of unmanufactured tobacco by 2002 the us share had fallen to 73 the drop in export share is the result of two compounding forces first the volume of us tobacco exports has been on downward trend since 1978 second and in contrast to declining us exports exports by othe r countries have been increasing the biggest export gains have been made by brazil argentina malawi and thailand the tobacco produced and exported by thes countries is directly competitive with us fluecured and burley tobacco in fact the united states itself has become major destination for shipments from these competing countries primary data source usda ers trend r2 95httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30947crs15 3 while these data apply directly to kentucky they are probably not far from lease and sale prices in north carolina according to expe rts in north carolina and the us department of agriculture data are not available on north carolina these data are compiled and published by dr william snell university of kentucky in an annual report titled the kentucky quota sales and leasing market 4 import and export quantity and value data are collected by the department of commerce these calculations are from data published in usda fas tobacco world markets and trade april 2003 all tobacco undergoes certain processing packing and storage before it is ready for manufacturing these processing and handling costs account for the price being higher at the export terminal than at farm auctionhistorically the united states dominant export position was due to its ability to deliver large supplies of high quality ci garette tobacco this tobacco has proven quite desirable in the milder americanstyle cigarettes that have gained in worldwide popularity over the traditional stronger cigarettes so common outside the united states until as recently as 20 years ag only small quantities of foreign tobacco could be blended successfully with usgrown tobacco in the americanstyle cigarettes to large degree us tob acco growers had monopoly in the production of high quality mild tobaccos used to manufacture americanstyle cigarettes the near monopoly situation for us tobacco made it possible to create domestic price support program with high and continuously increasing prices in fact the profits created by the price s upport program have b ecome capitalized into annual quota rental rates that have aver aged 43 per pound over the past 10 years increasing to 53 over the past 3 years about 1000 per acre similarly the sale of farmland with tobacco quota has br ought premium of about 185 per pound over the past 10 years and 214 over th past 3 years about 4200 per acre3 ultimately the federal suppor t program created an umbr of price protection for foreign producers with assistance from cigarette manufacturers tobacco growers in especially brazil zimbabwe malawi and argentina have improved the quality of their tobacco and expanded production at the same time cigarette manufacturers have develope d methods for utilizing larger proportions of lower quality tobacco while still maintaining acceptable smoking quality finally consumers have shown willingness to accep t the socalled lower quality generic cigarettes in return for lower prices together these factors have enabled foreign tobacco to displace usgrown tobacco in americanstyle cigarettes the obvious motivation for cigarette ma nufacturers to use nonus tobacco is to lower their input costs currently foreigngrown tob acco is being delivered to us buyers at about 40 of the cost of domestic tobacco data from invoices examined at ports of entry in 2002 s how the landed value of imported tobacco averaged 125 per pound in contrast sales invoices report the export price of us tobacco averaged 310 per pound4 there are two reasons that the price of us tobacco is currently 23 times as high as imported tobacco first and most important the federal tobacco price support program establishes floor under market prices if commercial buyers do not offer bids higher than the support price farmers are paid the support price withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30947crs16 5 this estimate is based upon the separate anal yses of dr blake br own of north carolina state university and dr william snell of the university of kentucky as they reported in testimony before the senate committee on agriculture nutrition and forestry on september 18 1997 6 the dispute settlement panel of gatt issued its report july 15 1994 in addition to determining that the domestic content requireme nt violated the agreement the panel found that budget deficit assessment on imported t obacco was also in violation but the nonet cost assessment on imported tobacco did not violate gatt tariff rate quota allows imports of specified quantity quota with minimal tariff and above that quantity imposes prohibitively high tariff imposition of ta riff rate quota obligates the united states to negotiate compensation with exporting c ountries who lose access to the us market failure to negotiate acceptable compensation entitles the injured countries to retaliate however to date the tariff rate quota on tob acco has been sufficiently large compared to imports that it has not been restrictivemoney lent by the commodity credit corpor ation this tobacco goes into storage and is held off the market until prices improve second much usgrown tobacco has quality advantage that manufacturers are willing to pay extra for as demonstrated by its continued use in dom estic cigarettes and its export to foreign cigarette manufacturers in the absence of federal support prog ram the price of usgrown tobacco would decline but probably not as low as the price of foreign tobacco some economists predict that prices would declin by 25 or more which translates into decline of about 050 from the 2002 average of 191 per pound5 in 1993 the congressional reaction to th competitive price advantage achieved by foreign tobacco was to impose high penalties on cigarette manufacturers who used less than 75 usgrown tobacco in their cigarettes contained in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 pl 103 66 was provision that effectively established 75 domestic content requi rement on usmanufactured cigarettes the domestic content requirement soon wa s determined to be in violation of international trading rules as part of the implementing legislation for the uruguay round trade agreement the domestic cont ent rule was replaced with tariff rate quota provisions6 however this tariff rate quot does not effectively limit imports first the quota quantity is sufficiently rge that it has not been reached second duty drawback rules allow the recovery of duty on all imported tobacco that is exported in cigarettes the policy of duty drawback which applie s to all imports not just tobacco encourages manufacturing jobs in the united states yet the end products do not compete in the domestic market because they are exportedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30947crs17 figure 11 domestic manufacturing use of usgrown tobaccomanufacturing use of leaf tobacco at the peak in 1952 us manufactur ers utilized nearly 16 billion pounds of domestically produced tobacco in the ma nufacture of tobacco products following 45 years of decline estimated 2001 utiliza tion of 688 billion pounds is already down to the trend level projected for the year 2005 primary data source usda ers trend r2 86 much of the decline in domestic manufacturing utilization of usgrown tobacco can be attributed to reduced cigarette consumption by americans nevertheless cigarette out put has actually followed an upward trend over the same period that domestic tobacco utilization has been declining this seeming contradiction can be explained by the changing character of usmanufactured cigarettes the amount of tobacco in each cigarette has declin ed and the proportion of foreigngrown tobacco in us cigarettes has been increasinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30947crs18 figure 12 us cigarette productioncigarette production more than 94 of the tobacco produced in the united states is used in the manufacture of cigarettes consequently us ciga rette manufacturers are the primary domestic users of usgrown tobacco the major cigarette tobaccos are fluecured grown primarily in north carolina and neighborin g regions and burley grown primarily in kent ucky and neighboring regions marylandtype tobacco grown in maryland and pennsylvania also is used in cigarettes but in relatively small amounts some imported tobaccos also are used by us cigarette manufacturers oriental tobaccos added for purposes of flavor and aroma are traditional component of mild americanstyle cigarettes oriental tobaccos are not grown in the united states but are impor ted primarily from turkey in addition cigarette manufactures have increasingly used less expensive imported fluecured and burley tobacco from south america africa and asia us cigarette production increased at nearly steady rate from 1950 through the peak year of 1996 when output reached 7545 billion cigarettes figure 12 year 2002 production of 565 billion cigarettes is

of usmanufactured cigarettesthe drop in pounds of tobacco smoked is reflection of the declining number of smokers combined with smaller amount of tobacco in each cigarette long steady decline in the amount of tobacco in cigarettes began in 1953 and continued to the late 1970s figure 17 for the first half of this century cigarettes contained about 27 pounds of tobacco per thousand pieces since

domestic c ontent law that took effect january 1 1994 however the tariff rate quota which repl aced the domestic content law in september 1995 does not serve as an effective import ba rrier because of its generous size and because manufacturers can recover the duty they pay on imported tobacco if it is subsequently exported in cigarettes during the september 13 2001 through september 12 2002 quota year 2474 million pounds declared weight were imported under the 3322 million pound limit amounting to 74 of the quota how do the combined forces of gra dually declining population of cigarette smokers declining per capita consumpti on rate reduced quantity of tobacco in each cigarette and the substitution of fo reign tobacco for domestic tobacco in cigarettes translate into consumption of domestic tobacco by us smokers figure 19 shows relatively steady declin from 1029 milli on pounds in 1966 to 419 million pounds in 2001 simp linear projection puts the consumption of us grown tobacco

manufacturers have not had to depend solely upon the us market for the sale of cigarettes in sharp contrast to the declining domestic market the rest of the world has offered us cigarette ma kers opportunities for expansion world cigarette trade has been increasing steadily for most of the past 30 years figure 20 the ups and downs of the past 6 years are unusual and are partially attributed to financial crises in asia and eastern europe that imp acted demand however with increasing incomes and consumption in many of the developing countries of the world there is little reason to believe the

prospects for cigarette manufacturers world consumption in 2002 using worl d cigarette production as proxy for consumption excluding the united states may have been about 5 trillion cigarettes with about onethird being americanstyle cigarettes made from primarily fluecured and burley tobacco if the milder americanstyle cigarette is the preferred choice then manufacturers have large market of

keep pace with the past domestic manufacturers have actually lost market share in the ear ly 1960s the united states accounted for more than 33 of global cigarette exports in 2002 by contrast the us share was 14 figure 24 the data are too erratic to give statistical validity to trend line but the large loss of market share does raise stions about the global competitiveness of domestic manufacturers primary data source usda fas trend r2 30 the apparent lack of competitiveness of domestic cigarette manufacturers may be more of problem for us growers than for the manufacturers philip
