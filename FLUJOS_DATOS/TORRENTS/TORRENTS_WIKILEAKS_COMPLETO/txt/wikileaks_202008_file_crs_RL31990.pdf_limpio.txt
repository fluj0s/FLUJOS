assets through security reviews risk assessment and inspections the office of pipeline safety ops within the department of transportation dot is the l ead federal regulator of pipeline safety while tsa and the ops have distinct missions pipeline security nd safety are intertwined there are questions about the ppropriate division of responsibility between the agencies and about the resources they will have for mandate d security activities as the lead agency for pipeline security tsa expects pipeline operators to maintain security plans based on security guidance initially circulated in 2002 tsa also plans to issue pipeline security regula tions although it is unclear if and when it will do so this agency also intends to issue new analytic models to help operators identify critical facilities and assess vulnerab ility to terrorist ttack in 2003 tsa inspected 24 of the largest 2530 pipeline operators to review their security practices and collect critical asset data tsa found that nearly all of these operators had met or exceeded minimum security guidelines all but two of the 24 operators also provided tsa with their security plans nd critical infrastructur information the ops joined tsa on approxima tely onethird of these inspections and expects continued security role the agencies ve formal cooperative agreement defining responsibilities and at this point do not think they need one industry and government agencies generally assert that efforts to promote us pipeline security are on the right track nonetheless tsas current funding for pipeline security will provide only limited capability for inspections and enforcement of any future regulations the presiden t s fy2005 budget request does not include line item for tsas pipeline activities they will be f unded

have vital links to other critical infrastructure like power plants airports and military bases while an efficient and fundamentally safe means of transport many pipelines carry volatile or flammable materials with the potential to cause public injury and environmental damage the nations pipeline networks ar also widespread running alternately through remote and densely populated re gions consequently these systems are inherently vulnerable to terro rist attack pipeline operato rs have had security and emergency response programs in place fo r decades but they have recently been taking

operate strictly within individual states6 these inter state and intra state transmission pipelines feed around 11 million miles of regional lines in some 1300 local distribution networks7 collectively these gas pipelines transport nearly all of the natural gas in the united states gas pipelines serve electric generation and industrial customers directly and link thr ough city gates to regional distribution mains which in turn feed the local service lines of retail gas consumers some pipelines are also connected to liquefied natural gas lng storage tanks which augment pipeline gas supplies during peak demand periods according to the department of energy there are 113 active lng facilities in the us mostly in the northeast many locat ed near populated areas8 safety record of the pipeline industry taken as whole releases from pipelin cause relatively few annual fatalities oil pipelines reported an average of 14 deaths per year from 19972001 gas pipelines reported an average of 186 d eaths per year during the same period9 it is difficult to make direct safety comp arisons between pipelines and other transportation modes due to data limitations nonetheless dot statistics suggest that pipelines have much lower fatalities per tonmile of general freight moved than truck rail or waterborne transport in general the nvironmental safety record of oil pipelines is comparable to other transportation modes according to the oil industrys own estimates from 19952000 oil pipelines spilled an average of 09 gallonsmillion barrelmiles of il compared to 15 for trucks 07 for rail and 07 for barges10 similar direct comparisons for gas pipelines are not available accidental pipeline releases result from variety of causes including outside force eg thirdparty excavation corro sion mechanical failure control system failure and operator error natural forces such as fl oods and earthquakes can also damage pipelines according to the dot of 183 gas pipeline accidents reported

context of security for two reasons such releases happen much more frequently than is likely to occur from limited terrorist activity in the united states and the pipeline industry has extensive experience re sponding to releases and generally does so relatively quickly although pipeline releases have caused relatively few fatal ities in absolute numbers single pipeline accident can be catastrophic for example 1999 gasoline pipeline explosion in bellingham washington killed two children and an 18yearold man and caused 45 million in da mage to city water plant and other property in 2000 natural gas pipelin explosion near carlsbad new mexico killed 12 campers including 4 children12 these accidents generated substantial scrutiny of pipeline regulation and increased state and community activism related to pipeline safety13 the accidents also highlighted the danger of pipelines as possible terror weapons because of thei r potential to harm people and damage property in their vicinity pipeline security risks like any physical system pipelines are vulnerable to vandalism and terrorist attack the physical plant of these facilities may be damaged with explosives or by other mechanical means disrupting flows and causing release of pipeline contents alternatively computer control system s may be cyberattacked or both physical and cyber attack may happen at the same time some pipelines may also be indirectly disrupted by other types of terror strikes such as attacks on regional electricity grids or telecommunications networks which c ould in turn affect dependent pipeline control and safety systems14 since pipelines supply fuel for vehicles power plants aircraft heating military bases and other uses serious disruption of pipeline network poses additiona l downstream risks oil and gas pipelines have been favored target of terrorists outside the united states in colombia for example rebels have bombed occident petroleums caÃ±o limÃ³n pipeline some 950

actions high consequence areas include population centers commercially navigable waters and envir onmentally sensitive areas such as drinking water supplies or ecological reserves the integrity management approach directs priority resources to locati ons subject to the greatest consequences rather than applying uniform treatment to the entire pipeline network30 integrity management risk assessments could be interpreted to include security butthe regulation does not explicitly address terrorism and the ops has provided minimal guidance to operators regarding terrorism risks expected

integrity management programs similar to those required for oil pipelines under 49cfr195 integrity management as whole is intended to focus primarily on safety but certain elements may also have links to s ecurity depending upon interpretation and application for example the integrity mana gement rule for oil pipelines states that identifying the need for additional preventive and mitigative measures an operator must evaluate the likelihood of pipeline release occurring and how release could affect the high consequence area this dete rmination must consider all relevant risk factors 49cfr195452 guidance for this rule also cites security of throughput effects on customers if there is failure re quiring shutdown as risk factor for establishing ssessment frequency33 as is the case for oil pipelines the rule does not explicitly discuss risks from terror attacks nonetheless assessm ent of accident risks near population centers could provide im portant data for related terror risk

contact with all major pipeline operators to ensure that communication was open and viable between our offices and that they underst ood and adhered to the security issues additionally ops personnel c

of the countrys pipeline infrastructure the ops also conducted vulnerability assessment used to identify which pipeline facilities were most critical b ecause of their importance to meeting national energy demands or proximity to highly populated or environmentally sensitive areas the ops worked with i ndustry groups and state pipeline safety organizations to assess the industrys readiness to prepare for withstand and respond to terrorist attack52 the ops warned that critical pipeline facilities such as control centers pump and compressor stations and storage facilities might be targets

encouraging industry activ ities intended to better secure the nations pipelines in general the ops approach was to encourage operato rs to voluntarily improve their security practices rather than to develop new secur ity regulations in adopting this approach the ops sought to speed adoption of security measures by industry and avoid the publication of sensitive security informati on eg critical facility lists that would normally be required in public rulemaking54 the ops worked with several industry s ecurity task groups to define different levels of criticality to identify actions to strengthen protection based on this criticality and to develop plans for imp roved response preparedness the ops surveyed many pipeline companies to assess security measures taken since 911 together with doe and state pipeline agencies the ops promoted the development of consensus standards for security measur tiered to correspond with the five levels of threat warnings issued by the office of homeland security55 the ops also developed protocols for inspections of cr itical facilities to sure that operators implemented appropriate secu rity practices to convey emergency information and warnings the ops established variety of communication links to key staff at the most critical pipeline facilities through out the country the ops also began identifying nearterm technology to enha nce deterrence detection response and recovery and began seeking to advance public and private sector planning for response and recovery56 on september 5 2002 the ops circulat ed formal guidance defining the agencys security program recommendations and implementation expectations this guidance recommended that operators identify critical facilities develop security plans consistent with prior trade associa tion security guidance implement security plans and review those plans annually57 the guidance defined asset criticality in terms of threats risks to people and economic impacts from the loss of energy supply it also suggested specific security measures to be taken at the 5 different homeland security threat levels with over 50 cumulative measures at the highest threat level while the guidance was voluntary the ops expected compliance from operators of critical facilities the agency believed it had the authority to enforce the requirements if voluntary comp liance was not effective the ops asked operators for written statement certifying their compliance within 6 months the ops also informed operators of its intent to begin reviewing security programs within

faces several challenges as discussed in detail in the following sec tions many in industry are concerned about the quality of information about actual terro rism threats that th ey receive from dhs industry is also generally concerned that criteria for identifying critical facilities continue to evolve as result the pi peline industry is concerned that it may be forced to spend too much on pipeline security or spend in the wrong places diverting limited resources from safety programs and other important uses tsa faces resource constraints of its own limiting the agencys ability to improve industry security standards and oversee pipeline security in the field tsa and the ops currently cooperate on secur ity inspections but many in industry are still concerned about the possibility of redundant conflicting regula tory regimes federal threat information the dhs homeland security advisory system communicates terrorist threats to the public based on five threat conditions low guarded elevated high and severe represented by the colors green blue yellow orange and red73 the pipeline industrys security guidance links specific security measures to these five threat levels while this approach ensures some consistency in terror preparedness among pipeline systems many operators believe they require more specific threat information to make better security decisi ons and focus protection where it is truly needed for example these operators question whether an orange dhs threat level applies equally across the country74 by uniformly responding to what they perceive as ambiguous warnings operators believe they may expend scarce resources to bolster security at facilities that are not really under increased threat furthermore operators do not believe federal agencies ve been as effective as they could be communicating the specific threat information they do receive according to one industry representative cnn tells us first then we hear from fbi doe and other agencies75 concerns about nonspecific threat information are not endemic to pipelines however and they are not new dhs s ecretary ridge has acknowledged that the current colorcoded

facilities various industry representativ state that they need clear and stable definitions of pipeline asset criti cality so they will know exactly what assets to protect and how well to protect them otherwise the pipeline industry risks hardening too many facilities hardening the wrong facilities or both either outcome would increase ultimate costs to consumers without co mmensurate security benefits and could potentially divert scarce security resources from better uses within or outside the pipeline industry eg securi ng electric power stations despite the security guidance put forward by the ops in 2002 pipeline operators are still uncertain how regulators will ultimately identify critical facilities and what protections regulators will expect for them the definition of criticality developed by industry in 2002 and suppor ted in the ops guidance avoided numerical thresholds relying instead on discretionary qualitative metrics like significance of impact77 the ops has expressed its belief that this criticality definition may be too general and that clearer criticality thresholds are needed78 the hspd7 directive appears to narrow the definition of critica lity by emphasizing infrastructure and key resour ces that could be exploited to cause catastrophic health effects or mass casualties par 13 it is not clear however how this emphasis will change what is considered to be critical pipeline infrastructure the pipeline industry is also concerned that in its efforts to ensure consistency among transportation modes tsa will not appropriately treat pipeline assets as unique nonvehicular trans portation and key component in the nations broader energy infrastructure79 for example many are cerned that threshold parameters such as fair market value of lost asse t in tsas model mig ht not appropriately account for the downstream economic impact of disrupted gas or oil supplies80 pipeline security resources at tsa the presidents fy2005 budget request for dhs does not

of industry and other federa l agencies in addition tsa staff will conduct pipeline security inspections and force any future security regulations83 at its current staffing level tsas pipelines branch has limited field presence for inspections and possible enforcement of future regulations an issue of particular concern to tsa84 for comparison the ops can deploy around 500 federal and state safety inspectors across the same pipeline network according to tsa the agency cannot now use ops inspectors extensively for security work because the ops faces resource constraints of its own only handful of ops insp ectors are trained in security and even if the ops could lend inspectors to tsa the agency would require compensation tsa cannot currently offer85 furthermore it is not clear that tsa has mechanism under law to delegate inspection authority to state agencies like the ops does even if tsa did have such mechanism states appear generally unwilling to take on this responsibility lack the required security inspection skills and might not be able to adequate ly safeguard security information86 the tsa is reluctant to use contractors for field work because the pi peline industry is concerned about safeguarding security information87 tsas plan to focus security inspections at least initially on the largest pipeline and distribution system operators seeks to make the best use of limited staff it is an open question however how many of the remaining operators some 1000 systems should also be inspected critica lity assessment and risk analysis are still evolving so the basis for prioritizing one set of pipelines over another for security purposes is debatable for example while possibly less critical from national perspective smaller pipeline systems still present local security risks and could arguably be more vulnerable than larger sy stems if they have smaller security budgets and fewer staff dedicated to infrastruct ure protection without security plan verification and credible threat of enfo rcement operator compliance with security guidance may be inadequate leaving the pipeline network as whole less secure than it might be with more universal in

secretary mineta did not believe that formal agreem ent between tsa and the ops would be necessary because the two agencies were already working together88 the ops sees strong link between pipe line security and safety one senior agency administrator has asserted that s afety and security are interdependentthe distinction is function of intent to do damage89 in the context of its ongoing safety

vulnerabilities as well as tsas broader multisector perspective accordingly ops staff believe that while the ops will not be the major player in pipeline security the agency will always have role in particular according to the ops the agency plans to ensure that pipeline security measures do not adversel impact pipeline safety91 in the short term the ops plans to independently conduct s ecurity spill and response ex ercises and with tsa to jointly inspect operator security plans based on its security guidance of last year92 the ops has not however made longterm commitment to security inspectionscurrently using only minimal resources in the form of few staff working parttime with tsa the pipeline industry is generally c oncerned that it might face redundant conflicting regulatory regimes under differe nt agencies with teams from government stumbling over each other to inspect pipes 93 consequently ts believes sharper distinction ultimately may be needed between its security activities and the safety activities of the ops tsa is concerned that too much ops involvement in pipeline security may create confusion among operators as to which agency is in charge of security and what requirements may be in force the ops and tsa believe their responsibilities have been worked out however without the need for formal agreements the agencies are engaged in ongoing roundtable discussions with thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31990crs21 94 aga personal communication june 11 2003pipeline trade associations and ferc to address additional concerns as they emerge94 the pipeline security challenge in perspective us pipeline operators currently report specific threats to their networks but the nationss pipeline system is extensive and presents an inviting target it is widely accepted that protecting their assets better is in the best interest of operators and federal agencies are monitoring and encouraging these efforts as practical matter industry and governme nt could spend vast sums to enhance pipeline security but this investment would have to be balanced against many other investment needs and opportunities the ops and ts face resour ce limitations and have many other priorities besides pipeline security concerns furthermore it is widely held that pipelines are already safer and more secure than most other critical infrastructures while the pipeline industry continues to f ace challenges protec ting its assets many analysts believe that more urgent security challenges lie elsewhere conclusions both government and industry have ta ken numerous steps to try to improve pipeline security federal activities in this area are relatively new and agency responsibilities are still being sorted out but discussions with variety of industry representatives suggest that these efforts are generally thought to be moving in logical direction furthermore ongoing dialogue among the operators and federal agencies appears to be addressing many ements of federal pipeline security policy that have been causing concern as oversight of the federal role in pipe line security continues questions may be raised concerning the existing resources of tsa and its ability to execute its various pipeline security responsibilities especia lly the implementation and enforcement of any potential future pipeline security regulations congressional policymakers may pose questions are tsas pipeline security activities adequately funded is there solid basis for how tsa prioritizes the most critical pipeline systems so that important network security vulnerabilities are not overl ooked should tsa inspect more pipeline systems to ensure universal compliance with security guidelines is there an appropriate division of responsibility for pipeline security among the federal agencies to minimize the possibility of regulatory confusion and best balance agency missions with capabilities in addition to these specific issues congress may wish to assess how the various elements of us pipeline security activity fit together in the nations overall strategy to protect critical infrastructure for example increasing the number of pipeline security inspections by tsa could be of limited value if asset criticality is not clearly defined and fe deral threat information re mains ambiguous likewise diverting pipeline resources away from safety to enhance security might further reduce terror risk but not overall pipeline risk if safety programs become lesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31990crs22 effective as result us pipeline secur ity necessarily
