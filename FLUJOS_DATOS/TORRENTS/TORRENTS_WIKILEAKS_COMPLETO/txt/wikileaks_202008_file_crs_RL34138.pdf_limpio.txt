thought of as an equitable remedy19 its antecedents can be easily found in law as well20 as its name implies restitution restores the victim to the status quo that is making the depleted victim whole again21 restitution has been feature of the federal system of criminal justice for close to century in its earliest form it was an unwritten feature of an underwritten system of probation and suspended sentences22 then in 1916 the supreme court held that the lower federal courts had inherent power to suspend sentences23 congress responded by granting the courts explicit authority to suspend sentences and to place defendants on probation24 in doing so the courts were permitted to require probationers to pay in one or several sums fine imposed at the time of being placed on probation and to make restitution or reparation to the aggrieved party or parties for actual damages or loss caused by the offense for which conviction was had and to provide for the support of any person or persons for whose support they were legally responsible 25 this continued waive protections afforded him under the federal restitution laws 16 18 usc 3663 17 18 usc 3563b2 3583d 18 although

though the federal courts enjoy other power to order restitution in criminal case27 the authority was infrequently used and indifferently enforced28 congress found this situation unsatisfactory29 thus in the victim and witness protection act of 1982 vwpa it vested federal courts with the general discretion to order restitution in any criminal case arising out of title 18 of the united states code or in air piracy cases30 in the violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994 congress established mandatory restitution as feature of the federal criminal prohibitions on sexual abuse sexual exploitation of children and domestic violence31 then in the mandatory victim restitution act mvra portion of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 congress made mandatory restitution consequence of conviction in most serious federal criminal cases ie crimes of violence and when proscribed in title 18 of the united states code crimes against property including fraud 32

to number of constitutional challenges over the years some initially saw restitution as an alternative to civil litigation on behalf of the victims of crime if this were the case defendants claimed that they should enjoy seventh amendment right to have jury determine the facts upon which restitution order was based their challenges came to naught the supreme court has said that the seventh amendment extends only to civil actions similar to those tried before jury when the amendment was ratified in 1791 33 the lower courts rejected the seventh amendment challenges either because they concluded that restitution was criminal rather than civil sanction or because at common law restitution was not matter presented to jury in some cases the challenges were rejected for both reasons 34

restitution to its proper place in criminal law they point out that the average dollar losses victims ffer total hundreds of dollars not thousands and that most exoffenders not just those on probation

constitutional restrictions on sanctions such as the proscriptions on ex post facto laws excessive fines and cruel and unusual punishments if the seventh amendment right to jury trial in civil cases has bearing what of the sixth amendment right to jury trial in criminal cases on the question of retroactive application of new laws and the ex post facto clause there is consensus among the lower federal appellate courts although majority take the position that the clause applies and consequently exposure to increased restitution liability may not be applied retroactively 35 the scant case law available on the issue indicates that the eighth amendments excessive fines clause as well as its cruel and unusual punishment clause marks the outer bounds of the courts restitution authority36 these limitations however impose real impediments they condemn fines and punishments that are grossly disproportionate37 although by definition restitution must be exactly proportionate to the harm caused by the offense38 in those federal circuits where restitution is considered criminal penalty questions regarding the sixth amendment right to jury trial are rais ed in series of cases beginning with apprendi v new jersey39 and culminating in united states v booker 40 the supreme court held that the sixth amendment right to jury trial and the fifth amendment right to due process require that any fact other than prior conviction which is necessary to support sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by plea of guilty or jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to jury beyond reasonable doubt 41 restitution on the other hand is determined by the court on the basis of preponderance of the evidence nevertheless the lower federal appella courts have rejected arguments that the apprendi line of cases clouds the validity of restitution order under such circumstanceseither because restitution does not constitute criminal sanction and thus raises sixth amendment concerns or because the restitution statutes fail to set the statutory maximum necessary to trigger apprendi concerns42 35 united states v leahy 438 f3d 328 335 3d cir 2006ex post

type of injuries or losses does restitution cover as originally cast section 3663 vwpa authorized restitution for any victim of any crime proscribed in title 18 of the united states code but did not define victim 44 the supreme court read the statute narrowly and held that it authorized restitution only for the crime of conviction it did not authorize restitution for related charges dropped as part of plea agreement45 congress responded almost immediately with more explicit statement of section 3663s coverage46 it replicated and enlarged that statement when it enacted section 3663a six years later47 sections 3663 and 3663a authorize restitution orders for the benefit of the victims of the crime of conviction48 however the term victim is expressly defined ie person directly and

schemes or patterns among their elements although the mail fraud wire fraud and racketeering statutes do61 in such cases restitution may include the losses incurred from different episode of the scheme than the one mentioned in the indictment62 yet the scheme must be the same victims entitled to restitution do not include those harmed by an otherwise identical scheme but different in time or place than the crime of conviction63 the courts are divided over which statutes qualify as scheme conspiracy or pattern laws some say the scheme or pattern must be an element of the crime of conviction it is not enough that the defendants crime involves contrivance or repeated related criminality64 others say it is enough the statute proscribing the crime of conviction need not use the

defendants assets anticipated future income and other financial obligations139 compensation may be made in lump sum in kind payments installments or any combination of such methods of payment140 inkind payments may take the form of return of lost property replacement inkind or otherwise or personal services141 when the defendants financial condition precludes any alternative the order may call for nominal periodic payments142 several courts have emphasized the importance of the courts close attention to the restitution payment schedule by prohibiting sentencing courts from initially ordering that restitution be paid immediately when it is readily apparent that the defendant is unable to do so thereby effectively leaving the task of establishing payment schedule to the probation officer or the bureau of prisons143 the court may not take into account the fact that victim may have been compensated by insurance forfeiture civil litigation or any other alternative form of compensation of his or her injury loss or damage144 when the government and the probation officer have been unable to determine the full extent of victim losses within 10 days prior to sentencing they are obligated to inform the court145 the court is then to set date for the final determination of victim losses within 90 days of sentencing146 victims have limited option to present claims for restitution relating to undiscovered losses thereafter147 there has been more than slight difference of opinion among the lower federal appellate courts as to how these provisions should be applied

and deny lower courts the authority to order restitution beyond the statutory limits148 some consider them akin to statutes of limitation and permit the time periods to be tolled149 others see the time limits as device designed for the benefit of victims not defendant s and for them the failure to honor the time limits warrants relief as long as the victim or the government in the interest of the victim has objection and the defendant is given the opportunity to contest150 the courts are likewise divided over the question of whether the court may order restitution to be paid to the crime victims fund on its own initiative if the victim refuses to accept it151 should the court determine that more than one defendant contributed to the victims loss it may apportion restitution accordingly or it may make the defendants jointly and severally liable152 when defendants are made jointly and severally liable each is liable for the entire amount but the victim is entitled to more than what is required to be made whole regardless of what portion each of the defendants ultimately contributes 153 section 3664i declares that when it comes to restitution the united states is to be served last154 the provision is cited most often to confirm that under the appropriate circumstances the government and its departments and agencies may be considered victims for restitution 148

forfeiture laws may operate to deplete any assets from which restitution might otherwise have been paid on the other hand the defendant is not entitled to have the restitution award offset by the value of any forfeited property unless the victim is the governmental entity for whose benefit the property is confiscated156 section 3664j permits court to order restitution to third parties who as insurers or otherwise have assumed some or all of the victims losses although in such cases the victim must be fully compensated first 157 section 3664j also supplies the only explicit offset for the defendants restitution obligations restitution award may be reduced after issuance by any amounts that the victim later receives in the course of related federal or state civil litigation158 the victim the defendant or the government may seek to have restitution order amended to reflect the defendants changed economic circumstances159 the changed economic circumstances envisioned in section 3664k do not include anticipated future changes160 nor later better informed understanding of the defendants financial condition at the time of sentence161 there are several means to enforce restitution order when restitution is condition of probation or supervised release failure to make restitution may provide the grounds for revocation162 moreover restitution order operates as lien on

federal courts have generally taken the view that the death of defendant at any time prior to the determination of his or her final direct appeal abates all underlying proceedings appeals are dismissed as moot convictions are overturned indictments are dismissed and abated convictions cannot be used in related civil litigation against the estate all as if the defendant was never criminally
