federal government is an enormously complex process it entails dozens of subprocesses countless rules and procedures the efforts of tens of thousands of staff persons in the executive and legislative branches millions of work hours each year and the active participation of the president and congressional leaders as well as other members of congress and executive officials the enforcement of budgetary decisions involves complex web of procedures that encompasses both congressional and executive actions these procedures are rooted principally in two statutesthe congressional budget act of 1974 and the budget enforcement act bea the 1974 act established congressional budget process in which budget policies are enforced by congress during the consideration of individual measures the bea is the current embodiment of additional enforcement procedures first established in the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 and renewed with substantial modification in 1990 and 1997 that are used mainly by the executive to enforce budget policies after congressional action for session has ended the presidents budget officially referred to as the budget of the united states government is required by law to be submitted to congress early in the legislative session the presidents budget is only request to congress nevertheless the power to formulate and submit the budget is vital tool in the presidents direction of the executive branch and of national policy the presidents proposals often influence congressional revenue and spending decisions though the extent of the influence varies from year to year and depends more on political and fiscal conditions than on the legal status of the budget the congress ional budget act of 1974 establishes the congressional budget process as the means by which congress coordinates the various budgetrelated actions such as the consideration of appropriations and revenue measures taken by it during the course of the year the process is centered around an annual concurrent resolution on the budget that sets aggregate budget policies and functional spending priorities for at least the next five fiscal years because concurrent resolution is not lawit cannot be signed or vetoed by the presidentthe budget resolutio n does not have statutory effect money can be raised or spent pursuant to it revenue and spending amounts set in the budget resolution establish the basis for the enforcement of congressional budget policies through points of order congress implements budget resolution policies through action on individual revenue and debtlimit measures annual appropriations acts and direct spending legislation in some years congress considers reconciliation legislation pursuant to reconciliation instructions in the budget resolution the federal government has decentralized system of expenditure management the office of management and budget has yearround responsibility in overseeing the expenditure of funds but agencies have primary responsibility to ensure the legality and propriety of expenditurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720contents chapter 1 overview of the federal budget process 1 the evolution

complex process it entails dozens of subprocesses countless rules and procedures the efforts of tens of thousands of staff persons in the executive and legislative branches millions of work hours each year and the active participation of the president and congressional leaders as well as other members of congress and executive officials it could hardly be otherwise because so much is at stake when budget decisions are made since 1962 as exhibit 1a shows federal spendingas measured in outlayshas amounted to between 17 and 24 of the gross domesti c product gdp of the united states federal revenues have hovered between 17 and 20 of gdp during the same period the deficit which has resulted from the imbalance between revenues and spending accounts for the largest single source of borrowing in capital markets although the deficit declined markedly during most of this decade and surpluses are projected for the near term federal outlays and revenues as share of gdp will remain significant the deficit is expected to recur and rise sharply in couple of decades as retirement and health costs for the babyboomer generation escalate the trend of federal revenues and spending relative to gdp is only one of the ways of measuring the impact of the budget trends also can be measured in terms of real spending ie inflationadjusted spending or in terms of the shares of the budget allocated to major national priorities such as defense aid to state and local governments and health care one of the useful ways of measuring trends is to examine how the composition of federal spending has changed over time exhibit 2 b which is discussed later reveals the growth in the share of the budget spent on various entitlement programs this exhibit suggests still another perspective the growth in the numbers of persons receiving various types of federal payments the budget is however much more than matter of numbers it finances federal programs and assists many households in meeting basic expenses it provides safety net for persons facing illness or old age it is the means by which the united states invests in its future through both physical improvements such as highway construction and human improvements such as training and education the budget pays for national defense and signals to allies and adversaries the role of the united states on the world scene it is one of the principal instruments available to the federal governme nt for regulating economic activity and for stabilizing household incomeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs2 exhibit 1a outlays and revenues

taxes duties imposts and excises to borrow money on the credit of the united states article i section 9 money shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law box 1a congresss power of the pursewith so much at stake it should not be surprising that budgeting often is difficult and contentious process allocating over trillionandahalf dollars is anything but routine task for as big as the budget is there is never enough money to satisfy all the claims on it to budget is to fight over money the conflict sprawls between the two parties and between the executive and legislative branches there often is friction among congressional committees and between those who make tax policy and those who control spending the scope of conflict has expanded as the size of the budget has grown and become even more prominent in the economic life of the country the procedures described in this manual are the means devised over the years to channel conflict in ways that enable the numerous participants to work their way toward agreement each year in this sense the rules affect outcomes how much is taxed and spent and who gets what depend in substantial measure on the rules and procedures of federal budgeting in studying the budget process therefore one gains an understanding not only of the roles of participants and the many steps that they must take each year but also of the interaction between budgetary procedures and policy appendix explains how to obtain publications cited in this report the evolution of federal budgeting the power of the purse is legislative power the constitution lists the power to lay and collect taxes and the power to borrow as powers of congress further it provides that funds may be drawn from the treasury only pursuant to appropriations made by law see box 1a the constitution does not state how these legislative powers are to be exercised nor does it expressly provide for the president to have role in the management of the nations finances during the nations early years the house and senate devised procedures for the enactment of spending and revenue legislation as these procedures evolved during the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th century they led to highly fragmented legislative actions in the course of each session congress passed many separate appropriations bills and other measures affecting the financial condition of the federal government neither the constitution nor the procedures adopted by the house and senate provided for budget system that is for coordinated set of actions covering all federal spending and revenues as long as the federal government was small and its spending and revenues were stable such budget system was not considered necessaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs4 congressional budget office cbo created by the 1974 congressional budget act cbo serves as congresss independent nonpartisan agency for budgetary information and analysis general accounting office gao created by the 1921 budget and accounting act gao conducts audits and evaluations of federal programs for congress as well as many other types of budgetary activity office of management and budget omb established by the 1921 budget and accounting act as the bureau of the budget and renamed in 1970 omb coordinates the preparation and implementation of the presidents budgetbox 1b key budgetary agencieslegislative fragmentation was mirrored by fragmentation in the executive branch the president had limited role in overseeing financial operations and most agencies submitted their spending estimates to relevant congressional committees without having their requests reviewed by the president early in this century however the incessant rise in federal spending and the recurrence of deficits spending exceeded revenues in half of the 20 years preceding fy1920 led congress to seek more coordinated means of making financial decisions the key legislation was the budget and accounting act of 1921 which established the executive budget process the 1921 budget and accounting act did not directly alter the procedures by which congress makes revenue and spending decisions the main impact was in the executive branch the president was required to submit his budget recommendations to congress each year and the bureau of the budgetrenamed the office of management and budget omb in 1970was created to assist him in carrying out his budgetary responsibilities see box 1b for an identification of key budgetary agencies congress it was expected would be able to coordinate its revenue and spending decisions if it received comprehensive budget recommendations from the president in line with this expectation the house and senate changed their rules to consolidate the jurisdiction of the appropriations committees over spending the 1921 act also established the general accounting office gao headed by the comptroller general and made it the principal auditing arm of the federal government the 1921 act as amended remains the statutory basis for the presidential budget system after world war ii the belief that the presidential budget sufficed to maintain fiscal control gave way to the view that congress needed its own budget process some members of congress feared that dependence on the executive budget had bolstered the presidents fiscal powers at the expense of congresss others felt that as long as its financial decisions were fragmented congress could not effectively control expenditures some efforts were made in the late 1940s to create congressional budget but it was not until the 1970s that durable process was established the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 established congressional budget process centered around concurrent resolution on the budget scheduled for adoption prior to legislative consideration of revenue or spending bills the congressional budgethttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs5 process initiated in the 1970s did not replace the preexisting revenue and spending processes instead it provided an overall legislative framework within which the many separate measures affecting the budget would be considered the central purpose of the budget process established by the 1974 act is to coordinate the various revenue and spending decisions that are made in separate revenue appropriations and other budgetary measures to assist congress in making budget decisions the 1974 act established the congressional budget office cbo and directed it to provide data on and analyses of the federal budget during the years that the congressional budget process has been in operation its procedures have been adapted by congress to changing circumstances following decade of experience with the 1974 congres sional budget act congress made further changes in the budget process by enacting the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act in 1985 also known as the grammrudmanhollings act the budget enforcement act in 1990 and the line item veto act in 1996 among other laws the 1985 act prescribed declining deficit targets intended to achieve balance in fy1991 the targets were enforced by sequestration process involving automatic acrosstheboard cuts in nonexempt spending programs if the targets were expected to be exceeded the 1990 act replaced the deficit targets with caps on discretionary spending and payasyougo requirement for revenue and direct spending legislation sequestration was retained as the means of enforcing the two new mechanisms finally the 1996 act authorized the president to cancel discretionary spending in appropriation acts as well as new direct spending and limited tax benefits in other legislation subject to expedited legislative procedures by which congress could overturn the cancellations the supreme court struck down the line item veto act in june 1998 as unconstitutional other less extensive changes have been made from time to time the various modifications made by these and other laws are discussed in appropriate sections of the manual box 1c identifies some of the major laws affecting the congressiona l budget process in the last quarter century appendix b summarizes the major milestones in the development of the federal budget process appendi x c provides citations to major budgetary laws the budget cycle federal budgeting is cyclical activity that begins with the formulation of the presidents annual budget and concludes with the audit and review of expenditures the process spreads over multiyear period the main stages are formulation of the presidents budget congressional budget actions implementation of the budget and audit and review while the basic steps continue from year to year particular procedures often vary in accord with the style of the president the economic and political considerations under which the budget is prepared and implemented and other factorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs6 congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 established the congressional budget process including the budget resolution and reconciliation created house and senate budget committees and cbo and set forth impoundment control procedures balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 grammrudmanhollings act established declining deficit targets leading to balance in fy1991 and the sequestration process also modified the congressional budget process extensively balanced budget and emergency deficit control reaffirmation act of 1987 placed the sequester trigger in the hands of the omb director and revised and extended the deficit targets aiming at balance in fy1993 budget enforcement act of 1990 replaced deficit targets with discretionary spending limits and payasyou go paygo process through fy1995 both enforced by sequestration also modified the congressional budget process extensively included the federal credit reform act of 1990 omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 extended the discretionary spending limits and paygo process through fy1998 line item veto act 1996 granted the president special authority from 1997 through 2004 to cancel discretionary spending new direct spending or limited tax benefits in legislation struck down by the supreme court in june 1998 budget enforcement act of 1997 extended the discretio nary spending limits and paygo process through fy2002 and made changes mostly minor or technical in the congressional budget processbox 1c major laws affecting congressional budgeting 19741998 the activities related to single fiscal year usually stretch over period of two andahalf calendar years or longer as the budget is being considered federal agencies must deal with three different fiscal years at the same time implementing the budget for the current fiscal year seeking funds from congress for the next fiscal year and planning for the fiscal year after that formulation of the presidents budget later than early february of each year the president must submit to congress budget for the fiscal year starting on october 1 preparation of the presidents budget begins in the spring of the preceding year about ten months before it is submitted to congress at the time thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs7 budget is being considered federal agencies must deal concurrently with three fiscal years they are implementing the budget for the current fiscal year seeking funds from congress for the fiscal year starting on october 1 the budget year and preparing for the fiscal year after that understandably therefore budgets are formulated with great deal of uncertainty about the conditions to which they will apply before it examines detailed spending and program requests omb reviews the major policy issues for the next budget and updates the longterm forecast of revenues and spending together with the council of economic advisers cea it reviews the economic outlook and presents the president with projection of future economic conditions the president often issues through omb policy directives and planning guidelines to be used by agencies in preparing their budget requests the extent to which these guidelines limit the amounts that agencies may request varies from year to year the summer months and the early fall are an intensive period for preparation of detailed budget requests by federal agencies these requests are reviewed by omb which notifies agencies of the spending levels recommended by it for their programs agencies have brief period during which they may appeal to the president for higher levels than were recommended by omb some recent presidents particularly nixon reagan and bush delegated much of the appeals function to senior white house staff others such as ford carter and clinton had more direct role in resolving budget appeals the appeals often involve policy issues as well as budget levels after the appeals have been decided budget preparation is completed but changes may be made right up to the deadline for printing the budget the budget submitted by the president contains report for the upcoming fiscal year indicating whether the presidents recommendations are consistent with the discretionary spending limits and payasyougo requirement established under the budget enforcement act of 1990 as amended congressional action on the budget congressional budget actions may be classified according to three distinct types of measures involved 1 adoption of budget resolution the steps associated with this action commonly are referred to as the congressional budget process 2 passage of the annual appropri ations bills including regular supplemental and continuing appropriations measures and 3 passage of other legislation affecting the federal budget such as authorizing legislation reconciliation bills and measures changing tax law modifying entitlement programs or adjusting the debt limit the budget resolution is congresss main procedure for linking these different types of measures the budget resol ution the congressional budget process begins early each year after the president submits his annual budget congress is not bound by the presidents recommendations when it develops budget resolution congress may use different policy economic and technical assumptions than those presented in the executive budget when it enacts legislation to carry out the budget plan it may provide more or less funds than the president has requested for particular programs or make different changes in tax laws than the president has recommendedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs8 under the 1974 congressional budget act each house and senate committee is required to issue views and estimates report on the budget matters in its jurisdiction within six weeks after the president submits his budget the budget committees use these reports along with cbo analyses to prepare the budget resolution for the coming fiscal year the budget committees use baseline projections of revenues spending and the surplus or deficit to estimate the impact of proposed policy changes the budget resolution which is supposed to be adopted by april 15 contains total revenue and spending levels for at least five fiscal years these totals generally are binding for the first year and the sum of all five years because it is concurrent resolution which is not presented to the president for his signature or veto the budget resolution does not have statutory effect taxes can be levied or funds spent pursuant to budget resolution the budget resolution consists of three main sections aggregates functional allocations of spending and optionally reconciliation instructions the aggregates include total revenues and the amount by which total revenues should be changed total new budget authority total outlays the surplus or deficit and the debt limit the new budget authority and outlay levels are allocated among 20 functional categories such as national defense international affairs energy or agriculture reconciliation instructions direct designated house and senate committees to report legislation conforming spending revenue or debtlimit levels under existing law to current budget policies these instructions are included when congress seeks to make changes in revenue or direct spending laws the budget resolution does not mention specific programs or accounts but the aggregates functional allocations and reconciliation instructions typically are predicated on assumptions about particular programs these assumptions sometimes are set forth in the reports of the budget committees accompanying the budget resolution but they are not binding on congress when it considers revenue or spending legislation to ensure that the budget resolution serves as guideline for subsequent action on budgetrelated measures congress is supposed to adopt it before turning to the consideration of revenue spending or debtlimit measures for the next fiscal year however congress often fails to adopt the budget resolution by the april 15 deadline specified in the 1974 congressional budget act the rules of the house permit it to consider regular appropriations bills after may 15 even if the budget resolution has not yet been adopted annual appropriations measures the rules of the house and to lesser extent the senate require that agencies and programs be authorized in law before an appropriation is made for them an authorizing act is law that 1 establishes program or agency and the terms and conditions under which it operates and 2 authorizes the enactment of appropriations for that program or agency authorizing legislation may originate in either the house or the senate and may be considered any time during the year many agencies and programs have temporary authorizations that have to be renewed annually or every few yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs9 action on appropriations measures sometimes is delayed by the failure of congress to enact necessary authorizing legislation the house and senate often waive or disregard their rules against unauthorized appropriations for ongoing programs that have not yet been reauthorized the budgetary impact of authorizing legislation depends on whether it contains only discretionary authorizations for which funding is provided in annual appropriations acts or direct spending which itself enables an agency to enter into obligations annual appropriations are provided in 13 regular appropriations bills each one under the jurisdiction of parallel house and senate appropriations subcommittees that recommend spending levels to the full committees these bills come to the house and senate individually as do other measures such as revenue and entitlement legislation affecting overall budget levels when congress fails to enact all of the regular appropriations bills by the start of the fiscal year it provides interim funding in continuing resolutions in some years these measures have provided appropriations for the full fiscal year not just for month or two congress also enacts supplemental appropriations measures to provide additional funding to federal agencies or programs or to finance spending not covered in the regular appropriations bills regular continuing and supplemental appropriations measures as well as other spending legislation are linked to the budget resolution through the section 302 procedures established in those sections of the 1974 congressional budget act after budget resolution has been adopted the spending totals are allocated to the house and senate appropriations committees and to other committees with spending jurisdiction the appropriations committees then subdivide their spending amounts among their 13 subcommittees when an appropriations measure is considered by the house or senate the spending provided in it is compared to the amount subdivided to the pertinent subcommittee in some circumstances consideration of an appropriations measure may be barred by point order on the grounds that budget resolution levels or the section 302 amounts would be breached in most instances however the appropriations bill is consistent with the section 302 subdivision reconciliation bills and other measures affect ing the budget annual appropriations are enacted for only about half of total federal spending the remainder is determined largely by permanent appropriations and other funding devices that do not require annual action by congress in addition the amount of revenue generated each year is determined principally by existing law this means that congress cannot enforce its budget decisions merely by comparing the amounts in new legislation with its budgeted levels the portions of the budget governed by existing law are controlled primarily through the reconciliation procedures mentioned earlier these procedures are triggered by reconciliation instructions in the budget resolution that direct designated committees to change revenue or spending laws by specified amounts in most instances committees subject to reconciliation instructions are given deadline by which they are to report changes in existing laws the recommendations of the instructed committees usually are consolidated into an omnibus reconciliation billhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs10 congressional committees also can report legislation changing revenue or spending laws such as entitlements on their own initiative when they do so the amounts of revenue or spending estimated to result from enactment of the measure are compared to the budget resolution or the section 302 allocations under some circumstances variance from the budgeted levels can lead to point of order barring consideration of the legislation implementation of the budget although they are bound by congressional decisions agencies typically have some spending discretion because appropriations are made in broad categories agencies generally conform to the financial and program plans they submit to congressional committees but they sometimes reprogram funds shift them from one use to another within an account or use other devices to meet unanticipated needs or changing conditions some reprogrammings require approval by the appropriations committees or legislative committees agencies cannot spend appropriations until omb apportions those funds the antideficiency act requires that omb apportion funds to prevent the necessity for deficiency or supplemental appropriations or to achieve the most effective and economical use of funds omb apportions available funds among time periods such as quarters or months or projects then agencies allot their apportioned funds among their administrative units agencies generally are not permitted to spend in excess of their apportionments when the president or another executive official withholds funds provided by congress he uses the procedures set forth in the impoundment control act of 1974 if the president wants to delay obligations or expenditures he proposes deferral but may do so only for the reasons authorized in the antideficiency act he cannot defer funds for policy reasons if the president wants to cancel an appropriation he must propose rescission if congress fails to rescind the funds within 45day waiting period the president must release the funds the comptroller general oversees compliance with the impoundment control act in 1996 congress gave the president special authority for 19972004 to cancel discretionary spending items of new direct spending and limited tax benefits under the line item veto act president clinton exercised this authority in 1997 in the case of two reconciliation acts and nine regular appropriations acts for fy1998 however the supreme court struck down the act in june 1998 the final phase of the budget process is review and audit under the principle of internal control agencies have the primary responsibility for ensuring the propriety and efficiency of their expenditures agencies are required to maintain accounting systems and to audit their expenditures in accordance with standards promulgated by gao two laws passed in recent years the chief financial officers act of 1990 and the government performance and results act of 1993 seek to strengthen financial management and reporting in the federal governmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs11 roles of the participants budgeting cannot be an isolated activity conducted solely by small number of financial experts because the stakes in budgeting radiate to all sectors of public policy the participants come from all parts of the federal governm ent some budgetmakers are program specialists others are fiscal experts some occupy central roles in government some participate from the limited perspective of particular program or organization the division of budgetary labor is essentially political in character there are program advocates and fiscal guardians legislative controllers and executive bargainers presidential agents and agency managers the existence of parallel legislative and executive processes adds significantly to the number and diversity of budget participants the executive branch has its own budget experts so too does congress there are program experts in all executive agencies as well as in most congressional committees congress in exercise of its budgetary independence has developed its own databases so as to avoid undue dependence on executive sources there is much greater budgetary heterogeneity in congress than in the executive branch however as an institution that represents diversity of interests and perspectives congress has diversified its budgetary processes to allow multiplicity of participants when it comes to public money one in congress is fully in charge but just about every member and committee has some role in shaping revenue or spending legislation the principal roles and functions of the participants in the budget process are summarized in the next three boxes and discussed in more detail below executive roles there are three main participants in executive budgeting arrayed in hierarchical order they are the president omb and the executive agencies see box 1d in addition to these various executive units have specialized roles the treasury department maintains governmentwide accounts manages federal cash and debt issues periodic statements on the condition of the budget and has the lead role on the executive side in tax policy the council of economic advisers prepares the annual economic report forecasts economic trends and advises the president along with others on economic policy and the national economic council coordinates policy advice for the white house budget roles cannot be considered independently of the participants as the interests skills and relationships among participants change so too do the roles they play some presidents take an active interest in budget policy but few of them get involved in specific budget decisions the manner in which the president uses omb and its director varies from administration to administration in some years omb has the dominant role in budget policy in other seasons it faces tough competition from other presidential agencies and advisors yet there must be measure of stability to budgetary roles if only because of the urgent need to produce budget each year if some participants were to behavehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs12 presidentoffice of management and budget omb federal agencies establishes executive budget policy and submits budget to congress submits supplemental requests

principal budgetary entities of the executive branch differently each year others might not know what to expect of them or how to adjust their own roles budgeting is process that depends on reciprocal expectations it is expected that agencies will seek more funds for programs in their jurisdiction and that omb will seek to constrain budgetary growth it is expected that the president will try to push his budget through congress and that legislators will try to exercise some independence in budget policy but it is also expected that both sides will compose their differences without going to the brink when one side is more adamant than usual this pattern of expectations can break down leading to protracted conflict as happened in the mid1990shttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs13 authorizing

senate committees see box 1e and congressional support agencies see box 1f in recent years legislative budgetary roles have been less stable than in the past several explanations can be offered for this beginning with the fact already noted that there is considerable diversity in legislative budgetary roles however the congressional budget process other changes in budgetary procedure and political differences between the two branches have been of greater importance the 1974 congressional budget act introduced new participants in the legislative process but it also retained the old ones on paper the roles of the revenue authorizing and appropriating committees were hardly changed but the establishment of the budget committees inevitably altered expectations and behaviorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs14 even before the budget process was established congress was experiencing considerable budgetary turbulence as many authorizing committees moved from permanent to periodic authorizations they became more active in proposing spending levels for specific programs moreover entitlements as well as other forms of direct spending became more prevalent these

has been implemented differently multiyear budgetinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs15 was introduced one year credit budgeting another in some years party leaders have been active in shaping the budget in other years they have remained on the sidelines relationships between congress and the white house have varied from year to year and have contributed to role uncertainty on capitol hill the 1985 balanced budget act and deficit pressures also have influenced legislative roles and behavior the budgetary roles and relationships of the president and congressional participants have been greatly affected by reliance on budget summit negotiations between the executive and legislative branches summit agreement in 1987 established overall budget policy for fy1988 and fy1989 1989 summit agreement set overall policy for fy1990 summit agreement in 1990 established the budget framework for fy19911995 and summit agreement in 1997 set the path for balanced budget by fy2002 the increased reliance on summit negotiations has been due to two factorssplit political control of the executive and legislative branches and the drive to reduce or eliminate the budget deficit in 18 of the 24 years since congress established its own budget process the presidency has been controlled by one party and one or both houses of congress by the other during this period republicans and democrats often have disagreed on budget policy and each party has had sufficient strength to block the others initiatives moreover as concern over deficit spending mounted both parties faced difficult and often controversial decisions on taxing and spending negotiated budgets have been the principal means by which the two parties have bridged their differences and agreed on policies to reduce the deficit the importance of budget summitry was demonstrated by the budget deadlock and government shutdown in 1995 during that year each party proceeded on its own the president submitted budget that was unacceptable to congressional republicans who adopted budget resolution that diverged significantly from president clintons proposals when congress tried to implement its budget strategy in reconciliation legislation president clinton vetoed the bill in the ensuing impasse congress and the president were unable to agree on major appropriations bills leading to the lengthiest shutdown of federal agencies in us history the 1995 stalemate shows that the outcomes of budget summits generally are uncertain because they depend on the willingness of the two branches to enter into negotiations and to set aside major differences in budget policy two of the summit negotiations mentioned above took place in the spring the other two occurred in the fall the first agreement covered two fiscal years the next applied to only single fiscal year and the most recent ones covered five fiscal years if summit negotiations guide budget making in the future one result is likely to be greater uncertainty about the budgetary behavior of participants basic concepts of federal budgeting the federal budget is compilation of numbers about the revenues spending and borrowing and debt of the government revenues come largely from taxes but stem from other sources as well such as duties fines licenses and gifts spending involves such concepts as budget authority obligations outlays and offsetting collections the numbers are computed according to rules and conventions that havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs16 accumulated over the years they do not always conform to the way revenues and spending are accounted for in other processes some of the rules are not recognized in law but they are nonetheless used by the various participants in federal budgeting appendix d provides glossary of terms used in the federal budget process budget authority and outlays when congress appropriates money it provides budget authority that is authority to enter into obligations budget authority also may be provided in legislation that does not go through the appropriations process direct spending legislation the key congressional spending decisions relate to the obligations that agencies are authorized to incur during fiscal year not to the outlays made during the year obligations occur when agencies enter into contracts submit purchase orders employ personnel and so forth outlays occur when obligations are liquidated primarily through the issuance of checks electronic fund transfers or the disbursement of cash budget authority that first becomes available for fiscal year is counted as new budget authority in programs that have permanent appropriations new budget authority becomes available each year without congressional action under law the income of the social security trust funds and certain other trust funds is automatically available for obligation hence the annual receipts of these funds are counted as new budget authority the provision of budget authority is the key point at which congress exercises control over federal spending although the outlay level often receives greater public attention because of its bearing on the deficit congress does not directly control outlays each years outlays derive in part from new budget authority and in part from carryover budget authority provided in prior years for example president clintons budget for fy1999 estimated that outlays would total 1733 billion as shown in exhibit 1b taken from the presidents fy1999 budget approximately 1365 billion of this amount was estimated to come from new budget authority for the fiscal year while the remainder 368 billion was estimated to come from budget authority enacted in prior years budget authority and outlays can be thought of as akin to deposits and withdrawals in bank account when congress provides budget authority whether by appropriating funds or otherwise enacting legislation that enables an agency to incur obligations its actions have the effect of making deposit into an agency account that is the budget authority augments the financial resources available to the agency when bills are paid and outlays occur resources are withdrawn from the agencys account the relation of budget authority to outlays varies from program to program and depends on spendout rates the rates at which funds provided by congress are obligated and payments disbursed in program with high spendout rate most new budget authority is expended during the fiscal year if the spendout rate is low however most of the outlays occur in later yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs17 exhibit 1b relation of budget authority to outlays dollars in billions 1 this exhibit shows the relati onship of budget authority to outlays in the fy1999 budget it shows that not all budget authority becomes outlays in the year for which it is provided and b portion of each years outlays derives from budget authority provided in prior years the flow of outlays from budget authority is measured by the spendout rate sometimes called the outlay rate 2 total new budget authority typically exceeds total outlays for fiscal year because in programs with long lead times such as construction it may take years for the resources provided by congress to be spent 3 the outlays set forth in the budget are only estimates of the amount to be spent actual outlays for fiscal year may vary significantly from the estimate however congressional budget procedures such as section 302 allocations control annual appropriations acts and other legislation in terms of the volume of outlays in fiscal year 4 unspent budget authority carried over into future years consists of both obligated and unobligated balances most of the obligated balances are for contracts entered into in prior years most of the unobligated balances are in trust funds source office of management and budget budget of the united states government fiscal year 1999 analytical perspectives february 1998 chart 201 page 352httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs18 regardless of the spendout rate the outlays in the budget are merely estimates of the amounts that will be disbursed during the year if payments turn out to be higher than the budget estimate outlays will be above the budgeted level the president and congress control outlays indirectly by deciding on the amount of budget authority to be provided or by limiting the amount of obligations to be incurred budget reforms enacted since 1985 have increased the prominence of outlay estimates and controls in federal budgeting under these procedures outlay estimates are essential in enforcing the discretionary spending limits and the payasyougo requirement this process is outlined in the next chapter certain receipts of the federal government are accounted for as offsets against outlays rather than as revenues various fees collected by government agencies are deducted from outlays similarly income from the sale of certain assets are treated as offsetting receipts most such receipts are offset against the outlays of the agencies that collect the money but in the case of offshore oil leases and certain other activities the revenues are deducted from the total outlays of the government scope of the budget the budget consists of two main groups of funds federal funds and trust funds federal fundswhich comprise mainly the general fundlargely derive from the general exercise of the taxing power and general borrowing and for the most part are not earmarked by law to any specific program or agency one component of federal funds called special funds are earmarked as to source and purpose the use of federal funds is determined largely by appropriations acts trust funds are established under the terms of statutes that designate them as trust funds to account for funds earmarked by specific sources and purposes the social security funds are the largest of the trust funds revenues are collected under social security payroll tax and are used to pay for social security benefits and related purposes the unified budget includes both the federal funds and the trust funds the balances in the trust funds are borrowed by the federal government they are counted therefore in the federal debt because these balances offset budget deficit but are included in the federal debt the annual increase in the debt invariably exceeds the amount of the budget deficit for the same reason it is possible that the federal debt will rise even when the federal government has budget surplus capital and operating expenses are not segregated in the budget hence monies used for the operations of government agencies as well as for the acquisition of longlife assets such as buildings roads and weapons systems are reported as budget outlays proposals have been made from time to time to divide the budget into capital and operating accounts while these proposals have not been adopted the budget contains various tables showing the investment and operating outlays of the government the budget totals do not include all the financial transactions of the federal government the main exclusions fall into two categoriesoffbudget entities and governmentsponsored enterprises in addition the budget includes direct andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs19 guaranteed loans on the basis of the accounting rules established by the federal credit reform act of 1990 which are discussed more fully in the next chapter offbudget entities are excluded by law from the budget totals the receipts and disbursements of the social security trust funds the oldage and survivors insurance fund and the disability insurance fund as well as spending for the postal service fund are excluded from the budget totals these transactions are shown separately in the budget thus the budget now reports two deficit or surplus amountsone excluding the social security trust funds and the postal service fund and the other on total or consolidated basis including these entities the latter is the main focus of discussion in both the presidents budget and the congressional budget process the official policy adopted by the president and congress to achieve balanced budget early in the near term uses consolidated basis which includes social security the transactions of governmentowned corporations excluding the postal service as well as revolving funds are included in the budget on net basis that is the amount shown in the budget is the difference between receipts and outlays not the total activity of the enterprise or revolving fund if for example revolving fund has annual income of 150 million and disbursements of 200 million the budget would report 50 million as net outlays governmentsponsored enterprises gses are excluded from the budget because they are deemed to be private rather than public entities the federal government does not own any equity in these enterprises most of which receive their financing from private sources although they were established by the federal government their budgets are not reviewed by the president or congress in the same manner as other programs most of these enterprises engage in credit activities they borrow funds in capital markets and lend money to homeowners farmers and others in total these enterprises have assets and liabilities in excess of one trillion dollars at this writing the governmentsponsored enterprises are the student loan marketing association sallie mae the college construction loan insurance association connie lee the federal national mortgage association fannie mae the federal home loan mortgage corporation the banks for cooperatives the farm credit banks the federal agricultural mortgage corporation the federal home loan banks the financing corporation and the resolution funding corporation financial statements of the governmentsponsored enterprises are published in the presidents budget functional categories of the budget budget authority and outlays are classified into 20 functional categories that represent the major objectives and operations of the federal government each of the functions is divided into number of subfunctions see box 4b for list of budget functionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs20 although the functional classification has diminished in importance in recent years it is used for number of purposes in the federal budget process first the functional classification brings together in single category the various programs and activities serving common objective regardless of the agency responsible for them for example the national defense function includes most of the programs and expenditures of the defense department as well as defenserelated activities of the energy department and other federal agencies second the functional classification shows the various types of resources spent on the same objective thus the budget presents the budget authority outlays tax expenditures and credit authority associated with each function third the functional classification may be used to explain the presidents budget policies and is used to present budgetary data finally the functional classification is used in establishing congressional budget priorities each budget resolution contains functional allocation of new budget authority and outlays for at least the next five fiscal years the budget and the economy key purpose of the federal budget is to allocate public funds among government agencies and programs viewed from this perspective the budget is an internal management tool of government much of the budget process entails relationships among federal agencies and between the agencies and congress the budget however serves another role which transcends the internal operations of the government it is prime means of influencing the condition of the economy the size of the budget and especially the deficit the shape of tax policy and the pattern of federal spending help determine the rate of economic growth employment trends interest rates and price changes when they make budget decisions therefore the president and congress are guided in part by concern about the impact of their policies on economic performance the relation of the budget and the economy is bilateral not only does the budget influence the economy but the reverse also is true the condition of the economy shapes budget outcomes when the president and congress formulate their budgets for the next fiscal year or beyond they must make assumptions about future economic conditions they typically make assumptions about real and nominal growth the gross domestic product short and longterm interest rates and inflation and unemployment rates differences in the assumptions used by the two branches of government often account for sizeable differences in their planned budget levels because the budget is predicated on assumptions about future economic conditions the extent to which the presidents or congresss budget policies materialize depends in substantial measure on whether the assumptions prove to be accurate any major discrepancy between assumed and actual economic conditions will translate into variances between expected and actual budget results httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs21 exhibit 1c reveals that the budget is highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions deviations of the economy from the assumed path will lead to higher or lower revenues outlays and deficits revenues are particularly sensitive to the rate of economic growth outlays are particularly sensitive to the interest rate paid on government debt moreover as the exhibit indicates the impact of these economic conditions on the budget compounds with each passing year according to the information presented in exhibit 1c one tenth of one percentage point lower economic growth would subtract an estimated 1 billion from federal revenues in the first year and 9 billion in the fifth year one percentage point rise in inflation would add 6 billion to outlays in the first year and 62 billion in the fifth year the relation of the budget and the economy is matter of considerable dispute controversy rages over the appropriate size of the surplus or deficit the assumptions to be used in making budget projections and the extent to which federal government policy should affect the supply of or the demand for goods and serviceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs22 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 real rate of growth is 01

are sensitive to changes in economic conditions particularly the rate of real growth unemployment and inflation levels and interest rates this exhibit displays the estimated effects on the budget of changes in economic assumptions for two of these factorsreal growth and inflation real growth refers to the change in the gross domestic product after adjustment for price changes 2 inflation increases both revenues and outlays in roughly equal degrees which lessens its net effect on the surplus or deficit 3 under these projections rise in inflation has much greater impact on interest payments and mandatory spending during the first five years than it does on discretionary spending because the latter is assumed to be capped by statutory limits in effect through fy2002 the effect on interest payments occurs more quickly but levels off after few years the effect on mandatory spending builds more slowly but continues to increase year after year after fy2002 when the caps on discretionary spending are assumed to expire such spending begins to rise steadily source congressional budget office the economic and budget outlook fiscal years 19992008 january 1998 table c1 page

actions these procedures are rooted principally in two statutesthe congressional budget act of 1974 and the budget enforcement act bea the 1974 act established congressional budget process as discussed in chapter 4 in which budget policies are enforced by congress during the consideration of individual measures the bea is the current embodiment of additional enforcement procedures first established in the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 and renewed with modification in 1990 and 1997 that are used mainly by the executive to enforce budget policies after congressional action for session has ended these twin sets of enforcement procedures are separate and distinct but they have common elements and are linked in various ways one important common element is the emphasis placed on reducing the deficit in past years and currently on maintaining surplus another is the distinction drawn between the treatment of discretionary spending on the one hand and direct spending and revenues on the other congress enforces budget decisions in two ways one is by guarding against actions that would cause budget outcomes to deviate from desired course the other is by ensuring that the house and senate and their committees abide by the budget decisions taken in the congressional budget resolution this chapter deals with enforcing budget outcomes chapter 4 deals with enforcing congressional budget decisions in addition this chapter addresses two other elements of the framework for budget enforcementbudget baselines and the new rules for the treatment of federal credit activities deficit reduction and the rules of congressional budgeting between the early 1980s and the late 1990s annual consideration of the budget was dominated by concern about the budget deficit the reason for this concern is evident from exhibit 2a which displays the budget deficit at 4year intervals since fy1982 in the mid1980s the deficit exceeded 200 billion and amounted to almost six percent of gdp high deficits persisted in the early 1990s the size of the deficit depends on how it is measured the total or consolidated deficit combines all onbudget federal funds and trust funds with the offbudget entities the social security trust funds and the postal service fund the total deficit generally is regarded as the most comprehensive measure of the impact of the budget on the economyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs24 exhibit 2a alternative measurements of the deficitsurplus 1 this table taken from president clinton s initial budget submission for fy1999 in february 1998 displays three alternative measures of the deficit or surplus on total or consolidated basis b on an onbudget basis which excludes the social security trust funds and the postal service fund and c on federalfunds basis which excludes all trust funds depending on the basis for the measurement the estimate for fy2002 ranged from deficit of 111 billion to surplus of 90 billion 2 the total deficit incorporates both onbudget and offbudget transactions but it does not include the finances of governmentsponsored enterprises 3 the social security trust funds ran an 8 billion deficit in fy1982 but since then they have run steadily increasing surplus amounting to about 100 billion by the end of the 1990s with the social security trust funds excluded the reported deficit after fy1982 is much higher because the annual surplus in these funds does not offset the deficit in the rest of the budget 4 the federal funds defic it excludes all trust funds whether they are on budget or offbudget sour ce chart prepared by the congressional research service based on data in office of management and budget budget of the united states government fiscal year 1999 historical tables february 1998 table 11 pages 1920 and table 14 pages 2526httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs25 narrower measure of the deficitthe onbudget deficitis derived by excluding the social security trust funds and the postal service fund from the totals as noted this exclusion is mandated by law although social security and the postal service fund are counted in the budget in reports on the deficit in 1983 congress enacted legislation revising the financing of the social security trust funds in order to bring about increasing annual surpluses for the next several decades as exhibit 2a discusses the social security trust funds ran small deficit in fy1982 thereafter the trust funds have run steadily increasing surpluses amounting to about 100 billion by the end of the 1990s therefore excluding social security from computations of the deficit or surplus results in higher deficit or lower surplus figures the accumulated balance credited to these funds is much higher than the annual surplus it now amounts to hundreds of billions of dollars and is projected to amount to trillions of dollars in the early decades of the next century still narrower measure of the deficitthe federal funds deficitwould exclude all trust funds from deficit computations as is the case with social security the other trust funds in the net incur an annual surplus exhibit 2a shows that the federal funds deficit exceeded 300 billion in the early 1990s regardless of the measure used it is evident that the deficit was unusually high for an extended period of time this chronic deficit prompted congress to enact the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 the original 1985 balanced budget act established deficit targets for each year through fy1991 when the budget was to be balanced and sequestration process under which budgetary resources would be canceled automatically if the estimated deficit exceeded the amount allowed under the act even with the targets the actual deficit for the covered years was above the targeted level the 1985 act as originally framed did not require that the actual deficit be within the target it required only that the deficit projected at the start of the fiscal year be within that amount thus any increase in the deficit during the fiscal year whether because of changes in economic conditions policy changes or other factors did not activate the sequestration process for that fiscal year failure to achieve the deficit targets and other problems led congress to revise the process in the budget enforcement act bea of 1990 sequestration procedures were retained but the fixed deficit targets were replaced by adjustable ones which expired at the end of fy1995 adjustable limits were imposed on discretionary spending and payasyougo paygo process was established for revenues and direct spending the discretionary spending limits and paygo process were extended in 1993 through fy1998 and again in 1997 through fy2002 different categories of discretionary spending are used for different periods under the 1997 changes discretionary spending limits apply separately to defense and nondefense spending for fy19981999 and to violent crime reduction spending for fy19982000 for the remaining fiscal years all discretionary spending is merged into single category in 1998 as part of the transportation equity act for the 21st century congress added separate categories for highway and mass transit spendinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs26 the paygo process requires that legislation enacted during session affecting revenues or direct spending not increase the deficit or reduce the surplus legislation reducing revenues or increasing direct spending must be fully offset in the same or other legislation by revenue increases or reductions in direct spending violations of the discretionary spending limits or the paygo requirement are enforced by sequestration sequestration has not been used in recent years budgeting for discretionary and direct spending the distinctio n drawn by the bea between discretionary spending which is controlled through the annual appropriations process and direct spending which is provided outside of the annual appropriations process recognizes that the federal government has somewhat different though overlapping means of dealing with these two types of spending one set of procedures pertains to discretionary spending another to direct spending most of the direct spending subject to the paygo process under the bea involves entitlement programs the rest consists of other forms of mandatory spending provided through authorizing legislation and interest payments in fact entitlements now account for about half of total federal spending all direct spending including net interest accounts for about twothirds of the total their recent growth is shown in exhibit 2b which also shows the rise in the number of recipients of these payments the impressive feature of this trend is that most of the growth in spending and in the number of recipients has been built into existing law for the most part it has not been the result of new legislation indeed the increase has occurred despite number of legislative enactments to curtail entitlement programs the procedures for discretionary and direct spending converge at two critical points in federal budgeting formulation of the presidents budget and formulation of the congressional budget resolution both of these policy statements encompass discretionary and direct spending but as box 2a indicates the procedures used in budgeting for these types of expenditure differ greatly the distinctions drawn in this box have some notable exceptions some procedures associated with direct spending are applied to particular types of discretionary programs and vice versa nevertheless the generalizations presented here help to explain the complications of the budget process and explain how decisions are made the paragraphs below correspond to the entries in box 2a 1 budgeta ry impact of authorizing legislation an authorization for discretionary spending program is only license to enact an appropriation the amount of budgetary resources available for spending is determined in annual appropriations acts for direct spending programs principally entitlements on the other hand the authorizing legislation either provides or effectively mandates the appropriation of budget authority in those entitlement programs that are subject to annual appropriation the appropriations committees have little or discretion as to the amounts they providehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs27 in billions of dollars 1970 1980 1990 1996 outlays for mandatory spending and net interest and as percent of total outlays755 393149 537529

selected major entitlement programs 2 mandatory and net interest spending grew almost 15fold between fy1970 and fy1996 claiming an increasingly greater share of the budget as percentage of total federal outlays mandatory and net interest spending increased from 39 in fy1970 to 66 in fy1996 3 most mandatory or direct spending is for entitlements which primarily involve retirement and disability programs such as social security and health programs such as medicare and medicaid 4 because most entitlement spending stems from permanent law spending automatically increases over time as

exceptions made annually for the current or next fiscal year direct spending programs typically are established in permanent law that continues in effect until such time as it is revised or terminated by another law the fact that many entitlements have annual appropriations does not diminish the permanence of the laws governing the amounts spent it should be noted however that some direct spending programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs29 such as medicare have been subject to frequent legislative changes the purpose of such legislation has been to modify existing law not to provide annual funding 4 means of enforcing the budget resolution the procedures used by congress to enforce the policies set forth in the annual budget resolution differ somewhat for discretionary and direct spending programs for both types of spending congress relies on allocations made under section 302 of the 1974 congressional budget act to ensure that spending legislation reported by house and senate committees conforms to established budget policies but although this procedure is effective in controlling new legislationboth annual appropriations measures and new entitlement legislationit is not an effective control on the spending that results from existing laws hence congress relies on reconciliation procedures to enforce budget policies with respect to existing spending and revenue laws reconciliation is not currently applied to discretionary programs funded in annual appropriations measures 5 budget enforcement act controls discretionary programs are subject to the spending limits set in the bea direct spending is not capped but operates under the paygo process which requires that direct spending and revenue legislation enacted for fiscal year not cause the deficit to rise or the surplus to decrease the lack of caps is due to the fact that most direct spending programs are openended with spending determined by eligibility rules and payment formulas in existing law rather than by new legislation 6 basis of computing budget impact the baseline projections discussed earlier are applied to both discretionary and direct spending programs but they are much more prominently used in scoring changes for the latter in recommending funds for discretionary programs the appropriations committees rely almost exclusively on two other benchmarks the appropriation for the current fiscal year and the amount requested by the president for the upcoming fiscal year these committees regularly compare the amount recommended by them to each of these benchmarks but make mention in their reports of baseline budget projections in the case of direct spending programs however the reconciliation instructions the budgetary impact of legislative changes made in reconciliation bills and other claimed savings or increases are computed in terms of the baseline projections 7 typical decision facing congress because discretionary spending is determined in annual appropriations acts the typical decision facing congress for such spending is the amount by which it should be changed from the current years level direct spending is determined by permanent law and often is affected by exogenous factors such as price changes so that decisions typically deal with the amount of increases or decreases from baseline levels in direct spending programs increases often are built into law in discretionary spending programs they are not 8 impact of economic changes when economic conditionssuch as the inflation or unemployment ratechange there often is an automatic reciprocal change in direct spending price rise triggers costofliving adjustments colas in various payment programs as does rise in the number of persons filing unemployment claims or participating in the food stamps program discretionaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs30 spending by contrast is largely insulated from such changes when prices rise for example congress can opt to appropriate more discretionary funds or it can compel the affected agency to absorb the increased costs the chain of discretionary spending control the many pieces and procedures of the federal budget process have been introduced in this and the preceding chapter at this point it would be useful to put some of the pieces together to see how they create chain of spending controls as part of an integrated budget process see box 2b the controls traced in the exhibit pertain most fully to discretionary spending somewhat different set of controls would apply to other parts of the budget such as direct spending and revenues though there are some common features the discussion that follows is keyed to the accompanying exhibit before explaining the individual controls two points should be noted first each control other than the first one is based on may not be exceeded rules that is the amount available under one step may not normally exceed the amount provided in the previous step these rules establish chain relationship among the various parts of the process but the may not be exceeded rules do not always mean that the controls produce the desired results for one thing there can be various adjustments or exceptions as will be explained below for another enforcement of the may not be exceeded rules often depends on estimates and assumptions which may prove to be erroneous as events unfold third enforcement of those rules pertaining to congress sometimes may be set aside despite these caveats the sequence of controls generally are quite effective in keeping discretionary spending within established limits the second point to be noted is that the chain of controls engages the participation of virtually all executive and legislative participants in federal budgeting note however that the chain does not begin with the presidents budget because as discussed earlier it is only set of recommendat ions congress does not have to accept these recommendations in its own budget actions note also that the chain does not include authorizing legislation because these measures do not always determine the amount that may be appropriated 1 discretionary spending limits the limits set dollar caps on budget authority and outlays subject to adjustment by omb for certain purposes prescribed by law on broad categories of discretionary spending through fy2002 the presidents budget recommendations and the congressional budget resolution adhere to these limits at times however the president and cbo do not agree on how these limits are to be applied and cbo sometimes finds that the president has recommended spending in excess of the discretionary spending caps 2 budget resolution aggregates the aggregates in the budget resolution may be lower than or the same amount as the discretionary

and the paygo process establishment of the sequestration process the 1985 balanced budget act established series of declining annual deficit targets and created an automatic spendingreduction process known as sequestration intended to ensure that the deficit targets were adhered to even if congress and the president failed to reduce the deficit sufficiently through legislative action the budget enforcement act bea of 1990 made major changes in conjunction with the enactment of fiveyear deficitreduction accord covering fy19911995 in 1993 the bea procedures were extended through fy1998 as part of another comprehensive budget agreement between the president and congress most recently the procedures were extended through fy2002 with modifications by the budget enforcement act bea of 1997 as part of plan to balance the budget by that fiscal yearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs33 sequestration involves the issuance of presidential order that permane ntly cancels budgetary resources except for revolving funds special funds trust funds and certain offsetting collections as originally framed the purpose of sequestration was to achieve required amount of outlay savings to reduce the estimated deficit to target levels once sequestration is triggered by an executive determination spending reductions are made automatically this process therefore is regarded by many as providing strong incentive for congres s and the president to reach agreement on legislation that would avoid sequester changes made by the budget enforcement acts of 1990 and 1997 from its inception in 1985 until its revision by the bea in 1990 the process was tied solely to the enforcement of fixed deficit targets the bea changed the sequestration process substantially first it effectively eliminated the deficit targets as factor in budget enforcement second the bea established adjustable limits on discretionary spending funded in the annual appropriations process third the bea created payasyougo paygo procedures to require that increases in direct spending ie spending controlled outside of the annual appropriations process or decreases in revenues due to legislative action are offset so that there is net increase in the deficit or reduction of the surplus the bea established new sequestration procedures to enforce the discretionary spending limits and the payasyougo requirements to the extent that any sequesters must be made they occur on the same day which must be within 15 calendar days after congress adjourns to end session sequestration of this type is referred to as endofsession sequestration further one or more additional sequesters may occur subsequently in the fiscal year to eliminate any breach in the discretionary spending limits this type of sequestration is referred to as withinsession sequestration previously the surpluses of the social security trust funds were included in the deficit estimates made under the 1985 balanced budget act but social security spending except for administrative expenses was exempt from sequestration under the bea social security spending still is exempt from sequestration but the trust fund surpluses are excluded

accommodate estimating differences between omb and cbo and the enactment of legislation providing emergency funding and funding for the international monetary fund international arrearages an earned income tax credit compliance initiative and other specially designated purposes enforcement of the spending limits is accomplished through special sequestration process that is triggered automatically at the end of congressional session if the applicable spending limit is breached through the enactment of legislation if the enactment of legislation causing breach in the spending limits for the current year occurs during the last quarter of the fiscal year ie between july 1 and september 30 the appropriate discretionary spending limits for the next fiscal year are reduced by the amount of the breach under the paygo process created by the bea legislation increasing direct spending or decreasing revenues must be offset so that the deficit is not increased or the surplus reduced see exhibit 2d the paygo process does not require any offsetting action when the spending increase or revenue decrease is due to the operation of existing law such as an increase in the number of persons participating in the medicare program direct spending consists largely of spending for entitlement programs most direct spending and revenue programs are established under permanent law so there is not necessarily any need for recurring legislative action on them and the paygo process does not require such action enforcement of the paygo process also is accomplished through special sequestration procedure the paygo process does not preclude congress from enacting legislation to increase direct spending it only requires that the increase be offset by reductions in other direct spending programs which could include increases in offsetting receipts by increases in revenues or by combination of the two in order to avoid sequester if sequester under this process is required it would have to offset the amount of any net deficit increase or surplus reduction for the fiscal year caused by the enactment of legislation in the current and prior sessions of congress and would be applied to nonexempt direct spending programs spending for social security benefits and current federal deposit insurance commitments as well as emergency direct spending and revenue legislation so designated by both the president and by congress is exempted completely from the paygo sequestration process all remaining direct spending programs are covered by the paygo process to the extent that legislation affecting their spending levels is counted in determining whether net increase or decrease in the deficit has occurred for fiscal year if paygo sequester occurs however many direct spending programs would be exempt from reduction in 1997 coverage of the paygo requirement was extended to legislation enacted through fy2002 however the paygo process remains in effect through fy2006 to deal with the

sequestration order by the president upon the submission of report by the comptroller general identifying deficit excess this feature of the act was invalidated by supreme court ruling bowsher v synar in 1986 on the ground that the constitutional separationofpowers doctrine was violated because the comptroller general is legislative branch official congress subsequently revised the process in the balanced budget and emergency deficit control reaffirmation act of 1987 by placing the triggering function in the hands of the omb director an executive branch official the timing of sequestration actions the multiple sequestration procedures established by the bea in 1990 remain automatic and are triggered by report from the omb director for sequestration purposes generally there is only one triggering report issued each year just after the end of the session additionally omb reports triggering sequester for discretionary spending may be issued during the following session if legislative developments so warrant ie the enactment of supplemental appropriations the cbo director must provide advisory sequestration reports shortly before the omb directors reports are due the timetable for the sequestration process is set forth in box 2c early in the session omb and cbo issue sequestration preview reports the reports provide estimates of the discretionary spending limits with the

sequestration order for fiscal year may be modified or the implementation of the order affected baseline budget projections most appropriations are for definite amount and the budget authority is provided for single fiscal year the main task is to estimate the outlays that will derive in the next year and beyond from the budget authority provided in the appropriations bill cbo and the appropriations committees base these estimates on outlay or spendout ratesthe percentage of budget authority that is spent in each year these outlay rates vary by account and are based on historical records for example if 1 billion is appropriated to an account which has spendout rate of 80 in the first fiscal year that funds become available the outlay estimate for that fiscal year will be 800 million the remaining 200 million will become outlays in subsequent years scoring is much more complex in enforcing the statutory paygo requirement for one thing unlike appropriations revenue and direct spending legislation usually is openended it does not specify the amount by which revenue or spending will behttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs41 changed for another the impact of this type of legislation continues in future years in enforcing the paygo requirement congress must estimate the revenue gain or loss for each of the next five years and 10 years under the special senate rule and it cannot do so simply by referring to the text of the legislation being scored it must also take into account the behavior of taxpayers economic conditions and other factors that affect revenue collection congress scores revenue and direct spending legislation by reference to baseline projections issued by cbo sometimes in cooperation with omb cbo works closely with the joint committee on taxation in preparing its baseline revenue projection s see box 5b the baseline is an extrapolation of future budget conditions typically for each of the next five years based on the assumption that current policies will continue in effect the baseline projections incorporate assumptions about future inflation and workload changes mandated by law these projections are made for the budget aggregates as well as for individual programs and accounts when congress considers revenue or direct spending legislation cbo estimates the amount of revenues or outlays that would ensue if the measure were enacted it then compares this amount with the baseline projection to score the legislation thus the score measures budgetary impact as the difference between the amount projected under current policies and the amount estimated if the legislation were enacted score is reported for each of the years and often for the sum of the years as well exhibit 2e provides hypothetical example of using baseline projections to score legislation in this hypothetical case legislation would be scored as reducing spending against the baseline by 308 million the first year and 5353 million over the five years covered by the baseline the bea makes omb the official scorer of congressional budget actions the omb score is authoritative in determining whether offsets or sequester are required under the paygo rules however congress usually relies on the cbo score while it is considering legislation the omb and cbo scores on legislation sometimes differ in addition to enforcing paygo baseline projections and scoring are used in computing the amount of deficit reduction agreed to in budget summit negotiations between the president and congress and enacted in reconciliation acts budgeting for direct and guaranteed loans the federal credit reform act of 1990 made fundamental changes in the budgetary treatment of direct loans and guaranteed loans the reform which first became effective for fy1992 shifted the accounting basis for federally provided or guaranteed credit from the amount of cash flowing into or out of the treasury to the estimated subsidy cost of the loans credit reform entails complex procedures for estimating these subsidy costs and new accounting mechanisms for recording various loan transactions the changes have had only modest impact on budget totals but

projections and policy changes 1 this hypothetical example shows baseline projections of budget authority for fy19992003 based on an assumed level of budget authority for the current year fy1998 of 100 billion 2 the baseline includes adjustments for projected inflation in this case inflation increases of 4 for each year covered by the baseline and mandatory workload increases of 3 such as increases in the number of social security recipients these adjustments typically lead to projections of rising spending in each subsequent year 3 policy changes represent changes from established policy often involving changes in law and cause spending to vary from baseline levels for example such changes might include setting inflation adjustments below projected levels in this case 2 cap or modifying eligibility rules so as to reduce workload increases in this case limiting them to 2 4 note that spending reductions tend to grow in the outyears in this instance the assumed policy changes save an estimated 308 million from the projected baseline in the first year and 1915 million in the fifth year in this hypothetical example the cumulative savings over five years 5353 million are more than half of the projected spending level for fy1998 100 million source table prepared by the congressional research servicehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs43 the pre1992 method of budgeting for loans prior to the federal credit reform act the budget accounted for both direct loans and loan guarantees on cash basis direct loans were recorded as outlays when funds were disbursed these outlays were netted against repayments of principal and interest on old loans so that net outlays were the difference between disbursements of new loans and repayments of old ones however the congressional budget resolution budgeted for both direct and guaranteed loans on gross basis that is total direct loan obligations and total guaranteed loan commitments the inclusion of loan volumes in the budget resolution has not been altered by credit reform loan guarantees were budgeted as outlays only when payment was made pursuant to default or to some other contingency requiring federal disburse ment outlays were recorded when the commitment was made to issue the guarantee this system had number of perceived shortcomings first it overstated the cost of direct loans and understated the cost of loan guarantees thereby encouraging the federal government to favor the latter type of loan regardless of its true cost second because direct loans were recorded as outlays when the funds were disbursed budget entry was made when as often happened the loans were defaulted forgiven converted into grants or forgotten the budget had inadequate means of recognizing these costs third neither congress nor executive agencies had effective control of guaranteed loans they did not have to set aside resources for loan guarantees even when defaults were probable when defaults occurred the ensuing outlays were uncontrollable fourth the treatment of direct and guaranteed loans made it impossible to compare the cost of these types of transactions to one another or to other budgetary actions such as grants the federal credit reform act of 1990 in response to these perceived shortcomings the federal credit reform act established system of budgeting for the subsidized cost of loans the credit reforms put direct and guaranteed loans on an equal footing provide means of recognizing change in the status of loans in the budget control guaranteed loans at the time the commitment is made and provide basis for comparing direct and guaranteed loans with other uses of budgetary resources the 1990 act also established procedures for handling the unsubsidized portion of loans as well as loans made prior to fy1992 the new system requires that budget authority and outlays be budgeted for the estimated subsidy cost of direct and guaranteed loans this cost is defined in the 1990 act as the estimated longterm cost to the government of direct loan or loan guarantee calculated on net present value basis excluding administrative costs under the new system congress appropriates budget authority or provides indefinite authority equal to the subsidy cost this budget authority is placed in program account from which funds are disbursed to financing account the various accounts maintained in credit budgeting are explained later in this section exhibit 2f shows the relation between subsidy rates budget authority and loan levels for certain direct loans using 1999

fiscal year 1999 analytical perspectives february 1998 table 83 page 188httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs45 estimating the subsidy cost estimating the subsidy cost is complex process that must be done for each credit program the process is designed to separate the subsidized portion of the loan from the unsubsidized portion budget authority and outlays are provided only for the subsidized portion which is the subsidy cost this cost typically is less than the face value of direct loan because all or part of most loans is repaid it is also less than the amount guaranteed because only some such loans default the unsubsidized portion of direct loans must be financed but it is not included in the subsidy cost hence budget authority is appropriated for it the subsidized portion of direct loan is the amount discounted to present value that is not repaid for guaranteed loans it is the portion also discounted to present value on which the federal government is estimated to incur payment in the future in discounting to present value factor equal to the interest rate paid by the treasury department is applied to all estimated cash flows associated with the loan when discounted payment made by the federal government in the first year of the loan has higher value and therefore higher subsidy cost than an equivalent payment made in later year furthermore present value is computed on net basis so that estimated inflows are discounted to present value and then subtracted from discounted outflows direct loans before direct loan may be obligated congress must provide budget authority in an annual appropriations act or other measure to cover the subsidy cost the amount of budget authority required for given volume of loans depends on the subsidy rate that is subsidy outlays as percentage of loan disbursements for example if the subsidy rate is 25 percent budget authority of 10 million would support 40 million of loan obligations exhibit 2g shows how the subsidy rate is derived from estimated cash flows the subsidy rate is calculated for each direct loan program many characteris tics some related to the terms of the loans others to the status of the borrowers go into calculation of the subsidy rate these include the interest and fees charged borrowers assumed defaults and recoveries on defaults and the maturity of the loan guaranteed loans the procedures used for estimating subsidy costs of guaranteed loans are similar to those used for direct loans but some of the factors differ the subsidy cost of guaranteed loans is the difference between the present value of the federal governments cash disbursements for defaults and other payments and the present value of the estimated cash inflows from fees recoveries and other collections in other words the subsidy cost is the portion of estimated payments by the federal government that is not expected to be offset by collections in present value terms as with direct loans congress must provide sufficient budget authority to permit the federal government to make loan guarantee commitmentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs46 credit subsidy calculation for hypothetical direct loan obligated in fy 1999 by fiscal

five percent well below the treasurys cost of money c the principal is paid in full at the end of five years default and d for simplicity all cash flows take place at the end of the year 2 an appropriation of subsidy costs is made for the fiscal year in which the loan is obligated even if some or all of the funds will be outlayed in subsequent years note that after the first year the actual net cash flows are different from the present value of these cash flows 3 subsidy appropriation of 106 million is needed for fy1999 this amount is derived by totaling the present value of cash flows for all fiscal years during the life of the loan fy19992004 outlays of 106 million also are scored for fy1999 4 the subsidy rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the present value of cash flows by total loan obligations yielding in this instance subsidy rate of 106 percent on the basis of this calculation an appropriation of 106 million would permit direct loan obligations of 10 billion source table prepared by the congressional budget office in 1991 and updated by the congressional research service in 1998httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs47 recording cash flows in the budget credit reform necessitates the establishment of separate budgetary accounts for the subsidized and unsubsidized portions of loans and for the cash flows of both prerefor m loans and those made after the new procedures took effect three types of accounts have been established to accommodate these needs 1 program accounts for the subsidized portion of new loans and administrative expenses 2 financing accounts for the unsubsidized portion and for all cash flows except administrative expenses during the life of new loans and 3 liquidating accounts for the cash flows of prereform loans box 2d lists the budgetary status of these accounts program account this is the type of account into which an appropriation is provided to cover the subsidy cost of direct or guaranteed loan an amount typically is also appropriated to this account for administrative expenses though these expenses are not included in the computation of subsidy costs direct and guaranteed loans are segregated within these accounts the program account does not receive any funds for the unsubsidized portion of direct or guaranteed loan financing account this type of account is nonbudgetary its cash inflows and outflows are not included in the budget totals these flows are accounted for as means of financing not as budget receipts or outlays the financing account collects the subsidy cost appropriation from the program account and borrows the unsubsidized portion of the loan from the treasury department as needed to make loan disbursements payments of fees interest principal and other charges are placed in the financing account which repays with interest money borrowed from the treasury department separate financing accounts are maintained within the same program for direct and guarantee d loans in the case of guaranteed loans the financin g account serves as reserve for defaults it lends these reserves with interest to the treasury department liquidating account this kind of account handles the cash flows for loans made prior to fy1992 because these loans were made under prereform procedures they are budgeted on cash basis the liquidating account collects payments of principal interest and

the budget of the united states government is required by law to be submitted to congress early in the legislative session later than the first monday in february the budget consists of estimates of spending revenues borrowing and debt policy and legislative recommendations detailed estimates of the financial operations of federal agencies and programs data on the actual and projected performance of the economy and other information supporting the presidents recommendations the presidents budget is only request to congress congress is not required to adopt the presidents recommendations in fact one of the purposes of the budget resolution process described in chapter 4 is to enhance congresss independence from presidential influence nevertheless the power to formulate and submit the budget is vital tool in the presidents direction of the executive branch and of national policy the presidents proposals often influence congressional revenue and spending decisions though the extent of the influence varies from year to year and depends more on political and fiscal conditions than on the legal status of the budget the constitution does not provide for budget nor does it require the president to make recommendations concerning the revenues and spending of the federal government until 1921 the federal government operated without comprehensive presidential budget process instead agencies submitted estimates to the secretary of the treasury who compiled them in book of estimates each year the president was not formally involved in the process though some presidents actively intervened to shape financial policy the budget and accounting act of 1921 provides for national budget system its basic requirement is that the president prepare and submit budget to congress each year the 1921 act established the bureau of the budget now the office of management and budget to assist the president in preparing and implementing the executive budget although it has been amended many times this statute provides the legal basis for the presidential budget prescribes much of its content and defines the roles of the president and the agencies in the process the three key advisers to the president on economic and budgetary matters sometimes referred to as the troika are the director of omb the secretary of the treasury and the chairman of the council of economic advisers presidents sometimes have accorded significant influence over economic and budgetary matters to an informal group of advisers including such persons as the white house chief of staff and special presidential assistants in addition to members of the troika in the executive branch omb is the hub of the federal budget process its chief mission is to assist the president by overseeing the preparation of the budget and its submission to congress and to supervise its administration and implementation by thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs50 executive agencies in doing so omb helps set funding priorities assesses competing funding demands among agencies and evaluates the effectiveness of agency programs omb seeks to ensure that the legislative proposals and congressional testimony of agencies as well as agency reports and rules are consistent with the presidents budget recommendations and administration policies during the consideration of budgetary legislation omb maintains liaison with the house and senate communicati ng the presidents position on budgetary issues through devices such as statements of administration policy see exhibit 7e in addition to its budgetary mission omb oversees and coordinates the administrations procurement financial management information and regulatory policies in omb the budget and review functions report directly to the director and deputy director but the management and regulatory functions usually report to the deputy director for management formulation and content of the presidents budget preparation of the presidents budget typically begins in the spring or earlier each year at least nine months before the budget is submitted to congress about 17 months before the start of the fiscal year to which it pertains and about 29 months before the close of that fiscal year the early stages of budget preparation occur in federal agencies when they begin work on the budget for fiscal year agencies already are implementing the budget for the fiscal year in progress and awaiting final appropriations actions and other legislative decisions for the fiscal year after that the long lead times and the fact that appropriations have not yet been made for the next year mean that the budget is prepared with great deal of uncertainty about economic conditions presidential policies and congressional actions at one time omb had formal process known as the spring preview for developing presidential budget guidelines for the next fiscal year during the 1980s however the formal process withered away possibly because of the preoccupation of omb and the white house with congressional budget activity nowadays however agencies usually are at work preparing their own budgets before presidential policies and detailed technical instructions are communicated to them box 3a displays the budget preparation schedule in one federal agency this example sets forth excerpts from more detailed schedule used by the department of education the complete schedule may be obtained on the internet at httpwwwedgovofficesousbudcal98html note that the process begins at the lower levels of the agency and moves progressively to higher levels until it is consolidated into an agencywide budget for submission to omb this bottom up approach is typical of federal agencies though some have elaborate planning processes which allow for objectives established at the top to guide budget preparation bottomup budgeting is timeconsuming process it begins almost full year before the president submits his budget to congress and year and half before the beginning of the fiscal year to which it pertains when the education department started work on the fy2000 budget it was barely half way through fy1998 and

annually as part of the budget process beginning with the fy1999 budget cycle strategic and performance plans are supposed to be integrated with and guide budget preparation but it is too early to assess whether this has been achieved procedures under gpra are discussed more fully in chapter 8 as agencies formulate their budgets they maintain continuing contact with the omb examiners assigned to them these contacts provide agencies with guidance in preparing their budgets and also enable them to alert omb to any needs or problems that may loom ahead midway during their work on the budget agencies receive circular a11 from omb which contains detailed instructions and schedules for submission of budget estimates omb communicates its instructions and guidelines on budget preparation and other activities to agencies through circulars bulletins and other publications see box 3b agency requests are submitted to omb in late summer or early fall these are reviewed by omb staff in consultation with the president and his aides the review has several distinct stages 1 staff review during which omb staff prepare issue papers consult with agency officials and prepare recommendations 2 directors review at which major issues are discussed omb examiners defend their recommendations and the omb director makes budget decisions 3 passback at which agencies are notified of the directors decisions and have an opportunity to appeal to omb if they disagree with aspects of the passback 4 appeals which are first taken to omb but if agreement cannot be reached may be taken to the president and 5 final decisions which are made by the president pursuant to which agencies must promptly revise their budget submissions to bring them into accord with these decisions the

their budget requests directly to congress see box 3c moreover omb regulations in circular 10 provide for confidentiality in all budget requests and recommendations prior to the transmittal of the presidents budget to congress however it is quite common for internal budget documents to become public while the budget is still being formulated the format and content of the budget are partly determined by law but the 1921 budget and accounting act authorizes the president to set forth the budget in such form and detail as he may determine over the years there has been an increase in the number of volumes making up the budget submission as well as in the types of information and explanatory material presented during 4year period covering fy19911994 however the budget was presented as single document the different volumes used in recent years are shown in box 3d much of the budget is an estimate of requirements under existing law rather than request for congressional action about onethird of all spending in the budget is discretionary congress must act each year on appropriations acts providing discretionary budget authority the remainder of the spending however is mandatory it occurs automatically each year with some exceptions under permanent law similarly most of the revenue for fiscal year is generated under permanent law the president usually proposes some changes in mandatory spending and revenue laws in his budget the president is required to submit budget update reflecting changed economic conditions congressional actions and other factors referred to as the midsession review by july 15 each year the president may revise his recommendations any time during the year changes requested before congress has acted are submitted as budget amendments requests made for additional funds after congress has acted on the particular appropria tions measures are submitted as supplemental requests the midsession review and messages transmitting budget amendments supplemental requests and impoundment proposals are routinely printed as house documents the president and his budget office have an important but limited role once the budget is submitted to congress

most years the president submits his annual budget to congress as multivolume set in recent years the major volumes that make up this set have included the budget referred to officially as the budget

organized by budget function and summary tables the appendix which sets forth detailed financial information on individual programs and appropriation accounts the analytical perspectives which

maintains an elaborate legislative clearance process to ensure that agency budget justifications testimony and other submissions are consistent with presidential policy but the fragmented structure of the appropriations process and interactions at congressional hearings sometimes enable agencies to exert independence from the white houses position on particular issues independence from the presidents recommendations also is fostered by cbo review of the administrations proposals the cbo review which generally is published about one month after the presidents budget is submitted to congress includes its reestimates of the presidents budget based on its own economic andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs55 technical assumptions the cbo review includes summary backed up by detailed analyses of major programs and policies as exhibit 3a reveals cbo sometimes finds that if the presidents budget proposals were put into effect they would yield higher deficit or lower surplus than the administration had projected although the differences between the presidents estimates and cbos estimates often seem to be large they usually amount to less than onehalf percent of total revenue and spending in recent years several factors have given the president more continuing involvement in congressional action on the budget one factor is the budget enforcement act which requires the president to notify congress whether the discretionary spending limits and payasyougo requirements are being met this process is discussed in chapter 2 another factor is the trend toward budget summits at which an overall agreement is negotiated by presidential aides and congressional leaders finally with agencies and congress acting more independently on budget matters than in the past the

economy as stated in the opening chapter the relationship between the budget and the economy is bilateral not only does budget policy affect the economy economic performance strongly influences budget outcomes in making the budget the president must consider the condition of the economy and the potential effects of federal policies on prices employment levels the output of goods and services and other economic indicators the presidents budget contains forecast of economic conditions for the next two calendar years see exhibit 3b it also projects assumed economic performance for longer period there is marked tendency for these forecasts and assumptions to project steady improvement in the years ahead shortly after the budget is issued the president submits an annual economic report to congress this document also contains the annual report of the presidents council of economic advisers congress is not bound by the presidents economic projections it usually makes its own economic forecast relying on data and analyses from cbo in formulating the budget resolution for the next fiscal year congress and the president sometimes coordinate their economic forecasts however especially when they engage in budget summit the budget is highly sensitive to the level of economic growth price changes interest rates and unemployment see exhibit 1c deviations between actual and projected

initially forecast deficit the forecast later was changed from deficit to the first surplus in many years the surplus estimates subsequently were revised upward economic conditions are not the only factors causing the budget to veer off the projected course variances also result from policy decisions and from differences between the technical estimates made when the budget was prepared and those used as later information became available much of the adjustment of the budget to economic conditions is automatic it occurs without presidential or congressional action revenues do not usually fall when the economy weakens they just grow more slowly outlays of various indexed programs are adjusted for price changes and interest charges respond directly to changing interest rates periodically the president issues an updated budget forecast to take account of fresh economic data and other developments cbo also reestimates revenues and outlays to reflect changing economic conditions the budget

and the bea controls can be suspended altogether by congress in case of recession or weak economic growth information in the presidents budget the presidents budget contains variety of data and

and impoundment control act of 1974 as amended establishes the congressional budget process as the means by which congress coordinates the various budgetrelated actions such as the consideration of appropriations and revenue measures taken by it during the course of the year the process is centered around an annual concurrent resolution on the budget that sets aggregate budget policies and functional spending priorities for at least the next five fiscal years because concurrent resolution is not lawit cannot be signed or vetoed by the presidentthe budget resolution does not have statutory effect money can be raised or spent pursuant to it the main purpose of the budget resolution is to establish the framework within which congress considers separate revenue spending and other budgetrelated legislation revenue and spending amounts set in the budget resolution establish the basis for the enforcement of congressional budget policies through points of order the budget resolution also initiates the reconciliation process for conforming existing revenue and spending laws to congressional budget policies the 1974 congressional budget act which includes many provisions that operate as rules of the house and senate has been amended many times major changes to the act occurred in the 1980s and 1990s in conjunction with legislation establishing and extending the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 and the budget enforcement act of 1990 changes in the 1974 act were made most recently by the budget enforcement act of 1997 additionally some rules of the congressional budget process have been incorporated into or augmented by the standing rules of the house and senate content and formulation of the budget resolution the congressional budget process begins upon the presentation of the presidents budget in january or february see box 4a the timetable set forth in the 1974 congressional budget act calls for the final adoption of the budget resolution by april 15 well before the beginning of the new fiscal year on october 1 although the house and senate often pass the budget resolution separately before april 15 they often do not reach final agreement on it until after the deadlinesometimes months later the congressional budget act of 1974 bars consideration of revenue spending and debtlimit measures for the upcoming fiscal year until the budget resolution for that year has been adopted but certain exceptions are provided such as the exception that allows the house to consider the regular appropriations bills after may

accompanying each resolution some recent reports have contained detailed information on the program levels assumed in the resolution these assumptions are not binding on the affected committees finally the 1974 congressional budget act allows certain additional matters to be included in the budget resolution perhaps the most important optional feature of budget resolution is reconciliation directives discussed below in recent years the house and senate have included many declaratory statements in budget resolutions these provisions usually begin with the phrase it is the sense of the house or it is the sense of the senate also the senate has included other procedural matters in recent years including provisions called reserve funds which provide for later adjustments in budget resolution figures and committee spending allocations so that certain deficitneutral legislation may be considered budget resolution formulation the house and senate budget committees are responsible for marking up and reporting the budget resolution in the course of developing budget resolution the budget committees hold hearings receive views and estimates reports from other committees and obtain information from cbo in their initial hearings each year the budget committees receive testimony from the director of omb the secretary of the treasury and the chairman of the presidents council of economic advisers the cbo director also testifies the views and estimates reports of house and senate committeesan excerpt from one appears as exhibit 4cprovide the budget committees with information on the preferences and legislative plans of congressional committees regarding budgetary matters within their jurisdiction cbo assists the budget committees in developing the budget resolution by issuing early each year report on the economic and budget outlook that includes baseline budget projections the baseline projections presented in the report are supported by more detailed projections for accounts and programs cbo usually revises the baseline projections one or more times before the budget committeeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs70 surface transportation the house transportation and infrastructure committees top priority is to reauthorize the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act istea of 1991 the committee recommends that the budget resolution assume contract authority for these programs that reflect funding level that would make full use of the resources of the highway trust fund the funding levels for highways mass transit and highway safety should include income plus an additional amount that would draw down the existing balance we recognize that immediately spending the maximum level possible would be difficult in light of the goal to balance the budget by 2002 the committee also believes that federal fuel excise taxes be used to finance infrastructure improvements and not be diverted to the general fund the budget resolution should assume funding financed from the 43 cent fuel tax that is currently deposited in the general fund this increased revenue will allow the trust fund to sustain higher level of funding well into the next century it is not sufficient however to simply provide contract authority for the reauthorization in the budget resolution the budget resolution must also assume that the newly authorized funds can actually be spent toward this end the resolution should reflect enactment of hr 4 the truth in budgeting act to move the transportation trust funds offbudget so they can be utilized for their stated intent without special budgetary treatment for the transportation trust funds the funds authorized and the tax revenue collected will simply accumulate exhibit 4c views and estimates of committees 1 house and senate committees are required to report their views and estimates on budget matters in their jurisdiction within six weeks after the president submits his budget the excerpt shown presents the views of the house transportation and infrastructure committee for fy1998 2 some committees submit views and estimates reports in the form of brief letter from the chairman others submit lengthy detailed reports in this exhibit the views represent bipartisan statement some committees submit separate statements from the majority and minority members 3 the house transpor tation committee like many other committees organizes its report by broad subject areas under its jurisdiction and identifies major legislation it expects to consider legislative committees

addition cbo issues report analyzing the presidents budgetary proposals in light of cbos own economic and technical assumptions in past years cbo also issued an annual report on spending and revenue options for reducing the deficit the extent to which the budget committees and the house and senate consider particular programs when they act on the budget resolution varies from year to year specific program decisions are supposed to be left to the appropriations committees and other committees of jurisdiction but there is strong likelihood that major issues will be discussed in markup in the budget commit tees reports and during floor consideration of the budget resolution an excerpt from budget committee report is shown in exhibit 4d although any programmatic assumptions generated in this process are not binding on the committees of jurisdiction they often influence the final outcome floor consideration of the budget resolution is guided by house and senate rules and practices in the house the rules committee usually reports special rule simple house resolution which once approved establishes the terms and conditions under which the budget resolution is considered this special rule typically specifies which amendments may be considered and the sequence in which they are to be offered and voted on it has been the practice in recent years to allow consideration of few amendments as substitutes for the entire resolution that present broad policy choices in the senate the amendment process is less structured relying on agreements reached by the leadership through broad consultative process the amendments offered in the senate may entail major policy choices or may be focused on single issue budget resolution enforcement achievement of the policies set forth in the annual budget resolution depends on the legislative actions taken by congress and their approval or disapproval by the president the performance of the economy and technical considerations many of the factors that determine whether budgetary goals will be met are beyond the direct control of congress if economic conditionsgrowth employment levels inflation and so forthvary significantly from projected levels so too will actual levels of revenue and spending similarly actual levels may differ substantially if the technical factors upon which estimates are based such as the rate at which agencies spend their discretionary funds or participants become eligible for entitlement programs prove faulty congresss regular tools for enforcing the budget resolution each year are overall spending ceilings and revenue floors and committee allocations and subdivisions of spending in addition in recent years the senate has enforced discretionary spending limits in the budget resolution which parallel the adjustable limits established in statute and enforced by the sequestration process in order for the enforcement procedure s to work congress must have access to complete and uptodate budgetary information so that it can relate individual measures to overall budget policies and determine whether adoption of particular measure would be consistent with those policies substantive and procedural points of order are designed to obtain congressional compliance with budget rules point of order may bar house or senate consideration of legislation that violates the spending ceilings httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs72 function 400 transportation discretionary spending discretionary spending in this function is priority in the bipartisan budget agreement the resolution mark assumes spending of all estimated highway trust fund tax receipts between 1998 and 2002proposal would increase total highway spending from its current level of 208 billion to 231 billion in 2002 the resolution mark assumes the budget resolution baseline for faa operations facilities and equipment and research engineering and development programs the resolution mark would provide for these programs to grow from their 1997 level of 71 billion to 83 billion in 2002 the resolution mark also assumes freeze in the airport improvement program aip through 2002 at its current level of 146 billion the presidents budget had provided for aip to be reduced to 10 billion in 1998 and frozen at this figure through 2002 in order to meet the bipartisan budget agreements discretionary spending limits savings will be required from programs in this function these savings will be determined by the appropriations committee mandatory spending the resolution mark provides for an increase in contract authority for highways highway safety and mass transit above the levels provided in 1997 total highway and highway safety contract authority would rise from its current level of 226 billion to 251 billion in 2002exhibit 4d committee report accompanying budget resolution 1 the increases or decreases in spending and revenues recommended by the budget committees usually are explained in the budget committee reports on the budget resolution as changes from the baseline spending recommendations are discussed by functional category of the budget and within each category by discretionary and mandatory amounts 2 in this case the senate budget committee adhered to bipartisan budget agreement reached by president clinton and congressional leaders that designated transportation spending as priority 3 the budget committees recommendations for this function like many others are mix of increases for priority programs freeze levels for other programs and reductions in others 4 although specific program assumptions are not binding on the appropriations committees and other committees with spending jurisdiction they may represent consensus and influence

2527httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs73 and revenue floors in the budget resolution committee subdivisions of spending or congressional budget procedures budget resolution aggregates in the early years after the 1974 congressional budget act the principal enforcement mechanism was the ceiling on total budget authority and outlays and the floor under total revenues set forth in the budget resolution the limitations inherent in this mechanism soon became apparent for example the issue of controlling breaches of the spending ceilings usually did not arise until congress acted on supplemental appropriations acts when the fiscal year was well underway the emergency nature of the legislation often made it difficult to uphold the ceilings as part of the budget process changes made by the bea of 1997 the aggregate levels set in the budget resolution and the associated discretionary spending limits and committee spending allocations are adjusted periodically for the consideration of legislation in several different categories the adjustments are meant to parallel similar adjustments made automatically in the statutory discretionary spending limits the chairmen of the house and senate budget committees make the adjustments whenever the designated legislation is reported and submit them for publication in the congressional record the adjustments take permanent effect if the legislation is enacted into law adjustments may be triggered by legislation in the following five categories 1 measures containing designated emergency amounts of discretionary spending direct spending or revenues 2 measures funding continuing disability reviews 3 measures providing an allowance for the international monetary fund 4 measures funding arrearages for various international organizations international peacekeeping and multilateral development banks but only for the period covering fy1998200 0 and subject to limit of 1884 billion in budget authority and 5 measures providing funds for an earned income tax credit compliance initiative subject to annual limits ranging from 138 million for fy1998 to 146 million for fy2002 allocations of spending to committees in view of the inadequacies in the early years of congressional budgeting of relying on enforcement of the budget totals congress changed the focus of enforcement in the 1980s to the committee allocations and subdivisions of spending made pursuant to section 302 of the act the key to enforcing budget policy is to relate the budgetary impact of individual pieces of legislation to the overall budget policy because congress operates through its committee system an essential step in linking particular measures to the budget is to allocate the spending amounts set forth in the budget resolution among house and senate committees section 302a provides for allocations to committees to be made in the statement of managers accompanying the conference report on the budget resolution section 302a allocation is made to each committee which has jurisdiction overhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs74 spending both for the budget year and the full period covered by the budget resolutionat least five fiscal years see exhibits 4e and 4f the committee allocations do not take into account jurisdiction over discretionary authorizations funded in annual appropriations acts the amounts of new budget authority and outlays allocated to committees in the house or senate may not exceed the aggregate amounts of budget authority and outlays set forth in the budget resolution although these allocations are made by the budget committees they are not the unilateral preferences of these committees they are based on assumptions and understandings developed in the course of formulating the budget resolution after the allocations are made under section 302a the house and senate appropriations committees subdivide the amounts they receive among their 13 subcommittees as required by section 302b see exhibit 4g the subcommittees section 302b subdivisions may not exceed the total amount allocated to the committee each appropriations committee reports its subdivisions to its respective chamber the appropriations bills may not be considered until such report has been filed scoring and cost estimates scoring also called scorekeeping is the process of measuring the budgetary effects of pending and enacted legislation and assessing its impact on budget planin this case the budget resolution in the congressional budget process scoring serves several broad purposes first it informs members of congress and the public about the budgetary consequences of their actions when budgetary measure is under consideration scoring information lets members know whether adopting the amendment or passing the bill at hand would breach the budget further scoring information enables members to judge what must be done in upcoming legislative action to achieve the years budgetary goals finally scoring is designed to assist congress in enforcing its budget plans in this regard scoring is used largely to determine whether points of order under the 1974 congressional budget act may be sustained against legislation violating budget resolution levels the principal scorekeepers for congress are the house and senate budget committees which provide the presiding officers of their respective chambers with the estimates needed to determine if legislation violates the aggregate levels in the budget resolution or the committ ee subdivisions of spending the budget committees make summary scoring reports available to members on frequent basis usually geared to the pace of legislative activity cbo assists congress in these activities by preparing cost estimates of legislation see exhibit 4h which are included in committee reports and scoring reports for the budget committees see exhibit 4i the joint committee on taxation supports congress by preparing estimates of the

budget committees issue scoring also called scorekeeping reports on the status of the congressional budget over the years both committees have met this requirement by inserting cbo scoring reports into the congressional record as frequently as legislative activity requires only the senate budget committee has issued these reports regularly in recent years 2 these reports are used principally in determining whether pending measure would violate section 311 of the 1974 congressional budget act by causing total budget authority or outlays to exceed or total revenues to fall below the levels set in the budget resolution 3 as used here current level includes both new legisl ation already enacted or sent to the president during the session and revenue or spending resulting from existing law

congressional budget act provides for both substantive and procedural points of order to block violations of budget resolution policies and congressional budget procedures one element of substantive enforcement is based on section 311 of the act which bars congress from considering legislation that would cause total revenues to fall below the level set in the budget resolution or total new budget authority or total outlays to exceed the budgeted level the house and senate both enforce the spending ceilings for the first fiscal year only the revenue floor however is enforced for the first fiscal year and for the full number of fiscal years covered by the budget resolution in the house but not the senate section 311 does not apply to spending legislation if the committee reporting the measure has stayed within its allocation of new discretionary budget authority accordingly the house may take up any spending measure that is within the appropriate committee allocations even if it would cause total spending to be exceeded neither chamber bars spending legislation that would cause functional allocations in the budget resolution to be exceeded section 302f of the 1974 congressional budget act bars the house and senate from considering any spending measure that would cause the relevant committees spending allocations to be exceeded in the house the point of order applies only to violations of allocations of new discretionary budget authority further the point of order also applies to suballocations of spending made by the appropriations committees the senate but not the house enforces revenue and spending levels for social security contained in the budget resolution section 311 bars the consideration of any legislation that would cause an increase in social security deficits or decrease in social security surpluses relative to the levels set forth in the budget resolution for the budget year or the full period covered by the budget resolution in addition to points of order to enforce compliance with the budget resolution and the allocations and subdivisions made pursuant to it the 1974 congressional budget act contains points of order to ensure compliance with its procedures perhaps the most important of these is section 303 which bars consideration of any revenue spending entitlement or debtlimit measure prior to adoption of the budget resolution however the rules of the house permit it to consider regular appropriations bills after may 15 even if the budget resolution has not yet been adopted when the house or senate considers revenue or spending measure the chairman of the respective budget committee sometimes makes statement advising the chamber as to whether the measure violates any of these points of order if point of order is made or if the point of order is waived the house or senate may consider measure despite any violations of the 1974 congressional budget act the house often waives points of order by adopting special rule the senate may waive points of order by unanimous consent or by motion under section 904 of the act the senate requires threefifths vote of the membership to waive certain provisions of the acthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs81 the reconciliation process beginning in 1980 congress has used reconciliation legislation to implement many of its most significant budget policies section 310 of the 1974 congressional budget act sets forth special procedure for the development and consideration of reconciliation legislation reconciliation legislation is used by congress to bring existing revenue and spending law into conformity with the policies in the budget resolution reconciliation is an optional process but congress has used it more years than not during the period covering 1980 through 1997 total of 14 reconciliation measures in 11 different years were enacted into law and one was vetoed the reconciliati on process has two stagesthe adoption of reconciliation instructions in the budget resolution and the enactment of reconciliation legislation that implements changes in revenue or spending laws although reconciliation has been used since 1980 specific procedures tend to vary from year to year reconciliation is used to change the amount of revenues budget authority or outlays generated by existing law in few instances reconciliation has been used to adjust the public debt limit on the spending side the process focuses on entitlement laws it may not be used however to impel changes in social security law reconciliation sometimes has been applied to discretionary authorizations which are funded in annual appropriations acts but this is not the usual practice reconciliation directives reconciliation begins with directive in budget resolution instructing designated committees to report legislation changing existing law or pending legislation see exhibits 4j and 4k these instructions have three components 1 they name the committee or committees that are directed to report legislation 2 they specify the amounts by which existing laws are to be changed but do not identify how these changes are to be made which laws are to be altered or the programs to be affected and 3 they usually set deadline by which the designated committees are to recommend the changes in law the instructions typically cover the same fiscal years covered by the budget resolution the dollar amounts are computed with reference to the cbo baseline thus change represents the amount by which revenues or spending would decrease or increase from baseline levels as result of changes made in existing law this computation is itself based on assumptions about the future level of revenues or spending under current law or policy and about the dollar changes that would ensue from new legislation hence the savings associated with the reconciliation process are assumed savings the actual changes in revenues or spending may differ from those estimated when the reconciliation instructions are formulated although the instructions do not mention the programs to be changed they are based on assumptions as to the savings or deficit reduction or in some cases increases that would result from particular changes in revenue provisions or spending programs these program assumptions are sometimes printed in the reports on the budget resolution even when the assumptions are not published committees and members usually have good idea of the specific program changes contemplated by the reconciliation instructionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs82 sec 105 reconciliation in the house of representatives purposethe purpose of this section is to provided for two separate reconciliation bills the first for entitlement reform and the second for tax relief b submissions 1 entitlement reformsnot later than june 13 1997 the house committees named in subsectio n c shall submit their recommendations to

fiscal years 1998 through 2002exhibit 4j house reconciliation directives 1 the reconciliation directives are contained in the budget resolution reconciliation is an optional procedure that is not used every year it has been used principally to reduce the deficit by raising revenues or reducing direct spending through changes in existing law in recent years it has been used to reduce revenues and in few instances to increase spending 2 the reconciliation directives set deadline for committees to report their legislative recommendations sometimes the deadline is extended 3 separate house and senate directives name the committees that must make legislative recommendations in most years at least several committees in each house are subjec t to directives their recommendations usually are consolidated into an omnibus bill but sometimes committees are directed to proceed separately with their legislation particularly on revenue issues 4 the house often uses directives that differ in form from those used in the senate in this example the directive is stated as ceiling on the total direct spending of the committee for the first year the last year and the full fiveyear period covered by the budget resolution the form of house directives has changed over the years compare this example to the next exhibit which makes clear that reconciliation involved an increase for this

the senate directives contemplate that the recommendations for spending reductions will be incorporated into an omnibus bill that the senate budget committee will report without any substant ive revision but that the senate finance committee will report its recommendations for the 85 billion tax cut directly to the senate as separate bill 2 like the house reconciliation directives the senate directives provide deadline for the submission by committees of their recommendations in the case of the omnibus bill the instructed committees must submit both legislative language for incorporation into the omnibus bill and report language for incorporation into the accompanying report 3 the senate directives differ in form from those used in the house in this example the directive is stated as specific amount of outlay increase or deficit reduction for each committee for the last fiscal year and the full five year period covered by the budget resolution the form of senate directives has changed over the years source hrept 105116 conference report to accompany hconres 84 concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1998 june 4 1997 pages 1516httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs84 committee has discretion to decide on the legislative changes to be recommended it is not bound by the program changes recommended or assumed by the budget committees in the reports accompanying the budget resolution further committee has to recommend legislation estimated to produce dollar changes for each category delineated in the instructions to it when budget resolution containing reconciliation instruction has been approved by congress the instruction has the status of an order by the house and senate to designated committees to recommend legislation usually by date certain it is expected that committees will carry out the instructions of their parent chamber but the 1974 congressional budget act does not provide any sanctions against committees that fail to do so development and consideration of reconciliation measures when more than one committee in the house and senate is subject to reconciliation directives the proposed legislative changes usually are consolidated by the budget committees into an omnibus bill the 1974 congressional budget act does not permit the budget committees to revise substantively the legislation recommended by the committees of jurisdiction this restriction pertains even when the budget committees estimate that the proposed legislation will fall short of the dollar changes called for in the instructions sometimes the budget committees working with the leadership develop alternatives to the committee recommendations to be offered as floor amendments so as to achieve greater compliance with the reconciliation directives the 1974 congressional budget act requires that amendments offered to reconciliation legislation in either the house or the senate be deficit neutral see box 4c to meet this requirement an amendment reducing revenues or increasing spending must offset these deficit increases by equivalent revenue increases or spending cuts additionally nongermane amendments may not be offered in either chamber this deficitneutrality requirement pertains only to floor amendments it does not pertain to deficitincreasing provisions recommended by committee instructed to produce reconciliation savings however such provisions in the senate could violate the byrd rule discussed below one effect of this restriction is to make it difficult to amend reconciliation bills in the house or senate although deficitneutral amendments may be offered the requirement that they contain offsets usually makes them politically unattractive of course amendments may be offered that reduce the deficit below the budgeted level during the first several years experience with reconciliation the legislation contained many provisions that were extraneous to the purpose of reducing the deficit the reconciliation submissions of committees included such things as provisions that had budgetary effect that increased spending or reduced revenues or that violated another committees jurisdictionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs85 section 310 of the congressional budget act of 1974 d limitation on amendments to reconciliation bills and resolutions 1 it shall not be in order in the house of representatives to consider any amendment to reconciliation bill or reconciliation resolution if such amendment would have the effect of increasing any specific budget outlays above the level of such outlays provided in the bill or resolution for the fiscal years covered by the reconciliation instructions set forth in the most recently agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget or would have the effect of reducing any specific federal revenues below the level of such revenues provided in the bill or resolution for such fiscal years unless such amendment makes at least an equivalent reduction in other specific budget outlays an equivalent increase in other specific federal revenues or an equivalent combination thereof for such fiscal years except that motion to strike provision providing new budget authority or new entitlement authority may be in orderbox 4c deficit neutrality of amendments in 1985 the senate adopted the byrd rule named after its principal sponsor senator robert c byrd on temporary basis as means of curbing these practices see box 4d the byrd rule allows senators to strike extraneous provisions from reconciliation legislation on point of order both during initial consideration of such legislation and during consideration of the conference report it has been extended and modified several times over the years in 1990 the byrd rule was incorporated into the 1974 congressional budget act as section 313 and made permanent senator opposed to the inclusion of extraneous matter in reconciliation legislation has two principal options for dealing with the problem first the senator may offer an amendment or motion to recommit the measure with instructions that strikes such provisions from the legislation second under the byrd rule the senator may raise point of order against extraneous matter in general point of order authorized under the byrd rule may be raised to strike extraneous matter already in the bill as reported or discharged or in the conference report or to prevent the incorporation of extraneous matter through the adoption of amendments or motions motion to waive the byrd rule or to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the chair on point of order raised under the byrd rule requires the affirmative vote of threefifths of the membership 60 senators if seats are vacant under the byrd rule several categories of extraneous matter are established including among other things items that would cause the estimated deficit for future fiscal years to rise the byrd rule supplements the prohibition against the offering in the senate of nongermane amendments to reconciliation measures set forth elsewhere in the 1974 congressional budget acthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs86 section 313 of the congressional budget act of 1974

extraneous if such provision does not produce change in outlays or revenues including changes in outlays and revenues brought about by changes in the terms and conditions under which outlays are made or revenues are required to be collected but provision in which outlay decreases or revenue increases exactly offset outlay increases or revenue decreases shall not be considered extraneous by virtue of this subparagraph b any provision producing an increase in outlays or decrease in revenues shall be considered extraneous if the net effect of provisions reported by the committee reporting the

use other devices to control the inclusion of extraneous matter in reconciliation legislation in particular the house has used special rules to make in order amendments that strike such matter any extraneous matter passed by the house may have to be deleted in conference because of senate insistence on adherence to the byrd rulehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720chapter 5 revenues and borrowing in addition to appropriations and other forms of spendin g congresss constitutional power of the purse see box 1a extends to revenues and borrowing article i section 8 of the constitution gives congress the power to levy taxes duties imposts and excises section 8 also empowers congress to borrow funds on the credit of the united states section 7 of article i of the constitution requires that all revenue measures originate in the house beyond this the constitution does not prescribe any procedures for action on revenue and debt legislation over many decades however the house and senate have developed complex rules and practices that govern consideration of such measures although the procedures of the two chambers have many elements in common each house has tailored its rules and practices to fit its role in revenue and debt matters for example the house usually considers revenue measures under more restrictive amendment process than the senate the senate considers revenue and direct spending legislation under budget enforcement procedures that extend over much longer time frame than does the house 10 years versus five years and the house unlike the senate has used special procedures in an attempt to eliminate the need for votes directly on increasing the debt limit with respect to revenue and debt matters the legislative process is sufficiently flexible to accommoda variety of political and legislative circumstances for example in some years when the senate has chosen to initiate action on major revenue proposals it has adhered to the letter of the constitutional requirement for house origination by taking up narrow housepassed revenue measure and substituting its own comprehensive revenue provisions for the other chambers brief text further although the annual budget resolution which sets forth total revenue for the next five fiscal years often originates in the senate this sequence does not violate the constitution because the resolution itself does not raise revenues in the house revenue legislation is under the jurisdiction of the ways and means committee in the senate jurisdiction is held by the finance committee these committees also have jurisdiction over certain spending programs such as social security and unemployment compensation some of which are funded by earmarked taxes the house rules in clause 5b of rule xxi bar committees other than the ways and means committee from reporting revenue legislation see box 5a the reference in the rule to the senate pertains to situations in which the senate adds revenue provisions to housepassed measure this part of the clause bars house consideration of revenue provisions added by the senate to housepassed measure not reported by the ways and means committeehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs88 house rule xxi clause 5b b bill or joint resolution carrying tax or tariff measure shall be reported by any committee not having jurisdiction to report tax

not having that jurisdiction question of order on tax or tariff measure in any such bill joint resolution or amendment thereto may be raised at any timebox 5a bar against revenue provisions in nonrevenue measures house rulesthe house sometimes allows committees with jurisdiction over particular programs to report legislation containing revenue provisions related to those programs in applying this rule the house distinguishes between levies on the general public such as income taxes and social insurance premiums which are in the exclusive jurisdiction of the ways and means committee and fees which are imposed on beneficiaries of particular services or to regulate certain activities in the latter case legislation containing the user charge may be reported by other committees this type of measure is sometimes jointly or sequentially referred to the ways and means committee the senate has rule comparable to clause 5b of house rule xxi but senate practices hardly differ in this respect from those of the house because all general revenue legislation is under the jurisdiction of the senate finance committee revenues of the federal government also referred to as receipts have fluctuated over the last several decades between 17 and 20 of gdp as exhibit 5a shows revenues are expected to be at about the top of this range at the turn of the century revenues derive from number of sources the top part of the exhibit shows that individual and corporate income taxes account for more than half of the receipts of the government social insurance taxes are an increasingly prominent source of revenues and they now provide more than one third of total receipts additional amounts accrue to the government from various excise taxes customs fees gifts and bequests and miscellaneous receipts these revenues do not include various offsetting receipts which as will be discussed below are not accounted for as budget receipts exhibit 5a also indicates that there has been remarkable stability in federal revenues as share of the gdp over an extended period of time revenues totaled just over 19 of gdp in fy1970 and are expected to amount to just under 20 of gdp in fy2000 the portion of receipts that are federal funds the general funds of the government that unlike trust funds are available for all purposes has progressively declined over the yearsfrom 15 percent of gdp in 1960 to only 12 percent today this means that an increasing portion of federal revenues are restricted to particular useshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs89 fiscal year 1960 1970

taxationmost receipts derive from existing provisions of the tax code or social security law which continue in effect from year to year unless changed by congress this tax structure can be expected to produce increasing amounts of revenue in future years as the economy expands and incomes rise nevertheless congress usually makes some changes in the tax laws each year either to raise or lower revenues or to redistribute the tax burden in most years these changes have only marginal impact on total revenues though the effects on particular categories of taxpayers can be enormous as displayed in exhibit 5b congress enacted almost 20 major revenue measures during the 1980s these cumulatively reduced federal revenues for fy1990 by an estimated 186 billion the most sizeable of these changes by far was the 1981 tax reduction act from time to time congress also alters the tax burdens in ways which greatly affect specific taxpayers even if total revenues are not changed very much such was the case in 1986 when congress enacted farreaching tax reform legislation revenue legislation in congress congress typically acts on revenue legislation pursuant to proposals in the presidents budget an early step in congressional work on revenue legislation is publication by cbo of its baseline budget projections and its estimates of the revenue impact of the presidents budget proposals the congressional budget act of 1974 requires that cbo use estimates of revenue legislation developed by the joint committee on taxation jct see box 5 b this requirement which was adopted in 1985 contributes to close working relationship between cbo and jct on revenue matters generally congressional estimates often differ significantl from those presented in the presidents budget the revenue impact often is estimated to be far greater in future years than in the year immediately ahead consequently differences between congressional and executive revenue estimates usually are greatest in the outyears revenue estimates are used by congress in establishing baseline budget projections formulating the annual budget resolution and scoring revenue legislation the budget resolution sets forth total revenues for each of the next five fiscal years and the amount if any by which these totals are to be increased or decreased by legislative action the budget resolution also may contain reconciliation instructions directing the house ways and means committee and the httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs91 exhibit 5b revenue effects of major enacted legislation in billions of dollars 1 the

continuing resolutions and otherswere used during the 1980s to enact changes in federal revenues 4 the projections made at the time revenue legislation is considered are not always realized the tax

the total amount of revenues legislation reported pursuant to these instructions often is considered as part of an omnibus budget reconciliation bill but sometimes it is considered as separate revenue reconciliation measure the revenue totals in the budget resolution establish the framework for subsequent action on revenue measures congress generally may not consider legislation increasing or decreasing revenues for the next fiscal year until it has adopted the budget resolution for that year congress sometimes waives this requirementin the house usually by means of special rule reported by the rules committee in the senate usually by unanimous consent or by waiver motion authorized by the 1974 congressional budget act the budget resolution contains only revenue totals and total recommended changes it does not allocate these totals among revenue sources although it does set out medicare receipts separately nor does it specify which provisions of the tax code are to be changed these specific decisions are made in the revenue legislation reported by the house and senate committees with jurisdiction over such matters revenue legislation usually is considered in the house under special rule typically either closed or modified rule that either bars any floor amendments or specifies those that may be offered the house rarely acts on such measures under an open rule which would allow any floor amendment to be offered in addition the special rule may waive one or more points of order that otherwise would apply to measure in 1995 the house amended clause 5 of rule xxi to require three fifths majority to pass legislation containing federal income tax rate increase and to bar measures containing any such increase that is retroactive the senate does not restrict floor amendments like the house but it does have strict budget rules that can block revenue legislation or amendment s which would cause the deficit to rise in particular the senate adopted as part of budget resolution payasyougo point of order that requires revenue and direct spending legislation to be deficit neutral over tenyear period this provision which supplements the statutory payasyougo process discussed below expires at the end of fy2002 unless the senate chooses to extend it payasyougo paygo rules the bea of 1990 established payasyougo paygo rules that affect the consideration of revenue and direct spending legislation in congress the paygo rules currently are in effect through fy2002 for discussion of the paygo process generally see chapter 2 the basic paygo rule is that congressional action on revenue and direct spending legislation should not increase the deficit or reduce the surplus direct spending consists of entitlement and other mandatory spending programs legislation reducing federal revenues must be offset by measures increasing revenues or decreasing direct spending by an equal or greater amount or sequestration of certain direct spending programs will occurhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs93 in enforcing paygo it is necessary to distinguish between baseline revenues derived from existing laws and increases or decreases in revenues resulting from new legislation congress is not required to offset any drop in baseline revenues due to changing economic conditions or technical reestimates it would however be required to act if baseline revenues decline because of new legislation although it covers five fiscal years paygo is enforced one year at time this means that revenue increases or decreases enacted for one fiscal year are not netted against increases or decreases for another year except under the lookback feature discussed in chapter 2 moreover paygo is enforced against all revenue and direct spending legislation affecting fiscal year not against individual measures paygo does not bar congress from considering measure that would reduce revenues its enforcement procedures are triggered only if all legislation enacted for fiscal year would increase the deficit above the baseline estimate paygo emphasizes deficit neutrality not deficit reduction thus legislation producing additional revenue can finance increased direct spending or reductions in other revenue and does not have to be applied to deficit reduction paygo simply requires that the net effect of revenue and direct spending enacted for fiscal year not increase the estimate of the deficit or reduce the estimate of the surplus for that year tax expenditures in enacting revenue legislation congress often establishes or alters tax expenditures the term tax expenditures is defined in the 1974 congressional budget act to include revenue losses due to deductions exemptions credits and other exceptions to the basic tax structure tax expenditures are means by which the federal government pursues public policy objectives and as the term denotes can be regarded as alternatives to other policy instruments such as direct spending the presidents budget presents two different measures of tax expenditures revenue losses and outlay equivalents revenue losses measure the amount of revenue that the federal government forgoes outlay equivalents measure the amount of spending that would be required to provide taxpayers the same aftertax income that would be received on the basis of revenue loss measure the presidents budget for fy1999 lists 131 different tax expenditures about 40 of them involve revenue losses of 1 billion or more see exhibit 5c legislation proposing the creation of new tax expenditures or the expansion of an existing ones is subject to restrictions under both the congressional budget process and paygo because revenue losses are involved tax expenditures are classified by budget function to facilitate the comparison of spending programs and tax expenditures the joint committee on taxation estimates the revenue effects of legislation changing tax expenditures and it also publishes fiveyear projections of these provisions as an annual committee printhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs94 exhibit 5c tax expenditures 1 tax expenditures come in various formsexclusions of income from taxation deduction of certain income in computing taxable income preferentia l treatment of certain activities tax credits and deferral of taxation 2 this exhibit shows the largest of the more than 100 tax expenditures listed in the preside nts budget for fy1999 they are computed in terms of estimated revenue losses the budget also reports tax expenditures in terms of outlay equivalents 3 the first three items on this list account for more than one third of total tax expenditures these and many other tax expenditures have enjoyed special treatment since the early years of the federal income tax 4 it is generally agreed that the value of individual tax expenditures cannot be added to calculate total tax expenditures the reason for this is that chan ging one tax expenditure provision might result in more or less

example if 50 million of offsetting collections were credited to an account the budget outlays in that account would be reduced by 50 million offsetting collections include income from business or markettype activities income from the sale of assets voluntary user fees and certain flows of funds among the accounts maintained by the federal government compulsory user fees in which the payer has discretion resemble taxes and are therefore accounted for as revenue the distinction between budget receipts and offsetting collections is sometimes vague in general any income received by the federal government in the exercise of its sovereign power is recorded as receipt any arising from the sale of goods and services or other businesslike charges are budgeted as offsetting collections although classifying income as revenue or as an offsetting collection does not affect the size of the budget deficit or surplus it does affect the enforcement of the budget rules adopted in 1990 when income is classified as receipt it is included in the paygo process discussed earlier when it is recorded as an offsetting collection it must be classified as either discretionary or mandatory spending discretionary offsetting collection would affect spending computations under the discretionary spending limits discussed in chapter 2 mandator offsetting collection would be considered direct spending and would be covered by the paygo process an increase in discretionary offsetting collections would allow an equivalent amount of additional spending within the discretionary spending limits an increase in mandatory offsetting collections would allow an equivalent reduction in revenue or increase in direct spending under the paygo requirement exhibit 5d indicates that offsetting collections including the income of the us postal service and excluding intragovernmental transaction s totaled almost 130 billion in fy1997 the president frequently proposes changes in offsetting collections borrowing each year the federal government borrows funds to meet various purposes repays portion of its outstanding debt and services the debt with interest payments borrowed funds are not treated as revenues similarly debt repayments are not counted as spending but interest payments on the debt are treated as budget authority and outlays borrowing occurs for two main reasons 1 to finance deficit and 2 to satisfy legal requirements that surplus amounts in trust funds and certain other funds in the federal budget be invested in treasury securitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs96 exhibit 5d offsetting collections 1 offsetting collections are budgeted as deductions against outlays not as revenues there are three main types of offsetting collections user fees and other charges proprietary receipt s from the public and intragovernmental transactions only the first two types of offsetting collections are exhibited here intragovernmental transactions are flows of money between budget funds or accounts 2 the distinction betwe receipts and offsetting collections is not always clear and the government sometimes changes the classification prior to the 1983 budge t for example medicare premiums paid into the supplementary medical insurance fund were classified as receipts since then they have been recorded as offsetting collections 3 the offsetting collections credited to appropriation accoun ts are usually available to be spent without any further action by congress congress sometimes limits the amount of these collections that can be spent in single year source

consists of monies borrowed from the public to finance the deficit and debt issued to federal government accounts that invest their surpluses as required by law for fy1999 the gross federal debt is expected to exceed 57 trillion twothirds of that amountabout 38 trillionis debt held by the public the remainder about 19 trillion is held by us government accounts debt held by the public is an important measure in fiscal policy because of the large impact that federal borrowing has on credit markets and for other reasons federal borrowing competes in these markets with private borrowing and thereby influences interest rates the issuance of federal debt to government accounts on the other hand does not have the same economic effects at the end of world war ii the federal debt exceeded 100 of gdp over the next several decades this figure steadily declined economic disruptions during the late 1970s and the burgeoning deficits of the 1980s reversed this decline and caused the federal debt to grow significantly as consequence interest payments on the public debt escalated to over 350 billion by the end of the 1990s net interest costs which deduct interest earned by government trust funds rose to more than 240 billion the realization of projected surpluses may cause the debt held by the public and associated interest payments to decline markedly in future years nonetheless the gross federal debt will continue to increase as trust fund surpluses particularly for the social security trust funds are invested in treasury securities nearly all of the federal debt has been issued by the treasury department but small portion of it has been issued by other federal agencies the latter is referred to as agency debt virtually all federal borrowing is subject to statutory limit the second liberty bond act of 1917 established the current framework under which the statutory limit on the public debt is adjusted periodically by legislative action congress has revised the nature of the debt limit over the years including temporary limits permanent limits combinations of temporary and permanents limits and limitations by dollar amount and time ie expiration dates the house and senate may use any one of three distinct procedures to develop debtlimit legislation 1 regular legislative procedures 2 the houses gephardt rule and 3 the reconciliation process for decades the usual practice was for the house to originate bill increasing the debt limit the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee have jurisdiction over such measures which the house and senate considered under regular legislative procedures such measures often attracted controversy affording members an opportunity to register their dissatisfact ion with various facets of budgetary and economic policy in the senate significant nongermane issues sometimes were added by amendment debt limit measures sometimes were defeated bringing the federal government to the brink of default in some instances series of shortterm laws raising the debt limit was enacted before the impasse on the matter was broken in 1979 the house added new rule rule xlix commonly referred to as the gephardt rule after its sponsor representative richard gephardt in an effort to make debtlimit adjustment an automatic extension of congressional action on the budget resolution although the appropriate levels of the public debt for each fiscalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs98 year are set forth as one of the required elements in the budget resolution statute must be enacted subsequently to actually increase the debt limit the gephardt rule provides that upon the adoption by congress of the conference report on budget resolution the clerk of the house automatically engrosses and transmits to the senate joint resolution containing debtlimit increase consistent with the budget resolution the measure is deemed to have passed the house by the same vote by which the house agreed to the conference report on the budget resolution the senate did not adopt any special procedures for the consideration of debt limit measures although several joint resolutions originating under the gephardt rule were enacted into law during the 1980s these measures usually were subject to full debate in the senate and during housesenate conference action beginning in the 104th congress the house decided to longer use procedures under the gephardt rule to originate debtlimit measures in recent years the house and senate have incorporated debtlimit increases into omnibus budget reconciliation bills and other

establishing and funding federal agencies and programs first congress enacts legislation authorizing an agency or program then it makes appropriations for the authorized purpose while the rules have certain exceptions and are sometimes waived or not enforced they delineate the basic functions of authorizing legislation and appropriations measures this chapter discusses the authorizations process the next one describes the appropriations process congress bypasses the usual twostep funding process for some agencies and programs in these cases the legislative committees exercise jurisdiction over the legislation that controls spending this type of spending is referred to as direct spending also called mandatory spending it is distinguished from discretio nary spending which is controlled through the annual appropriations process at present roughly twothirds of all spending in the federal budget is direct spending and it is growing at faster rate than discretionary spending direct spending is used primarily but not exclusively to fund entitlement programs such as social security medicare federal employees retirement and disability programs and unemployment compensation most entitlement funding is provided automatically each year under permanent appropriations in substantive law some direct spending programs such as medicaid are funded in annual appropriations acts each year but the spending levels effectively are controlled in the substantive legislation establishing the entitlement legislative committees sometimes report hybrid legislation that commingles authorizing provisions and direct spending provisions the authorization process authorizing legislation has dual purpose 1 it is the means by which congress establishes policy and exercises control of federal agencies and 2 it provides the authority under house and senate rules for congress to appropriate funds accordingly an authorization act is legislation that both establishes continues or modifies an agency or program and authorizes the enactment of appropriations for that agency or program authorizing legislation establishes the terms and conditions under which each agency operates this type of legislation typically sets forth the responsibilities of agency officials and often specifies the agencys organizational structure the basic purposes of authorizations acts are illustrated in exhibit 6a httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs101 an act to reauthorize the sea grant program sec 5 national sea grant college program section 204 33 usc 1123 is amended to read as follows

house and senate committees are authorizin g committees with jurisdiction over designated programs or activities most of what these committees do revolves around their authorizing responsibilities the legislation they produce defines the relationship between these committees and the appropriatio ns committees authorizing legislation often establishes the financial boundaries within which appropriations are made authorizations represent the exercise by congress of its legislative power at one time what is now termed an authorization was referred to simply as legislation in the exercise of its legislative powers congress can place just about any type of provision other than appropriations or revenue provisions in authorizing legislation it can prescribe what an agency must do or may not do in the performance of its assigned responsibilities it can give the agency broad grant of authority or legislate in great detail there is uniform structure or format for authorizing legislation however virtually all contemporary authorization measures contain one or more provisions authorizing funds to be appropriated for designated purposes house and senate rules house rule xxi and senate rule xvi establish the basic relationship between authorizations and appropriations see box 6a house rules do not expressly require authorizations they bar unauthorized appropriations under clause 2a of house rule xxi before the house can consider most appropriations measures the purposes for which the money is to be provided have to be authorized in law the house sometimes waives the rule against unauthorized appropriations by adopting special rule before taking up an appropriations bill the rule applies only to general appropriations bills under the precedents of the house continuing appropriations act is not deemed to be general appropriations bill hence it can fund unauthorized programs house rule xxi also bars legislative provisions in general appropriations bills changes in existing law constitute new legislation and are proscribed by clauses 2b and c of the rule clause 5a of the rule shown in box 7a contains parallel provision that bars the insertion of appropriations into authorizing legislation the rule makes an exception for germane provisions which retrench expenditures this exception known as the holman rule was devised in the 1870s but rarely is used anymore senate rule xvi in paragraph 1 bars unauthorized appropriations as well but it allows many exceptions as consequence the house is much stricter in its enforcement of the rule unlike the house senate rules do not bar appropriations in authorizing legislation legislation in appropriations also is prohibited by senate rule xvi in paragraphs 2 and 4 however during the senates consideration of supplemental appropriations bill in 1995 the chairs ruling that particular amendment offered by senator was out of order as legislation was overturned by the full senate the senate has not enforced this portion of the rule since that timehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs103 house rule xxi clause 2a and b appropriation shall be reported in general appropriation bill or shall be in order as an amendment thereto for any expenditure not previously authorized by law except to continue appropriations for public works and objects which are already in progress b provision changing existing law shall be reported in general appropriation bill including provision making the availability of funds contingent on the receipt or possession of information not required by existing law for the period of the appropriation except germane provisions that retrench expenditures by the reduction of amounts of money covered by the bill which may include those recommended to the committee on appropriations by direction of legislative committee having jurisdiction over the subject matter thereof and except rescissions of appropriations contained in appropriation acts senate rule xvi paragraphs 1 and 2 1 on point of order made by any senator amendments shall be received to any general appropriation bill the effect of which will be to increase an appropriation already contained in the bill or to add new item of appropriation unless it be made to carry out the provisions of some existing law or treaty stipulation or act or resolution previously passed by the senate during that session or unless the same be moved by direction of the committee on appropriations or of committee of the senate having legislative jurisdiction of the subject matter or proposed in pursuance of an estimate submitted in accordance with law 2 the committee on appropriations shall not report an appropriation bill containing amendments to such bill proposing new or general legislation or any restriction on the expenditure of the funds appropriated which proposes limitation not authorized by law if such restriction is to take effect or cease to be effective upon the happening of contingency and if an appropriation bill is reported to the senate containing amendments to such bill proposing new or general legislation or any such restriction point of order may be made against the bill and if the point is sustained the bill shall be recommitted to the committee on appropriations box 6a house and senate rules on authorizing legislation the relationship of authorizations and appropriations it is basic rule of federal law that funds provided in appropriations acts are to be spent according to the terms set in authorizing legislation the ideal division of labor between these two types of enactments would be for the appropriations act to determine the amounts available for expenditure and the authorization act to determine the purposes for which the funds are to be used in practice however the relationship is not so clear cut some authorization acts provide budget authority and some appropriations acts contain substantive provisions affecting the use of available resources permanent vers us temporary authorizations an authorization is presumed to be permanent unless the authorizing law limits its duration most of the provisions in an authorizing statute pertaining to the operations of the affected agency are permanent although some may be effective only for single fiscal year or other period of time the permanent provisions continue in effect year after year until suchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs104 time as they are terminated or revised by new authorizing legislation in many areas of federal activity therefore there is need for congress to consider new authorizing legislation each year the portion of authorization law which provides the authority under house and senate rules for congress to make appropriations often is limited in its period of effectiveness these authorized to be appropriated provisions can be classified into three categories depending on their duration permanent authorizations do not have any time limit and continue in effect until they are changed by congress an agency having permanent authorization need only obtain appropriations to continue in operation annual authorizations are for single year and usually for fixed amount of money these authorizations have to be renewed each year strictly speaking all congress has to do is to extend the authorized to be appropriated language for another fiscal year but in the course of doing so it often makes other changes in authorizing law multiyear authorizations are typically in effect for two to fiveyear period and have to be renewed when they expire exhibit 6b provides examples of the three types of authorizations until the 1950s virtually all authorizations were permanent since then however there has been trend toward temporary annual or multiyear authorizations the shift from permanent to temporary authorizations can be mandated either by law or by the rules of the house or senate as shown in exhibit 6c there are two main reasons for the trend to temporary authorizations corresponding to the two functions of authorizing legislation identified earlier in this chapter first an annual or multiyear authorization act gives congress frequent opportunities to review an agencys activities and to make such changes in law as it deems appropriate congress is likely to seek additional control when it lacks confidence in the agency second temporary authorizations enhance the influence of authorizing committees in congress especially with respect to the amounts subsequently appropriated to affected agencies this influence arises out of feature of temporary authorizations which generally distinguish them from permanent ones while permanent authorizations rarely specify amounts of money temporary authorizations usually do in fact some of these authorizations have become quite detailed in specifying amounts that are authorized to be appropriated for particular activities although the amount appropriated does not have to conform to the authorized levelunder the rules the appropriation can be as much as or less than the authorized amountthere often is close correspondence between the authorized and appropriated amounts this is particularly true for annuallyauthorized programs inasmuch as the annual authorization normally is enacted first it directly influences the amount subsequently provided in the appropriations acthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs105 annual national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1998 sec101 army funds are hereby authorized to be appropriated for fiscal year 1998 for

congress often enacts appropriations for ongoing programs whose temporary autho rizations have expired agencies usually may spend unauthorized appropriations but sometimes their availabil ity is affected by statutory requirement for prior authorization 3 because this statutory provision bans the obligation of funds the state department would not be able to use unauthorized appropriations unless the appropriations act expressly waived this prohibition 4 this provision requires annual authorization of intelligence activities in contrast to the language shown above for the state department which does not specify the period for which authorization shall be made source 22 usc 2680a house rule xlviii clause 9httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs107 congress sometimes sets aside its rules and makes unauthorized appropriations an appropriation in excess of the authorized amount is also deemed to be unauthorized in most such cases the full appropriation is available for expenditure except when law prohibits the obligation or expenditure of such unauthorized funds congress rarely makes an unauthorized appropriation for new program concerning which authorizing law has been enacted the typical unauthorized appropriation occurs because the authorized to be appropriated provision has not been renewed in these instances the agency receiving the unauthorized appropriation is subject to the permanent law governing its operations means of influencing appropriations the authorizations discussed thus far do not permit agencies to incur obligations or spend money the authorized funds are available only to the extent provided in appropriations acts these conventional or discretionary authorizations cover less than half of the funds spent each year by the federal government although discretionary authorizations do not provide budget authority they often influence the amount of funds subsequently appropriated or the activities on which funds are spent one means of influence is to earmark funds in authorizing legislation in the manner displayed in exhibit 6d earmarking has become more prevalent and more detailed in recent years and it has sometimes resulted in conflicts between the priorities spelled out in authorizing legislation and the priorities sought by the appropriations committees congress sometimes inserts appropriations forcing provisions in authorizing legislation in these cases the funds are provided in appropriations acts but under circumstances that either give the appropriations committees little flexibility in the matter or induces them to provide the desired funds in some instances the authorization bars the use of funds for one purpose unless minimum amount is appropriated for another purpose the appropriations committees do not have to provide the minimum amount but if they fail to do so funds provided may then remain unused this and other appropriationsforcing techniques are used by authorizing committees when their spending priorities differ from those of the appropriations committees direct spending as mentioned at the opening of this chapter sizeable portion of the budgetary resources spent by the federal government is provided or controlled by laws under the jurisdiction of the legislative committees rather than the appropriations committees spending of this type is referred to as direct spending section 250 of the 1985

amounts authorized are appropriated each authorized category is reduced to its prorata share of the total authorization 3 earmarked authorizations sometimes are accomp anied by flexibility to shift

direct spending the most prominent of which is entitlement authority provisions of law that mandate payments to eligible recipients direct spending also includes borrowing authority provisions authorizing agencies to spend borrowed funds contract authority provisions authorizing agencies to enter into obligations and authority to forgo offsetting receipts provisions authorizing agencies not to collect certain user fees or other charges the 1974 congressional budget act bars congresswith certain exceptionsfrom considering new contract authority or new borrowing authority unless it is made effective only to the extent provided in appropriations acts this bar does not apply to entitlements examples of contract borrowing and entitlement authority appear in exhibits 6e and 6f although entitlements are established in authorizing legislation the rules and procedures for them are somewha t different than for discretionary authorizations entitlements are laws that give eligible recipients usually persons but sometimes governments legal right to payments from the federal government the federal government is obligated to make these payments even if the budget does not provide sufficient funds for them most entitlement laws are openended they do not specify or limit the total to be spent instead the law typically spells out eligibility criteria and establishes formula for computing the size of payments the total spent depends on the number of eligible persons and the amount each is entitled to receive some entitlements such as social security have permanent appropri ations the necessary funds become available without annual action by congress other entitlements such as veterans pensions go through the annual appropriations process though congress does not really control them at this stage if the amount appropriated does not suffice congress will have to provide supplemental appropriation the 1974 congressional budget act bars the house and senate from considering entitlement legislation until the budget resolution for the next fiscal year has been adopted this sequence enables congress to determine whether the new entitlement is consistent with the spending policies adopted in the budget resolution congress makes this determination principally by means of the section 302 procedures discussed in chapter 4 that is it determines whether the estimated cost of the entitlement legislation is within the amounts allocated to the committees of jurisdiction pursuant to section 302 of the 1974 congressional budget act the bea regulates the

stems from provisions in law that mandate payments to eligible beneficiaries entitlement laws usually set forth eligibility criteria and schedule of benefit payments some entitlements are funded by permanent appropriations and others are funded by annual appropriations 2 the entitlem ent for civil service retirement and disability pay has permanent appropriation all receipts of the trust fund become available for expenditure without further action by congress hence the receipts of the trust fund are classified as budget authority 3 congress sometimes places limits in annual appropriations acts not shown here on the administrative expenses that can be incurred in fiscal year for programs financed by permanent appropriations 4 this entitlemen t for portion of the medicare program is financed by annual appropriations in the case of such provisions called appropriated entitlements the appropri ations committees regularly provide the funds mandated by law source 5 usc 8348a public

the only way for congress to modify these spending levels is to change the laws establishing entitlements congress frequently relies on the reconciliation process see chapter 4 to make such changes in law direct spending legislation may authorize federal agency to make or guarantee loans the federal credit reform act of 1990 made significant changes in budgeting for direct and guaranteed loans these changes are discussed in chapter 2httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720 7 annual appropriations an appropriations act is law passed by congress that provides federal agencies legal authority to incur obligations and the treasury department authority to make payments for designated purposes appropriations provide budget authoritythat is authority to obligate fundsto agencies appropriations measures as explained in the previous chapter are distinct from authorizing and direct spending legislation and are principal but not the only means of providing budget authority the power of appropriation is part of congresss constitutional power of the purse see box 1a article i section 9 of the constitution states in part that money shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law the power to appropriate is exclusively legislative power it functions as limitation on the executive branch an agency may not spend more than the amount appropriated to it and it may use available funds only for the purposes and according to the conditions provided by congress in contemporary times appropriations also have been viewed as mandates that the funds be used to carry out the activities intended by congress the constitution does not require annual appropriations but since the first congress the practice has been to make appropriations for single fiscal year appropriations must be used obligated in the fiscal year for which they are provided unless the law provides that they shall be available for longer period of time all provisions in an appropriations act such as limitations on the use of funds expire at the end of the fiscal year unless the language of the act extends their period of effectiveness in the federal government an appropriation makes funds available for obligation it does not usually require that outlays be made in any particular fiscal year this is in contrast to the practices of most state and local governments which have outlaybased appropriations the amount provided is the amount to be paid out during the fiscal year in the federal government outlays often ensue years after the appropriations are obligated the relationship between budget authority provided in appropriations acts and annual outlays is explained in chapter 1 the constitution does not specify the form in which appropriations shall be made established practice predating the constitution and recognized in the rules of the house and senate provides for appropriations to be made in appropriations acts that are distinct from other types of legislation this distinction was discussed in the previous chapter and is reflected in rule xxi of the house and rule xvi of the senate which deal with general appropriation bills box 7a presents excerpts from house rule xxi and senate rule xvi as previously noted these rules establish twostep authorizationsappropriations process and should be read in tandem with box 6a clause 5a of house rule xxi bars appropriation s in authorizing legislation it is sometimes waived by the house to permit the inclusion of permanent appropriations in authorizing legislation senate rule xvi bars unauthorized appropriations and legislation in appropriations paragraph 4 of the rule for example prohibits senators from offering floor amendments to general appropriations bills that are legislative in 1995

washttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs114 house rule xxi clause 5a bill or joint resolution carrying appropriations shall be reported by any committee not having jurisdiction to report appropriations nor

in any such bill joint resolution or amendment thereto may be raised at any time senate rule xvi paragraph 4 on point of order made by any senator amendment offered by any other senator which proposes general legislation shall be received to any general appropriation bill nor shall any amendment not germane or relevant to the subject matter contained in the bill be received nor shall any amendment to any item or clause of such bill be received which does not directly relate thereto nor shall any restriction on the expenditure of funds appropriated which proposes limitation not authorized by law be received if such restriction is to take effect or cease to be effective upon the happening of contingency and all questions of relevancy of amendments under this rule when raised shall be submitted to the senate and be decided without debate and any such amendment or restriction to general appropriation bill may be laid on the table without prejudice to the billbox 7a appropriations jurisdiction house and senate rules overturned by the full senate as consequence of the senates action this portion of rule xvi has not been enforced since that time the president requests annual appropriations in his budget submitted in january or february of each year the presidents budget displays for each account the appropriation language for the current fiscal year and the proposed text for the next fiscal year in support of the presidents appropriations requests agencies submit justification materials to the house and senate appropriations committees these materials provide considerably more detail than is contained in the presidents budget and are used in support of agency testimony during appropriations subcommittee hearings on the presidents budgethttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs115 types of appropriations measures congress passes three main types of appropriations measures regular appropriations acts provide budget authority to agencies for the next fiscal year supplemental appropriations acts provide additional budget authority during the current fiscal year when the regular appropriation is insufficient or to finance activities not provided for in the regular appropriation continuing appropriations acts also called continui ng resolutions provide stopgap or fullyear funding for agencies that have not received regular appropriation exhibit 7a lists the various types of appropriations measures considered in recent session of congress house rule xxi and senate rule xvi pertain only to general appropriations bills for purposes of these rules all regular appropriations bills as well as supplemental appropriations measures covering two or more agencies or purposes are considered to be general appropriation bills the house and senate usually do not consider supplemental appropriations for single agency or purpose to be general appropriation bills nor does the house consider continuing appropr iations to be general appropriation bills hence the restrictions in these house and senate rules do not apply to certain appropriations in fact congress often inserts legislation into continuing appropr iations acts moreover the house often waives rule xxi with respect to particular appropriations measures and the senate sometimes chooses not to enforce rule xvi in typical session congress acts on more than 15 appropriations measures thirteen of these are regular appropriations bills jurisdiction over these measures is vested in the house and senate appropriations committees each of which is divided into 13 parallel subcommittees each set of subcommittees has jurisdiction over one of the regular appropriations bills after the house and senate have considered each of these bills separately the house and senate appropriations committees sometimes consolidate all or some of them into an omnibus measure congress typically acts on one or more supplemental appropriations measures each year the number and size of supplementals have declined in recent years principally because of constraints imposed by the budget enforcement act and congressional budget enforcement rules some supplemental appropriations usually those prompted by an emergency such as natural disaster are for single purpose but at least one of the supplementals enacted during the session is likely to cover multitude of activities because of recurring delays in the appropriations process congress typically passes one or more continuing appropriations each year the scope and duration of these measures depend on the status of the regular appropriations bills and the degree of budgetary conflict between the president and congress in some years the final continuing appropriations has been turned into an omnibus measure for enactment of regular appropriations billshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs116 number of billtitle reported passed housepassed senate hr 1469 hr 1871 hr 2016 hr 2107 hr 2158 hr 2159 hr 2160 hr 2169 hr 2203 hjres 94 hjres 97

appropriations measures each year regular appropriations for the next fiscal year b supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year in progress and c continuing appr opriations for programs and agencies lacking regular appropriations 2 each appropriations measure has either an hr house of repres entatives or hjres house joint resolution number indicating that the measure originated in the house the senate sometimes acts on its own appropriations measures up to the stage of final passage when it then switches to the housepassed measure 3 there is substantive difference between bill and joint resolution joint resolutions are used for some supplemental and usually all continuing appropriations 4 there usually is only brief interval from the time that an appropriations measure is reported and its consideration in the house the house usually takes up regular appropriations bills in june and july and the senate usually follows suit in july august if it is in session and september this schedule does not usually enable congress to complete action on all regular appropriations by the start of the fiscal year on october 1 5 congress often passes more than one continuing appropriations measure during session the first such measures usually have an expiration date hence congress must pass additional continuing resolutions if all regular appropriations measures have not yet been enacted the last continuing resolution sometimes is in effect for the remainder of the fiscal year source calendars of the united states house of representatives 105th congress first sessionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs117 congress sometimes makes appropriations in substantive legislation reported by an authorizing committee rather than in appropriations acts these usually are permanent appropriations which become available each year without current action by congress because of the growth of permanent appropriations for example the social security trust funds and interest on the public debt only about half of the budget authority available each year is in the jurisdiction of the appropriations committees moreover sizeable portion of the budget authority provided in annual appropriations acts is mandatory principally for entitlements the appropriations committees have effective discretion over about onethird of each years total new budget authority appropriations procedures in congress by precedent appropriations originate in the house of representatives in the house appropriations measures are originated by the appropriations committee when it marks up or reports the measure rather than being introduced by member beforehand appropriations bills do not have hr or hjres numbers until they are about to be reported by the committee and they cannot generally be tracked in legislative databases until that point exhibit 7b traces the path of an appropriations act through the house and senate before the full committee acts on the bill it is considered in the relevant appropriations subcommittee the house subcommittees typically hold extensive hearings on appropriations requests shortly after the presidents budget is submitted in marking up their appropriations bills the various subcommittees are guided by the discretionary spending limits establishe d by the budget enforcement act and the allocations made to them under section 302 of the 1974 congressional budget act the discretionary spending limits which are more fully discussed in chapter 2 set limits on budget authority and outlays for broad categories of spending inasmuch as all discretionary spending is in the jurisdiction of the appropriations committees the caps limit the amount that these committees can provide in annual appropriations measures specific dollar limitations on appropriations also are set following the adoption of budget resolution by the process under sections 302 of the 1974 congressional budget act discussed in chapter 4 pursuant to this process the house and senate appropriations committees receive total spending allocations which they subdivide among their 13 subcommittees when an appropriations bill is reported the spending provided in it is compared to the amount allocated or subdivided to the relevant subcommittee in acting on appropriations the subcommittees closely review the extensive justification material submitted in connection with hearings at which agency officials defend their budget requests the justification material typically breaks down the agencys request into discrete projects activities and line items although the format of these materials which are published in the appropriations hearings varies among subcommittees it is common for the agency to compare the amount requested for the next fiscal year with the amount provided for the current year and to explain variances between themhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs118 house senate subcommittee hearings subcommittee hearings subcommittee

quite influential and it is not uncommon for the full appropriations committee to report the bill prepared for it by the subcommittee without making substantive changes the subcommittees also draft the report which will accompany the bill to the floor and will establish much of the legislative history used to determine congressional intent exhibit 7c identifies the main steps in house action on appropriations because general appropriations bills are privileged for floor consideration they can be brought to the house without first obtaining special rule simple house resolution setting the terms of consideration through the rules committee nevertheless most appropri ations measures do come to the house under rule waiving one or more of the standing rules such as the rule against unauthorized appropriations the house first adopts the special rule see exhibit 7d then it takes up the appropriations bill when debate on an appropriations bill begins the managers of the bill usually provide summary of the main features including comparison of the budget authority and outlays in the bill to the amounts appropriated for the previous year and requested in the presidents budget sometimes the bills managers or the chairman of the house budget committee will indicate how the measure complies with the subdivisions under section 302b the house also is advised of any issues raised by the white house or omb the advice takes the form of statement of administration policy sap sap outlines the administrations position on the appropriations measure as it progresses through the appropriations process sap normally is issued at six stages of congressional action 1 house appropriations subcommittee action 2 house appropriations committee markup 3 house floor action

recent version of the appropriations measure that the administration finds objectionable excerpts from sap are provided in exhibit 7e the senate usually considers appropriations measures after they have been passed by the house when house action on appropriations bills is delayed however the senate sometimes expedites its actions by considering senatenumbered bill up to the stage of final passage upon receipt of the housepassed bill in the senate it is amended with the text that the senate already has agreed to as single amendment and then passed by the senate the sequence of senate actions is outlined in exhibit 7f hearings in the senate appropriations subcommittees generally are not as extensive as those held by counterpart subcommittees in the house the senate routinely uses unanimous consent agreements to frame the consideration of measures these agreements are printed in the senates daily calendar of business sometimes the senate uses such agreements to expedite the consideration of appropriations bills see exhibit 7g when the senate either in committee or on the floor changes housepassed appropriations measure it does so by inserting consecutively numbered amendments see exhibit 7h httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs120 exhibit 7c sequence of house actions on appropriations measures special rule although appropriations bills are privileged and can be considered by the house at any time the house normally considers them under special rules in the form of simple house resolution waiving one or more points of order such as those arising out of the house rule barring unauthorized appropriations committee of the whole after the house adopts the special rule it takes up the appropriations bill in the committee of the whole rather than in the house itself the committee of the whole has much smaller quorum requirement than that of the house general debate debate on the bill is opened by the floor managersthe chairman and ranking minority member of the relevant appropriations subcommittee opening statements may also be made by the chairman of the appropriations committee who may remark on the overall status of appropriations bills and by the chairman of the budget committee who may advise the house as to whether the particular bill conforms to the 302b subdivision amendments regular appropriations bills usually are considered under an open rule which does not preclude consideration of any floor amendments an amendment must be offered in timely manner that is when the portion of the bill to which it pertains is being read except for bloc amendments that are completely offsetting points of order points of order may be raised against either the bill reported by the committee or floor amendment in the house it is rare for the ruling of the chair on point of order to be challenged limitations floor amendments inserting certain limitations into the appropriations bill may be offered only after consideration of funding levels has been completed at this point it is in order to move that the committee of the whole rise and report if this motion is adopted there may be opportunity to offer limitation amendments final passage after the committee of the whole reports final consideration is in the house itself under certain circumstances the house may reconsider matters decided in the committee of the whole but it usually

record designated for that purpose exhibit 7d special rules on appropriations bills 1 although appropriations bills are privileged in the house and can be taken up at any time their consideration typically is preceded by the adoption of special rule in the form of simple house resolution waiving certain points of order that otherwise would apply and establishing other terms for consideration the house acts first on the rule and then if the rule is adopted considers the appropriations bill 2 the appropriations bill which was the subject of this rule did not involve any violations of the 1974 congressional budget act but it did violate house rule xxi which among other things bars unauthorized appropriations and legislation in appropriations bills the rule exhibited here waived any points of order under clauses 2 or 6 of the house rule 3 note that the waivers pertain to the entire measure in the past rules used to protect only particular portions of the appropriations bill which

bill providing requested funding for many of the administrations priorities we appreciate the committees decision to fully fund the military pay raise and to fund critical readiness programs at

the committe bill based on ombs preliminary scoring provides 255 million below the presidents request in order to increase funding for lower priority military construction projects the administration strongly opposes any provision in the house version of the bill that could be read to require prior congressional authorization of actions taken by the president pursuant to his authority under the constitution the president must be able to act decisively to protect us national security and foreign policy interests this provision would send the wrong signal to the world including us resolve regarding iraqi compliance with its obligations with respect to weapons of mass destruction the sfor operation in bosnia and efforts to deter serbian president milosevic from attacks on the people of

decades and their scope has become much broader than was the case in earlier years in some years the major continuing appropriations act has covered all of the regular appropriations bills for that year moreover rather than providing interim funding until the regular appropriations bills are enacted some continuing resolutions have provided funds for the entire fiscal year when this occurs the continuing resolution becomes an omnibus appropriations act for the fiscal year exhibit 7j displays portion of continuing resolution this development has been accompanied by two other changes in the character of continuing appropriations first these measures frequently provide funding at levels other than continuation rate some recent continuing resolutions have contained the full text of regular appropriations bills or have incorporated these bills by reference to the version passed by the house or senate or agreed to in conference some have specified definite amounts for particular programs or accounts in the same manner as is done in regular appropriations bills second continuing resolutions have been increasingly used to enact substantive legislation the opportunity to do so is based in part on the fact that they are not deemed to be general appropriations bills in the house and therefore the requirement that appropriations and authorizing legislation be in separate measures does not apply to them the manner in which these measures are consideredlate in the session and with the threat that government agencies will have to suspend operations if funds are not speedily

appropriations acts contain number of features these include the enacting clause which designates the fiscal year for which the appropriations are made the appropriation for each account including any provisions attached to it and the general provisions some of these features are displayed in exhibits 7k 7l and 7m the basic unit of an appropriation is an account single unnumbered paragraph in an appropriations act comprises one account and all provisions of that paragraph pertain to that account and to other unless the text expressly gives them broader scope any provision limiting the use of funds enacted in that paragraph is restriction on that account alone over the years appropri ations have been consolidated into relatively small number of accounts it is typical for federal agency to have single account for all its expenses of operation and additional accounts for other purposes such as construction accordingly most appropriation accounts encompass number of activities or projects the appropriation sometimes earmarks specific amounts to particular activities within the account but the more common practice is to provide detailed information on the amounts intended for each activity in other sources principally the committee reports accompanying the measures in addition to the substantive limitations and other provisions associated with each account each appropriations act has general provisions that apply to all of the accounts in title or in the whole act these general provisions appear as numbered sections usually at the end of the title or the act the standard

appropriations acts often contain substantive limitations on government agencies rulings in the house and senate have held that certain limitations examples of which are in exhibit 7p may be included in appropriations measures impact of authorization law in the previous chapter it was noted that appropriations must be spent according to the terms and conditions set in authorization law it does not suffice to review the appropriations act and any pertinent legislative history one must also examine relevant substantive law in many instances the relationship between the authorizations and appropriations laws is straightforward but there are instances where the two laws conflict or where the authorizing statute is silent particularly difficult complication arises when the report on the appropriations bill specifies somewhat different pattern of expenditure than is prescribed in substantive law in sorting out conflicts between the two sets of law one should keep in mind that seemingly slight differences in wording can spawn major differences in legal interpretation hence one should not draw conclusions about how appropriated funds are to be spent without reviewing the actual text of appropriations and authorization law budget justifications although appropriations accounts often span many activities each agency supplements accountleve l data with detailed budget justifications while agencies have discretion to vary their actual expenditures from the detailed supporting schedules the appropriations committ ees expect them to adhere to their justifications to the extent practicable when an agency shifts funds from one program to another in the same account it must go through the reprogramming procedures discussed in chapter 8 less significant changes are handled informally or by the agency unilateral ly but there has been pronounced trend for congress to hold agencies more closely to the spending patterns set forth in their budget justifications appropriations committee reports detailed information on how funds are to be spent along with other directives or guidance is provided in the reports accompanying the various appropriations measures see exhibits 7q and 7r agencies ordinarily abide by report language in spending the funds appropriated by congress the appropriations reports do not comment on every item of expenditure report language is most likely when the appropriations committee prefers to spend more or less on particular item than the president has requested or when the committee wants to earmark funds for particular project or activity when particular item is mentioned by the committee there is strong expectation that the agency will adhere to the instructionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs136 limitation by

established by congress when it makes appropriatio ns and provides other forms of budget authority and when it enacts laws prescribing the rules and procedures for financial management this chapter discusses the legal basis of expenditure management including ongoing efforts to improve financial management and the efficiency with which federal agencies use resources implementation of spending laws the federal government has decentralized system of expenditure management the size of the federal government and the diversity of its activities preclude the maintenance of centralized operation in which all major financial decisions are made at single command post omb has yearround responsibility in overseeing the expenditure of funds but after it has apportioned funds to agencies ombs role is necessarily limited and selective on any particular matter omb can intervene to influence the use of money but most expenditure decisions are made by the spending agency itself with little specific guidance from omb in decentralized environment for expenditure management agencies receiving appropriations and other financial resources from congress have primary responsibility to ensure the legality and propriety of expenditures agencies generally make their own determination on these matters but they sometimes consult with gao which serves as the principal accounting and auditing arm of the federal government in addition gao often undertakes studies and evaluations on its own initiative to determine whether financial resources have been managed in an appropriate and efficient manner box 8a lists the main financial management roles and responsibilities in the federal government spending available funds appropriated funds are not automatically available to agencies for their use key step in making these funds available is for omb to apportion them to spending agencies the antideficiency act requires that appropriated funds be apportioned among time periods usually quarters during the fiscal year or among the projects on which the funds are to be spent in order for them to become available for obligation the purpose of the apportionment process is to prevent agencies from spending at rate that would exhaust their appropriations before the fiscal year has been completed in some instances such as for national defense and some other emergencies the antideficiency act permits apportionment at rate that would necessitate additional appropriations the apportionment process is managed by omb using the standard form excerpted in exhibit 8a agency requests for

reported to congress under the procedures of the impoundment control act of 1974 discussed below key requirement of expenditure management is that funds be used only for the purposes for which they were provided this requirement is embodied in number of statutes excerpts of which are presented in box 8b which provide that expenditures and obligations may not exceed the appropriated amounts and that funds shall be applied only to the objects for which they were appropriated another fundamental tenet is that funds be used only for public purposes the distinction between public and private is not always clear and gao sometimes is called upon to render decision on whether particular expenditure is allowable see exhibit 8b the obligation of funds is key point in expenditure management an obligation represents legal commitment by an agency of the government to another party as shown in box 8c each obligation has to be supported by documents attesting to the commitment of funds once the goods or services for which the funds have been obligated have been provided the ensuing outlay normally is matter of administrative routine obligated funds carry over from year to year even when the appropriation is made for single fiscal year although they are not usually an effective point of financial control outlays are an essential part of the financial management process for one thing the timing of outlays is important for cash and debt management by the treasury department for another the difference between outlays and receipts determines the size of the budget deficit or surplus as concern over the budget deficit deepened in the 1980s and early 1990s closer attention was paid to the volume of outlays some httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs143 decision the comptroller general of the

performing his official duties is authorized from appropriated funds the facts briefly stated are as follows the employee has worked for the department of the navy since 1966 he is 66 in height and weighs about 330 pounds since the inception of his employment with the navy due to his height and weight he has broken approximately 15 normal office chairs the chairs usually bend or break and have to be discarded the cost of each chair is about 200 in addition the employee has medical condition that is aggravated by the narrowness and shallowness of the seat of the normal office chair which does not provide adequate support for his thighs and cuts off the circulation of blood in his legsexhibit 8b gao decisions on the legality of expenditure 1 the com ptroller general head of gao is often asked to rule whether appropriated funds may be used for specific purpose in deciding on the legality of proposed expenditure the comptroller general may have to analyze the purpose for which the funds are to be used if he finds private purposesuch as providing employees with special equipment which would benefit only themthe expenditure would be disallowed if he finds as in this case that reasonable public purpose would be served the expenditure would be permitted 2 agencies may rely on the decisions of the comptroller general and one ruling may establish precedent for later cases which present similar issues agencies do not refer every question to the comptroller general they often interpret previous rulings or rely on their own interpretation of an appropriations legislative

of how the requested funds are to be spent if an agency wants to spend for somewhat different purposes within the same account than were submitted to the appropriations committees it reprograms the moneythat is it shifts funds from one project or activity to another within the same account shift between appropriations accounts is transfer and may be done only pursuant to statutory authorityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs145 reprogrammings are not always easy to define in the course of managing their expenditures agencies often make minor adjustments in the use of funds they may experience higherthanexpected vacancy rate and shift some funds budgeted for personnel expenses to other objects such as consultants or office equipment many such adjustments are made without bringing into play formal reprogramming procedures nevertheless reprogramming would occur if the shift were from one activity to another or if the pattern of expenditure deviated from that set forth in the appropriations committee report many perhaps most specific items of expenditure are not noted in these reports hence an agency may have somewhat more discretion in making minor adjustments but when report directs that particular expenditure be made the spending agency would probably go through the reprogramming process in the unlikely event it proposed to use the funds for different purpose reprogramming rules and procedures vary among appropriations subcommittees and federal agencies in some instances only the relevant appropriations subcommittees are drawn into the process in others the authorizing committees also participate some reprogrammings require advance approval by the participating congressional committees for others the relevant committees must be notified in advance and the reprogramming takes effect after waiting period if they do not object in still others congress is notified of reprogrammings but it takes action on them reprogramming rules often are set forth in the reports accompanying appropriations bills in some cases the rules are incorporated into the act itself exhibit 8c deals with reprogramming rules for the commerce department closing accounts the final step in the spending process other than the payment of funds which normally is routine operation is the closing of appropriation and fund accounts once an account is closed all remaining balances are canceled and it is longer available for obligation or expenditure the procedures for closing accounts were substantially revised by public law 101510 enacted in 1990 under the old procedures when an appropriation expired after the period during which it was available for obligation ended remaining obligated and unobligated balances retained their fiscal year identity for another two years after this time remaining balances lost their fiscal year identity and separate accounts were longer maintained for them obligated balances were transferred to an m account and remained available indefinitely to pay previou sly recorded obligations unobligated balances were transferred to merged surplus authority accounts maintained by the treasury departme nt and were available to cover adjustments in obligations under the new system which terminated the m accounts and the merged surplus authority accounts when the period during which funds are available for obligation ends the account expires but all obligated and unobligated balances retain their fiscal year identity for an additional five years during this fiveyear period obligated balances are available to liquidate obligations chargeable to that account while unobliga ted balances are available for adjustments in obligations or expenditures at the end of five years the account is closed and all remaining balances are canceled from this point up to one percent of unexpired httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs146 sec 605 none of the funds provided under this act or provided under previous

reprogramming occurs when an agency shifts funds from one program or purpose to another within the same appropriation account shift of funds between accounts constitutes transfer 2 there are governmentwide rules for reprogramming the rules vary among appropriations subcommittees and sometimes the authoriz ing committees which often include their reprogramming rules in the reports accompanying the appropriations bills but sometimes include them in the acts themselves each agency has its own procedures for initiating these actions and submitting them to congress for review 3 in the case of the com merce department from which this exhibit is drawn the appropriations subcommittees placed reprogramming rules in the annual appropriations act the rules in section 605a of the act bar actions that would among other things create new programs terminate existing program s or relocate offices or employees without prior notification to the house and senate appropriations committees the committees must also be notified when reprogrammings would exceed 500 thousand or 10 threshold source public law 105119 commercejusticestate appropriations act for fiscal year 1998 november 26

appropriate new funds or provide other legislative authority to pay old obligations impoundment although an appropriation limits the amounts that can be spent it also establishes the expectation that the available funds will be used to carry out authorized activities hence when an agency fails to use all or part of an appropriation it deviates from the intentions of congress the impoundment control act of 1974 title x of the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 as amended prescribes rules and procedures for instances in which available funds are impounded an impoundment is an action or inaction by the president or federal agency that delays or withholds the obligation or expenditure of budget authority provided in law the impoundment control act of 1974 divides impoundments into two categories and establishes distinct procedures for each deferral delays the use of funds rescission is presidential request that congress rescind cancel an appropriation or other form of budget authority deferral and rescission are exclusive and comprehensive categories an impoundment is either rescission or deferralit cannot be both or something else although impoundments are defined broadly by the impoundment control act of 1974 in practice they are limited to major actions which affect the level or rate of expenditure if every action or inactionthe phrase used in the impoundment control act of 1974that slowed the rate of expenditure were deemed to be an impoundment there probably would be many thousands of impoundments each year in fact at most only few hundred are reported as general practice only deliberate curtailments of expenditure are reported as impoundments actions having other purposes which incidently affect the rate of spending are not recorded as impoundments for example if an agency were to delay the award of contract because of dispute with vendor the delay would not be an impoundment if the delay were for the purpose of reducing expenditure it would be an impoundment the line between routine administrative actions and impoundments is not clear and controversy occasionally arises as to whether particular action constitutes an impoundment particularly difficulttoidentify impoundment occurs when the rate or level of spending is deliberately slowed through indirect administrative means for example if an agency cuts the size of the staff processing grant applications it might spend less on grants than the amount provided by congress even if it does not expressly impound the funds these actions have come to be known as facto impoundments rescissions to propose rescission the president must submit message to congress specifying the amount to be rescinded the accounts and programs involved the estimated fiscal and program effects and the reasons for the rescission multiple rescissions can be grouped in single message after the message has been submitted to it congress has 45 days of continuous session usually larger number of calendar days during which it can pass rescission bill congress may rescind all part or none of the amount proposed by the presidenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720crs148 if congress does not approve rescission in legislation by the expiration of this period the president must make the funds available for obligation and expenditure if the president fails to release funds at the expiration of the 45day period for proposed rescissions the comptroller general may bring suit to compel their release this has been rare occurrence however the rescission process has both similarities to and differences with the lineitem veto process invalidated by the supreme court in both the president proposes to cancel appropriations enacted into law but unlike the lineitem veto which had to be initiated within five days after the president signed an appropriations act the rescission process operates throughout the year and unlike lineitem veto which cancels an appropriation unless the cancellation is disapproved by congress rescission takes effect only if it is approved by congress thus if congress fails to act lineitem veto would be effective but proposed rescission would lapse deferrals to defer funds the president submits message to congress setting forth the amount the affected account and program the reasons for the deferral the estimated fiscal and program effects and the period of time during which the funds are to be deferred an excerpt from such message in presented in exhibit 8d the president may not propose deferral for period of time beyond the end of the fiscal year nor may he propose deferral that would cause the funds to lapse or otherwise prevent an agency from spending appropriated funds prudently in accounts where unobligated funds remain available beyond the fiscal year the president may defer the funds again in the next fiscal year at present the president may defer only for the reasons set forth in the antideficiency act including to provide for contingencies to achieve savings made possible by or through changes in requireme nts or greater efficiency of operations and as specifically provided by law he may not defer funds for policy reasons for example to curtail overall federal spending or because he is opposed to particular program the comptroller general reviews all proposed rescissions and deferrals and advises congress of their legality and possible budgetary and program effects the comptroller general also notifies congress of any rescission or deferral not reported by the president and he may reclassify an improperly classified impoundment exhibit 8e contains an excerpt from report of the comptroller general in all cases notification to congress by the comptroller

course of operating its programs federal agency takes many actions affecting its financial condition to ensure that resources are properly and efficiently used an agency must be informed of the financial implications of its actions and the status of budgeted resources it must know for example the amount of appropriated funds that have already been obligated and the amount of unobligated funds that may be carried over to the next fiscal year it also must establish practices and procedures governing how its resources are used these practices and procedures comprise the financial management systems of federal agencies broadly conceived financial management extends beyond the purely financial operations of an agency to its capacity to perform the tasks required of it with the resources provided by congress omb has defined financial management to include all systems that 1 collect analyze and report data for financial decisionmaki ng 2 process control and account for financial transactions and resources and 3 generate financial information in support of an agencys mission financial management reaches to budget formulation and implementation accounting and information systems property and inventory control personnel and payroll systems and the management of grants contracts and purchases some of the laws governing federal financial management were enacted during the 19th century when the government was much smaller others date back to the early years of federal budgeting in the 1920s still others to the postwar period during the 1950s when management practices and concepts were adapted to much enlarged federal government dozen major laws affecting financial management have been enacted since 1978 some of these are briefly described in box 8d the two most important of these laws are the chief financial officers act of 1990 see exhibit 8f and the government performance and results act of 1993 see box 8e box 8d lists these laws in chronological order it shows clear difference between the earlier laws on the list and the more recent ones the earlier laws were designed to identify and eliminate wrongdoing and inadequ acies in financial management the later laws have been designed to establish systems and procedures that promote efficiency in federal operations these recent laws set forth two basic requirementsthat agencies maintain accounting and other information systems that provide timely and reliable information and that they maintain systems of management accountability and control to ensure that resources are properly and prudently used their information systems determine what agencies know and report about their operations and whether they are sufficiently informed to take corrective action when problems

of basic data on an agencys financial condition and operations as indicated by the title of the 1921 law that established the presidential budget system at one time budgeting and accounting were integrated activities that shared the same database and operated in close relation to one another the budget was plan of expenditures for future fiscal period the accounting system reported on expenditures during past period in this integrated relationship the accounting system fed financial information to budget makers and the budget fed data to those who compiled financial statements over time however the two activities drifted apart and accounting came to be viewed as specialized activity that was isolated from the overall management of an agency moreover budget systems accumulated conventions and practices on the treatment of revenue and expenditure that differed in some key aspects from the way they were recorded in financial statements many federal agencies relied on budgetary information systems rather than accounting data to prepare budget requests modern financial management reintegrates accounting and budgeting and views them as connected interdependent consistent processes this reintegration was the main objective of the chief financial officers act of 1990 see box 8e which directs omb to develop fiveyear plan for improving financial management and assigns agency chief financial officers cfos broad responsibility for overseeing financial systems key part of this development is changed perspective on accounting systems rather than being isolated accounting is now viewed as vital part of each agencys managerial capacity in line with this broad managerial orientation substantial effort has been made in recent years to upgrade and modernize federal accounting systems these efforts have led to important progress in developing accounting principles and standards integrating accounting with other financial management activities and reporting on financial condition standardization of accounting systems from about 1950 to 1980 accounting was highly decentralized agencies were encouraged to install accounting systems that served their particular needs and within big departments individual bureaus and operating units also were permitted to design their own specialized systems decentralization led to extreme fragmentation with the federal government operating hundreds of separate systems that were unable to communicate with one another it was not uncommon for the various systems to record transactions inconsistently and for the accounts maintained at the bureau level to be incompatible with those maintained by the department within this fragmented arrangement gao took the lead in prescribing governmentwide accounting standards and in certifying agency compliance with these standards from time to time gao reviewed agency accounting systemsit generally did not audit particular transactions leaving this responsibility to the agencies and their inspectors general but gao was not the sole participant in the account field as displayed in box 8a responsibility for financial manage ment is shared with the

but each took the position that it had the authority to promulgate accounting standards with passage of the chief financial officers act however the three agencies recognized need to set aside their differences and cooperate in developing accounting standards that would enable federal entities to prepare auditable financial statements accordingly gao the treasury department and omb established the federal accounting standards advisory board fasab and agreed that each would accept and issue accounting standards recommended by fasab during the 1990s fasab has devised and omb has issued series of statements of federal financial accounting standards sffas the major standards are listed in box 8f note that the initial standards are broad statements of principle while the later standards apply

supplement core requirements with accounting practices and reports that meet their particular needs these customized features are important to make accounting useful for managerial purposes financial management for agencies traditionally financial management has served external requirements such as those concerning the legal basis of expenditure for this limited purpose it sufficed to account for federal finances in terms of obligations authorized or incurred budget authority and cash received or paid out receipts and outlays accounting for obligations is essential to ensure that funds are spent properly while accounting for cash is essential for the treasury departments management of the governments debt operations in addition to these external requirements an agency needs timely and accurate financial data to manage its own operations efficiently two steps have been taken to make accounting systems more useful for agency management one has been to integrate accounting with other financial management activitie s and the agencys management information systems the second step has been to supplement accounting for obligations and cash with costbased or accrualbased accounts the cost basis is compared to alternative methods of accounting in exhibit 8h the main differences between traditional practices and costbased accounting arise when obligations or outlays occur in one fiscal period but the cost is incurred in another period this situation commonly occurs in procurement and construction programs certain credit programs and in programs which maintain large variable inventories costbased budget records costs in terms of the goods and services consumed by each activity this type of budget is useful in measuring the cost of providing service or carrying out an activity it sensitizes managers to their responsibility for controlling expenses and in improving the efficiency of operations costbased budgets have made it possible for federal agencies to apply cost accounting techniques in managing their operations relationship to the budget process as noted previously the budget and accounting act of 1921 conceived of accounting and budgeting as interdependent process with decisions made in the budget providing the basis for the accounting structure and the information collected by the accounting system providing basis for new budget decisions but as also noted over the years accounting and budgeting drifted apart typically they were assigned to different organizational units and there was little contact between them during the 1990s however significant progres s has been made in linking the two processes the key development has been the establishment of chief financial officer in 24 federal departments and agencies as prescribed by the chief financial officers act of 1990 each cfo is to report to the head of the agency regarding all financial management matters the cfos responsibilities vary somewhat among agencies but they generally include developing and maintaining an integrated accounting and financial managem ent system overseeing all financial management activities relating to programs and operations of

that each agency should have the primary responsibility for ensuring that its resources are used properly and efficiently the term management control generally has replaced the term internal control although the latter still is used in various documents and reports while the two terms sometimes are used interchangeably management control conveys broader sense of the responsibility of federal managers for the resources they use and the results achieved the federal managers financial integrity act requires each agency to establish management accountability and control systems in accordance with standards prescribed by the comptroller general which provide reasonable assurance that 1 obligations and costs are in compliance with applicable law 2 funds property and other assets are safeguarded against waste loss or abuse and 3 revenues and expenditures are properly recorded the term internal control refers to the procedures used by agencies to ensure that established policies with respect to financial management are followed the comptroller general has defined internal control as the plan of organization and methods and procedures adopted by management to ensure that resource use is consistent with laws regulations and policies that resources are safeguarded against waste loss and misuse and that reliable data are obtained maintained and fairly disclosed in reports omb circular a123 excerpted in exhibit 8i sets forth policies and procedures to be followed by federal agencies in establishing and reporting on their management accountability and control systems these guidelines require each agency to develop management control plan that assesses the risk of various activities to waste or loss and to identify material weaknesses in their internal control systems furthermore agencies must periodically evaluate their management accountability and control systems and take corrective action when necessary in addition to agency selfevaluations gao

integrity of controls gao has set forth number of criteria that recognize that not all shortcomings entail the same degree of risk in assessing whether problem constitutes material weakness gao

integrity act consolidated financial statements improvements in accounting and financial management culminated in 1998 with the issuance of the first audited financial statements covering the entire federal government although the auditors found numerous gaps and shortcomings in the statements their publication marked big step forward in applying accounting standards to report on the financial operations and condition of the federal government the requirement of published financial statements is embedded in the constitution which provides in article i section 9 that regular statement of account of the receipts and expenditures of all public money shall be published from time to time over the years the treasury department has met this requirement by publishing an annual report on receipts and outlays the report did not include information on the assets and liabilities of the government nor was it prepared in accord with accepted accounting principles two developments during the 1990s advanced the idea of true financial statements for the federal government one was the work of the financial accounting standards advisory board fasab the other was the government management reform act of 1994 by 1997 fasab had completed the basic of accounting standards giving the federal government for the first time in its history the means by which to measure and report on its financial position and results the 1994 law extended the requirement of audited financial statements to all departments and major agencies and called for audited statements covering the entire federal government to be published beginning with fy1997 the new governmentwide financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis hence reported costs do not match budgeted expenditures the statements reported that at the end of fy1997 the federal government has assets of 16 trillion and liabilities of 66 trillion but the assets did not include the value of public lands or the federal governments taxing power in auditing the statements gao concluded that because of significant weaknesses in financial systems incomplete documentation and weak internal control and other deficiencies the government was unable to accurately report large portion of its assets liabilities and costs the quality of these statements is expected to improve rapidly now that it has been demonstrated that it is possible to produce governmentwide reports improving government performance the value of financial information depends on the use to which it is put if it is produced only to satisfy external reporting requirements there may be some benefit in improved accountability but if the information is used by managers to measure and assess costs to determine how resources should be deployed and to restructure operations then the payoff will come in higher organizational efficiency potentially important advance in using the budget to promote efficiency was taken by the government performance and results act gpra of 1993 the main provisions of this act are set forth in box 8f they call for sequence of actions by federal agencies beginning with the development of performance measures early inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720the 1990s leading to agency strategic plans later in the decade and concluding with agency and governmentwide performance plans linked to budget submissions at the end of the decade beyond this agencies are to develop new performance plans annually based on the existing or revised longerterm strategic plans agency strategic plans must have six critical components 1 comprehensive mission statement that explains why the agency exists and what it does 2 agencywide longterm goals and objectives for the next five years or longer that explain the results expected from each major function and when to expect those results 3 approaches or strategies to be employed by the agency in pursuing its objectives including the resources needed to reach specified goals 4 an explanation of the relationship between the agencys longterm goals and its annual performance goals expressed in measurable terms so that actual results can be compared to plans 5 identification of key factors beyond the agencys control that could significantly affect achieveme nt of its strategic goals and 6 description of how program evaluations were used to define strategic goals and schedule of future evaluations gpra requires agencies to consult with congress during preparation of their strategic plans in 1997 the house majority leadership established special teams to oversee implementation of the act the first batch of strategic plans were submitted by september 30 1997 updates are required every three years at the behest of various congressional committees gao has assessed the strategic plans and concluded that they do not yet define strategic direction for agencies to take in setting goals and measuring performance in gaos view the early strategic plans should be regarded as only the starting points for the broad transformation that is needed to implement performancebased management the next step in the gpra process the submission of annual performance plans to omb by federal agencies on the basis of these agency plans omb beginning with the fy1999 budget cycle must include federal performance plan in the presidents budget agency plans must specify goals that define the performance to be achieved express the goals in an objective quantifiable and measurable form describe the operational processes and resources required to achieve the goals specify performance indicators to be used in measuring or assessing outputs and provide basis for comparing actual results with program goals the culmination of the gpra process may be the introduction of performance based budgets in which level of resources is explicitly linked to level of outputs this form of budgeting was tried in the 1950s and 1960s with little success it is too early to know whether the outcome will be more favorable this time but if it is it will be because developments in financial management and new culture of performance management has created the conditions under which the allocation of resources can be based on actual or planned results rather than on agency demandshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98720appendix how to obtain publications exhibited in
