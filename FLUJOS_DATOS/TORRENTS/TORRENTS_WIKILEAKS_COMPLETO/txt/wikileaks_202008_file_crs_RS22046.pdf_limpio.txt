control nd price support farmers are longer constrained as to who can produce tobacco where it can be grown how much can be marketed or how low the farm price can go in their prebuyout analyses tobacco economists anticipated rapid consolida tion of tobacco production onto substantially fewer but larger farms located in the most economical regions total us tobacco production was expected to increase1httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22046crs2 the tobacco quota buyout campaign gained mo mentum after farmers were joined by some antismoking and public health advocates as well as the philip morris usa cigarette manufacturing company seekin g new authority for the food and drug administration fda to regu late tobacco products the fda authority was introduced as s 2461 dewinekennedy and hr 4433 tom daviswaxman in the 108th congress legislative conferees on hr 4520 did not adopt the fda provisions though the provisions had been included in the sena version of the bill there was opposition from some cigarette manufacturers to the fda provisions and from those in congress opposed to giving the federal government expanded regulatory authority over private businesses payments to tobacco quota holders tobacco quota holder was defined as the owner as of october 22 2004 of farm with basic tobacco marketing quota or t obacco acreage allotment for the 2004 marketing year each quota holder received contr act obligating the usdas commodity credit corporation ccc tobacco trust fund to pa 7lb on the basic quota level established for the farm for the 2002 marketing year the payments would be made in 10 equal annual installments of 070lb for those ki nds of tobacco where the farm quota was specified in acres 2002 poundage equivalent was calculated using the county average yield for the 20012003 crop years in 2002 the national basic quota amounted to about 959 million pounds so payments to quota owners could amount to 67 billion according to usdas farm service agency fsa data there were about 415750 tobacco quota owners in 1999 there were 56977 farms producing tobacco in 2002 according to the census of agriculture and almost all of these farm ope rators also were owners of quota thus approximately 358000 nonoperator ndlords could receive quota buyout payments along with the nearly 57000 farm operators payments to producers of quota tobacco active tobacco producers received contract obligating the ccc to pay 3lb on the effective farm marketing quota for the 2002 ma rketing year for those kinds of tobacco where the effective farm quota was specifi ed in acres 2002 poundage equivalent was calculated using the average yield on the fa rm for the 20012003 crop years farmer who produced quota tobacco in each of the 20022004 marketing years would receive the full 3lb payment the payments would be made in 10 equal annual installments of 030lb for each of the thr ee base years the farmer did not produce tobacco the payment is reduced by onethird in 2002 the national effective quota am ounted to about 970 million pounds hence payments to quota owners could amount to 29 billion which could be divided among approximately 57000 producers obtaining lump sum payments provisions were made in the law allowing contract payment recipients to assign the annual payments to fina ncial institutions called successori ninterest transfers by fsahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22046crs3 this enables financial institu tions to make lump sum payments to the quota holders and active producers the financial institutions ar allowed to discount th contracts to cover their costs of borrowing as well as adminis trative overhead by regulation the maximum allowable discount rate is th prime rate on the first workday of each money plus 2 rounded to the nearest number ccc then makes the annual payments to the financial institutions to which the contracts have been assigned assessments on tobacco product manufacturers and importers the cost of the tobacco buyout is c overed by assessments on tobacco product manufacturers and tobacco produc t importers the assessments will be collected by the ccc on quarterly basis during each of the 10 fiscal years from fy2005 through fy2014 the assessments began with the calendar quarter ending december 31 2004 the amount to be collected each fiscal year is the amount needed to cover the years expenditures associated with the quota buy out program about 1 billion per year the assessments are apportioned according to the gross domestic volume share of the market held by each class of tobacco pr oduct by law the initial shares for fy2005 were as follows cigarettes 96331 cigars 2783 snuff 0539 rollyourown tobacco 0171 chewing tobacco 0111 pi pe tobacco 0066 each year the allocation will be changed to mirror shifts in market shares each manufacturer and importers pro rata share of the domestic market becomes its contribution to the total collection assessments and collections are done quarterly if domestic cigarette sales remain constant at the 2004 level of 194 billion packs th annual buyout program cost will amount to about 5 per pack subsequent to the 1998 mast er settlement agreement be tween the major cigarette manufacturers and the state attorneys general the manufacturers signed phase ii agreement to pay 515 billion to the tobacco pr oducing states the payments were to be made over 12year period corresponding to declining scale from 1999 through 2010 an estimated 20 billion in remaining phase ii obligations are now offset by the tobacco quota buyout assessments the states most dversely affected by the loss of phase ii payments will be pennsyl vania and maryland at about 93 million and 135 million respectively because these states will not receive quota buyout payments they receive buyout payments because many years ago the tobacco producers decided to forgo the federal tobacco subsidy program disposal of loan pool stocks farm market prices for usgrown tobacco in 2005 and subsequent years are expected to fall below the mandatory suppor t levels that applied to 2004 and previous crops therefore tobacco previously put under price support loan called loan pool stocks likely will not be sold at prices hi gh enough to cover the loan principal plus interest it also is possible that nonetco st funds previously collected from producers and leaf buyers will not be adequate to cover the losses the buyout legislation anticipates this development and specifies that such losse s in excess of funds previously set aside in the nonetcost accounts are to be covered by money from the tobacco trust fund ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22046crs4 detailed explanation of the previous support program is in crs report 95129 tobacco price support an over view of the program administration of the tob acco quota buyout program the tobacco quota buyout program is admi nistered by the fsa through the same network of county offices that administere d the tobacco price support program and the emergency tobacco loss payments the reco rds in these county offices are used to determine the distribution of payments so quota holders and pr oducers were required to complete applications with sufficient information to demonstrate each applicants rightful claim to payments the ccc established revolving tobacco trust fund to receive tobacco product assessments and to make quot owner and producer payments the tobacco trust fund also will reimburse the ccc for losses associated with the disposal of existing association loan pool stocks and inventories connected to prior price support activities total expenditures from the trust fund are limited to 1014 billion and must be completed by january 1 2015 tobacco quota holder and producer
