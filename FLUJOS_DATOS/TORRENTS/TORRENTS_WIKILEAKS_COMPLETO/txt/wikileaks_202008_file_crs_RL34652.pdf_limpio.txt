introduction the age discrimination in employment act adea of 19671 as amended seeks to address the longstanding problem of age discrimination in the workplace the adea which prohibits employment discrimination against persons over the age of 40 was enacted to promote employment of older persons based on their ability rather than age to prohibit arbitrary age discrimination in employment and to help employers and workers find ways of meeting problems arising from the impact of age on employment2 the adea makes it unlawful for an employer to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation terms cond itions or privileges of employment because of such individuals age3 the statute not only app lies to hiring discharge and promotion but also prohibits discrimin ation in employee benefit plans such as health coverage and pensions in additi on to employers the adea also applies to labor organizations and employment agencies after it was enacted the adea went through series of amendments to strengthen and expand its coverage of older employees originally the adea only covered employees between the ages of 40 and 65 eventually the upper age limit was extended to age 70 and then elimin ated altogether in 1978 enforcement authority of the adea was transferred from the department of labor to the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc4 ii requirements under the adea coverage employers the adea applies to employers who have twenty or more employees for each

adea pursuant to the congressional accountability act of 19959 in addition the term employer incl udes state and local governments10 despite the fact that the adea applies to state governments the united states supreme court in kimel v florida board of regents held that state employees could not sue states for monetary damages under the adea11 the court reasoned that states have sovereign immunity and are immune from suit unless the state consents or an exception applies while the kimel decision effectively eliminated the ability of state employees to bring suit for m onetary damages against states under the adea the act may still be enforced against states by the eeoc and state employees may still sue state officials for declaratory and injunctive relief in addition to employers labor organiza tions and employment agencies are also subject to the adea labor organization is covered by the adea if it exists for the purpose of dealing with employers concerning grievances labor disputes wages rates of pay hours or othe r terms or conditions of employment12 the adea defines labor organization as an entity that has hiring hall or is certified employee representative or if not

adea if the agency r egularly undertakes with or without compensation to provide em ployees for an employer14 employees in general the adea covers employees who are forty years of age and older15 because the statute prohibits discriminati on against individuals regarding any terms or conditions of employment the acts pr otections not only cove r employees but also extend to both applicants for employment nd discharged exemployees both private and public employees are generally covere d by the adea for example the adea applies to most federal employees and the congressi onal accountability act of 1995 extended the rights and protections of the adea to congressional employees16 state elected officials and their personal staff appointees and legal advisers are excluded from the definition of employee although st ate employees covered by civil service laws are considered employees despite the adeas exemption for the personal staff appointees and legal advisers of state officials such individuals may nevert heless be able to file age discrimination claims under separate law the govern ment employee rights act17 state officials remain exempt and therefore are not protected from age discrimination by either law18 the adea contains several notable excep tions to the prohibition against age discrimination for example although mandatory retiremen t policies generally constitute violation of the adea the statute permits employers to establish compulsory retirement for bona fide executive or high policymaker who has reached age 65 and is entitled to pension benefit of at least 4400019 under certain circumstances state and local governments may establish mandatory retirement requirements for their firefighte rs or law enforcement officers20 also exempt are federal civil

of the civil rights act the supreme court held that exemplo yees may sue for retaliation 519 us 337 1997 since the adea is closely modeled after title v ii former employees appear to be protected from retaliation under the adea as well 24 128 s ct 1931 2008enforcement officers nuclear materials c ouriers and customs and border protection officers21 although the adea did at one point c ontain an exception for tenured faculty at institutions of higher education that exception has expired currently however the adea does allow institutions of higher education to offer tenured employees who become eligible to retire supplem ental benefits to encourage them to voluntarily retire supplemen tal benefits are those be nefits above and beyond retirement or severance benef its generally offered to employees of the institution if certain requirements are met supplemental benefits may be reduced or eliminated on the basis of age without violating th adea however the adea continues to prohibit an institution from reducing or ceasing nonsupplemental benefits on the basis of age22 prohibited acts as noted above the adea applies to broad range of employment practices including discrimination because of age in hiring placement promotion demotion transfer termination and discipline because the stat ute prohibits age discrimination with respect to all terms and conditions of employment discrimination regarding salary leave and other benefits may also violate the act in addition the statute prohibits discrimination in referrals by employment agencies actions by unions and retaliation against employees for filing or participating in an adea claim or for opposing an employers discriminatory practices23 although the adea expressly prohibits re taliation in the private sector the statute is less clear with regard to re taliation involving age discrimination in the federal sector the supreme court however recently addressed this issue in gomez perez v potter holding that the adea does indeed prohibit retaliation in federal employment24 relying on precedents established in cases involving other anti discrimination statutes the court ruled that prohibition against retaliation is encompassed within the general prohibition against age discrimination in the federal sector because the statute covers individuals who are age forty or older younger employees are not protected from age discrimination indeed employers may engage in socalled reverse discrimination favoring employees over the age of forty without violating the statute furthermor the supreme court has held that the adea does not prohibit employers from discriminating against employees who arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34652crs5 25 gen dynamics land sys v cline 540 us 581 2004 26 id at 584 27 oconnor

employees are w ithin the protected class ie age forty or older26 in contrast the court has separately held th at the adea does prohibit discrimination against older employees in favor of younger employees who are older than forty years old27 before entering an employment relations hip with their workers most employers advertise the job opening as result such advertisements are subject to the adea which prohibits advertisements that contai n age preferences unless age is bona fide occupational qualification fo r the position advertised28 according to the eeocs regulations advertisements that contain phrases such as age 25 to 35 young college student recent college graduate boy girl or similar terms are prohibited under the act unless an exception applies even phrases that favor some members of the class but discriminate against others is prohibited such as age 40 to 50 age over 65 retired pers on or supplement your pension29 on the other hand the request for the age or date of birth of an applicant on an employment application or use of the phrase state age on want ad is not automatically violation because there may be legitimate reasons for requesting the age or date of birth of an applicant30 however the eeoc will closely scrutinize the application to assure that the request is for per missible purpose and not for purposes proscribed by the act31 defenses and exceptions the adea provides several defenses for employers these available defenses attempt to strike balance between the ab ility of employers to conduct their business and the interest of the government in eliminating age discrimination in employment under one prominent exception an empl oyer will not be deemed to have violated the act when the action taken ag ainst an employee is due to bona fide occupational qualification b foq reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the particular business32 according to the supreme court the bfoq must be more than convenient or reasonable

the court considered whether afteracquired evidence of employee misconduct would bar an adea claim the court held that afteracquired evidence wh ich if discovered would have led to the employees

to vest under his em ployers pension plan which allowed vesting after ten years of service although the court held that firing an employee to prevent vesting is actionable under the employees retirement in come security act erisa 29 usc 1001 et seq such firing would not constitute di scriminatory treatment on the basis of age even though an employees years of service may be highly correlated with age biggens 507 us at 612 however the court did not addr ess the possibility of pension status being used as proxy for age if vesting were based on an employees age then firing an employee to avoid vesting could possibly result in liability under both the adea and erisa id at 613 likewise if an employer uses cost factors such as pension status or high salary as proxy for age then an adea violation may occur 38 128 s ct 2361 2008particular business33 under this narrow interpretati on an employer must justify an agebased employment requirement by monstrating 1 that the requirement is reasonably necessary to the essence of its business and 2 that an individualized approach would be pointless or impractical the second prong of this test can be established in one of two ways first the employer may show that it had factual basis for believing that persons over certa in age would be unable to perform the job safely in the alternative the employer may show that age was legitimate proxy for the safetyrelated job qualifications by pr oving that it is impossible or highly impractical to deal with the older employees on an individualized basis34 although employers have attempted to use the bfoq fense in wide variety of occupations jobrelated age requirements have tended to be more ccessful when the position in question such as airline pilot or law enfo rcement officer may affect public safety another defense to charge of age discrimination may apply if the differentiation is based on reasonable factors other than age rfota35 similarly disciplining or discharging an employee fo r good cause also constitutes defense to the act36 in both of these defenses an employer asserts that its adverse action did not involve age discrimination but rather was based on some other factor such factors may include job performance business cutb acks or lack of qualifications among others in addition the court has held th at employers may without violating the adea make employment decisions based on cost factors that are highly correlated with age such as pensions or high salari as long as their actions are not actually based on age37 indeed in kentucky retirement systems v equal employment opportunity commission 38 the supreme court recently upheld state retirement plan that imputed additional years of service to employees who became disabled before becoming eligible for retirement at age 55 but did not for purposes of calculating pensions impute additional years of service to employees who became disabled afterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34652crs7

623f2b in public employees retirement system of ohio v betts the court rejected the equal benefits or equal costs principle hol ding that bona fide employee benefit plan was permissible under the adea unless an employee could establish that adoption of the plan was subterfu ge for discrimination 492 us 158 1989 the older workers protection act pl 101433 which amended the adea restored the use of

held that the retirement plan which treated employees differently based on their pension status was designed to provide pension benefits to disabled employees and was not actually motivated by age thus the court ruled that the retirement plan did not violate the adea39 under the adea it is also permissible fo r an employer to take action pursuant to bona fide seniority system or em ployee benefit plan although neither the seniority system nor the benefit plan ma require mandatory retirement of employees because of age40 however the adea explicitly allows voluntary early retirement as an incentive of employee benefit plans in addition bona fide employee benefit plan must satisfy the equal cost equal benefit principle that provides parity between the amount employers spend on benef its for older and younger workers41 if it costs more to provide the same benefit to the pr otected class the employer has the option of paying the same amount for benefits of the protected class as it does for employees outside of the protected class this is so even if it results in workers in the protected class receiving fewer benefits however employers may not pay less for benefits of members of the protected class than they pay for younger employees recently there has been debate over the extent to which the equal benefits or equal costs principle shoul d be applied to retired empl oyees in order to cut costs some employers have sought to provide one level of hea lth benefits to retirees under age 65 to cover them until they are eligible for medicare and then reduce or eliminate the benefit when the retiree becomes medicare eligible in erie county retirees assn v county of erie 42 the court of appeals for the third circuit ruled that the adea applies to retirees and held that the practice of providing different benefits to older and younger retirees based on thei r eligibility for medicare constitutes age discrimination in violation of the act b ecause medicare eligibility is an explicitly agerelated factor fearing that employers might reduce or eliminate benefits for all retirees rather than increase benefits for older medicareeligible retirees the eeoc which exercised

health benefits for retirees when the participant becomes eligible for medicare or comparable state health benefits44 finally as noted above the adea pe rmits employers to impose mandatory retirement with respect to certain categories of employees such as executives and high policymakers as well as firefi ghters and law enforcement officers disparate treatment vs disparate impact when bringing civil case alleging em ployment discrimination there are two types of claims that plaintiff can make disparate treatment and disparate impact disparate treatment occurs when an employer intentionally discriminates against an employee or enacts policy with the intent to treat or affect the employee differently from others because of the employees age such disparate treatment claims require proof that the employer intended to discriminate against the complaining party when it took the challenged employment action in tent the critical elem ent of disparate treatment claim may be shown directly eg by discriminatory statements or behavior of supervisor towards s ubordinate or perhaps more likely by circumstantial evidence meanwhile disparate impact occurs when the employers acts or policies are facially neutral but have an adverse impact on class of employees and are not otherwise reasonable unlike disparate treatment claims disparate impact claims may be established without proof of discriminatory intent relie ving the victim of an often insurmountable burden although the adea clearly allows disparate treatment claims it was for many years unclear whether an employee may recover under disparate impact theory which led to confusion for litigants and lower courts alike45 in 2005 however the supreme court held in smith v city of jackson that the adea does indeed authorize disparate impact claims46 over the years the courts have deve loped complicated set of rules and procedures that govern how disparate treatment and disparate impact claims arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34652crs9 47 under the adea plaintiffs may also bring separate type of disparate treatment claim akin to title vii pattern or practice suits which involve habitual discriminatory actions on the part of the employer such class acti on claims carry heavy evidentiary burden that follow different rules of proof see eg in tl bhd of teamsters v united states 431 us

509 us 502 1993 in hicks the supreme court revisited the burden of proof scheme established by mcdonnell douglas and burdine holding that it is not enough for the plaintiff to show that the employers proffered reason was false the plaintiff must show that the em ployers proffered reason is both false and that the employers actions were motivated by discrimination in reeves v sanderson plumbing products inc the court emphasized that plaintiffs prima facie case of age discrimination combined with sufficient evidence to find that the employers asserted justification for its action was false may perm it the trier of fact to conclude that the employer unlawfully discriminated and the pl aintiff need not always introduce additional and independent evidence of di scrimination 530 us 133 14849 2000 53 burdine 450 us 248 255256 1981adjudicated many of the cases in which these rules have evolved are title vii cases but their reasoning typically applies in the adea context as well these rules which differ depending on the type of cl aim involved are discussed below proving disparate treatment claim in general the courts evaluate indivi dual disparate treatme nt claims under the adea in one of two ways47 when direct evidence of discrimination is lacking plaintiffs are generally subject to the bur denshifting framework established by the supreme court in mcdonnell douglas v green and texas dept of community affairs v burdine 48 when the plaintiff has direct evidence of age discrimination use of the mcdonnell douglas burdenshifting m odel is unnecessary49 and courts tend to rely instead on the mixed motive framework established by the court in price waterhouse v hopkins 50 under the mcdonnell douglas burdenshifting framework plaintiff must first establish prima facie case meaning that plaintiff must allege facts that are adequate to support legal claim once plaintiff by preponderance of the evidence establishes prima facie case th the burden of production shifts to the employer to articulate some leg itimate nondiscriminatory reason for the employees rejection51 if the employer successfully rebuts the employees prima facie case by articulating such reason th the employee may still prevail if he can show that the employers defense is merely pretext and that the employers behavior was actually motivated by discrimination52 while the burden of production shifts to the employer to rebut the employees prima facie case the burden of persuasion remains on the plaintiff at all times53httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34652crs10 54 mcdonnell douglas 411 us at 802 55 the plaintiff must show that age was mo tivating factor in the employers decision but does not have to show that it was the only fa ctor kralman v illinoi s dept of veterans affairs 23 f3d 150 7th cir 1994 cert deni ed 513 us 948 1994 56 for example in discharge cases the court has held that prima facie case of age discrimination does not require plaintiff to monstrate that he or she was replaced by person outside of the protected age cla ss rather replacement by someone who is substantially younger even if that person is also member of the protected class may be sufficient for the plaintiff to demonstrat that he was replaced because of his age oconnor v consol coin cate rers corp 517 us 308 1996 57 128 s ct 1140 2008 58 id at 1147because the mcdonnell douglas framework was originally established in title vii case involving failure to hire there has been some confusion among the courts when applying this model to adea claims particularly when it comes to defining what constitutes prima facie case of ag discrimination under the facts in the mcdonnell douglas case prima facie case would be established when the plaintiff showed 1 that he belongs to raci minority 2 that he applied and was qualified for job for which the employer was seeking applicants 3 that despite his qualifications he was re jected and 4 that after his rejection the position remained open and the employer continue d to seek applicants from persons of complainants qualifications54 as adapted to the adea context therefore plaintiff generally must show that he or she is member of the protected age group that he or she was adversely affected by an employment action and that such action was taken because of the employees age in order to establish prima facie case of age discrimination55 however because the elements of prima facie case may vary somewhat depending on the type of employ ment action that wa s taken eg failure to hire discharge demotion compensati on etc pl aintiff may have to make additional or more specific showings in order to establish prima facie case56 as noted above if an employer rebuts th plaintiffs prima f acie case by offering legitimate nondisc riminatory reason for its employme nt action then the plaintiff must establish that the employers reason is pretext for discrimination plaintiff may show pretext in variety of ways such as offering statistical evidence proof of discriminatory statements by an employ er or evidence of harassment although presentation of such evidence does not guaran tee that the plaintiff will be successful in addition plaintiff may in some cases demonstrate pretext by offering evidence of discrimination against other employees indeed in sprintunited management company v mendelsohn 57 the plaintiff attempted to introduce testimony by several former employees who claimed they had suffered age discrimination at the hands of their supervisors even though those supe rvisors worked in another part of the company and were not involved in any discriminatory action taken against the plaintiff noting that the question whether evidence of discrimination by other supervisors is relevant in an individua l adea case is fact based and depends on many factors the supreme court held that such evidence is neither per admissible nor per inadmissible and ther efore the district court should determine the admissibility of such evidence on case by case basis58 because many lowerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34652crs11 59 smith v city of jackson 544 us 228 2005 60 idcourts had been excluding such evidence the courts decision is expected to benefit employees who want to introduce coworker evidence in future cases in contrast to the mcdonnell douglas model which is typically used in cases in which direct evidence of discrimination is lacking courts may instead evaluate disparate treatment claims under the price waterhouse mixed motive framework mixed motive cases which involve employme nt actions that are based on mix of discriminatory and nondi scriminatory reasons require plaintiff to provide direct evidence demonstrating that age discrimin ation was substantial factor in the employers action at that point the burde n shifts to the employer who must prove that it would have made the same decision regardless of the discriminatory motive if the employer fails to make this showing it will be held liable the differences between mcdonnell douglas pretext case and price waterhouse mixed motives case are significant for several reasons first under the mcdonnell douglas framework the burden of persua sion remains on the plaintiff at all times because the plaintiff bears the bur den of demonstrating pretext in response to an employers articulation of nondiscriminatory reason for the employment action under the price waterhouse framework however th burden of persuasion ultimately lands on the employer who must prove that it would have made the same employment decision even in the absence of the discriminatory motive second the types of evidence that plaintiffs are required to produce differ somewhat in pretext case an inference of discrimination ma be made even though the plaintiffs evidence of age discrimination is not be very strong while mixed motive cases require direct evidence of such discrimination proving disparate impact claim as noted above the supreme court has clarified that plaintiffs may bring disparate impact claims under the adea r easoning that the adea is analogous to title vii under which disparate impact claims are authorized59 the process for bringing such claims however differs from the process for proving disparate treatment claim in additi on because of differences between the adea and title vii plaintiffs who decide to pursue disparate impact claims under the adea must comply with rules of proof that differ from the rules that govern disparate impact claims under title vii in order to bring disparate impact cla im under the adea plaintiff must first establish prima facie case of age discr imination by demonstrating that given employment practice has disparate impact on members of the protected class at this stage plaintiff must identify the specific employment practice that is responsible for the disparate impact60 the employer may then rebut the prima facie case by showing that the adverse impact was attributable to reasonable factor other than age requirement based on the st atutory provision that exempts otherwise prohibited employment actions that are ba sed on reasonable factor other than agehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34652crs12

federal courts regarding the question of whether it is the employee or employer who bears the burden of demonstrating that the challenged employment practice is reasonable or unreasonable in meacham v knolls atomic power laboratory the supreme court ruled that the employer is responsible for proving that its action was in fact reasonable61 the courts decision rested in part on its determination that the party who claims the benefits of statutory ex ception must bear the burden of proving its actions were justified62 ultimately the result in the meacham case appears to make it easier for plaintiffs to prevail in disparate impact cases enforcement and filing procedures the eeoc is responsible for enfo rcing the provisions of the adea63 in order to encourage informal resolution of age discrimination disputes the statute requires aggrieved employees to file complaints with the eeoc before they are allowed to sue in federal court the deadline for filing an adea charge varies depending on several factors64 generally private sector employee must file complaint with the eeoc within 180 days of the alleged discriminat ory act however if the state where the alleged unlawful practice took place has an age discrimination law and corresponding enforcement agency then the time by which claima nt must file with the eeoc is extended to within 300 da ys of the alleged unlawful practice65 after receiving charge of unlawfu l discrimination the eeoc conducts an investigation and if the claim is found to have merit the agency may seek compliance with the statute through met hods such as concilia tion conference or persuasion66 once 60 days have elapsed after the filing of discrimination charge then an adea plaintiff may file suit in federal court67 if the claimant

important to note however that the eeoc has the authority to sue on behalf of an individual in which case the individuals right to bring suit yields to the eeoc69 over the years there has been some confusion over what constitutes charge for purposes of triggering eeoc enfor cement action under eeoc regulations an adea complaint must at minimum 1 be in writing 2 name the prospective respondent and 3 generally llege the discriminatory acts70 in addition to these regulatory requirements eeoc policy states that filing in order to be deemed charge must contain request for agency action to remedy the alleged age discrimination the agencys position was r ecently validated by the supreme court in federal express corp v holowecki 71 which held that claimants submission of an improper form was not fatal to her claim according to the court in addition to the information required by the regulations if filing is to be deemed charge it must be reasonably construed as request for the agency to take remedial action to protect the employees rights or otherwise settle dispute between the employer and the employee72 although this permissive standard may lead to higher number of filings being deemed to be charges the court reasoned that giving inexperienced litigants the benefit of the doubt is more c onsistent with the remedial purpose of the adea waiver and arbitration an employee may waive his rights under the adea if such waiver was knowing and voluntary73 in order to be considered know ing and voluntary waiver must comply with detailed requirements set forth in the statute74

with the eeo c or in civil action is not considered knowing and voluntary unless th general requirements for waiver are met and the individual has reasonable opportunity to consider the settlement75 the person asserting validity of the waiver has the burden of proving that the waiver was knowing and voluntary in addition the wa iver provision does not apply to the eeoc nor may waiver be used to interfere with an employees right to file an age discrimination charge or pa rticipate in an eeoc investigation or proceeding on occasion employers may either delib erately or inadvertently fail to comply with the adeas waiver requirements in such cases the courts must determine what effect the employees acceptance of the statutorily deficient waiver has on the waivers validity in oubre v entergy operations inc 76 the employee received severance pay in return for waiving any claims against the employer but the waiver did not fully comply with the adeas wa iver requirements the supreme court reasoning that retention of severance be nefits does not ratify statutorily invalid waiver held that the plaintiff did not have to return the money before bringing suit77 related issue is the effect of arbitration clauses on adea claims the court held in gilmer v interstatejohnson lane corp that the adea does not preclude enforcement of compulsory arbitration clause78 the plaintiff in gilmer signed registration application with the new york stock exchange nyse as required by his employer the application provided that the plaintiff would agree to arbitrate any claim or dispute that arose between him and interstate gilmer filed an adea claim with the eeoc upon being fired at age 62 interstate filed motion to compelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34652crs15 79 9 usc 1 et seq 80 gilmer

arbitration act faa79 which was enacted to change the longstandi ng judicial hostility to arbitration80 ultimately the court held that an adea claim may be subject to compulsory arbitration in accordance with an arbitration agreement contained in an employment contract81 remedies the remedies available under the adea are patterned on the fair labor standards act82 and may include injunctions comp elled employment reinstatement promotion and back pay83 in addition willful violation of the act gives rise to liquidated damages which are generally computed by doubling the amount awarded to the plaintiff84 according to the supreme court in trans world air lines v thurston violation of the act is willf ul if the employer knew or showed reckless disregard for the matter of wh ether its conduct was prohibited by the adea85 upon proving claim of age disc rimination plaintiff is entitled to reasonable attorneys fees and costs86 in addition anyone who in terferes with the eeocs performance of its duties under the adea is subject to criminal penaltie s amounting to fine or up to one year of prison or both87 iii other laws prohibiting age discrimination the adea is not the only legal remedy available to employees who have been subject to age discrimination other laws that may offer some degree of protection include the us constitution federal statut such as the age discrimination act and the congressional accountability act and various state laws one alternative remedy to the adea is the us constitution although some employees seeking remedy for age discrimination in employment may decide to filehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34652crs16 88 us const amend xiv 1 the equal protec tion clause states in part state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws 89 501 us 452 1991 90 id at 470 91 it is unclear whether plaintiffs may bring age discrimination in employment claims under certain provisions of the reconstruction stat utes namely 42 usc 1983 or 42 usc 1985 92 42 usc 6101 et seq 93 2 usc 1301 et seq 94 29 usc 633aa constitutional challenge based on the equal protection clause88 such claims are unlikely to be successful because the equal protection clause applies only to governmental entities plaintiff must show state action in order to establish such claim moreover the courts generally review legislation involving age classifications under deferential standard of review meaning that such legislation is highly likely to survive judicial scrutiny for example in gregory v ashcroft 89 the supreme court considered an equal protection clause challenge to missouri law that required state judges to retire at ag 70 noting that age is not suspect classification under the equal pr otection claus and that th plaintiffs did not have fundamental interest in serving as judges90 the court reviewed the claim under the deferential rational basis standard ultimately the court held that the state had legitimate and rational basis for requiring retirement of their state judges to ensure the competency and efficacy of their judiciary other remedial alternatives to the adea may be found in other federal statutes91 for example the age discrimination act prohibits discrimination on the basis of age in federally funded programs or activities92 although each federal agency is responsible for enforcing complian ce with respect to its funding recipients the statute states that agencies are not authorized to take action against recipients with respect to their employment prac tices however it is possible though not certain that individuals may bring em ploymentrelated suits on their own meanwhile as noted above the congre ssional accountability ac t applies several existing civil rights labor and workplace laws including the adea to employees of the legislative bran ch of the federal government93 finally in addition to federal laws most states have laws that prohibit age discrimination in private employment the adea does not preempt such state laws even when those laws are more stringent than the adea94
