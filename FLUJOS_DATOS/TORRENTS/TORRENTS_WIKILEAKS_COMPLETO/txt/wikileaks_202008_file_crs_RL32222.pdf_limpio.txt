communications commission has the authority to enforce this provision by forfeiture or revocation of license15 the commissions authority to regulate material that is indecent but not obscene was upheld by the supreme court in federal communications commission v pacifica foundation 16 in pacifica the supreme court affirmed the commissions order rega rding the airing of comedian george carlins filthy words monologue17 in that order the commission determined that the airing of the monologue which containe d certain words that depicted sexual and excretory activities in patently offensive manner at time when children were undoubtedly in the audience was indecent and prohibited by 18 usc 146418 pursuant to the courts decision whether an such material is patently offensive is determined by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium19 the court noted that indecency is largely function of context it cannot be judged in the abstract20 the commissions order in the pacifica case relied partially on spectrum scarcity argument ie that there is scarcity of spectrum space so the government must license the use of such space in the public interest and pa rtially on principles analogous to those found in the law of nuisance21 the commission noted that public nuisance law generally aims to channel the offensive behavior rather than to prohibit it outright for example in the context of broadcast material channeling would involve airing potentia lly offensive material at times when children are less likely to be in the audience in 1987 th commission rejected the spectrum scarcity argument as sufficient basis for its regulation of broadcast indecency but noted that it would continue to rely upon the validity of the public nuisance rationale including channeling of potentially objectionable material22 however in its 1987 order thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32222crs5 22 continued 2 fcc rcd 2698 1987 two other orders handed down the same day articulate the

indecent language was not strictly limited to the seven words at issue in the original broadcast in question and that repeated us of those words was not necessary to find that material in question was

challenged and threejudge panel of the united states cour t of appeals for the district of columbia circuit subsequently vacated the commissi ons order implementin g the act and held the underlying statute unconstitutional32 in its order implementing the act the fcc set forth three goals to justify the regulations 1 ensuring that parents have an opportunity to supervise their children s listening and view ing of overtheair broadcasts 2 ensuring the well being of minors regardless of supervision and 3 protecting the right of all members of the public to be free of indecent material in the privacy of their homes33 the court rejected the third justification as insufficient to support restriction on the broadcasting of constitutionally protected indecent material but accepted the firs t two as compelling interests34 despite the finding of compelling interests in the first two the court found that both congress and the fcc had failed to tailor their efforts to advance these interests in sufficiently narrow way to meet constitutional standards35 following the decision of the threej udge panel the commission requested rehearing banc 36 the case was reheard on october 19 1994 and on june 30 1995 the full court of appeals held the stat ute unconstitutional insofar as it prohibited the broadcast of indecent material betw een the hours of 10 pm and midnight on non public stations37 in so doing the court held that while the channeling of indecent broadcasts between midnight and 6 m would not unduly burden the first amendment the distinction drawn by congress between public and nonpublic broadcasters bears apparent relationship to the compelling government interests that the restrictions are intended to serve38 the court remanded the regulations to the fcc with

permit certificate or other instrument or authorization issued by the commission if the fcc were to change its policy and impose fines on performers it could pparently do so only under the provision which remains in effect that authoriz forfeitures of up to 32500 per violation46 to determine whether broadcast material is in fact indecent the commission must make two fundamental determinations 1 that the material alleged to be indecent falls within the subject matter sc ope of the definition of indecency the material in question must describe or depict sexual or excretory organs or activities and 2 that the broadcast is patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium47 if the material in question does not fall within the subject ma tter scope of the indecency finition or if the broadcast occurred during the safe harbor hours bet ween 10 pm and 6 am the complaint is usually dismissed however if the commission determines that the complaint meets the subject matter requirements and was aired outside the safe harbor hours the broadcast in question is evaluated for patent offensiveness the commission notes that in determining whether material is patently offensive the full context is very important and that such deter minations are highly factspecific the commission has identified three factors that have been significant in recent decisions in determining whether broadcas t material is patently offensive 1 the explicitness or graphic nature of the description or depiction of sexual or excretory organs or activities 2 whether the material dwells on or repeats at length descriptions of sexual or excretory organs or activities 3 whether the material appears to pander or is used to titillate or whether the material appears to have been presented for its shock value48 discussion of cases that address each of these factors follows explicitness or graphic nature of material generally the more explicit or graphic the description or depiction the greater th likelihood that the material will be deemed patently offensive and therefore indecent for example the commission imposed forfeiture on university radio station

1998 54 the commission has recently indicated that the mere fact that specific words or phrases are not sustained or repeated does not mandate finding that material that is otherwise patently offensive to the broadcast medium is not indecent in the matter of complaints against various broadcast lice nsees regarding the airing of the golden globe awards continuedthat included line depi cting anal intercourse49 in that case the commission determined that the song described sexual activities in graphic terms that were patently offensive and therefore indecent since the song was broadcast in the mid afternoon there was reasonable risk that ch ildren were in the audience thus giving rise to the commissions action50 broadcasts need not be as graphic as th song in the above case to give rise to the imposition of an fcc forfeiture broa dcasts consisting of double entendres or innuendos may also be deemed indecent if the sexual or excretory import is unmistakable the fcc issued notice of apparent liability and imposed forfeiture on several stations for airing song that included the following lines i whipped out my whopper and whispered he sweettart howd you like to crunch on my big hunk for million dollar bar well she immediately went down on my tootsie roll and you know it was like pure almond joy51 the commission determined that the material was indecent even t hough it used candy bar names to substitute for sexual activities in one notice concerning the broadcast of the song the commission stated that while the pa ssages arguably consist of double entendre and indirect references the language us ed in each passage was understandable and clearly capable of specific sexual meaning and because of the context the sexual import was inescapable52 the nature of the lyrics c oupled with the fact that the song aired between 6 am and 10 am ga ve rise to the imposition of forfeiture dwelling or repetition of pote ntially offensive material repetition of and persistent focus on sexual or excretory activity could exacerbate the potential offensiveness of br oadcasts for example the fcc issued notice of apparent liability and imposed forfeiture on radio station that broadcast an extensive discussion of flatulence and fecation by radio personality bubba the love sponge53 though the broadcast did not contain any expletives the commission found that the material dwelt on excretory activities and therefore was patently offensive while repetition can increase the likelihood that references to sexual or excretory activities are deemed indecent wh ere such references have been made in passing or are fleeting in nature the co mmission has found that the reference was not indecent even when profanity has been used54 for example the

iddetermined that the following phrase the hell i did i drove motherfer oh uttered by an announcer during radio morning show was not indecent55 the commission declined to take action regarding the broadcast because it contained only fleeting and isolated utterance within the context of live and spontaneous programming56 certain fleeting references ma however be found indecent where other factors contribute to the broadcasts patent offensiveness for example the commission has imposed forfeitures on stations for airing jokes that refer to sexual activities with children57 pandering or titillating nature of material in determining whether broadcast material is indecent the commi ssion also looks to the purpose for which the material is being presented indecency findings generally involve material that is presented in pandering or titillating manner or material that is presented for the shock value of its language for exam ple the commission deemed radio callin survey about oral sex to be indecent based in part on the fact that the material was presented in pandering and titillating manner58 whether broadcast is presented in pandering or titillating manner depends on the context in which the potentially indecent material is presented explicit images or graphic language does not necessarily mean th at the broadcast is being presented in pandering or titillating manner for example the commission declined to impose forfeiture on televi sion station for airing portions of high school sex education class that included the use of sex or gan models to demonstrate the use of various birth control devices59 in dismissing the complaint the commission held that although the program dealt with sexual issues the material presented was clinical or instructional in nature and not presented in pandering titillating or vulgar manner60 golden globe awards decision as noted above on march 18 2004 the federal communications commission overturned an earlier decision by the co

prohibitions on the broadcast of indecent and profane material62 i n reversing the bureau the commission determined that the phrase at issue is within the scope of our indecency definition b ecause it does depict or describe sexual activities63 although the commission recognize d nbcs argument that the f word here was used as an intensifier it nevertheless concluded that given the core meaning of the fword any use of that word or variation in any context inherently has sexual connot ation and therefore falls w ithin the first prong of our indecency definition64 upon finding that the phrase in question fell within the first prong of the definition of indecency the commission rned to the question of whether the broadcast was patently offensive under c ontemporary community standards for the broadcast medium the commission determined that the broadcast was patently offensive noting that the fword is one of the most vulgar graphic and explicit descriptions of sexual activity in the englis h language and that the use of the f word here on nationally telecast awards ceremony was shocking and gratuitous65 the commission also rejected prior commission and staff action that have indicated that is olated or fleeting broadcasts of the fword such as that here are not indecent or would not be acted upon concluding that any such interpretation is longer good law66 the commission further clarified its position stating that the mere fact that sp ecific words or phrases are not sustained or repeated does not mandate finding th at material that is otherwise patently offensive to the broadcast medium is not indecent67httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32222crs12 68 id at 7 it should be noted that although in this case the commission found that the broadcast in question was both inde cent and profane there are certain to be words that could be deemed profane but do not fit the commi ssions definition of indecent under the newly adopted definition of profanity many words could arguably be found profane because they provoke violent resentment or are otherwise grossly offensive but not be found indecent because they do not refer to any sexual or excretory activity or organ or even inherently have sexual connotation as the commission found the phrase that bono uttered to have presumably it is these words that the commission will consider on case bycase basis 69 id at 7 citing

profa nity is construable as denoting certain of those personally reviling epithets natura lly tending to provoke violent resentment or denoting language so grossly offensive to members of the public who actually hear it as to amount to nuisance70 the commission acknowledged that its limited case law regarding profane speech has focused on profanity in the context of blasphemy but stated that it would longer limit its definition of profane speech in such manner pursuant to its adoption of this new definition of profane the commission stated that depending on the c ontext the fword and those words or variants thereof that are as highly offensive as the fword would be considered profane if broadcast between 6 am and 10 pm71 the commission noted that other words would be considered on

f simple98 these incidents raise the same questions that fccs action against the bono expletive raised whether fleeting isolated expletive is ind ecent under federal law nd if so whether the first amendment permits the fcc to enforce th law by punishing broadcasters for such utterances on june 4 2007 the second circuit in 21 decision which the supreme court has agreed to review found that the fccs new policy regarding fleeting expletives represents significant depart ure from positions previously taken by the agency and relied on by the broadcast indus try we further find that the fcc has failed to articulate reasoned basis for this change in policy accordingly we hold that the fccs new policy regarding fleeting expletives is arbitrary and capricious under the administrative procedure act99 the court rejected several reasons that the fcc gave for departing from its previous positions the fcc for example attempted to justify its stance on fleeting expletives on the basis that granting an automatic exemption for isolated or fleeting expletives unfairly forces viewers including children to take the first blow100 the second circuit could not accept this argument as reasoned basis justifying the commissions new rule fi rst the commission provides reasonable explanation for why it has changed its perception that fleeting expletive was not harmful first blow for the nearly thirty years between pacifica and golden globes more problematic however is that th first blow theory bears rational connection to the commissions actual policy regarding fleeting expletives as the fcc itself stressed during oral argument in this case the commission does not take the position that any occurrence of an expletive is indecent or profane under its rules for example although there is out right news exemption from our indecency rules the commission will apparently excuse an expletive when it occurs during bona fide news interview 101 another fcc argument that the court rejected was that it is difficult if not impossible to distinguish whether word is being used as an expletive or as literal description of sexual or excretory functions102 the court found this defies any commonsense understanding of these words which as the general public knows are often used in everyday conversation wit hout any sexual or excretory meaninghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32222crs18 103 id

was devoid of any evidence that suggests fleeting expletive is harmful which would seen to be particularly relevant today when children likely hear this language far more often from other sources than they did in the 1970s when the commission first began sanctioning indecent speech in addition the c ourt found the commi ssions new approach to profanity is supported by even less analysis reasoned or not104 having overturned the fcc policy on statutory grounds the court had occasion to decide whether it also violated the first amendment it explained however why it was skeptical that the commission can provide reasonable explanation for its fleeting expletive regime that would pass constitutional muster105 the final section of this report examines this aspect of the courts opinion cbs corp v fcc on july 21 2008 the us court of appeals for the third circuit issued unanimous decision to invalidate the fccs fine against cbs broadcasting station affiliates for the broadcast of the super bowl halftime show that included brief instance of partial nudity106 the court decided to invalidate the fine because the fcc had acted arbitrarily and capriciously when finding that the brief nudity was actionably indecent in its review of the fccs previous actions in this area the court noted that the fcc has the power to regulate indecency over the broadcast airwaves but for much of the fccs history the agency maintained an exception for fleeting instances of indecency107 the commission argued that its policy exempting fleeting instances of indecency over broadcast from enfor cement applied only to fleeting indecent language and not to images108 the fcc claimed that fleeting indecent images had always been subject to enforcement th erefore there was departure from the fccs previous approach to sanctions regarding such images as result the fcc argued that the agency did not have to articulate reasoned basis for its shift in policy and it provided none the court examined

question raised by the case which was whether cbs had properly been held vicari ously liable for the actions of the performers the court chose however to address this ques tion in dicta and determined that under two of the fccs theories of vicarious liability the fine would have been improperly imposed upon the broadcasters as to third fcc theo ry of vicarious liability which was that the broadcasters had willfully violated the f ccs regulations by failing to take adequate precautionary measures the court determined that the definition of willful was unclear and remanded the question to the fcc for decision on that issue see cbs corp v fcc 535 f3d 167 189209 3d cir 2008always been subject to fcc enforcement109 the court found those claims to be unfounded in its review of the fccs pr evious decisions the court could find distinction between the way the agency tr eated fleeting indecent language as opposed to indecent images110 the court cited instances in which the fcc declined to issue fines for fleeting indecent images in dec lining to institute enforcement actions the agency had stated that the images were fleeting and covered by its policy of non enforcement111 the court decided on that basis that the fccs decision to consider the fleeting indecent image broadcast during the halftime show to be actionable was shift in the fccs policy towards the enforcement against such images because the agency had decided to implement policy shift the agency was required to articulate reasoned basis for doi ng so in order for the departure to be valid under the administr ative procedure act112 as noted above the fcc argued that its policy toward fleeting indecent images had not changed consequently the fcc articulated reason for the shift in policy identified by the court of appeals because the fcc provided basis for its departure from previous enforcement practices the court held that the deviation from the prior policy of restraining from enforcement against fleeting images was arbitrary and capricious to the extent that it violated the apa113 the fine therefore could not be imposed on cbs for two reasons first the underlying policy sh ift was invalid havi ng reasoned basis second even if the policy had reasoned ba sis the enforcement action against cbs represented the first time that the fcc had articulated its intention to take action against fleeting indecent images assuming as the commission argued that it had not done so in its golden globes decision the new policy could not be applied retroactively to fine cbs in this case114 the court did not

harmless and that our attitudes toward them are essentially silly the commission objects however not to this point of view but to the way in which it is expressed122 the court commented if there were any reason to believe that the commissions characterization of the carlin monologue as offensive could be traced to its political content or even to the fact that it satir ized contemporary attit udes about fourletter words first amendment pr otection might be required123 there appears to be some tension between this comment and the courts remark about chaucer as any attempt to censor ch aucer would presumably also be based not on its ideas but on the way its ideas are expr essed but as noted above the courts remark about chaucer was footnote to its comment that the content of the program in which the language is used will also affect the composition of the audience therefore the difference that justice stevens apparently perceived between chaucer and carlin was that even if both have literary artistic or political value only the latter would be likely to attr act youthful audience arguably then pacifica would permit the censorship during certa in hours of the broadcast even of works of art that are likely to attract youthful audience124httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32222crs24 124 continued communicated 403 us 15 26 1971 upholding the first amendment right in the corridor of courthouse to wear jacket bear ing the words f the draft arguably carlins use of indecent words not only served an emotive purpose but served to indicate the precise words to whose censorship he was objecting yet pacifica was decided after cohen which suggests that cohen does not lessen the precedential value of pacifica 125 miller v california 413 us 15 27 24 1973 in addition in striking down parts of the communications decency act of 1996 the cour t expressed concern that the statute may extend to discussions about prison rape or safe sexual practices artistic images that include nude subjects and arguably the card catalogue of the carnegie library reno v aclu supra 521 us at 878 and in striking down federal statute that prohibited child pornography that was produced without the us of an actual child the court expressed concern that the statute prohibits speech spite its serious literary artistic political or scientific value ashcroft v free speech coalition 535 us 234 246 2002 in neither of these cases however did the court state that its holding turned on the statutes application to works of serious value 126 390 us 629 1968 if so this would be contrary to the courts opposition in other contexts to the censorship of works of art the court has he ld that even materials that depict or describe patently offensive hard core sexual conduct which would otherwise be obscene may not be prohibited if they have serious literary artistic political or scientific value125 in addition the harmful to minor s statutes of the sort that the supreme court upheld in ginsberg v new york generally define harmful to minors to parallel the supreme courts defin ition of obscenity and thus prohibit distributing to minors only material that lacks serious value for minors126 this suggests that if the fcc or congress pr ohibited the broadcast during certain hours of indecent words regardless of context the court might be tr oubled by the prohibitions application to works with serious value even though pacifica allowed the censorship of carlins monologue desp ite its apparently ving serious value yet as noted justice stevens expressed distinction in pacifica between point of view and the way in which it is expressed and though majority of the justices did not join the part of the opinion that drew this distinction majority of the justices by concurring in pacifica s holding indicated that the political or literary or artistic content of carlins monologue did not prevent its censorship during certain hours on broadcas t radio and television ther efore it appears that in deciding the constitutionality of an fcc or congressional action prohibiting the broadcasting during certain hours of mate rial with indecent words the court might be troubled by its application to wo rks with serious value only if those works would like chaucers not likely attract substantial youthful audience in sum the court did not hold that the fcc could prohibit an occasional expletive and did not hold that the fcc could prohibit offensive words in programs even primetime programs that children would be unlikely to watch or listen to the court did not hold that the fcc could not take these actions as the question whether it could was not before the court but the courts language quoted above renders pacifica of uncertain precedential value in deciding whether ban during certain hours on the broadcast of indecen t words regardless of context would be constitutionalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32222crs25 127 pacifica supra 438 us at 731732 128 id at 732 distinguishing indecent from obscene and profane in 18 usc 1464 129 id at 740in the filthy words monologue as th supreme court described it george carlin began by referring to his thought s about the words you couldnt say on the public ah airwaves um the ones you definitely wouldnt say ever he proceeded to list those words and repeat them over and over in variety of colloquialisms the fcc at the time used essen tially the same standard for indecent that it uses today the concept of indecent is intimately connected with the exposure of children to language that describes in terms pate ntly offensive as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium sexual or excretory activities and organs 127 most of carlins uses of the filth words it appears from reading his monologue which is included as an appe ndix to the courts opinion seem designed to show the words multiple uses apart from describing sexual or excretory activities or organs nevertheless the commission concluded th at certain words depicted sexual or excretory activities in patently offensive manner 128 therefore one might argue that even if under pacifica the first amendment does not protect during certain hours the use on broadcast media of words that depict sexual or excretory activities in patently offensive manner it nevertheless might protect the use of those same words as an adjective or expletive to emphasize an exclamation to quote the fcc enforcement bur eaus opinion in the bono case counterargument might be that in pacifica the court noted that the normal definition of indecent merely refers to nonconformance with accepted standards of morality129 this suggests the possibility that the court would have ruled the same way in pacifica if the fcc had defined indecent loosely enough to include the use of patently offensive word as an adjective or expletive to emphasize an exclamation but this is speculative as th court did not so rule further as noted above court emphasized the narrowness of its holding noting that it had not decided that an occasional expletive would justify any sanction on what basis did the court in pacifica find that the fccs action did not violate the first amendment in part ivc of opinion which was joined by majority of the justices justice stevens wrote of all forms of communication it is broadcasting that has received the most limited first amendment protection thus alt hough other speakers ca nnot be licensed except under laws that carefully define and narrow official discretion broadcaster may be deprived of his license and his forum if the commission decides that such an action would serve the public interest convenience and necessity similarly although th first amendment protects newspaper publishers from being required to print th replies of those whom they criticize miami herald publishing co v tornillo 418 us 241 it affords such protection to broadcasters on the contrary they must give free time to

distinctions are complex but two have relevance to the present case first the broadcast media have established uniquely pervasive presence in the lives of all americans patently offensive indecent material presented over the airwaves confronts th citizen not only in public but in the privacy of the home where the individua ls right to be left alone plainly outweighs the first amendment rights of an intruder rowan v post office dept 397 us 728 to say that one may avoid further offense by turning off the radio when he hears indecent language is like saying that the remedy for an assault is to run away after the first blow second broadcasting is uniquely accessible to children even those too young to read bookstores and motion pict ure theaters may be prohibited from making indecent material available to children we held in ginsberg v new york 390 us 629 that the governments intere st in the wellbeing of its youth and in supporting parents clai m to authority in their own household justified the regulation of othe rwise protected expression 130 in sum the court held that on broa dcast radio and tele vision during certain times of day certain material may be prohibited because 1 it is patently offensive and indecent and 2 it threatens the wellbe ing of minors and their parents authority in their own household this raises the stion of the extent to which the court continues to allow the government 1 to treat broadcast media differently from other media and 2 to censor speech on the ground that it is patently offensive and indecent or threatens the wellbeing of minors and their parents authority in their own household broadcast media in red lion broadcasting co v fcc which the court cited in the above quotation from pacifica the court upheld the fccs fairness doctrine which imposed on radio and television broadcas ters the requirement that discussion of public issues be presented on broadcast stations and that each side of those issues must be given fair coverage131 the reason that the court upheld the imposition of the fairness doc trine on broadcast media though it would not uphold its imposition on print media is that where there are substantially more individuals who want to broadcast than there are frequencies to allocate it is idle to posit an unabridgeable first amendment right to broadcast comparable to the right of every individual to speak write or publish132 licenses to broadcast the court added do not confer ownership of designated frequencies but only th temporary privilege of using them 47 usc 301 unless rene wed

best serve the public interest this conditi on longer prevails so that continuing control is not justified to this there are several answers scarcity is not entirely thing of the past134 with the plethora of cable channels t oday has spectrum scarcity now become thing of the past in turner broadcasting system inc v fcc the court held that the scarcity rationale does not apply to cable television cable television does not suffer from the inherent limitations that characterize the broadcast medium soon there may be practical limitation on the number of speakers who may use the cable medium nor is there any danger of physical interference between two cable speakers attempting to use the same channel in light of these fundame ntal technological differences between broadcast and cable transmission application of more relaxed standard of scrutiny adopted in red lion and the other broadcast cases is inapt when determining the first amendment validity of cable regulation135 one might argue that if the scarcity rationale does not apply to cable television then it should not apply to broadcast tele vision either because person who because of scarcity cannot start broadcas t channel can start cable channel136 but the court has not ruled on the question in turner it wrote although c ourts and commentators have criticized the scarcity rationale since its inception we have declined to question its continuing validity as support for our broadcast jurisprudence and see reason to do so here137 in 1987 however the fcc abolished the fairness doctrine on first amendment grounds noting that technological deve lopments and advancements in the telecommunications marketplace have provided basis for the supreme court to reconsider its holding in red lion the fccs decision was upheld by the us court of appeals for the district of columbia and the supreme court declined to review the case138 the court of appeals did not rule on constitutional grounds but rather concluded

of all american s and can also confront the citizen in the privacy of the home with little or prior warning id at 744745 justice souter concurred that todays plurality opini on rightly observes that the characteristics of broadcast radio that rendered indece ncy particularly threatening in pacifica that is its intrusion into the house and accessibility to child ren are also present in the case of cable television id at 776 141 529 us 803 813 2000 striking down fede ral statute that required distributors to fully scramble or fully block signal bleed to nonsubscribers to cable channels signal bleed refers to the audio or visual porti ons of cable television programs that non subscribers to cable channel may be able to hear or see despite the fact that the programs have been scrambled to prevent the nonsubscribers from hearing or seeing them 142 an earlier district court case held that pacifica does not apply to cable television because of several differences between cable and broad casting for one in the cable medium the physical scarcity that justifies content regu lation in broadcasting is not present for another as subscriber medium cable tv is not an intruder but an invitee whose continuedthe public interest was neither arbitrary capricious nor an abuse of discretion and we are convinced that it would have acted on that finding to terminate the doctrine even in the absence of its belief that the doctrine was longer constitutional139 but whether or not spectrum scarcity s become thing of the past it would apparently would not today justify governmental restrictions on indecent speech this is because subsequent to the court in turner declining to question the applicability of the scarcity rationale to broadcast media plurality of justices noted in denver area educational telecommuni cations consortium inc v fcc that though spectrum scarcity continued to justify the structural regulations at issue there in turner the must carry rules it has little to do with case that involves the effects of television viewing on children t hose effects are the result of how parents and children view television programming and how pervasive and intrusive that programming is in that re spect cable and broadcast television differ little if at all140 the plurality therefore upheld fede ral statute that permits cable operators to prohibit indecent material on leased access channels thus it appears that the court today would not cite spectrum scarcity to justify restrictions on indecent material on broadcast media but it might cite broadcast medias pervasiveness and intrusiveness subsequent to denver area in united states v playboy entertainment group inc the court held that cable television s full first amendment protection ie contentbased restrictions on cable television receive strict scrutiny141 thus if as the court said in denver area cable and broadcast media differ little if at all with respect to the regulation of

to both broadcast and cable rather than to neither143 in any event as noted above even if the court were to c ontinue to apply pacifica to restrictions on broadcast media this doe s not necessarily mean that it would uphold ban on the broadcast of indecent language regardless of context as pacifica did not hold that an occasional expletive would justify sanction strict scrutiny we now consider the analysis that the court might apply if it chooses not to apply pacifica in deciding the constitutionality of ban on the broadcast of indecent language regardless of context the court in pacifica as noted offered two reasons why the fcc could prohibit offensive speech on broadcast media first the broadcast media have established uniquely pervasive presence in the lives of all americans patently offe nsive indecent material presented over the airwaves confronts the citizen not only in pub lic but in the privacy of the home second broadcasting is uniquely accessible to children even those too young to read and the government s an interest in the wellbeing of its youthand in supporting parents claim to authority in their own household the first of these reasons apparently refers to adults as well as to children ordinarily when the government restricts speech including indecent speech on the basis of its content the restricti on if challenged will be found constitutional only if it satisfies strict scrutiny144 this means that the government must prove that the restriction serves to promote compelling interest and is the least restrictive means to further the articulated interest145 the court in pacifica did not apply this test or any weaker first ame ndment test and did not explain why it did not its reason presumably was that th fccs action restricted speech only on broadcast media if however the court were not to apply pacifica in determining the constitutiona lity of ban during certain hours on the broadcast of indecent language regardless of context then it would apparently apply strict scrutiny if the court were to apply strict scrutin in making this determination it seems unlikely that it would find the first reason cited in pacifica sparing citizens

392 2000 restriction on campaign contributions in all three of these cases the government had restricted lessthanfully protected speech so the court di d not apply strict scrutiny because offensive words are apparently entitled to full first amendment protection except under pacifica and in the instances cited in cohen v california quoted in the text above it seems all the more likely that the court if it applie d strict scrutiny instead of pacifica to challenge to ban on the broadcast of indecent words regardless of context would require the government to demonstrate that harms it recites are real and that the ban would alleviate these harms in direct and material way 148 interactive digital software association v st louis county missouri 329 f3d 954 959 8th cir 2003 the supreme court

not obscene by adult standards sable supra 492 us at 126 the court has so upheld state law banning the distribution to minors of socalled girlie ma gazines even as it acknowledged that it is very doubtful that this finding that such ma gazines are basic factor in impairing the ethical and moral development of our youth expresses an accepted scientific fact ginsberg v new york supra 390 us at

software association supra 329 f3d at 959 continuedcompelling governmental interest the court has held that the government may not prohibit the use of offensive words unless they fall within relatively few categories of instances such as obscenity fighting words or words thrust upon unwilling or unsuspecting viewers146 if the court were to apply strict scrutiny in determining the constitutionality of ban during certain hours on the broadcas t of indecent language regardless of context it also might not find the second reason cited in pacifica protecting minors from patently offensive and ind ecent words and supporting parents claim to authority in their own household to constitute compelling governmental interest when the court considers the constitutionality of restriction on speech it ordinarily even when the speech lacks full first amendment protection and the court applies less than strict scrutiny requires the government to demonstrate that the recited harms are real not merely conjectural and that the regulation will in fact alleviate these harms in direct and material way147 with respect to restrictions designed to deny minors access to sexually explicit material by contrast the courts appear to assume without requiring evid ence that such material is harmful to minors or to consider it obscene as to minor s even if it is not obscene as to adults and therefore not entitled to first ame ndment protection with respect to minors whether it is harmful to them or not148 word used as mere adjective or

found that the statute did not constitute the least restri ctive means to advance the interest the supreme court affirmed on the same ground pparently assuming the existence of compelling governmental interest but finding less restrictive means that could have been used in another case federal court of appeal s upholding the current statute that bans indecent broadcasts from 6 am to 10 pm noted that the supreme court has recognized that the governments interest in protectin g children extends beyond shielding them from physical and psychological harm the st atute that the court found constitutional in ginsberg sought to protect children from exposure to materials that would impair their ethical and moral development congress does not need the testimony of psychiatrists and social scientists in order to take note of the coarsening of impressionable minds that can result from persistent exposure to sexually explicit material action for childrens television v fcc supra 58 f3d at

the nature of the alleged harm is never explained id at 671 dc cir 1995 dwards cj dissenting 149 the full commissions decision in the bono case stated that any use of that word or variation in any context inherently has xual connotation but this does not necessarily mean that it is sexually oriented enough to cau the courts to assume without evidence that it is harmful to minors however arguably does not constitute sexually oriented material149 therefore if court applied strict scrutiny to decide the constitutionality of ban during certain hours on the broadcast of indecent wo rds regardless of context then in determining the presence of compelling interest the court might require the government to demonstrate that the recited harms are real not merely conjectural and that the regulation will in fact alleviate these harms in direct and material way this could raise the question not raised in pacifica of whether hearing such words is harmful to minors more precisely it might raise the question of whether hearing such words on broadcast radio and television is harmful to minors even in light of the opportunities for minors to hear such word s elsewhere if the government failed to prove that hearing certain words on br oadcast radio or tele vision is harmful to minors then court would not find compelling interest in censoring those words and might strike down the law

states interest in the wellbeing of its youth as independent from its interest in supporting parents claim to authority in their own household to direct the rearing of their children150 the holding in ginsberg however did not turn on whether these interests are independent and one might argue that they are not because the governments interest in s upporting parents lies in assisting them in protecting their children from harmful influences if ind ecent words are not harmful influence then arguably the government has interest sufficient to override the first amendment in supporting parents in their efforts to prevent their childrens access to them it has also been argued that law that effectively bans all indecent programming does not fac ilitate parental supervision in my view my right as parent has been preempted not facilitated if i am told that certain programming will be banned from my television congress cannot take away my right to decide what my children watch absent some showing that my children are in fact at risk of harm from exposure to indecent programming151 if the government could persuade cour t that ban during certain hours on the broadcast of indecent words regardless of context serves compelling interest either in protecting the wellbeing of minors or in supportin g parents claim to authority the government would then ve to prove that the ban was the least restrictive means to advance that interest this might raise questions such as whether it is necessary to prohibit particular words on weekdays during school hours solely to protect preschool children and child ren who are home sick some days in response to this question the governme nt could note that the broadcast in pacifica was at 2 pm on tuesday but was nevertheless considered time of the day when there is reasonable risk that children may be in the audience152 more significantly however court might find ban too restrictive because it would prohibit the broadcast between certain hours of material including works of art and other material with serious value that would not attract substantial numbers of youthful viewers or listeners in conclusion it appears that if court were to apply st rict scrutiny to determine the constitutionality of ban on the broad cast of indecent language regardless of context then it might require the government to demonstrate that the recited harms are real not merely conjectural and that the regulation will in fact alleviate these harms in direct and material way th is would mean that the government would have to demonstrate compelling governmental interest such as that hearing indecent words on broadcast radio and television is harmful to minors despite the likelihood that minors hear such words else where or that banning indecent words is necessary to support parent s authority in their own household if the government could not demonstrate compelling governmental interest then the court might find the ban unconstitutional even

note 98 489 f3d at 447 154 id at 463465serious value at least if such material would not attract substantial numbers of youthful viewers or listeners whether court would apply strict sc rutiny would depend upon whether in light of the proliferation of cable television it finds pacifica to remain applicable to broadcast media if court does find that pacifica remains applicable to broadcast media then the court would be faced with questions that pacifica did not decide whether on broadcast radi and television during hours when children are likely to be in the audience the government may prohibit an indecent word used as an occasional expletive or in material that would not attract substantial numbers of youthful viewers or listeners second circuits dicta in fox levision stations inc v fcc as noted at pages 1618 of this report on june 4 2007 the second circuit in 21 decision found that the fccs new policy re garding fleeting expletives represents significant departure from positions previ ously taken by the agency and relied on by the broadcast industry we further fi nd that the fcc has failed to articulate reasoned basis for this change in policy accordingly we hold that the fccs new policy regarding fleeting expletives is arbitrary and capricious under the administrative procedure act153 as also noted above the second circuit having overturned the fcc policy on statutory grounds had occas ion to decide whether it also violated the first amendment in dicta however it explained why it was skeptical that the commission can provide reasonable explanation for its fleeting expletive regime that would pass constitutional muster the court wrote that it was sympathetic to the networks contenti on that the fccs indecency test is undefined indiscernible inconsiste nt and consequently unconstitutionally vague we also note that the fccs indecency test raises the separate constitutional question of whether it permits the fcc to sanction speech based on its subjective view of the merit of that speech it appears that under the fccs current indecency regime any and all uses of an expletive is presumptively indecent and profane with the broadcaster then having to demonstrate to the satisfaction of th commission under an unidentified burden of proof that the expletives were integra l to the work in the licensing context the supreme court has cautioned against speech regulations that give too much discretion to government officials finally we recognize that there is some tension in the law regarding the appropr iate level of first amendment scrutiny in general restrictions on first amendmen t liberties prompt courts to apply strict scrutiny at the same time howev er the supreme court has also considered broadcast media exceptional nevertheless we would be remiss not to observe that it is increasingly difficu lt to describe the broadcast media as uniquely pervasive and uniquely accessible to children and at some point in the future strict scrutiny may properly apply in the context of regulating broadcast television154
