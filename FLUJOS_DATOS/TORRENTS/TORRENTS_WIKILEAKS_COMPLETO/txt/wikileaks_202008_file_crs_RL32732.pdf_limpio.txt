information on tr ends in vha appropriations to provide some context it is important to understand the difference between appropriations and spending when congress appropria tes money it provides budget authority that is authority for an agency to enter into obligations obligations occur when agencies enter into contracts employ personnel and so forth outlays or spending occur when obligations are liquidated pr imarily through issuance of checks transfer of funds and so forth it should be noted that not all budget authority in given year becomes outlays in the year for which it is provided portion of each years outlays derives from carryover budget authority provided in prior years the total new budget authority in year typically exceeds total outlays for fiscal year particularly for programs with long lead times such as construction it may take years for the funds provided by congress to be spent furt hermore in certain instances congress explicitly establishes multiy ear appropriation accounts wh ich are budget authorities that can be expended over several years this report will specifically provide an overview of trends in appropr iations or budget authority for va health care as wellhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32732crs2 3 for detailed description of funding for va medical care for fy2004 and fy2005 see crs report rl32548 veterans medical care appr opriations and

serviceas data on the number of ve terans veteran enrollees and unique veteran patients from fy1995 through fy20043 the report will use the terms appropriations and funding interchangeably vha is funded through multiple appropr iation accounts that are supplemented by other sources of revenue over th past two decades congress has passed legislation to increase vhas ability to supplement its appropriations the composition of these supplemental revenues as well as their use by va has been modified periodically historically the house and nate appropriations committees and the office of management and budget omb have used the following appropriation accounts for va the larger entity to describe funding for vha medical care medical and prosthetic research and medical administration and miscellaneous operating expenses mamoe these accounts have constituted the majority of vhas appropr iations however over the past decade vas account structure has changed in recent years in its budget submissions to congress va proposed different account st ructures to fund vha and congress adopted different account structure during enactment of appr opriations also c ongress appropriates funds for constructing altering extendi ng and improving ll va facilities and significant and changing portion of these sums are expended on va medical facilities these changes present cha llenges in comparing vha funding over period of time legislation to supplement appropriations beginning in 1986 congress enacted seve ral major pieces of legislation to increase vas ability to supplement its appropriations in 1986 congress passed the veterans healthcare amendments of 1986 pl 99272 and gave va the authority to s eek reimbursement fro m thirdparty health insurers for the cost of medical care furnished to insured nonserviceconnected nsc veterans this law also authorized va to assess means test copayment to certain nsc veterans base d on the veterans income and assets the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 pl 101 508 expanded vas cost recovery program by providing va the authority to seek reimbursement from thirdparty payers for the cost of medical care provi ded to insured servi ceconnected veterans treated for nsc conditions4 however va was not initially allowed to use these funds to supplement its medical care appropriations instead the collections were returned to the treasury with the passage of the balanced b udget act of 1997 bba 97 pl 10533httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32732crs3 5 these are expenses incurred in the identif ication billing auditing

provided va the authority to reta in funds from thirdparty collections in the medical care collections fund mccf va has the authority to collect inpatient outpatient medica tion and nursing home copaym ents from veterans and authority to recover thirdparty payments fro m veterans insurers by statute subject to appropriations mccf funds must be spent on providing va medical care and services and on vas expenses associ ated with mccf program operations5 since fy1998 va has used these funds to supplement its medical care appropriations unlike appropriations for vha which must be expended in given fiscal years mccf funds are available indefin itely and may be spent without any fiscal year limitation in 1999 congress once again enacted gislation to improve vas ability to enhance its nonappropriated re venues the veterans m illennium health care and benefits act of 1999 pl 106117 aut horized va to increase the medication copayment amount and to establish nnual caps on the medication copayment amount this act also established the h ealth services improvement fund hsif to reduce waiting times for receiving care and to reduce the burden of cost sharing for drugs and prosthe tics on veterans6 monies in this fund we re available without fiscal year limitation revenues for the fund came from increases in medication copayments from 2 to 77 revenue from enhanceduse lease agreements8 and reimbursement from partment of defense dod for tricareeligible military retirees9 the consolidated appropria tion resolu tion fy 2003 pl 1087 consolidated this account with mccf and granted va permanent authority to collect prescription copayments10 more recently in 2004 congress authorized consolidating several revenue accounts into mccf to augment these revenues the fy 2004 departments of veterans affairs and hous ing and urban development and independent agencies appropriations act fy2004 vahud ppropriations act pl 108199 authorized consolidating the following accounts

during the course of fy200511 detailed listing of revenue accounts that constitute mccf for fy2004 is given in appendix 1 it should be noted that mccf collecti ons are estimated by va when developing budget proposal for the forthcoming fis cal year these va estimates incorporate the changes associated with the implement ation of the administrations legislative proposals such as an increase in costsha ring charges however the house and senate appropriations committees may reject these legislative proposals and include more conservative estimate for mccf co llections for example in its fy2004 budget request to congress va projected mccf collections for fy2004 at 18 billion an amount that included revenue fro m increased costsharing charges the house and senate appropria tions committees rejected th costsharing proposals and used lower mccf estimate of 16 billion in deciding that years va appropriation recommendation changes in account structure another challenge in comparing funding from one year to the next is the changes in appropriation accounts that c onstitute funding for vha the following examples illustrate the inhe rent complexities when trying to compare funding historically the house and senate appr opriations committees have funded vha using the following accounts medical care medical and prosth etic research and mamoe accounts however in some years va as well as the committees on appropriations have restruct ured appropriation accounts th at constitute funding for vha for instance the fy1991 vahud appropriations act pl 101501 established the health prof essional scholarship program as sepa rate appropriation account12 from fy1991 through fy1995 va in cluded the health professional scholarship program under the vha budget13 about 10 million was appropriated for this program in each fiscal year during this peri od beginni ng in fy1996 the account received appropriation from congre ss and was not included as separate appropriation account under the vha budget va made its last award under this program at the end of fy1995 alt hough the health professional scholarship program was funded as parate account va funded seve ral programs for training of health professionals through the medical care account in fy1995 va spent approximately 408 million for ducation and training of health professionals in fy2003 va

philippines as sepa rate account under the vha budget beginning in fy1996 congress discontinued providing us funds to maintain and upgrade the physical plant at this facility this was due to the suspension of us veteran admissions to the vmmc about 500000 was provided for each of the fiscal years from fy1991 through fy1995 more recently in fy2004 va submitted its budget request for vha using an account structure based on business lines the new medical care business line in addition to the medical care appropriati on included the following appropriation accounts that were previously funde
