at the bay pines medical center in florida16 in the wake of the corefls failure the vas assistant secretary for information technology in december 2004 contracted with the gartner group to conduct an organizational ssessment of va it the study delivered in may 2005 proposed several options to reorganize the development and management of va it programs the first option was to keep the existing it management structure in which va it resources are operated and managed within highly decentralized management structure the departments cio manages central office staff of approximately 350 employees and direct budget of approx imately 50 million per year while the cio is charged with overall responsibility fo r the successful management of all va it resources the cio has direct management control or organiza tional authority over any of these resources the department s cio provides policy guidance budgetary review and general oversight via indirect supervision of the cios of each of the vas three administrations the veterans health administra tion vha veterans benefits administration vba and national cemetery administration nca the second option proposed was the reg ional option under this option va would be divided into three to five ge ographically based subdivisions within each of these deputy cio would control all it assets and would be responsible for all service delivery within that region these deputy cios would report directly to the va cio the third option recommended by the gartner study was the administrationcentric opti on under this option va would be divided by administration into the vha vba and nca and deputy cio for each administration would control ll it assets and be responsib for all service delivery within that administration these deputy cios would report directly to the va cio the fourth option proposed was the fed erated option under this option va would divide operational responsibilitie s and it systems development res ponsibilities
