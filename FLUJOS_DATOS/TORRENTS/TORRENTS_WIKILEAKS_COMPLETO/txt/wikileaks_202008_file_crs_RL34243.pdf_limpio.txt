summary since the terrorist attacks of septembe r 11 2001 the role of foreign assistance as tool of foreign policy has come into sh arper focus the president elevated global development as third pillar of national security with defense and diplomacy as articulated in the us national security strategy of 2002 and reiterated in 2006 at the same time that foreign aid is being recognized as playing an important role in us foreign policy it has also come unde r closer scrutiny by congress largely in response to number of presidential initiativ and by critics who argue that the us foreign aid infrastructure is cumbersome and fragmented and that aid policy is unfocused in recent years several in itiatives have heightened c ongressional interest in and caused reexamination of us foreign assistance policy and programs including organizational structure in january 2006 secretary of state rice announced an initiative to bring coordination and coherence to us aid programs the secretary created new state department position director of foreign assistance dfa the occupant of which serves concurre ntly as administrator of the us agency for international development usaid new bureau of foreign assistance f was created to coordinate assistance programs led by the dfa who in 2006 developed strategic framework for foreig n assistance to align us aid programs with strategic objectives the framework guided the writing of the fy2008 and fy2009 budgets us foreign aid programs began in earne st with the marshall plan to rebuild europe following world war ii arguably the underlying rationale for aid during most of the postwar period was to counter communist influence in the world since the fall of the berlin wall and the collapse of the soviet union and particularly since the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 aid programs have increasingly been justified within the context of antiterrorism despite changing global conditions and challenges us foreign aid programs th eir organizational structure and their statutory underpinnings reflect the cold wa r environment in which they originated these factors are arguably motivating the heightened interest in reevaluating how us aid programs function and in re vamping how they are administered there is also growing recognition of the role that foreign assistance can play as foreign policy tool that is equal to the role of diplomacy and defense within the current international environment characterized by regional conflicts terrorist threats weapons proliferation concerns with disease pandemics and the difficulty in overcoming poverty as result number of recent highprofile studies have made recommendations for specific reforms this report written by connie veillette former crs specialist will be updated by susan

post911 envir onment prompting reexamination of the purposes of assistance and how best to achieve those objectives the renewed interest occurs as the administration has initiated many new programs that introduced performancebased assistance in the form of the millennium challenge account and sectorspeci fic assistance largely directed at health programs in africa the administration also unveiled in early 2006 restructuring of foreign aid programs administered by the department of state and the us agency for international development usaid the restructuring is meant to link aid programs with strategic objectives and to provide more coordination and coherence in addition number of recent studies have made specific recommendations for both policy and organizational reforms congress has been considering thes reforms as part of the annual appropriations process congress may consider more farreaching reforms in authorizing legislation in the coming years in the context of new administration criticisms of current foreign aid structures and programs the current structure of us fore ign aid entities and the conduct and effectiveness of aid prog rams have come under incr easing scrutiny on number of fronts programs have b een described as fragmented and cumbersome and lacking in flexibility responsiveness and transparen cy aid policy is considered lacking in focus and coherence there is ambiguity w ith regard to who develops aid policy not just between the state department and usaid but among the 26 other government departments agencies and offices that provide some type of foreign aid in general some disillusionment with foreign aid results from perceived lack of progress in some countries that have been aid recipients for decades other criticism results from an outdated aid apparatus developed during the cold war that has been reformed in piecemeal fashion often adding conflicting and competing priorities and that has not been updated to reflect cu rrent world conditions and challengeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34243crs2 definitions and data sources definitions there is precise definition of what the term foreign assistance encompasses at its broadest level it can refer to any and all expenditures that provide assistance to foreign countries in the areas of economic development humanitarian assistance disaster res ponse security and military assistance governance and rule of law health and trade development the broad definition covers programs managed by many governme nt agencies in addition to those of the state departme nt and usaid often when talking about appropriations the term is considered to refer to those programs funded in annual state departme nt and foreign operations appropriations bills this would include programs managed by the state department usaid and several independent agencies but would excl ude some major funding streams such as from the department of defense and the partment of health and human services narrower conceptualization of the term re fers to programs that promote longterm economic development poverty alleviati on health and humanitarian assistance largely but not entirely managed by usai d humanitarian assistance is understood to encompass food aid and disaster assistance when used as such the term excludes large sums of assistance administered by the state departme nt but would include grants from the millennium challenge corporation another term official development assistance oda is also used oda is defined by the organization for economic coopera tion and development oecd as grant assistance of mainly development nature as such it excludes some security and military assistance for the most part this report adopts the br oadest definition this approach is used because possible reforms that congress ma consider could address aid programs governmentwide in some parts of this report the foreign operations budget is considered separately and is noted as such in the narrative data sources this report relies on two main data sources both of which have limitations the first data source is budget documents submitted to congress and enacted foreign operations appropriations while this source provides detailed information on large portion of us aid programs it does not cover aid programs of domestic agencies those agencies often do not systematically report these types of expenditures in their congressional budget ju stifications and their appropriations bills do not always provide the deta ils of the funding approved the second source is data base maintained by the development assistance committee dac of the oecd donor nations report their calendar year disbursements of official development ssistance to the dac and the dac report is the internationally accepted measure of oda contributions of the international community of donors its limitations as noted above is that it is not inclusive of all the assistance that the united states prov ides on the other hand it is reliable source of data on what types of assistan ce are being provided by all government agencieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34243crs3 specific points of contention include the level of us assistance usually in relation to other international donors and the composition of aid generally the ratio of humanitarian and development aid to security assistance by region the coordination of aid among programs in usaid the state department and independent agencies such as the millennium challenge corporation the trade and development agency the overseas private investment co rporation and veral regionally focused funds such as the interamerican foundation and the african development foundation the coordination of aid among num erous domestic agencies such as the department of health and human services hhs and the center for disease control cdc that administer some type of foreign assistance program the coordination of bilateral and multilateral assistance the coordination of aid with other international donors the involvement of the department of defense in aid programs that some observers believe should be carried out by civilian agencies the perceived ambiguity with regard to who sets foreign aid policy among the state department and usaid the effectiveness of aid programs especially in light of steady diminution of technical expertise at usaid and the increasing reliance on contractors both in wash ington and in the field to carry out aid programs and the lack of foreign assistance strategy to guide and justify the provision of aid generally and one that deals with programs specifically that responds simultane ously to recipient country needs and us priorities some of these issues are longstanding ot hers are responses to more recent changes such as new aid initiatives new offices administering assistance and general increase in the foreign aid budget current aid platforms and funding aid platforms the state department and usaid are the lead agencies that provide foreign assistance both are f unded in the annual state department and foreign operations appropria tions bills in fy2007 the state department controlled about 64 of bilateral nd multilateral assistance while usaid accounted for approximately 20 the rema inder is managed by other independent agencies such as the millennium challenge corporation the trade and development agency andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34243crs4 the peace corps some funds are comanag ed by the state department and usaid such as the economic support fund alt hough major policy decisions are often retained by state some observers maintain that restructuring initiatives beginning in 2006 have further removed usaid from policy decisions the accounts managed by usaid largely pertain to longterm development health programs and disa ster relief although the office of the global aids coordinator which administers the largest us initiative on human immunodeficiency virus and acquired imm unodeficiency syndrome hivaids is located in the state department the stat department aid portf olio in addition to hivaids funds comprises accounts relate d to military assistance implemented by the department of defense narcotics and law enforcem ent migration and refugees antiterrorism peacekeeping operations and accounts focusing on democratic transitions in states of the former sovi et union and eastern europe and the baltics prior to 2006 reforms see section be low on recent reforms there was little coordination at the budget and policy deve lopment level between state and usaid there are however number of independent agencies administering foreign assistance that remain outside of state nd usaid and that are also funded in the annual foreign operations appropriations bills these include the millennium challenge corporation the trade and velopment agency the peace corps the overseas private investment corpora tion and the exportimport bank these agencies develop their own budgets and cr itics argue that their activities are not well coordinated with those of state and usaid in addition to these entities there are aid programs administered by approximately 14 different partments and agencies th largest portfolio belongs to the department of fense which manages programs providing humanitarian assistance civic action activities training and equipping of foreign militaries and even some healthrelated assistance see page 27 for complete list of agencies reporting assistance in calendar year 2006 these organizations have provided as much as 40 in official development assistance in recent years each of these agencies develops its own budget and those funds are appropriated in domestic funding bills these programs remain outside of the jurisdiction of foreign operations appropriations subcommittees and foreign affairs authorizing committees that have oversight of foreign assistance in addition there is central reporting mechanism for these programs making it difficult to ascertain the full amount that the united states is providing in foreign assistance in any given year proponents of aid reform point to this situation as one of the main symptoms of fragmented aid structure that impedes coherent governmentwide foreign assistance policy and implementation current funding since the events of 911 amounts requested and approved by congress for foreign assistance gene rally have trended upward the foreign operations fy2009 budget request is 261 b illion or an increase of 88 over the 24 billion estimate including supplements only within pl 110161 in foreign assistance programs for fy2008 the actual fy2007 funding level for fy2007 including supplemental funds totals 264 billion the estimated level for

statutes author izing foreign assistance but is illustrative of some of the more recent legislation see legislation on forei gn relations through 2005 volumes ia and ib house committee on international relations and senate committee on foreign relations january and april 2006part of the trend in increases is due to the greater use of supplemental appropriations measures to fund international affairs spending including foreign assistance table 1 provides funding levels for foreign operations since fy1999 in both current and constant do llars and includes both regu lar and

state department estimates both fy2008 and fy2009 figures include supplementals passed by congress june 30 2008 pl 110252 statutory basis of foreign assistance the main statutory basis of foreign aid programs is the foreign ssistance authorization act of 1961 faa as amended pl 87195 22 usc 2151 the faa has been amended numerous times since its initial enactment but it has not been comprehensively reauthorized since 1985 instead congress has enacted ries of statutes to authorize specific aid programs these include the freedom support act pl 102511 the support for east european democracy s eed act pl 109102 the afghanistan freedom support act of 2002 107327 the us leadership against hivaids tuberculosis and malaria act of 2003 pl 10825 the millennium challenge act of 2003 pl 108199 and various s ecurity assistance acts since 19991 over the years most aid reform studies have recommended that the faa and related statutes be replaced with new legislation that w ould update the statutory basis to eliminate the emphasis on the cold war and communism and reflect current international conditions thereby bringing coherence to numerous aid programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34243crs6 2 this very brief historical review of foreign assistance necessarily omits much of the nuance and detail of 60year program for more information see foreign

programs by stanley j heginbothamhistorical ra tionales for for eign assistance2 since the start of us foreign aid programs the rationale for such assistance has been posited in terms of national security humanitarianism and commercial interest from beginning in rebuilding europe after world war ii and assisting newly independent states in africa aid programs reflected cold war tensions that continued through the 1980s us assistance progra ms were viewed in national security context as way to prevent the incursion of soviet influence in latin america southeast asia and africa in the immediate aftermath of the dissolu tion of the soviet union aid programs lost their cold war underpinnings with the end of the cold war foreign aid programs reflected less of strategic fo cus on global scale and instead responded to regional issues such as middle east peace initiatives supporting the transition to democracy of eastern europe and republics of the former soviet union addressing international drug production and traffick ing in the andes and stemming illegal immigration foreign aid lost its anticomm unism rationale and decreasing foreign aid budgets in the 1990s reflected th lack of an overarching theme even during periods when aid programs we re justified in the context of the cold war and more recently in the context of antiterrorism foreign aid programs also were justified for commercial and humanitarian reasons foreign assistance has long been defended as way to either promote us exports by creating new customers for us products or by improving the gl obal economic environm ent in which us companies compete at the same time strong current has existed that explained us assistance as moral imperative to help povertystricken countries and those trying to overcome disaster s or conflict providing assistance for humanitarian reasons or in response to natural disaster s has generally been the least contested within the american public and policymakers alike the purposes of aid are thought to fit within these rationales by promoting economic growth and reducing poverty improving governance addressing population growth expanding access to basic education and health care protecting the environment promoting stability in conflictive regions protecting human rights curbing weapons proliferati on and addressing drug produc tion and trafficking the united states would achieve its goals of promoting national security ensuring global economic environment for americ an products and monstrating the humanitarian nature of the us people some

pandemics that have the ability to spread with increasing speed has also brought focus to us aid programs the present national security rationale for foreign affairs programs has transitioned from largely anticommunist orientation for some 40 years following world war ii to more recent focus on antiterrorism in the post september 11 2001 environment in 2002 president bush released his national

initiativ believe that aid progra ms need to be responsive to current global conditions such as disease outbreaks and regional instability while critics argue that these new focuses are diverting

accounts some observers would not include all of esf in this category since significant amounts are used for development purposes 8 it is difficult to track sector allocations over time for number of reasons some aid can be attributed to several sectors water san itation can be considered relating to health agricultural productivity and the environment for example but may not have been consistently reported as such from year to year also usaid has ch anged the structure of its congressional budget justification as resu lt of the strategic framework so that not all information is reported in the same format as in previous years finally funds for some activities can be spread over various accounts for example health activities are funded from csh fsa seed and ghaimany observers describe curre nt us programs as giving priority to health and security assistance this perception is rgely driven by the large increase of funding for hivaids prevention and treatment and the costs of reconstruction in afghanistan and iraq health funding including all usaid and state department programs comprised approxima tely 6 of the foreign aid budget in fy1995 but has risen to nearly 30 in

exceeded regu lar foreign operations funding have become significant channel of funds for us international activ ities especially those related to reconstruction efforts in iraq and afghanistan supplemental appropriations bills have often also been used as vehicles to provide additional funding to respond to unanticipated emergencies or na tural disasters there has been some criticism that the administration has relied too heavily on supplementals and that some items pa rticularly relating to iraq should be incorporated into the regular appropriations cycle the administration counters that given the nature of rapidly changing overs eas events and unforeseen emergencies it is necessary to make supplemental requests for unexpected and nonrecurring expenses funds in supplemental appr opriations bills are generally declared emergency and do not fall unde r discretionary budget caps figure 3 shows the growing reliance on foreign operations supplemental appropriations congress

appropriations measures notes all figures include regular and supplemental appropriations figures are in current us dollars issues for congress congress will likely play an integral role in any type of foreign aid reform by authorizing new aid infrastructure appr opriating funds for refocused aid programs or both the challenges facing congress include weighing the justifications for foreign aid

centered on security concerns for most of its existence with security most often defined in an anti communism or antiterrorism context another rationale to reflect the humanitarian nature of the american peopl has also been prominent third rationale to promote us exports has been prominent at some points further some aid proponents have ju stified aid as means to reduce illegal immigration to the united states by addressing the econo mic motivations for mig ration or to reduce the illegal flow of narcotics others have cited the need for the united states to exercise leadership in the aid field commensurate with its economic political and military standing in the world it is likely that us foreign aid policy will continue to be predicated on ll of these rationales there are number of other considera tions however that policy makers may address in any redesign of us foreign aid should us assistance be based on the political and economic performance of recipients ie tied aid there is strong belief in the development community that countries with democratic institutions have greater capacity to absorb and benefit from foreign aid critics argue that focus on performancebased criteria neglects countries in dire need of ssistance but that are not able for one reason or another to achie ve usdetermined benchmarks should us assistance emphasize poverty alleviati on without regard for the nature of the recipient c ountry government critics of aid point out that us aid has been given to countries with repressive regimes and may signal tacit suppor t for such regimes the poverty of its citizens cannot be overcome by foreign assistance if repressive and corrupt regimes exploit the pr ovision of aid on the other hand some observers believe that there is moral obligation to find the means to help people in need most of whom are the victims of repressive regimes should us assistance be focused on countries that have the best chance of graduating from aid such focus would reduce the number of countries in whic h the united states conducts development activities as best cases are identified and as countries graduate from assistance on the other hand it would omit countries that have not reached level of development that approaches sustainability should development serve as its ow n distinct purpose or should it be seen as tool of diplom acy those who favor strong development policy based on human itarian rationale believe that development is distinct from dipl omacy and should not be subsumed by it others believe that th american public will not support foreign aid budgets unless it can be demonstrated that aid serves strategic us foreign policy objectiveshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34243crs14 9 see usaidus government coordi nation at

the secretary of states reorganization creating new position and new bureau to coordinate aid the changes were made in the context of achieving the administrations development initiatives to that end she created ne w state department position director of foreign assistance dfa and new bureau of foreign assistance f the dfa serves concurrently as administrator of usaid when established it was argued that the dualhatted nature of the position along with rank equivalent to deputy secretary would allow for the be tter coordination of aid programs the dfa has authority over assistan ce programs managed by the state department and usaid nd provides guidance for foreign assistance delivered through other government agencies while the fy2008 foreign operations budget request was written under his direction the dfa has d very little input except informally over the aid provided by other agencies and departments that according to one usaid document now totals more than 50 government entities9 t h i s situation was arguably not unexpected since the dfa has statutory authority except that delegated to the office from the secretary of state in 2006 the dfa presented new strategic framework for foreign assistance10 that links aid programs to us strategi c objectives countries are grouped into five categories representing common development challenges rebuilding countries are those in or emerging from inte rnal or external conflicts transforming countries include low and lowermiddle income c ountries that meet certain performance criteria based on good governance and sound economic policies developing countries are those low and lowermiddle income countries that are not yet meeting performance criteria sustaining partnership countries include uppermiddle income countries with which the united states maintains economic trade and security relationships beyond foreign aid restrictive countries include authoritarian regimes with significant freedom and human rights issues most of which are ineligible to receive us assistance except for humanitarian purposes programs in these countries operate through nongovernmental organizations or through tities outside the country sixth category was created to encompass global or regional programs that transcend any one countrys borders countries are expected to graduate from one category to another and th eventually from aid entirely each category represents common deve lopment challenges around which aid programs are to be design ed and linked to strategic objectives those objectives include peace and security governing justly and democratically investing in people economic growth and humanitarian assist ance countries in each category may receive assistance under veral or all objectives the initial reception to the framework and the dfa position within the development community is mixed some observers hail the effort as timely andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34243crs15 11 such summits include the millennium summit in 2000 the monterrey conference on financing for development in 2002 and the gleneagles summit in 2005 the 2000 summit adopted the millennium development goals

number of assistance programs these analysts s ee the effort as good first step to address fragmented assistance structure they also argue however that the reform does not go far enough in addressing the weakened state of technical expertis at usaid in the context of decreasing operating budgets us aid staff numbers have been cut in half since the early 1980s as most developmen t activities are carried out by private contractors and the nongovernmental orga nization community with many observers remarking that instead of development experts the agency now has contract managers others criticize the new framework for being inadequate they contend that unless the dfa has authority over all us assistance programs the serious problem of lack of coordination and coherence will not be solved if one examines the sources of official devel opment assistance as reported to the organization for economic cooperation and velopment oecd programs under the jurisdiction of the dfa that is all state depar tment and usaid programs accounted for 58 of us aid in calendar year 2006 the actual amount may be much less as it appears that the office of the global hivaids coordinator which

countries annual events such as the g8 mmits and international meetings on the subject of development have produced pledges to increase aid in overall terms for specifi c regions and for particular purposes11 the proliferation of pledges raises the ques tion of what is an appropriate level of assistance that will bring about sustainable development while being cognizant of the capabilities both political and fi nancial of donor countries some international aid goals are widera nging and ambitious such as the uns millennium development goals mdg while others are more focused such as doubling aid to africa by 2010 the millennium project established eight development goals to be ach ieved some pa rtially by 201512 the development program undp estimates that global ai d levels from all

are two ways to measure levels of foreign aid as percentage of countrys gross national income gni or as percentage of countrys budget14 advocates of increasing foreign aid have called for the united

the fy2008 budget one percent increase would amount to an additional 29 billion for total foreign aid budget of 53 billion this would represent near doubling of assistance critics of both proposals

tracked by the dac critics of large increases in foreign aid believe that many developing countries lack the capacity to absorb large inputs of assistance and that such levels could overwhelm weak government institutions including health care and education systems for example some usaid missions have expressed concern that the health care systems in some pepfar countries are not capable of sustaining the large amount of hivaids funds that have increas ed precipitously in recent years and are proposed to climb further under the presidents pledge to double funding in the fy2009fy2013 time frame20 observers also contend that large increases in aid run the risk of creating recipient country dependenc from illdesigned projects created in the immediate aftermath of large infusions of funds to aid programs such situation does not square with the underlying notion that nations should eventually graduate from assistance they believe instead that us aid agencies should focus on quality programs that reward countries taking the necessary steps to promote their own development in other words aid polic should be concerned with outcome rather than input criticism also shared by thos

approach is consistent with the pari s declaration on aid effectiveness signed by oecd members including the united states in 2005 the paris declaration calls for donor coordination among other items such as measuring progress and recipient country involvement in development planningpolicy options the topic of foreign aid reform and reor ganization has existed nearly as long as foreign aid programs themselves in f act the creation of usaid in the kennedy administration was partly an effort to br ing coordination to aid programs that had developed across government agencies since then there have been numerous studies of how best to organize foreign ai d in order to increase its effectiveness and to support us interests21 there are at least three paths congress can consider with regard to policy options one is to maintain the status quo with all the attribut described herein second is to maintain the foreign assi stance act of 1961 as amended but further amend it to reflect the challenges of the 21st century and possibly to support different mix of assistance by refocusing goals strategies and programs as outlined below those include refocus assistance change or better define the role of the department of defense change the use of multilateral instruments and organizations and create unified budget another path and arguably more amb itious one is to reorganize the current aid infrastructure to achieve congressional objectives this could entail rewrite of the foreign assistance act of 1961 as ou tlined below structural reform options include elevate usaid to cabinetlevel department merge usaid into the state department create new aid agency with increased jurisdiction and improve interagency coordination reform options refocus assistance with the growth in objectives prioritie s and programs so reform proponents have suggested that donor countries should refocus their programs on more defined goals they suggest that countrys aid programs should focus

dod implements the imet and fmf programs although the funds are appropriated to the state department with decisions on recipients ma by the state departmentthat it would reduce the number of recipient

ne w government has proposed linking its aid to the good governance prac tices of recipient nations government officials have said that frances aid pr ograms should be streamlined with clear priorities and limited scope and should focus on one or two strategic aims24 refocused us aid program could be one that identifies limited number of objectives or priorities and then directs funding for t hose objectives the objectives chosen would have implications for the re gional distribution of aid as for example an objective to alleviate poverty would benef it africa at the expense of other regions at its most extreme this approach would entail dramatic scaling back of us aid activities that do not support the chosen focus and could also mean reduction in the number of countries receiving us assist ance less drastic refocusing could be similar to the process undertaken in 2006 th at produced the strategic framework for foreign assistance that linked assistance to five strategic objectives this approach as currently managed does not overcome problems of coheren ce and coordination among us government agencies changedefine role of defense department the role of the department of defense in foreign aid activities has increased in recent years largely in response to stab ilization and reconstruc tion activities in iraq and afghanistan the proportion of dod fo reign assistance has increased from 7 of bilateral official development assist ance in calendar year 2001 to an estimated 20 in 2006 defense activities include the provision of humanitarian assistance and training in disaster response countern arcotics activities nd capacity building of foreign militaries25 much of this assistance is managed by the defense security cooperation agency dsca the increased role of dod in foreign assistance has been debated both within military and civilian circles secretary of defense robert gates has stated that us civilian development assistance agencies need to be reinvigorated and that until theyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34243crs21 are strengthened the military will have to engage in reconstruction activities advocates of greater role for dod argu that the military is often in the best position with personnel on the ground to provi timely assistance in conflict and postconflict situations and in response to natural disast ers further they say dod has more flexibility in the allocation of assistance finally dod has the resources and technical capacity to provide timely assistance in many cases those who are concerned about the incr eased dod profile warn that it results from diminution of personnel expertise at usaid and state and that it will further contribute to this problem critics believe that dod is supplanting and eroding the traditional role of the state department and usaid agencies that critics argue should be in charge of these types of po licy decisions further they caution that there may not be the degree of coordination among these three entities that they argue is necessary to achieve us foreign polic objectives others believe however that requirements that involve th secretary of state in th decisionmaking process ameliorate this concern still others contend that dod programs can be duplicative and are better carried out by civilian agencies finally many believe that aid programs detract from dods primarily milita ry function any redesign of foreign aid programs w ould likely take into account the role of the defense department options for addre ssing the role of dod include making the defense security cooperation agency co managed entity between the department of defense and the department of state or moving the dsca into new aid agency another option is to bring the dsca under th control of an inte ragency coordinating mechanism change use of multilateral organizations in addition to bilateral assistance the united states contributes to multilateral institutions that carry out development activities these institutions include international and regional organizations such as the united nations and the organization of american states and multilateral banks such as the world bank inter american development bank asian development bank african development bank and european bank for rec onstruction and development since fy2000 the share of funds that th united states provides not including assessed dues to some international organizations has averaged little less than 8 of the total amount appropria ted for foreign assistance programs the lowest point occurred in

total foreign aid since 1981 decreases since 2003 can be attributed to th large increase in bilateral assistance in light of new initiatives such as pepfar and mcc congress may consider the desired level of us contributions to multilateral institutions there have been disagreements between the administration and congress on the use of multilateral institutions the debate on funding levels for the us contribution to the global fund fo r aids tuberculosis and malaria is one example where congress has consistently pr ovided more funds than requested by the administrationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34243crs22 26 it should be noted however that the unite d states does fund some large infrastructure projects through the millennium challenge account see crs report rl32427 the millennium challenge account by curt tarnoffproponents of greater use of multilate ral institutions believe that these organizations are better suited to carry out development activities because they can pool the resources of member nations and as result can bring more funds to any particular country or problem they argu that these organizations often fund large infrastructure projects activities in which usaid longer engages26 t h r s believe that they can tackle longterm development issues with longer and more consistent commitment of resources some also contend that multilateral institutions often have better cred ibility in recipient countries nd are not burdened by possibly poor relations that may exist between so donor and recipient countries those who advocate greater flexibility observe that multilateral assistance often is not subject to as many statutor restrictions in both appr opriations and authorization legislation critics of mu

how assistance is provided and to whom possibly resulting in situations where us funds are going to support governments with which the unite d states has serious policy differences others contend that

although program specifics would be developed by the agency providing the assi stance under this scenario funds would still be part of the various agencies but the budget request would be unified and presented by the head of the aid agency related option is to maintain the current function categories but have the admi nistration present congressional budget justification that includes all foreign assistance programs governmentwide proponents believe such unified budget or presentation would provide congress with fuller picture of the totality of foreign aid and assist in making policy decisions this option would also offer the possibility of being able to identify redundancies and inc onsistencies in progra ms critics would argue that reorganizing budget functions would be time

kingdoms department for internati onal development dfid27 as cabinet department it is believed that secret ary for development would be better able to work as an equal with ot her department heads in order to coordinate aid programs governmentwide it would so operationalize the rh etoric of elevating the importance of global development in addition there is the possibility that department would attract experienced velopment professiona ls who have left usaid as its operating budget has continued to decline some critics oppose the idea on the grounds that other equally important agencies are not in the cabinet and th at usaid should remain under the foreign policy direction of the secretary of state others believe that even as cabinet agency usaid would not be equal to the more powerful depar tments of state and defense some would also argue that usaid controls just 20 of foreign assistance28 with the remaining controlled by the state department and other independent aid agencies such as th millennium challenge corporation in addition the option does not formally provide for better governmentwide coordination merge usaid into state department as currently structured usaid is

argume nts are relevant in the current debate proponents note that the state department s aid budget already dwarfs that of usaid controlling nearly 64 of funds provided by foreign operations appropriations for fy200729 in addition supporters contend that having the secretary of state in charge of foreign assistance would raise its profile and result in better coordination of pr ograms located in other agencies current merger proposals call for the official in charge of aid at the state department to have high rank and for merger of the two foreign rvices so that usai d officials could be considered for ambassadorships opponents countered then as now that the state department and usaid have different and distinct missions the state department primarily focuses on resolving shortterm crises through diplomacy wh ile usaid pursues longterm development achievements that could be compromised by the departments need to shift funds for crisis management critics believe that aid policy would be diminished within state pointing out that moving usia into state in 1998 did nothing to raise the profile of public diplomacy and many would argue did the exact opposite critics also argue that the state department lacks both an interest in aid programs and the expertise in managing them view that was confirmed by recent gao report30 finally merger does not formally ddress

with private capital to carry out aid activities 32 for more information on coordinating mechanisms see crs report rl31357 federal interagency coordinative mechanisms varied types and numerous devices by frederick m kaiserwould have bureaus that correspond to functi ons such as humanitarian assistance and disaster response longterm development health security and military assistance trade and innovative programs such as mcc and the global velopment alliance gda31 while it may be politically difficult to move the programs of domestic agencies into this new entity system of liaison offices could be instituted instead for example say proponents centers fo r disease control nd prevention cdc and health and human services department hhs liaison office colocated in the health bureau would increase coor dination and program formation with all aid programs in its portfolio it is believed that the agency would be in better position to monitor and evaluate program effectiveness in this view it would also be able to provide the coor dination necessary to avoid duplication and programs working at cross purposes pr oponents say that reinvented aid agency would be able to enhance its human capital capacity by bolstering its cadre of development experts and that the agency would become the lead government entity on policy implementa tion and research on the other hand the proposal could be criticized for creating large new bureaucracy that may be better at managing foreign assistance than the current structure without clearly thought out st rategy and objectives to guide foreign aid the organization of aid delivery would matter little others believe that independent agencies have been created with specific mission and that those missions could well be downgraded or neglected in larger organization still others contend that development assistance with its focu s on poverty alleviation and longterm development should not be colocated with security and military assistance much for the same reasons they would argue th at usaid should not be merged with the state department improve interagency coordination there have been previous attempts to improve interagency coordination of aid programs the most often cited are the development coordination committee dcc and the international velopment cooperation agency idca both were considered unsuccessful however ther are other examples of interagency coordinating mechanisms outside of the aid field such as the national security council the director of the office of na tional drug control policy and the council on environmental quality32 the need for some type of coordination is evidenced by the growth in the number of agencies and departments that administer some type of foreign assistance program there is little coordination or joint policy development among these entities leading many observers to characterize us aid programs as fragmented and vulnerable to programs and agencies working at crosspurposes in many cases existing departme nts have adopted an aid co mponent in other caseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34243crs27 33 the usaid website states that over 50 sepa rate

and international military education and training managed by the state department nor does it include the costs of military operations there are number of options available to policy makers to improve interagency coordination these options range from main taining the current foreign aid structure with possible modifications to improve coordination creating coordinating entity with the authority to marshal the resources of various government entities or elevate usaid or successor aid agency within the national security council structure create coordinating entity this option would be similar to the development coordination committee dcc or the international development cooperation agency idca the dcc was authorized by sec 640b as an amendment to the foreign assistance act of 1961 to advise the president on the coordination of policie s and programs affec ting developing countries the dcc was established by executive order in 1973 with the usaid administrator as chair and figure 6 distribution of oda by agency cy2006 percentage of net oda bilateral and multilateral assistancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34243crs29 34 the dcc structure remains in the faa as an unimplemented provisionwas later revoked by executive order in 199934 the dcc reportedly did not function well for variety of reasons including lack of white house commitment to foreign aid programs and the difficulty in having an agency usaid trying to coordinate the activities of cabinet departments the international development coopera tion agency was inspired by proposed legislation to coordinate all government foreign assistance programs the agency created by president carter in 1979 by executive order was much weaker organization than that envisioned by its chief legislative s ponsor senator hubert humphrey considered understaffed and w ith jurisdiction limited largely to just usaid the idca ceased to function in the reagan administration any new coordinating entity would need commitment from the white house and strong leadership at its helm with th authority to coordi nate across department jurisdictions consideration could also be given to providing the position with authority to coordinate the foreign ai d budgets of all odacontributing agencies elevate aid agency within nsc structure the national security council nsc serves as the presidents principal forum for considering national security and foreign policy issues nd coordinating polic ies among government agencies the nsc was established by the national security act of 1947 pl 235 61 stat496 usc 402 by statute memb ers include the president vice president secretary of state and s ecretary of defense and by executive designation the secretary of the treasury and the assistant to the president for national security affairs the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff is the statutory military advisor and the director of national intelligence is the intelligence advisor other various department heads are invited to attend meetings as appropriate usaid participates at the nsc through the policy coordinati on committee pcc which is unit of the nsc charged with policy coordination the proposal to elevate u s aid agency within the structure of the nsc is predicated on three observations first the us national security strategy as articulated in 2002 and restated in 2006 elev ates global development as third pillar along with defense and diplomacy of national security yet little structural change has been made to reflect this elevation in the importance of usaids work second the lack of success in past attempts has been attributed to either lack of interest on the part of the white house and to the usaid administrator lacking the rank necessary to coordinate othe r cabinet departments third the current participation of usaid at the policy coordination co mmittee level may not be high enough to accomplish effective coordination there are numerous possible mechanisms to raise the status of development within the nsc structure congress could statutorily designate the head of us aid agency whether or not it is cabinetlevel to nsc membership as such this person would participate in all national securityrelated debates alternatively congress could designate an aid coordinator within the nsc with the authority to convene regular meetings with the relevant agency heads several committees exist within thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34243crs30 35 africa command works to become effective department of defense documents american forces information service news articles october 5 2007 and making room for civilians southcom organization could be model inside the army october 8 2007nsc such as the committee on transnational threats and the committee on foreign intelligence possible option is to create committee on foreign assistance with the central mission of developing aid policy and providing governmentwide coordination maintain status quo with or without minor modifications some policy makers may eschew the idea of fo rmal coordinating mechanism as creating an additional level of bureaucracy that would do little to improve aid effectiveness coordination exists at the field level among agencies represented at us embassies at policy planning level they can poi nt to the development of interagency coordination that has arisen among defense state and usaid at least two combatant commands southcom and africom are integrating civilian agencies at headquarters with the objective of coordina ting aid activities better at the newly operational africom plans are for senior state department foreign service officer to hold the position of deputy to the commander for civilmilitary activities35 with the increase in dod providing aid both the state department and usaid have created offices office of politicalmilitary affairs at state and the office of military affairs at usaid to manage the relationship advocates of less formal coordinating approach contend that aid levels of other agencies are small fraction compared to that provided by usaid state and dod combined which reached 76 of oda in calendar year 2006 there is also the possibility that the dfas mandate could be expanded to include all us foreign assistance although such an approach led by subcabinet officer may not result in the full cooperation of ll cabinet departments rewrite the foreign assistance act an issue in the current debate on foreig n aid reform is whether it is necessary or practicable to replace the current law governing us aid programs the foreign assistance act of 1961 faa as amended the debate may be resolved based on the degree of proposed reforms the more ambitious such as cabinetlevel aid agency would call for authorizing legisla tion to refocus assistance whether by region sector or purpose may not require new faa the foreign assistance act of 1961 has not been comprehensively reauthorized since 1985 instead congress has considered and enacted singleissue foreign aid legislation some of which ve been incorporated into the foreign assistance act these laws have authorized assistance to the former soviet union freedom

the act identifies over 33 major objectives 75 priorities and 247 directives36 for us aid many added through subsequent reauthorizations and amendments but does not prioritize them the history of changes to the faa has also produced what many believe is lis t of program restric tions conditions and reporting requirements that can be either outdated conflicting or both they further argue that other statutes pa ssed by congress as standalone legislation ie they were not incorporated into the faa complicate efforts to revise nd update current law to fully understand the implications of new gislation or the obstacles that exist in existing provisions and to provide coor dination and coherence to the complete complement of us aid programs others believe that comp lete rewriting of the faa is not necessary and that the political difficulties in passing such legislation may doom needed aid reforms for any priority listed in the faa th ere are likely supporters who would oppose its removal or lessening of the priority accorded to it instead they argue reform efforts should focus on policy developmen t coordination nd implementation of existing programs even more ambitious reforms except for the creation of new assistance entity could be accomplished with in the existing statutory framework that grants the president the necessary authorities to administer foreign aid
