homeowners in louisiana mississippi and alabama have protested what they view as inappropriate obstacles to the payment of their property damage insurance claims when insurance adjustors and damage experts assessed the properties damaged by the 2005 storms they were faced with the issue of allocating damages between wind covered loss and flood an excluded loss the delays and economic uncertainty that this activity has engendered have raised financial and legal issues for insurers as well as homeowners and businesses along the gulf coast region the solution for some of the insureds has been to litigate with their insurers under variety of legal theories with the objective of avoiding the standard water damage exclusiona move that would arguably allow insureds to receive coverage for water damage under their homeowners policies many of these theories rely on the principle that any ambiguity in the insurance policy should be construed in favor of the policyholder in addition even where the water damage exclusion is enforced difficult factual and legal disputes have arisen relating to the allocation of damage between covered wind damage and excluded flood damage in the aftermath of the devastating 2005 hurricane season three broad policy issues for the 110 th congress have emerged related to postkatrina economic uncertainties 1 the massive insured and uninsured property losses and their impact on gulf coast property insurance markets and rebuilding after katrina 2 assertions that insurers have shifted the cost of damages onto the federal flood program and us taxpayers and 3 unreliable government flood maps that are used in decision making by homeowners for purchasing insurance postkatrina insurance claims litigation and the economic uncertainty it generates for consumers and insurers raise concerns about the volatility in the legal environment in terms of postevent judicial interpretations in the scope of insurance coverage what should be done to mitigate the economic consequences of future floods are the american people and policymakers ready to address perceived weakness in the us floodplain management policy should the nation forgo development of its floodplains new policy initiative or continue along the current path embodied in the nfip finally insurance analysts have observed that large percentage of those eligible to buy federally subsidized flood insurance do not what could or should be done about this these and other policy questions have been examined in the 110 th congress on february 28 2007 the house committee on financial services

katrina the storm surges it produced and the subsequent levee failures caused devastating flooding in communities located along the gulf of mexico coast katrinas winds destroyed or substantially damaged many of the properties located on the mississippi gulf coast as well as property located further inland from the immediate coastal areas tens of thousands of homes and businesses in louisiana mississippi and alabama were damaged as direct result of katrinas storm surge many thousands more homes were condemned and left empty due to exposure to days and even weeks of soaking in oftencontaminated flood waters modern homeowners and business owners policies are often issued on an open perils or special causes of loss basis which provides that all direct physical loss or damage to insured property is covered except as specifically excluded some policies are still issued on named perils or specified perils basis by which the insurer promises to insure covered property only if damaged by listed perils and subject to certain exclusions under either approach damage by wind is typically covered while water damage from flooding wind driven water storm surge seepage or through openings in the building not cause by other damage is typically specifically excluded there are three main reasons that insurers utilize exclusions 1 the excluded peril or property is more appropriately insured under different insurance product or through an optional coverage eg exclusion in property policies for earthquake and mobile equipment 2 insurance is not an appropriate vehicle for transfer of particular risk eg exclusions in property policies for failure of appropriate maintenance or 3 the peril or property presents an unacceptable hazard to the insurer eg exclusions in property policies for nuclear or contamination event the water damage exclusion is thought to be the result of the first and third reasons for many homeowners and small businesses the only explicit insurance coverage against flood damage is underwritten by the national flood insurance program nfip but homeowners have not participated in sufficient numbers for various reasons as required by law 1 because of water damage exclusions and underutilization of available nfip coverage significant number of the thousands of properties damaged or lost through hurricanes katrina and rita were uninsured these storms have spawned numerous class actions and other litigation concerning insurance coverage for losses both uninsured and underinsured property owners have focused on the water damage exclusions in homeowners policies maintaining that they apparently should be made whole through government flood insurance homeowners insurance some combination of both or the government depending on each persons particular insurance coverage for example the insurance services office iso commercial policy wording cp 103004 02 with respect to the flood exclus ion provides the following we will not pay for loss or damage caused directly or indirectly by any of the following such loss or damage is excluded regardless of any other cause or even t that contributes concurrently or in any sequence to the loss 1 see lloyd dixon noreen clancy seth seabury the national flood insurance programs market penetration rate estimates and policy implications rand corporation march13 2006 located at

flowing or seeping through foundations walls floors or paved surfaces b basements whether paved or not or c doors windows or other openings but if water as described in g1 through g4 above results in fire explosions or sprinkler leakage we will pay for the loss or damage caused by that fire explosion or sprinkler leakage insurers take the position that these policies do not provide coverage for water damage resulting from such events as levee breaches or storm surge because of the policy exclusion for example the standard homeowners insurance policy language does not specifically identify storm surge but insurers insist that the breadth of the water damage exclusion encompasses such damage insurance coverage disputes and litigation over the policy exclusions have ensued between policyholders and their insurers the key coverage issue has been and will be whether damage or destruction to properties along the coastal regions was caused by winds typically covered under homeowners policies or by the flooding accompanying the storm typically excluded under homeowners policies with katrina the possibility exists that either wind or flood caused damageeither separately or working in combination disputes over causation are inevitable hundreds of millions and perhaps billions of dollars in potential insurance coverage will rest on the outcome of decisions rendered in the courts on february 14 2007 mississippis largest provider of homeowners insurance state farm fire and casualty company announced plans to suspend sales of new policies in the state because of what the insurer claims is an increasingly unpredictable business and legal environment 2 the decision is not expected to affect existing polic yholders state farm representative stated that the decision to curtail writing new policies was business decision to protect corporate assets in response to an adverse legal and political environment in the state3 state attorney general jim hood responded to

auto insurance in the state to provide homeowners and commercial insurance if they sell those policies elsewhere in the united states4 following the state farm announcement the concern raised by insurance regulators and policymakers is what to do about other insurers who might decide to retreat further from the gulf coast region because of the uncertainty of pending legal battles consumer advocacy groups expect other insurers to follow state farms lead as way to apply political pressure on the mississippi courts and legislature to deal with the insurance coverage issue 5 this report provides an analysis of postkatrina insurance issues in louisiana mississippi and alabama particularly as they have related to 1 the magnitude and impact of flooding 2 the way private insurers settle claims 3 the types and scope of policies and coverage and 4 how courts have determined whether coverage exists under property policies when both covered and uncovered risks combine to cause loss the report does not provide legal advice nor is it definitive assessment of the applicable law in each jurisdiction g22g145g142g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 g17g159g142g155g159g146g142g160g561 private insurers play central role in the functioning of the us economy not only because of their risktransfer function but also because of their ability to provide relatively easy access to sources of capital instability in the availability and price of coverage interruptions in the payment of claims immediately after disaster and the large numbers of uninsured or underinsured americans have led to pressure for government intervention in property insurance markets in the wake of katrinas massive flooding and uninsured property losses specific concerns have been expressed in congress not only about making sure that every insurance claim owed is paid but also that there is gulf coast insurance market after all the litigation is concluded in 1983 as result of adverse court decisions in which insurers were forced to pay floodrelated claims that insurers did not believe they were responsible to pay the property and casualty insurance industry revised its policy language in the exclusions in homeowners policies today almost all homeowners policies have water damage exclusion with anticoncurrent causation language 6 which according to insurers should have eliminated coverage for flooding including from storm surge and levee breaches not all water is excluded just the water damage described in the exclusion there are still several instances in which water damage is covered such as when 4 in addition to signing the new catastrophic insurance legislation the florida governor signed an emergency order suspending the right of insurers to cancel and nonrenew pending full implementation of the new law the florida insurance council an insurance company trade group initially challenged the validity of the governors order but later withdrew the legal challenge events in florida are not discussed in this report 5 joseph b treaster state farm ends new property coverage in mississippi new york times february 15 2007 p c2 6 the term anticoncurrent causation language refers to langua ge that is typically inserted in an insurance policy to make it as clear and unambiguous as possible that specific risk is not covered insurers use this type of language in contracts in an attempt to prevent policyholders from seeking coverage for losses they never intend to cover

question is how the courts will interpret the water damage exclusion or whether they will rule in favor of the claimants fo rcing insurers to pay billions of dollars to repair flood damage certain other insurancerelated issues have arisen such as concerns that some insurers inappropriately billed the federal flood insurance program for claims that should have been paid by the insurers wind

insurance reform and modernization act of 2007 was passed in the house to restore the financial solvency of the national flood insurance program hr 3121 includes provision to add optional multiple

aftermath of hurricanes katrina and rita three broad issues have emerged related to post katrina economic uncertainties the massive insured and uninsured property losses and their impact on gulf coast property insurance markets and rebuilding after katrina assertions that insurers have shifted the cost for damage to the federal flood program and fema for us taxpayers to pay the billie potentially huge uninsured property losses and the denial of thousands of katrina wind claims where insurers invoked the water damage exclusion and anticoncurrent causation clause in homeowners policies unreliable government flood maps that are used by homeowners lenders and realtors to determine whether flood insurance was needed first hurricanes katrina rita and wilma resulted in massive property losses for both private insurers and the national flood insurance program nfip in addition the total value of uninsured property damage and business interruption caused by katrina has been estimated at 135 billion12 congress has already appropriated 109 billion for disaster relief and recovery aid to affected communities plus more than 8 billion in tax relief13 table 1 shows that private insurers paid 605 billion in insured property damages caused by hurricane katrina rita and wilma this amount does not include claims filed under the nfip insurers are still assessing losses in terms of how they will affect ultimate claim payments for losses in 2005 including the total cost of litigating and settling wind v flood cases 11 bill mellander payouts hinge on the cause of damage new york time

policy adjusting and servicing legislative efforts are now underway in congre ss to reform the nfip on september 27 2007 the full house approved hr 3121 to restore the financial solvency of the national flood insurance program significantly hr 3121 would allow for the purchase of optional insurance that would cover flood and windstorm losses and extend the nfip five years through september

claims s 2284 however would forgive the programs outstanding debt to the treasury second hurricane katrina damaged or destroyed thousands of homes and businesses that were covered for wind damages but not water damage insurers have reportedly denied thousands of katrina wind claims by assigning all katrina damages to flooding covered by the nfip and not to their own windstorm policies insurers say

living in floodprone areas without adequate insurance protection this is despite that fact that structures in areas with at least 1 chance of flooding in any given yearthe socalled 100year flood or special flood hazard areas sfhasare required to have flood insurance if they have loan from federally insured or regulated lender the insurance must be in an amount of at least equal to the outstanding principal balance of the loan or the maximum available under the nfip whichever is less16 this requirement is based on two federal laws the flood disaster protection act of 197317 and the national flood insurance reform act of 199418 according to rand corporation nationwide study about 49 of singlefamily homes in sfha are covered by flood insurance the market penetration rate with substantial variations across geographic regions19 in addition about 1 of homeowners in nonsfhas purchase flood insurance coverage20 the purchase of flood insurance is voluntary outside sfhas researchers have explored factors influencing insurance purchase decisions21 they include the following millions of homeowners incorrectly believe that their standard homeowners policies automatically provide coverage against flooding when in fact an additional flood policy is needed people have misperception of risk and tend to underestimate their chances of being disaster victims and do not purchase flood insurance they have difficulty dealing with probabilistic information for small likelihood events because they need context in which to evaluate the data22 homeowners might think it is not good investment when comparing the insurance price of coverage per dollar against their estimate of the probability of total loss which they assume approaches zero there are economic disincentives to buying flood insurance because of free federal and charitable disaster assistance and the taxdeductibility of flood losses23 property owners often believe that disaster relief ie small business 16 these property owners or loans include 1 loans from federally regulated lending institutions 2 loans that are purchased by the federal national mortgage association fannie mae or the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac and 3 property owners who receive federal financial assistance for acquisition or construction purposes in sfhas in communities that participate in the nfip 17 pl

contents property owners sometimes selfprotect or selfinsurea substitute for formal insuranceby for example elevating their property above the base flood elevation bfe which serves to reduce both the probability of loss and the size of the potential costs homeowners might simply cancel their fl ood coverage without lenders taking action homeowners with mortgages issued by nonfederally regulated lenders are not subject to the mandatory flood purchase requirements in response to low levels of compliance with the mandatory purchase requirements and the financial challenges facing federal insurance program some insurance market analysts have proposed an overhaul of the nfip to address these and other programmatic issues 24 although fema does have an interest in ensuring high levels of compliance the agency must rely on federally regulated lenders government sponsored enterprises gses and federal agencies that provide financial assistance for construction and acquisition of property in sfhas to implement and monitor compliance with the mandatory purchase requirement some propose requiring all us homeowners to purchase flood insurance possibly the way liability insurance is required for automobile owners third thousands of residents along the gulf coast who relied on government flood maps to determine who must buy flood insurance were arguably unaware of their actual flood risk and uninsured when hurricanes katrina rita and wilma struck an issue for the 110 th congress therefore might be to decide what to do about flood maps that may be incorrectly measuring risk and therefore not capturing the nations exposure to flood risk critics of fema s flood map modernization efforts say these activities have been underfunded and lack focus many people in hurricane katrinas path did not have flood insurance because according to government flood maps they were not in floodplain and did not need coverage 25 on october 18 2005 the department of homeland securitys inspector general released report that raised concerns about the accuracy of flood maps26 the report concluded that outdated flood maps placed homeowners and residents at physical and financial risk because many people living in highrisk areas did not know of the dangers and therefore might not have chosen to participate in the nfip again according to rand corporation about onet hird of all flood

in the aftermath of hurricanes katrina and rita thousands of homeowners in louisiana mississippi and alabama face significant obstacles in getting their property damage insurance claims paid when insurance adjustors and damage experts assessed properties damaged by the 2005 hurricanes they were faced with the issue of allocating damages between wind covered loss and flood an excluded loss the ambiguity and economic uncertainty that this activity has engendered has raised financial and legal issues for insurers as well as homeowners and businesses along the gulf coast region the solution for some of the insureds has been to litigate with their insurers seeking to declare the wat er damage exclusion clause in their policies unenforceablea move that would arguably then allow insureds to receive coverage for flood damage under their homeowners policies allocating damages between covered wind damages and excluded flood damages has become question of fact to be decided by the courts

the location in many areas of new orleans for example the house contains clear waterline with or minimal roof damage along the mississippi coast many homes are completely destroyed with only slab remaining in those cases the factual investigation turns on an analysis of weather conditions and the construction of the home to determine the extent of wind damage that occurred prior to the destruction of the home by excluded storm surge policyholders and insurers can have different views on these facts which result in litigation from the industrys perspective claims are settled in the same manner they always have been with regard to the water damage exclusion that they assert has been well known among homeowners and state regulators for years insurers have argued that they settle claims fairly and in accordance with policy language and the historical treatment in court cases of storm surge associated with flooding during hurricane this is why insurers insist the federal government offers flood insurance in addition insurers note that they did not cover and therefore price the flood risk in the homeowners policies and hence did not set aside appropriate loss reserves to pay such claims 28 further insurers maintain that the uncertainty associated with the courts ex 27 peter whorisky risk estimates led to fewer flood policies washington post october 17 2005 p 1 28

substantially increases their risk ie paying flood insurance claims after the loss without actuarially accounting for this event before the loss could jeopardize their financial solven cy if they raise rates to reflect the increased risk their customers will pay more for coverage that is now provided by the nfip policyholders and their advocates have charged that insurers rely upon the flood exclusion and anticoncurrent causation policy language to not pay claims on homes damaged by combination of wind and flood from their perspectives in sistence on the unenforceability of the flood

katrina demonstrates apparent gaps in the legal system and its ability to respond to events of this magnitude this issue is important if communities are to be able to rebuild and recover in timely manner after major catastrophe in the short term congress might consider oversight and investigation hearings into postkatrina insurance claims issues and the regulatory impact this could have on the insurance market in the long term businesses including the insurance industry rely on predictable legal regime that will operate efficiently in an emergency situation in anticipation of another

damage and mitigate the consequences of future floods the aftermath of disaster often presents the opportunity to address multiple longstanding problems after hurricane katrina the floodplain policy response seems to have been to build bigger and better flood protections systemsie take nationwide inventory of the structural flood controls levees reinforce and strengthen them and expand requirements for insuring residual risks behind levees and da ms history 1920s1960s and 1993 midwest floods has showed that relying on structural means of controlling floods such as building levees and dams is not always the best flood control policy two broad policy options have been suggested that would 1 surrender land to the water new idea that would require forgoing development of floodplains and property buyouts or 2 continue along the current path embodied in the nfip ie risk assessment or mapping floodplain management and insurance protection but strengthen zoning laws and construction standards modernize flood maps and enforce existing mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements g11g151g156g158g155g138g151g140g142g561g20g142g143g152g155g150g156g561 large percentage

flood hazard because of the problem of adverse selection 31 and the perceived unprofitability and volatility of this line of insurance due to the absence of tools for technical risk rating or portfolio diversification since 1968 this gap in coverage has been filled by the purchase of federally subsidized flood insurance many homeowners incorrectly believe that their standard homeowners policies automatically provide coverage against flooding when in fact an additional flood policy will be needed this section provides an analysis and comparison of both federal flood insurance and the

uniformity in coverage and consistency in legal outcomes the basic forms are developed and written by the insurance services office inc iso 34 the standard homeowners insurance ho policy that iso publishes combines various personal insurance protections which can include losses on the home its contents loss of its use additional living expenses as well as liability coverage in the event the homeowner is sued and found legally responsible for damages there are seven types of iso standardized ho forms in general and consistent use of these ho 3 is the most common policy followed by ho4 and ho6 others that are less used are ho1 ho2 ho5 and ho8 the ho3 is special homeowners policycalled openperils that covers all perils except those specifically excluded by the policy such as earthquakes floods acts of god or war special insurance can be purchased for these possibilities including flood insurance and earthquake insurance the ho policy might also contain options called riders floaters or endorsements that can provide additional coverages for such items as art or coin collections for an additional premium state insurance departments are responsible for reviewing and approving all insurance policy forms and rates before the policy can be lawfully used by an insurer the approval process includes an examination of every word sentence and paragraph in the policy before the regulators are given the policy form for approval however it is standard practice in the industry for insurers to consult with actuaries and insurance underwriters to develop the policy language so that pricing is commensurate with the related coverage economic efficiencies are realized in this activity by utilizing certain industry organizations like the iso to develop the specific provision in standardform insurance policies and to file with the each state insurance department so that individual insurers can use them w ithout expending money and time that would be required to get the policy forms approved in every state in which they operate by standardizing the ho policy insurers hope that court interpretations of standard coverage forms provide consistent treatment of claimants thus when court determines the meaning of word phrase or clause in standard coverage form that interpretation triggers rewrite or adjustment to the policy language 34 the insurance services office inc iso

loss caused by or their equivalent the insuring clause in the ho 3 policy is statement of the promises the insurer makes to the insured as far as what perils and exposures are covered it varies greatly from policy to policy the problem is that when an insured cause wind joins with one or more additional causes flood which may be uninsured or may be insured under separate contract concurrent causation can be said to exist it is this concurrent causation that has generated so much litigation surrounding the wind v flood legal disputes litigation arises as to whether the damage was caused by an insured event or by an event which is either excluded from coverage or not within the scope of the policy

commercial and homeowners these policies are further divided by the type of risks insured namedperil risk or openperil risk named risk policies insure against physical loss or damage caused by various risks specified in the policy eg fire lightning explosion windstorm or hail smoke aircraft or vehicles riot or civil commotion vandalism sprinkler leakage sinkhole collapse and volcanic action openperil policies on the other hand insure against physical loss or damage caused by any risk that is not excluded or limited by the policy the distinction between namedperil and openperil policies becomes especially important in litigation under the namedperil policies courts have held that policyholder must first prove one or more of the named perils caused loss insurers must then prove that the loss is excluded in the policy under an openperil policy the policyholder must prove damage occurred to the insured property insurers must establish that an excluded risk caused the loss in some litigation addressing the water damage exclusion plaintiffs have contended that the water damage should be covered because it resulted from storm surge which was not specifically excluded peril recent federal court decision held that storm surge was within the policy definition of flood and the exclusion should apply 35 in another case involving water damage but that specifically covered winds or hail the court denied the insurers motion to dismiss hold that there was coverage for all damage caused by wind and winddriven rain but that losses directly resulting from storm surge were excluded by the water damage exclusion 36 applying mississippi law in the tuepker case the judge also held that the exclusionary language in the policy was invalid to the extent that it did not allow for consideration of the proximate cause covered wind or uncovered water of the insureds damage37 and further that at trial if the insured could prove its damage was sustained as result of covered perils its claim would be paid38 openperils policies cover many perils not covered by namedperils policies consequently the openperils policy provides broader coverage than namedperils policy and carries

water or wind and water is of considerable importance39 the reason is that flood exclusion language has been standard feature of homeowners insurance policies since around 1968 when the federal governments national flood insurance program nfip was established homeowners policies generally exclude coverage for flood damage insurers have not priced and therefore not collected premiums to pay for flood coverage an insurance policy usually specifies what causescalled hazards or perilsare covered it also specifies what effectscalled losses or damagesare covered and which perils and losses are excluded from coverage the insurance industry defines an exclusion as provision in an insurance policy that eliminates coverage for certain risks people property classes or locations the insurance policy language that sp ecifically excludes flooding is found in the perils insured against and exclusions section of the standard homeowners policy

alleged adverse impact on insureds of computerized claims settlement systems and products public interest advocacy groups have alleged that the insurance industry uses computer programs such as colossus sold by com puter sciences corporation csc or claims outcome advisor sold by the insurance services office iso to systematically underpay homeowners claims40 their argument is that these systems allow insurers to calibrate the amount of savings they want to generate to the detriment of their insureds claims adjustment under the nfip is different from that in the private homeowners insurance market the adjustment of federal flood insurance claims is conducted by property and casualty insurers who write and service nfip policies and claims under contractual agreement with the nfips write your own wyo pr ogram over 95 of nfips policies are written under this program private insurers enter into financial assistance subsidy arrangement whereby they agree to issue flood policies in their own names and take responsibility for policy administration claims processing marketing and sales private insurers handle all claims issued in their names and adjust and settle flood loss claims consistent with their general claims practices in adjusting 39 the controversial issue involving the allocation of damage between wind and water is not present in the commercial insurance marketplace because floodwater damage is covered to the extent an issue might arise it is with respect to sublimits for damage from flood for example commercial building could be insured for 200 million but with 30 million sublimit for flood 40 see j robert hunter propertycasualty insurance in 2007 overpriced insurance underpaid claims declining losses and unjustified profits january 8 2007

government wyo insurer is authorized to use staff adjusters or independent contractors selected and supervised by the company the wyo insurer also determines when and how adjusters will be compensated for their work on flood claims wyo insurers typically receive an expense allowance for policies written and claims processed and the federal government assumes total financial responsibility for underwriting losses insurers retain 15 of premiums written to cover commissions and salaries of agents and brokers they are also reimbursed for marketing operating and administrative expenses the expense ratio of the wyo appears to be about onethird of premiums 41 on january 18 2006 the collins center for public policy issued report that raised several specific concerns involving contracting with private insurance companies for nfip policy claims adjusting and servicing the issue paper indicated 1 wyo insurers had financial incentive to adjust claims in the best interest of the nfip because the federal government pays all claims and 2 the existence of conflicts of interest for wyo insurers and their agents when they attempt to adjust possibly competing claims against flood insurance offered by nfip and claims against their own policies for wind or other coverage 42 critics have charged that the nfip appears to have few systemic checks and balances to ensure that it is being administered correctly fema has responded to this charge by noting that wyo insurers are subject to certain standards and oversight as detailed in the nfips write your own program financial control plan requirements and procedures manual wyo insurers for example must comply with monthly financial and statistical transaction reporting requirements they are subject to review of operationsclaims underwriting customer service marketing and litigation activitiesevery three years to assure that each company is meeting its performance objectives and adhering to program standards and policies in addition wyo insurers are subject to biennial claims audit every two years and claims reinspection program that randomly reviews percentage of wyo insurers claims settlement practices congress may debate the wyo claims adjusting issue given that under legislation passed in the 109 th congress the department of homeland security inspector general was required to investigate and report to congress by april 1 2007 on whether insurers under the wyo program improperly attributed damages from hurricane katrina to flooding covered under the national flood insurance program rather than to windstorms covered by such insurers43 second is the issue of causation in the homeowners claims adjustment processa major source of insurancecoverage disputes between policyholders and their insurers ie whether loss was caused by winds typically covered under homeowners policies or flooding accompanying the storm typically excluded under homeowners policies causation is the key factor

caused by covered peril or in the case of all risk openperils policies peril that is not expressly excluded if the loss is caused by multiple factors mixed cases such as wind that is covered and flood that is not claims adjustment becomes more challenging both wind and flood for example might have worked together to cause the loss one may have followed directly from the other or the two may have arisen independently in either case the causal nature of the relationship between the perils has resulted in legal disputes between policyholders and their insurers in order to resolve these mixed cases the courts have developed various tests for situations in which an excluded peril and nonexcluded peril contributed to the loss with the most prominent being the efficient proximate cause doctrine and the concurrent causation doctrine 45

application of causation doctrinesconcurrent causation proximate cause efficient proximate cause and anticoncurrent causationin the context of hurricane katrina claims will depend on the type of insurance policy owned by the claimant the facts of the claim and the case law in the pertinent jurisdiction insurance lawyers have observed that every legally disputed case has unique features with different fact patterns and different levels and types of coverage that apply to each policyholder the next four sections examine causation doctrines or rules of insurance policy interpretation that could be used in understanding the tension between intended meaning in policy language and interpretation of certain provisions

supporting the flood exclusion the principle of concurrent causation holds that if two causes combine to produce loss or damage and one of the two causes is excluded eg flood and the other is covered eg windstorm the loss will be covered absent policy wording to the contrary46 proximate cause and efficient proximate cause are variations on concurrent causation continued be linked to preexisting structural deficiencies or to outside forces such as vandalism mold in buildings may have been there before any flooding yet another issue is damages resulting from the levee break key question is what is the chain of causation the breach of levees built by government authorities would presumably involve two entirely independent causes that combine to result in loss or damage but neither set the other in motion in this case coverage under policy is equally available to an insured whenever an insured risk constitutes simply concurrent proximate cause of the injuries policyholders have been able to argue successfully that while policy might exclude flooding it did not exclude the independent concurrent cause of negligence in design or maintenance of levees in other words because the loss resulted from the occurrence of an excluded hazard and covered hazard it should be covered 45 seth tucker and annkelley kemper hurricane katrina insurance coverage issues covington burling october4

the proximate cause concept is particularly important in the chain of causation arguments involving wind versus flood claims following major hurricane under the proximate cause concept if policy covers fire not only is the direct damage by fire covered but the collateral smoke damageas well as damage from the water used by firefightersis treated as loss by fire the key is that the damage must actually have been caused by the fire and any collateral damage that did not break the chain of causation proximate cause may impose limits on scope of legal liability because determining the cause of loss can only be based on what is administratively possible and convenient ie it may not be determinable with precision

by some courts to allocate losses when damage results from combination of both covered and excluded causes thus in the event of multiple causes for loss the efficient proximate cause doctrine allows payment under the policy if the nonexcluded cause is the dominant cause of the loss ie the one that sets the others in motion notwithstanding that an excluded peril may have contributed to the loss47 attorneys and the courts frequently utilize the but for rule in determining how far back the chain of causation should go the rule as applied to the windvflood coverage dispute says that but for the particular event eg wind the loss experienced by the plaintiff would not have occurred even when the loss and the covered event are separated by chain of events that include floods as in any insurance coverage litigation involving whether coverage should be available when both covered wind and excluded flood losses are part of chain of events there are differences of opinion on the proper scope of th efficient proximate cause doctrine particularly whether the cause is considered minor or major factor in producing the injury or damage

and the courts reinterpretation of the flood exclusion language that has led to unanticipated exposures insurers have sought to draft file and get state approval of policy language to make it as clear and unambiguous as possible that damage due to flood is covered hoping to avoid the unexpected consequences of future adverse court decisions insurers sought to implement industrystandard language designed to cover all risks not specifically excluded by the contract language the anticoncurrent causation doctrine was designed to prevent the theory of concurrent causation from providing coverage for losses never intended to be covered by standard property insurance policies plaintiffs attorneys however frequently argue that the exclusions are in violation of public policy 47 for expert

decisions to the contrary the efficient proximate cause doctrine has been adopted by the highest courts of mississippi louisiana and alabama48 courts in these three states have interpreted the doctrine to allow policyholders to recover for hurricanerelated sses where their evidence showed that wind was the proximate cause of the damage even if flooding contributed to the loss to attempt to defend against the claim insurers must counter the in sureds evidence with evidence tending to prove that the proximate and efficient cause was one that falls outside of the coverage of the insurance policy49 recently decided cases specifically in mississippi suggest that the federal courts will enforce the flood exclusion to the extent the damage is caused by flood not wind and rain but will not enforce anticoncurrent causation language wher it would eliminate coverage for otherwise covered damage50 in addition because insurers bear the burden of proving allocation of loss between windrain covered and flood excluded insurers will likely be held liable for paying all katrina damage for which the cause of loss cannot be definitely established51

doctrine to uphold or not uphold coverage in favor of policyholders most states and jurisdictions have regulations and rules on claims handling that provide certain protection to policyholders most states have adopted version of the national association of insurance commissioners naic model unfair claims practices act that governs how insurers must deal with claimants these statutes require insurance companies to handle claims with good faith and fair dealing insurers for example must pay claims according to standards of practice which is within 30 days after receipt of proof of lossie

policyholders typically use the valued policy statutes to gain coverage in cases where both wind and water caused damage to the property valued policy statutes require insurers to determine the value of the property being insured at the time policy is written and to pay that full value to the insured when there is total loss caused by covered peril the insured is not required to prove the value of the damaged property building is considered total loss when the necessary repair costs are more than 50 of the value of the building both louisiana and mississippi have enacted valued policy statutes as follows the louisiana valued policy statute provides that under any fire insurance policy insuring inanimate immovable property in this state if the insurer places valuation upon the covered property and uses such valuation for purposes of determining the premium charge to be made under the policy in the case of total loss the insurer shall compute and indemnify or compensate any covered loss of or damage to such property which occurs during the term of the policy at such valuation without deduction or offset unless different method is to be used in the computation of loss in which latter case the policy and any application therefore sha ll set forth in type of equal size the actual method of such loss computation by the insurer the mississippi valued policy statute provides that insurance company shall knowingly issue any fire insurance policy upon property within this state for an amount which taken with any existing insurance thereon exceeds fair value of the property nor for longer term than five years when buildings and structures are insured against loss by fire and situated within the state are totally destroyed by fire the company shall not be permitted to deny that the building or structures insured were worth at the time of the issuance of the policy the full value upon which the insurance is calculated and the measure of damages shall be the amount for which the building and structures were insured mississippi has an instructive precedent regarding the water damage exclusion under mississippi common law where there is damage caused by both wind and rain covered loss and flood excluded loss the amount due under the policy will generally depend on the proximate and efficient cause of the damage ie hurricane wind even if other non covered causes also contributed to the loss53 florida case found that the states valued policy statute did in fact require payment of the face amount of the windinsurance policy because the insured property was damagedat least in partby covered peril wind54 the special concurrence in mierzwa would have required that the proximate cause of the damage be the covered peril wind and not merely as the majority held that it be some part of the cause of the damage but agreed with the majority result because 53 see grace v lititz mutual insurance co 257 so 2d 217 miss 1972 54 mierzwa v florida

however was amended after the mierzwa decision to specifically allow for the pro rating of damages caused by both covered and noncovered peril except if the covered perils alone would have caused the

recoveries that may be inconsistent with my prior rulings the agreement pursuant to which the insurers liability is limited by the amount of recovery under separate flooddamage policies does not provide for any exception for situations in which the fair market value or the actual cash value of the insured property is equal to or greater than the combined limits of flood coverage limits and the coverage limits in the state farm policies 60 in addition the court was bothered by state farms indirect control over the claims handling procedure because the appointment by state farm of special

3121 to restore the financial solvency of the national flood insurance program chairman barney frank had introduced hr 1682 an earlier version of hr 3121 on march 26 2007 hr 3121 would make the nfip satisfy traditional criteria for actuarial soundness by phasing out discounted premiums hr 3121 would also 1 allow the federal emergency ma nagement agency fema to increase flood policy rates by 15 year up from 10 2 increase the programs borrowing authority to 215 billion from 208 billion 3 raise civil penalties on federally regulated lenders who fail to enforce mandatory purchase of flood insurance for mortgage holders 4 increase program participation incentives 5 add coverage for wind as well as water damage as outlined in hr 920 and 6 encourage the revisions to flood maps the bill passed the full house on september 27 2007 on november 1 2007 senator christopher j dodd introduced s 2284 flood insurance reform bill designed to increase the amount of premiums collected reduce the cost of expected claims under the nfip s 2284 would also forgive the programs outstanding debt to the treasury on february 16 2007 senator patrick leahy and representative peter defazio introduced the insurance industry competition acts of 2 007 s 618hr 1081 which would amend the mccarranferguson act of 1945 to give the federal trade commission and the justice department oversight over ensuring that insurers comply with federal antitrust laws the mccarran ferguson act allows collaborative industry practices like the development of standardized policy language which makes it easy for consumers to compare policies and prices on january 12 2007 senator bill nelson and representative kendrick b meek introduced the commission on catastrophe disaster risk and insu rance acts of 2007 s 292hr 537 to create federal bipartisan commission to study catastrophe insurance markets in katrinas aftermath and make recommendations to congress regarding the ava ilability of insurance for catastrophic risks the commission would establish forum for both the insurance and consumers to address post katrina insurance issues finally the 109 th congress enacted the department of homeland security appropriations act of 2007 that included provision that directed the dhs inspector general to investigate and report to congress on whether insurers under the nfips writeyourown program improperly attributed damages from hurricane katrina to flooding covered under the national flood insurance program rather than to windstorms covered by such insurers the section of the dhs appropriations act reads as follows the department of homeland security inspector general shall investigate whether and to what extent in adjusting and settling claims resulting from hurricane katrina insurers making flood insurance coverage available under the writeyourown program pursuant to section 1345 of the national flood insurance act of 1968 42 usc 4081 and subpart c of part 62 of title 44 code of federal regulations improperly attributed damages from such hurricane to flooding covered under the insurance coverage provided under the national flood insurance program rather than to windstorms covered under coverage provide by such insurers or by windstorm insurance pools in which such insurers participatedthe department of homeland security inspector general shall submit report to congress not later than april 1 2007 setting forth the conclusions of such investigation 66 66 pl 109295 120 stat 1357

that the nfip flood coverage and the private market wind coverage are provided under separate coverage forms many times by separate insurers and often through separate distribution mechanisms congress might choose to focus on the identified problem flood and wind coverages do not intersect the nfips wyo program works today because the flood policy is typically sold by the same personal lines agent and through the same personal lines insurer that offer the basic property policy the challenge for policymakers and insurers is to develop better coordination between flood and wind coverage major problem with the current system of flood risk mapping is the incorporation of the latest information on risk when there is evidence that risk levels are rising or that risk was previously underestimated it can be difficult to get the appropriate adjustments approved as an illustration climatologists have observed that the nation is in period of higher hurricane activity and rising sea levels the nfips coastal storm surge flood zones at any return period may extend further inland than are shown on the official fema flood maps as result the construction of buildings at dangerously low elevations will continue to be permitted in 2006 fema announced it was in the process of issuing new flood maps for the city of new orleans and areas of mississippi until such time as these maps are available fema has issued advisory base flood elevations bfes which direct areas protected by levees to elevate substantially damaged homes and businesses to 3 feet above the highest adjacent existing grade on site or the current bfe on the flood insurance rate map whichever is higher nfip has low level of market penetr ation despite requirement that many policyholders purchase nfip coverage much lower than expected number do many of those that claim wind flood issues appear to be attacking the private insurance policys flood exclusion because the policyholder did not purchase nfip coverage congress faces relatively low levels of participation in the nfip is there need for national catastrophe insurance solution the media has made references to insurance affordability and availability issues in many parts of the nation one solution offered is to have the federal government assume wind risk on nationwide basis hurricane katrina resulted in recordsetting insured and uninsured property damages sharply higher insurance rates and insurance availability problems for homeowners and businesses in coastal areas because of rising cost or dissatisfaction with in surers growing number of homeowners and small businesses in louisiana and mississippi are reducing insurance coverage or dropping it altogether statesponsored catastrophe insurance pools suffered record losses and experienced major deficits following hurricanes katrina and rita these indications of financial distress might be considered precursors to potential market failure some question however whether federal disaster legislation is needed if private sector wind insurance coverage is sufficient in nonhurricaneprone areas

failure exists outside of hurricaneprone gulf and atlantic coast areas insurance market failure could justify federal government intervention one possible precedent can be seen in flood insurance in the decades of the 1920s through the 1960s private insurers were unwilling and unable to provide flood coverage in response the federal government created the national flood insurance program nfip in 1968 while the private insurance sector failed to provide flood coverage these same firms have always been willing and able to offer wind coverage to property owners residing outside of hurricanepr one areas some question whether or not states need to disband well functioning system as part of nationalization of wind insurance if the federal government offers optional wind insurance coverage in nfipdesignated communities not subject to hurricane risk and where private insurers now offer coverage at affordable prices the availability of federal wind insurance coverage could arguably compete directly with the private insurance industry the insurance availability and affordability problem seems localized but some have proposed national solution in order to avoid market competition national wind insurance program could target areas where the insurance regulator approved the wind damage policy exclusion peril and there are signs of insurance market failure government insurance only appears cheaper than private insurance federal insurance programs like any of the state catastrophe funds or federal insurance programs appear cheaper up front than they really are because government can use taxpayer capital without compensating the taxpayer government can provide an upfront cost of insurance that is actuarially sound for much less than private insurers this is how the nfip has functioned to date now there is call on the taxpayers capital in the form of 22 billion deficit analysts ask how was the taxpayer compensated for taking that risk if nfip was private company then it would have had to acquire capital from investors andor reinsurersand pay them for that capital government can implicitly tax the taxpayer preevent by shifting the risk to large future postevent expenditures thereby denying taxpayers compensation for that risk in this way government can make insurance appear cheap on the front end but with enormous postevent costs
