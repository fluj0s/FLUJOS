responsible for the conduct of amphibious operations in support of the full spectrum of us national security objectives if the marines need armored fighting vehicles in the early stages of an amphibious landing these vehicles must either be transported by landing craft with limited protection against enemy fire or the armored vehicle must come ashore under its own power1 like current aa vs the efv is designed to roll off navy amphibious assault ship move under its own power to the beach and cross the beach and operate inland the efv is to be designed to be able to be launched 25 miles off shore the aa v can be launched only 2 miles from shore permitting the fleet to operate over the horizon where it theoretically would be less vulnerable to enemy fire some suggest that the 25mile over the horizon operating capability may longer provide the protection to the fleet that it once did noting that the hezbollah c802 cruise missile which successfully struck an israeli ship in 2006 has maximum range of 75 miles concerns also have been raised that when ashore the flatbottomed efv may be excessively vulnerable to improvised explosive devices ieds

threeperson crew that can carry 17 combatequipped marines it is to be selfdeploying highspeed amphibious vehicle that will be able transport marines from ships to objectives inland and will have the speed maneuvering capabilities fire power and protection to operate with main battle tanks on land it is intended to have 20knot speed in the water and 345mile range ashore with 45 kilometerperhour speed on hardsurfaced roads the efv is to be designed to have modular armor and expanded mine blast protection and mount 30mm highvelocity cannon in stabilized turret the efv is also supposed to be able to communicate in joint networks and operate as part of joint land force there are to be two efv variants the evfp1 will carry marine rifle squad and its equipment and provide direct fire support

rebaselined in november 2002 adding an additional year to the program schedule and then rebaselined again in march 2003 also adding another year to the program schedule9 in december 2004 efv prototypes experienced major failures of the hull electronics unit heu the vehicles main computer system10 these failures caused the watermode vehicle steering to freeze making the vehicle nonresponsive the efv also experienced significant problems in september and october 2004 with the bow flapa folding panel extended forw ard to generate additional hydrodynamic lift as the efv moves through the water 11 the efv experienced myriad hydraulics system failures leaks and pressure problems during testing that contributed to low reliability ratings because of reliability problems the originally required 70hour mean time between operational mission failure mtbomf rate for the efv was reduced by the marines to 435 hours because of these demonstrated failures and related concerns about lack of program management and oversight the program was rebaselined for third time in march 2005 this time adding an additional two years to the extra two years added during the previous rebaselinings g344g342g342g348g561g17g153g142g155g138g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g3g156g156g142g156g156g150g142g151g157g343g344g561 in 2006 the efv was subject to an operational assessmenta series of tests to demonstrate that it could meet performance requirementsthat if successfully completed would permit the program to move into the production phase during this assessment the efv experienced numerous critical failures and because of repeated breakdowns the efv failed to meet reliability requirements and failed the assessment for example during the test the vehicles were able to operate for only 45 hours between breakdowns and required about 34 hours of corrective maintenance for every 1 hour of operationa maintenance burden that evaluators said would wear out unit under realistic combat operations poor reliability also resulted in 117 operational mission failures and 645 unscheduled maintenance actions during testing the efvs low reliability resulted in the efv completing 2 out of 11 attempted amphibious tests 1 out of 10 gunnery tests and none of the 3 scheduled land mobility tests the efv prototypes tested were approximately 1900 lb too heavy to achieve the desired high water speed and in some circumstances could not accommodate equipment needed by marines for special climatic conditions evaluators also noted significant problems in terms of limited visibility excessive noise and difficulty in reloading the efvs main gun 9 ibid pp 89 dod has been known to rebaseline programs change the programs estimated cost and schedule so they are more accurate

2006 operational assessmen t the marines went back to the drawing board13 in february 2007 the efv program office issued sources sought notice requesting information from industry leaders on tracked combat vehicles that can provide an alternative design concept of the efva perceived vote of confidence in general dynamics by the marines also that month the navy formally advised congress that the efv program would incur cost breach requiring program recertification under the nunnmccurdy act 10 usc 2433 14 finally in late february 2007 the navy announced that it would have to relax efv performance and reliability requirements in order for the program to continue in march 2007 the marines modified the original sdd contract nd awarded general dynamics an additional 1435 million to redesign the efv 15 in what has been termed the largest program setback the marines decided in june 2007 to repeat the entire sdd phase meaning that instead of the original completion date of 2003 the sdd phaseif successfulwill now be completed in 2011 eight years behind the original schedule 16 in august 2008 the marines and general dynamics signed sdd ii contract and work on seven new efv prototypes is expected to begin in january 200917 these new prototypes are expected to include rewired electronics to better protect against sea water rebuilt and strengthened gun turret that should improve ammunition feed to the main gun and the addition of trim tabs to make the efv more stable in the water the new efvs are scheduled to be built at the us militarys joint tank production facility

environment has changed so significantly since the efvs inception that both the fleet and the efv face greater risks than anticipated 25 the navy and marines envision that future conflicts will require persistent presence in littoral areas characterized by landbased antiship cruise missiles mines and small fast suicide boats twenty years ago when the efv was conceived some defense officials suggested that the fleet could operate 25 to 30 miles from shore debarking efvs for amphibious operations but with the advent of these new enemy weapons and tactics this is longer possible instead in order to sufficiently protect the large amphibious ships that transport marines and efvs it has been suggested that the fleet might need to operate at least 100 miles from shorebeyond the efvs range if there are new developments in enemy weapons and tactics between now and 2025 when the efv is scheduled to reach full operational capabilitythe vulnerability to the fleet could increase further another potential issue is the efvs vulnerability to ieds some in congress are concerned that the flatbottomed efv with 16inch ground clearance would be highly vulnerable to ieds that detonate under vehicles 26 the marines contend that v shaped hull on the efv to better protect it from ied blasts would force total redesign of the efv instead the marines propose that once ashore armor could be applied to the underside of the efv solution that has met with congressional skepticism recent study by the center for strategi c and budgetary assessment csba titled the us marine corps fleet marine forces for the 21st century advocates cancelling the efv in favor of an armored combat vehicle optimized for modern land warfare with modest ability to traverse water obstacles and combine it with highspeed shallowdraft ship to shore connector eg highspeed lighterage aircushioned landing craft 27 the primary argument is that this solution 21 report 110652 duncan hunter national defense author

weapons regimes that will threaten naval forces at increasing distances at sea and marine corps ground forces ashore28 this approach may become an alternative if the efv proves to be too unreliable or expensive to field but any type of ship such as the suggested improved navy lighterage system or ground combat vehicle modified light armored vehicle v or the proposed marine personnel carrier mpc 29 might also be equally as vulnerable to antiarmor and precision weapons one proposal to address this vulnerabilityan active protection system aps such as the one being developed for the armys future combat system fcsmay be potential solution but it is not known if the aps can be readily adapted for maritime use30 the assertion that the mpc and surface transport would have the additional benefit of nearly doubling the intended purchase thereby lowering the perunit cost and simplifying related logistics issues within the service merits detailed examination but any such examination should acknowledge that abandoning efv altogether will result in significant sunk cost that should be factored into any decisions related to the affordability of efv alternatives

second attempt at sdd while reports suggest that an earlier requirement for prototype reliability demonstration has been dropped there will likely be series of operational tests similar to those conducted in 2006 given the efvs poor reliability and performance in the past it is possible that new tests might be even more rigorousin part to restore confidence in the efv program general dynamics has predicted that it will achieve 607 hours mean time between operational mission failure mtbomf with its new efv prototypes 31 despite claims that the second sdd phase is going well it is possible that the 16 million per vehicle efv may again perform poorly in operational testing if this is the case it would likely be difficult to justify third sdd phase and it would probably not be operationally feasible to reduce the 573 efv requirement any further to cut program costs given this potential scenario it might be prudent to examine possible contingencies such as the aforementioned csba proposal should the efv perform poorly on upcoming operational tests g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 andrew feickert
