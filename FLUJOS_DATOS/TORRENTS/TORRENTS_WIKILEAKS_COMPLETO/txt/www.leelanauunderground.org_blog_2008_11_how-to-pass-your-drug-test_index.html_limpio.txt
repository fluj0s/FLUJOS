leelanau talk blog how to pass your drug test november 16th 2008 tags drug tests guides howtos print this shit everywhere weed leave comment trackback the leelanau school has an extremely invasive policy when it comes to drug testing last year they even started to implement drug testing on random basis even to kids who were model students find out how to pass your drug test what causes false positives and your rights when it comes to testing why is drug testing wrong because what you do with your body and what you put into it is your business not anybody elses regardless of what you consented to in your applications it doesnt change the morality of the issue if youre using drugs it doesnt matter what drugs youre using or when youre using them as long as you dont hurt anybody in the process its none of their business drug testing is also wrong because its extremely invasive getting tested can be an embarrassing situation even if youre just taking baseline testing can reveal number of things about you that you dont want revealed such as what medications you take or whether you are having issues peeing on command for somebody who does taking these tests is never fun it can also be embarrassing if you are singled out for drug test if you take pride in staying abstinent it doesnt look good when you get pulled in for test especially when the school doesnt tell you if you pass they dont tell you if you pass only if you fail drug testing is not even used for its proclaimed purposes its mainly used as scare tactic in order to perpetuate culture of fear every time we are subjected to testing it reinforces the idea that we are sujects of the school and that our free will is limited for example drug testing is brought up in situations like quiet period and before prom where administrators threaten kids with drug tests in order to stop kids from doing drugs again their business the school says that theyll be screening more or screening everybody if drug testing were really to detect members of the community who used drugs it would be applied on regular consistent basis as opposed to the haphazard schedule it has been on in the past the school also targets students who skip class or act up for more drug tests than regular this basically subjects students to embarrassing situations when they arent acting perfectly like making them walk down the hall in embarrassing clothes the geneva convention has long outlawed embarrassing prisoners shouldnt we apply the same standards to our students if youre acting up in class asking questions or bringing up controversial topics you might just be singled out for additional testing my question is if your drug use isnt disrupting the learning environment or causing problems why should the school even care in other words if they cant tell why does it matter why drug testing doesnt work drug tests can prove that you used or were in the vicinity of people using drugs but they dont prove when that occurred what if you were around people using drugs on fall or spring break the test assumes you have done drugs while in school and you are punished according to that assumption if youre dealing with drugs like weed whose active chemical thc is fatsoluble you may have used it long time ago thc is stored in fat cells when it is used and if you gain weight after using it then that thc can be stored in your body for months and months if you start losing weight you might just start failing your drug tests drug tests are also subject to numerous false positives false positive is when the drug tester says your urine sample contained drug when it did not here is an incomplete list of things that might cause false positives on your drug test if you fail drug test and can prove you have taken any of these things or can come up with an even semiplausible story bring it up with school administrators thc weed dronabinol marinol ibuprofen advil nuprin motrin excedrin ib etc ketoprofen orudis kt

received baseline testing upon enrollment if student failed baseline test heshe would be subject to random or planned testing from then on as decided by an administrator if student failed test and tested positive for hard drugs such as heroin or unusually high amounts of drugs such as weed you would be subject to forced counseling and put on random screening program the school could also screen people at random or when they were suspected of using drugs ie skipping class acting funny asking questions etc what are my rights as student i am not lawyer but i do know lot of law if youre seriously considering doing something about being forced to be tested then be sure to contact lawyer when you enroll in the leelanau school you agree to be subject to drug testing under certain conditions random if they have reason to believe you have been using drugs etc if you are forced to take tests for reasons not covered by that release you have grounds to take legal action if the school forces you to take drug test through coercion such as physical violence or physically forcing you into the testing room threatening you etc then you have grounds for legal action all the drug testing release form does is insure that you cant sue because they required you to take test for enrollmentgraduation medical decisions are yours to make and the school may not force you to take drug test they can encourage you by subjecting you to dorming suspension etc but they may not use force to make you take one there are certain conditions under which school may refuse you diploma and im not sure if refusing drug test is one of them id need to research that little more if you refuse to take drug test the school cant take any type of legal action against you as patient it is your right or your guardians depending on your age and the situation youre in to refuse any type of medical treatment on any ground if the school punishes you for exercising your rights as patient there might be grounds for legal action also courts and the media tend to be sympathetic to kids when they assert their rights as patients even when it is technically the decision of their parents how long will it stay in my system for occasional healthy users weed will stay in your system for 710 days as for other drugs im not so sure how to pass the condom method if you know you have drug test coming up this is the safest option since the school does not physically watch you pee this works some schools do this however its extremely invasive and many times borders on sexual harassment you didnt agree to let them watch you so they have right to what youll need condom regular nothing fun or good tasting or anything it might mess up the test safety pin some clean urine urine from somebody who hasnt done drugs recently the school cant trace this back to them hand warmers available at minimarts etc something to keep the condom attached to you tape pocket etc 1 find somebody with clean urine have them fill up the condom with urine and tie it off 2 if you have test coming up anything after this second wrap hand warmers around the condom to keep it warm you can also tape it to the inside of your leg but it wont stay quite warm enough and youll have to spend some time warming it up before you give it to the nurse 3 right before the test or whenever possible conceal the condom you can put it in pocket tape it to your leg etc 4 once youre in the bathroom shut the door take out your safety pin and poke the end of the condom letting the urine stream into the sample cup 5 wash off the urine around the cup to make sure you dont get the nurses hands all dirty if they say its too cold say its because you washed it off because you figured they didnt want to get their hands dirty there have been situations where the nurses have refused samples because they were too cold and made students give another one 6 walk away knowing youve passed your drug test if your friend who gave you the urine was honest with you if youll need to pass lots of drug tests this method is bit easier what you need catheter two pairs of boxes rubber tubing needle and thread and some hand warmers 1 cut square piece out of one of the pairs of boxers 2 sew the piece you cut out onto the fly zone ie the area where your penis goes through this makes an area to put the catheter 3 cut rubber tube to few inches and attach it to the end of the catheter 4 fill the catheter with clean urine and put hand warmer next to it in the pouch 5 when you take the test flip the lever and pass how to pass the niacin method warning i am not doctor taking niacin can be dangerous i suggest that you talk to doctor before taking niacin and follow all instructions on the package if you have liver damage history of liver problems in your family diabetes or anything that could make you more likely to experience liver failure do not take niacin taking niacin can be dangerous some people say niacin helps flush you out so youll pass your drug test from what i understand it only helps you pass drug tests if youve been using fatsoluble drugs like weed ive always taken niacin before tests but im not actually sure how much it helps i know it does something because i have noticed that it delays the effect of drugs in this case dramamine for up to eight hours i hear from people who are experienced in faking drug tests that its hit or miss and from others that its surefire youre more likely to pass the test if its been while since you used drugs and everything is out of your bloodstream niacin is available at drug stores meijers and grocery stores its expensive so split the cost with somebody you know if you have liver problems youll want to ask doctor before taking it whatever you do dont buy the flush free niacin its completely worthless taking niacin for extended periods of time or in large amounts can cause liver damage so please be careful when using it remember overdosing on niacin is dangerous duh see this article for more information i hear that you should take one niacin pill at least one hour before your test and then it will last for eight hours supposedly it opens up your capillaries so that more blood can pass through them making the likelihood that thc will end up in your bloodstreamfat higher and the likelihood that it will end up in your urine lower depending on how much water youve had your weight etc you will experience varying levels of sideeffects if youre low on water it will give your skin burningcrawling sensation which is just horrible for this reason and to help dilute your urine drink lots and lots of water before and during the niacin dose it will also make you look flushed blotchy etc to make yourself feel better it can help to take cool shower whatever you do dont itch move around lot or wear lots of clothes as this will only make it worse even better take it naked i swear it helps keep peeing until your test and then hope for the best if anybody has any experience with niacin i would appreciate hearing their stories so i can make this section more accurate how to pass dilution there are several ways to do the dilution method it relies on the principle that the more diluted ie the more water your urine has it is the sample is the less drugs will be present in it method one dilution via external sources sometimes when you take your drug test they will put tablet in the toilet that makes the water blue this totally defeats this method if theres tablet then pee into the toilet and then put the urine from the toilet in your cup you can also fill the sample cup about halfway with water and then fill the rest with your own urine pretty simple make sure that the urine is yellow enough or they might make you take the test again the school has been known to keep kids in the bathroom for over an hour who ran out of urine so be wise method two dilution via drinking drinking lots of water dilutes your urine if you drink tons of water the week leading up to your test but none the day of it wont do much for you you have to be wellhydrated at the time of the test good way to check how hydrated you are if the colour of your urine clear urine indicates you have been drinking lot of water if you drink enough and its been long enough since you took the drugs in question youll pass the test pretty simple how to pass breaking the test if youre really desperate ie you will test positive for high levels of heroin or something along those lines you can botch the test by putting some bleach in it this will show up as an invalid test but it might buy you some time how to pass general tips its often best to combine several techniques to help you pass drug tests for instance dilution and niacin eat well and exercise before your test this will help your body clean itself out especially with fatsolube drugs like weed drink and drink lots this can not be overemphasized if you have test coming up be sure to drink lots and lots of water this helps everything in your body run smoothly which is good for you and helps your body expel toxins and drugs it also dilutes your urine so the drugs in it are less concentrated if you feel like youre getting sick from drinking too much then stop as this might be sign you have had too much its better to drink lots consistently than to binge use common sense when peeing into the sample cup make sure the urine in the sample cup comes from midstream never use the start or the end of your urine stream as your sample as drugs tend to be concentrated in higher amounts there in order to make your urine more yellow take some vitamins in accordance with their labels bvitamins are the ones that give it the most yellow colour but all of them help you cant just put yellow food colouring in some water and call it good the testing facility will notice that the ph is off and say the sample is bad you will also be subject to an interesting array of questions from administrators the thinner and healthier you are the faster drugs will pass through your system people with high metabolisms benefit when it comes to drug tests as you use drug more often you become less and less likely to pass as it takes these drugs longer to get out of your system most of the flushdetox kits available out there dont do anything except mess up your body chemistry they can be dangerous so just stay away from them why publish our secrets because if they stay secrets were fucked some people might read this and ask why were publishing this after all cant the school read this and update their drug testing policies to defeat these measures not really lot of these things cant be defeated unless the school moved up to hair tests which would never work especially considering how costly those are one might ask as emmett grogan demanded of abbie hoffman upon the publication of steal this book whether it has occurred to us that making all these secret methods public knowledge might hurry them into obsolescence in limited cases this might be true though weve made an effort to slant the content so that it wont be quickly outdated when these methods become outdated well then well have to come up with new methods at any rate our answer to this charge is that these skills and the struggle for which they are useful must both be extended to much broader circles or else they are doomed to obsolescence anyway the small group of people who already know this information is too small to make us all pass our drug tests for massive change to be possible everybody who has become victim of drug testing policies must learn how to defeat them in limited cases yes the powers that be will be able to use our advice to prepare themselves for our efforts to contest their control but we hope that this drawback will be outweighed by the ways in which this work can help equip new generations to strike blows for freedom from unexpected directions and in unpredictable ways in short why give away our secrets because if they stay secrets were fucked if you associate yourself with the struggle for better world consider how you can do your part to get these tools into unlikely hands talk without action only sets precedent for more of the same actions themselves can be eloquent on the other hand in ways that words rarely can all the best in all the
