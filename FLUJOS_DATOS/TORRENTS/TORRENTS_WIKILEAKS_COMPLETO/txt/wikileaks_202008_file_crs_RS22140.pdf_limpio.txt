section 1 short title section 1 of the bills contains their short titles the security and freedom ensured act of 2005 s afe act in the case of hr 1526 and security and freedom enhancement act of 2005 or safe act in the case of s 737 section 2 limitation on roving wiretaps under foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 the foreign intelligence surv eillance act fisa permits federal judges assigned to serve on the foreign intelligence surveillance court to issue orders authorizing for foreign intelligence gathering purposes electronic surveillance physical searches the use of trap and trace devices and pen regi sters and access to tangible items subsection 1805c of fisa describes the specifications and directions for fisa electronic surveillance orders before 911 fisa electronic surve illance orders specified 1 the identity if known or the description of the target of the surveillance 2 the nature and location of the facilities or places at wh ich the surveillance was directed and 3 ifhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22140crs2 requested the identity of communications providers landlords and other person whose assistance would facilitate execution of the order section 206 of the usa patriot act tem porarily altered this third feature to permit general command for th ird party assistance without identifying specific person if the target of the order regularly change d telephones or meeting places or took other evasive steps in order to thwart surveillance efforts the intelligence authorization act for 2002 altered the second feature to require id entification of the na ture and location of targeted facilities and places only if they we re known thus at least temporarily fisa surveillance orders may be issued that simply describe the target but do not otherwise identify the target the facilities or places to be targeted or those communications providers or others whose assistance will be commanded to facilitate execution of the order both the house and senate bills amend subsection 1805c to require that fisa surveillance orders identify either the target or the facilities or places targeted orders merely describing the target because the targets identity is unknown must identify the facilities or places targeted and orders that do not identify the facilities or places because they are unknown must identify the target if the facilities or places cannot be identified in the order both bills limit execution of fisa surveillance order to times when the target is present at the facility or place under surveillance section 3 limitations on delayed notice search warrants in general the fourth amendment to the united states constitution prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures us const amend iv the amendment does not apply when there is reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to the item seized such as information or other property in the possession of third pa rty for example yet where reasonable expectation of privacy exists and subject to certain exigent circumstances the fourth amendment requires officers executing s earch warrant to knoc k and announce their purpose before entering to execute the warrant prior to the usa patriot act the federal rules of criminal procedure which imp lement the amendment instructed officers to leave notice of the search and an inventory of any items seized at the location where the search occurred the lower federal appella courts were divi ded over whether failure to provide notification should be treated as violation of the rule or as constitutional violation and they likewise could not agr ee on how long notification might be postponed when exigent circumstances ju stified delaye d notification federal law permits layed notification to customers of government access to their communications stored with service provide rs situation under which there may well be judicially recognized reasonable expectation of privacy the law limits delays to instances where contemporaneous disclosure would have adverse c onsequences the list of adverse consequences includes factor s traditionally recognized as exigent circumstances for fourth amendm ent purposes risk of injury or flight of the destruction of evidence or of the intimidation of poten tial witness and two factors which probably would not be thought to constitute exigen t circumstances seriously jeopardize an investigation or unduly delay trial section 213 of th usa patriot act amends 18 usc 3103a to permit delayed notification of the execution of search warrant or court order for reasonable time in presence of any of the adverse conditions listed in 18 usc 2705httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22140crs3 the two bills amend subsection 3103ab fi rst to limit the grounds justifying delay to those that can be considered exigent circumstances injury flight destruction of evidence witness intimidation risks and sec ond to confine the period of delay to more than 7 days with the possibility of 21day extensions b reports the bills direct the attorney gene ral to issue public report every six months documenting the number of notify pos tponements and extensions requested and granted or denied proposed 18 u sc 3103ac the senate bill also insists that the report identify the nature of the crimes that have given rise to s ubsection 3103ab requests section 4 privacy protections for library b ookseller and other personal records under foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 in general before the usa patriot act fisa authorized judges and ma gistrates of the fisa court to issue orders affording the federal bureau of investigation fbi access to certain business records during the course of gathering foreign intelligence information or investigating international terrorism applications were to include specific and articulable facts for belief that the subject of the business records was foreign power or the agent of foreign power the orders could be addr essed to any transportation common carrier public accommodation provider stor age facility or vehicle rent business and recipients could not disclose them except to the extent necessary to provide access to the records section 215 of the usa patriot act tem porarily rewrote this portion of fisa in the form scheduled to sunset on decem ber 31 2005 fisa court orders are available for fbi access to any tangible things incl uding books records papers documents and other items without regard to whether they pertain to foreign power or any of its agents as long as access is sought to obtain foreign inte lligence information not concerning united states person or to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities section 215 kept the nondisc losure feature and granted recipients protection from civil liability for compliance with fisa order both bills restrict the temporary fisa tangible things access orders to instances where there are specific and articulable reasons to believe that the records pertain to foreign power or one or more of its agents the senate bill alone provides that the order may be more sweeping than grand jury subpoena duces tecum issued in the context of an espionage or international terrorism investigation ie it must yield to federally recognized privileges and may not be unreasonable or oppressi ve the senate bill also calls for the order to include notice of the recipient rights that the bill provides b oversight both bills add the house and senate judiciary committees to the congressional authorities that the attorney general must keep apprised of the extent of the fbis use of the fisa access order authority 50 usc 1862 c amendments unique to s 737 the senate bill adds 1 exceptions and 180 day time limits to the nondisclosure feature with the possibility of 180 day extensions 2 procedure to allow recipient to quash or modify an order and 3 use provisions comparable to those that apply to the use of information generated by fisa surveillance and physical search orders proposed 50 u sc 1861d f g hr 1526 has comparable provisionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22140crs4 section 5 hr 1526 privacy protections for co mputer users at libraries under national secur ity authority s 737 procedural prot ections for national security letters in general four statutes vest federal intelligence officials with the power to demand production of certain informati on directly rather than invoke the power of fisa court judge to secure access these national secur ity letter statutes are 1 18 usc 2709 fbi request to wire or electr onic communications service pr oviders for customer name address length of service and local and long distance toll billing records 2 12 usc 3414 fbi request to financial institutions for records relating to customer transactions 3 15 usc 1681u fbi request to consumer reporting agencies for consumer name address former address places of employme nt former places of employment and names and addresses of financ ial institutions with whom cust omer has an account and 4 15 usc 1681v government agency request to consumer reporting ag encies for consumer and all other information in the agencys files although they vary somewhat these statut generally have explicit enforcement mechanism nor any means for recipient to have request modified or set aside bar disclosure by recipients of the requests and have uniform provisions concerning use of the information provided in response to the request section 505 of the usa patriot act amended three of the four provisions 18 usc 2709 12 usc 3414 15 usc 1681u and section 358 created the fourth 18 usc 1681v each of the amendments 1 made it clear that the request did not have to come from fbi headquarters but could be issued by any of the agents in charge of the various fbi field offices 2 substituted relevancy issuance standard for the earlier reason to believe standard 3 dropped the requirement that the records sought pertain to foreign power or its agents and 4 asserted that access could not be sought in connection with an investigation based solely on an americans exercise of his first amendment rights in case now on appeal one federal district c ourt found that the manner of exerci sing the national security letter authority under 18 usc 2709 violated both th fourth and the first amendments the fourth because of the want of judicial superv ision or review and the first because of the facially all encompassing permanent form of the gag order hr 1526 the bills treat the national security letter statutes differently hr 1526 simply exempts libraries from the coverage of 18 usc 2709 later in the bill it adds section 505 of the usa patriot act with its amendments to the na tional security letter statutes 18 usc 2709 12 usc 3414 and 15 usc 1681u to the list of usa patriot act provisions that expire on december 31 2005 s 737 the senate makes such addition to the list of terminating sections nor does it exempt libraries per from any of national security letter statutes instead it rewrites each of the statutes in much the same way it rewrites the fisa access order provisions within each of the national security letter statutes it 1 reestablishes the demand that the information s ought be based on specific and articulable facts that suggest that the information sought pert ains to foreign power or one or more of its agents 2 sets 90 day time limit for the gag orders based on exigent circumstances with the possibility of 180 day extensions available fro m the court on the same basis 3 permits recipients to challenge both the request and gag orders in court 4 holds the letters to same standards that apply to grand jury subpoenas duces tecum issued in espionage or international terrorism cases ie they must yield to federally recognized privileges and may not be unreasonable or oppressive 5 explicitly permits disclosure to thosehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22140crs5 necessary to comply with the request and to the recipients attorney and 6 establishes procedure for use and suppression of evidence generated by the letters section 6 modification of definition of domestic terrorism hr 1526 section 7 in s 737 federal law employs two terrorismrelated definitions fairly extensively the first defines federal crimes of terrorism by listing series of specific federal offenses likely to be committed for terrorist purposes 18 u sc 2332bg5text is appended the second defines domestic terrori sm generically rather than by reference to any specific federal crime 18 usc 23315 as used in this chapter 5 the term domestic terrorism means activities that involve acts dangerous to human life that are violation of the criminal laws of the united states or of any state b appear to be intended i to intimidate or coerce civilian population ii to influence the policy of government by intimidation or coercion or iii to ffect the conduct of government by mass destruction assassination or kidnapping and c occur primarily w ithin the territorial jurisdiction of the united states neither domestic terrorism or federal crime of terrorism is separate crime they are used for purposes of cross reference t hus for example federal crime of terrorism as defined in 18 usc 2332bg5b that invol ves the risk of serious injury to another person is not subject to the usual statute of limitations and may be prosecuted at any time similarly property derived from and used to facilitate international or domestic terrorism as defined by 18 usc 2331 is subject to confiscations both bills amend 18 usc 23315 so as to merge the two definitions as used in this chapter 5 the term domestic rrorism means activities th at involve acts dangerous to human life that constitute federal crime of terrorism as that term is defined in section 2332bg5 of this title nd b occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the united states hr 1526 contains an additional provision that emphasizes that nothing in section 2331 shoul d be construed to preclude enforcement of state terrorism laws s 737 has comparable provision section 6 s 737 only privacy protections for pen registers and trap and trace devices in general trap and trace devices and pen re gisters are essentially surreptitious caller id devices that track the source and destination of incoming and outgoing telephone calls to and from pa rticular telephone the suprem court has held that their use does not offend any fourth amendment prot ected expectation of privacy federal law contains procedures under which authoritie s may secure judicial approval for the installation and use of trap and trace devices and pen registers in both law enforcement and an intelligence gathering fisa context section 216 and 214 of the usa patriot act amended the law enforcement and fisa procedures to apply to email nd other forms of internet and electronic communications the law enforcement amendment requires report to the issuing court on the specifics on the use of the devices in connection with an internet communication the fisa amendment precludes use of the aut hority in connection with an investigation predicated solely on the exercise of an american targets first amendment rights the fisa amendment expires on december 31 2005 the law enforcement amendment does not httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22140crs6 hr 1526 section 7 of the house bill dds section 216 the law enforcement amendment to the list of usa patriot ac t sections that expire on december 31 2005 s 737 the senate bill amends both the fisa and the law enforcement procedure to require applicants to include statement of the specific and articulable facts that give rise to their belief that in stallation and use of the devi ces will produce evidence relevant to criminal investigation it expands th annual law enforcemen t reporting requirement to include more specific information concerning the use of the devices and directs that report be made publicly and it establishes new notice provision in the law enforcement procedure for the benefit of those intere sts are implicated by use of the device section 7 hr 1526 only extension of patriot sunset provision in general section 224 of the usa patriot act creat an expiration date december 31 2005 for the sections found in title ii of the act but exempts from termination several including sections 213 delayed notification of the execution of search warrant sneak and peek warrants 216 use of trap and trace vices and pen registers for law enforcement purpose 219 nationwide service of terrorism search warrants hr 1526 removes the exemption for these three sec tions so that they too expire on december 31 2005 it also marks section 505 national s ecurity letter amendments fo r expiration at that time although it has similar provision s 737 ddresses many of th same concerns as noted earlier in secti on 3 relating to section 213 nd limiting the justifications of delayed notification to exigent circumstances and establishing 7 day and 21day caps for the initial period of delay and any subsequent extensions in section 6 relating to section 216 and providing for participant notice in w enforcement trap and trace device and pen register cases public reports on use of the au thority and presentation of the facts giving specific and articulable justification for the orders and in section 5 relating to section 505 and providing for general adjustments in the national security letter statutes boundless terrorist search warrants in most instances federal judges may only issue search warrants to be executed in their own judicial districts but in cases of international or domestic rrorism section 219 of the us patriot act allows judges in any district where related activities have occurred to issue search warrants that may be executed within or outside the district under hr 1526 section 219 expires on december 31 2005 section 8 s 737 only public reporting of the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 the intelligence reform legislation passed at the end of the 108th congress amended fisa directing the attorney general to report in manner consistent with the protection of national security to the congressional judiciary and intelligence committee semiannually on the extent of fisa use interpretation of the act by the fisa court and copies of the fi sa court opinions 50 usc 1871 s 737 amends section 1871 to require that the reports be made public confines the instruction that the report be made in manne r consistent with the protection of national security to information relating to fisa court opinions but permits the attorney general to redact for the protection of national secur ity portions of the publicly released opinions hr 1526 has comparable provisions
