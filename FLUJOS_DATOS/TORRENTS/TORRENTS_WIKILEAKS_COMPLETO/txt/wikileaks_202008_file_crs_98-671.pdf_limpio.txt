issu of recent years has been the federal budget of the united states and its defic it since the 1930s dozens of proposals have called for laws or constituti onal amendments that would require balanced budget andor limit the size or growth of the fe deral budget or of the public debt the accumulation of large deficits since the 1970s has heightened the feeling of some policymakers and other observers that th constitution should be amended to require the federal government to ba lance revenues and expenditures the chief debate has been on the necessity of making such requirement part of the constitution but other questions have arisen as well how would such requirement affect the balance of power between the president and congress if congress and the president failed to pa ss balanced budget how would the re quirement be enforced should there be exceptions or circumstances when the requirement would not be enforced in the 104th congress the house republican leadership

debate over the relativ benefits of balanced budget as well as the accompanying debate over constitutional amendment solution has been spurred in recent years partly by concern that co mmitment to an annually balanced federal budget s been largely abandoned balanced budgets enjoyed long history of acceptance as part of an unwritten constitution like political parties and the presidents cabinet however since th 1930s and especially since the kennedy administration federal budget deficits and surpluses have come to be managed as an aspect of fiscal policy additionally because the federal government has not ended fiscal year in surplus since fy1969 and the size of the annual deficits has increased dramatically since fy1982 some obs ervers feared that the practical pursuit of balanced budget has been abandoned nevertheless the revi val of the balanced budget as political goal and the call fo r constitutional amendment to require its realization reflect its status as one of th most

of any amendment to the constitution is outlined in article v this provisi on grants congress the ability to propose amendments to the states whenever tw othirds of both houses shall deem it necessary this means that both the house and senate must pass joint resolution proposing constitutional amendment by two thirds majorities unlike other joint resolutions such measures are not submitted to the president for his signature instead the constitution specifies that they be submitted to the states for ratification if the proposal is ratified by threefourths 38 of the states it is certified by the archivist of the united states and becomes part of the constitution except for the requirement for tw othirds majorities in each house congressional procedure for considering joint resolution to amend the constitution is the same as for any other proposed legi slation some procedural points are worth noting however for example the required tw othirds majority is twothirds of those voting quorum being present and not tw othirds of the entire membership which is 290 in the house and 67 in the senate also this requirement applies only to the vote on final passage and on adoption of any conference report or secondchamber amendment not to any preliminary or an cillary matters the precedents of the house require only majority vote for committee action including action in committee of the whole or by conferen ce committee adoption of special rules reported by the house rules committee nd adoption of any amendments similar practices apply in the senate in add ition joint resolutions proposing constitutionalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98671crs12 amendments cannot also include any provisions that are in tended to be only statutory for this reason provisions requiring admin istration or committee reports clarifying legislative history or declaring congressi onal intent have been considered in the senate in the form of motions to refer the measure to committee with instructions that the committee report back the measure forthwith unchanged and that it also report separately the instructed language this action allows the senate to consider proposed constitutional amendments without ving to incorporate clarifications or congressional intentions dir ectly into the proposals the drafting style of proposed amendments is also somewhat different from that for statutory enactments proposed amendmen ts rarely make explicit reference to any other amendment or portion of the constituti on even if the intent is to revise specific point for example article i s ection 3 is superseded by the seventeenth amendment election of senato rs and article i section 4 is superseded by the twentieth amendment meeting day for congress but in neither case does the latter explicitly repeal the former the only sp ecific reference to another portion of the constitution in an amendment is in the twentyfirst amendment which repeals the eighteenth amendment prohibition the constitution also provides sec ond method for proposing am endments though it has never been used article v of the cons titution specifically provides that on the application of twothirds of the several states congress shall call convention for proposing amendments convention would not have the power to amend the constitution directly any proposed amendment would still need to be ratified by
