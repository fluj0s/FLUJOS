report examines pl 10992 2005 wh ich passed the senate and the house as s 397 109th congress and was signed by the president on october 26 2005 titled the protection of lawful commerce in arms act it prohibits civil action or proceeding or an administrative proceeding except in six circumstances against manufacturer or seller of firearm or ammunition or trad association for damages resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse of firearm or ammunition1 the statute requires that pending lawsuits brought by shooting victims and municipalities be immediately dismissed by the court in which the acti on was brought or is currently pending the statutes findings state that it is an abuse of the legal system and an unreasonable burden on interstate and foreig n commerce to hold defendants liable

c onduct that violates st atute ordinance or regulation as it relates to the use of qualified productof s 397 reportedly said that the bill will put an end to politicallymotivated lawsuits against the firearms industry and added t hese outrageous lawsu its attempting to hold lawabiding industry responsible for the acts of criminals are threat to jobs and the economy jeopardize the exercise of cons titutionallyprotected freedoms undermine national security and circumvent congress and state legislatures2 an opponent of the bill dennis henigan director of the brady legal action project reportedly said the gun lobby is trying to radically change the rules to make irresponsible gun dealers and the makers of defective guns the only busin esses in american exempt from longstanding principles of negligence nuisance and product liability3 he had previously argued that the 108th congress version of the bill would bring progress toward safer guns to screaming halt would prevent cities from collecting damages against gun manufacturers who maintain di stribution system which they know ensures the continual supply of guns to the illegal market and w ould be radical intrusion by the congress into the workings of state courts4 the statute provides qualified civil liability action may not be brought in any federal or state court and re quires the dismissal of any such action that is pending on the date of enactment of the statute the statute defines qualified civil liability action as with six exceptions civil action or proceeding or an administrative proceeding brought by any person against manufacturer or seller of qualifie d product or trade association for damages punitiv damages injunctive or d eclaratory relief abatement restitution fines or penalties or other re lief resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse of qualified product by the person or third party 5 whether the statute covers administrativ proceedings is not clear b ecause it prohibits qualified civil liability actions from being brought in courts and administrative proceedings are not brought in courts although appeals of them may be if the statute does cover administrative proceedings then the effect of its doing so is not clear the first five exceptions in the statute discussed below all refer to an action that the statute does not prevent from being brought it is so not clear therefore whether these exceptions apply to administrative proceedin gs sixth exception in s 397 however which was added when the sena passed the bill does not bar any action or proceeding commenced by the attorney general to enforce the provisions of chapter 44 of title 18 or chapter 53 of title 26 us code these incl ude proceedings of the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives the statute defines qualified product as firearm as defined in 18 usc 921a3a or b an antique firear m as defined in 18 usc 921a16httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22074crs3 6 the 2004 cumulative annual pocket part to the u s code annotated sets forth subsection h of section 924 as subsection g incorrectly noting that public law 108174 2003 redesignated the subsections of section 924ammunition as defined in 18 u sc 921a17 or com ponent part of firearm or ammunition in addition any of these products have to have been sh ipped or transported in interstate or foreign comme rce to be qualified product the statute defines trade ssociation which is used in the definition of qualified civil liability action quoted above as an corporation unincor porated association federation business league professional or business or ganization not organized or operated for profit and part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private individual or shareholde r in addition to be tra association an entity must be an organization described in section 501 c6 of the internal revenue code of 1986 and exempt from tax under section 501a of such code and two or more members of the organization must be manufacturer s or sellers of qualified product the statute defines manufacturer to limit the term to manufacturers who are licensed under chapter 44 of title 18 us code it defines seller to include an importer as defined in 18 usc 921a9 dealer as defined in 18 usc 921a11 and person engaged in the business of selling amm unition as defined in 18 usc 921a17 an importer and dealerhas to be licensed under chapter 44 of title 18 us code to be seller under the statute persons in all three categories of seller to be seller must be engaged in the business which the statute gives the meaning given that term in 18 usc 921a21 and as applied to seller of ammunition defines as person who devotes time attention and labor to the sale of ammunition as regular course of trade or business the six exceptions the first of the six types of lawsuits that is not qualified civ il liability action and that therefore is not be barred by the statute is i an action brought against transferor convicted under section 924h of title 18 united states code or comparable or identical state felony law by party di rectly harmed by the conduct of which the transferee is so convicted6 section 924h makes it crime to knowingly transfer firearm knowing that such firearm will be us ed to commit crime of violence or drug trafficking crime the transferor whom the statute does not preclude from being sued is person who has been convicted of violating section 924h or comparable or identical state felony law the phrase is so convicted ppears unclear it appears to require that the transferee ie the person who bought the firearm from th transferor and who shoots the plaintiff with it be convicted but of what it is not be of section 924 h because section 924h makes it crime to transfer fi rearm not to receive one or to fire one in addition there would be apparent reason for congress to have created an exception to exception i and prohibit lawsuits agains t transferors convicted under section 924h merely because the transferee had not been convicted the transferee after all may not have been convicted because he had been killed in selfd efense by the plaintiff whom he shot and this would not seem relevant to the transferors culpability for the harm he had indirectlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22074crs4 7 could transferee actually be intended to be transferor this seems unlikely because exception i speaks of the plaintiffs having be directly harmed by the conduct of the transferee and the plaintiff would be directly harmed by the conduct of the transferee he would be only indirectly harmed by the conduct of the transferor 8 johnson v bulls eye shooter supply 032039328 2003 wl 21639244 wash super ct june 27 2003 9 the washington post p c03 dec 12 2004caused by violating section 924h the drafte rs of the statute may have meant to refer to the conduct in which the transferee engage d rather than the c onduct of which he was convicted7 the second type of lawsuit that is not be qualified civil liability action and therefore is not barred by the statute is ii an action brought against seller for negligent entrustment or neg ligence per the statute defines negligent entrustment as the supplying of qualif ied product by sell er for use by another person when the seller knows or reasonably should know the person to whom the product is supplied is likely to and does use the product in ma nner involving unreasona ble risk of physical injury to the person or others this appare ntly covers supplying firearm or ammunition to person who because of age mental di sability intoxication or violent propensity seems likely to use the product in dangerous manner it seems questionable whether it contemplates d ealers rather than an individual purchasers using the product in manner involving unreasonable risk under washington law however negligen t entrustment can apply to sales by manufacturers to dealers case in the state of washington held that negligent entrustment occurs when firearms manufactur er sells firearms to retail store that it knew or should have known was operating its store in reckless or incompetent manner8 this suit was brought by victims of the dcarea snipers against among others the manufacturer of the assault rifle that the snipers used to commit their crimes the plaintiffs alleged that the manufacturer knew or should have known that the retailer had history of large number of weapons for which it could not account the court found that if the plaintiffs could prove th is then the defendant may be liable for plaintiffs injuries under the theory of neglig ent entrustment the court therefore denied the defendants motion to dismiss the suit fo r failure to state claim upon which relief can be granted and ruled that the case may go to trial the defendant subsequently settled the case for 25 million9 it appears however that the statute even though it does generally not preclude actions for negligent entrustment could pr eclude an action for negligent entrustment against manufacturer in the state of wash ington even if the statutes definition of negligent entrustment is construed to cove r sales by manufacturers to dealers and not merely to individual purchasers this is because the statute defines negligent entrustment as the supplying of qua lified product by ller not by manufacturer the statute defines seller to include dealer as defined in section 921a11 of title 18 who is licensed to engage in business as such dealer section 921a11 defines dealer to incl ude any person engaged in the business of selling firearms at wholesale or retail manufacturer ge nerally sells its products at wholesale and therefore appa rently may be dealer under section 921a11 but thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22074crs5 10 27 cfr 47841b 11 although negligent entrustment is recognized in almost every jurisdiction jd lee and barry lyndahl 4 modern tort law liability and litigation 331 rev ed 2002 and manufacturers selling potentially dangerous product to retailer it knows or should know to be reckless may constitute negligence in almo st every jurisdiction this does not mean that jurisdictions besides washington necessarily label this sort of negligence negligent entrustment 12 black s law dictionary 7th ed 1999 at 1057 13 w page keeton p rosser and keeton on the law of torts 5th ed 1984 at 230 the courts of many states follow this rule stuart m speiser charles f krause alfred w gans 2 the american law of torts 1985 cum supp 1998 at 1029 14 stuart m speiser charles f krause alfred w gans 2 t he american law of torts 1985 cum supp 1998 at 10341035 emphasis in original does not mean that manufacturer is be seller under the statute because though manufacturer apparently may be dealer under section 921a11 it need not be licensed as dealer and under the statute it must be both dealer and licensed as one regulations of the bureau of alcohol tob acco firearms and explosives provide that firearms manufacturer is not required to obtain dealers license in order to engage in business as dealer10 apparently confirming that manufacturer may be dealer under section 921a11 manuf acturer who is not licensed as dealer is not seller under the statute and therefore under the statute apparently is immune from suits for negligent entrustment manuf acturer who is licensed as dealer even though it is not required to be is seller under the stat ute and therefore apparently would be subject to suits for negligent entrustment provided that the statutes definition of negligent entrustment is construed to cover sales by manuf acturers to dealers and not merely to individual purchasers11 the second exception to the definition of qualified civil liab ility action does not bar suits not only for negligent entrustment but for negligence per term that the statute does not define the term generally means negligence established as matter of law so that breach of the duty is not jury question12 this means that once defendants conduct is termined to have violated re levant statute the defendant is automatically deemed negligent and the jury is not asked to determine whether the defendant acted in reasonable manner this is apparently the rule in probably majority of the courts13 some courts appear to have limited the per rule to situations where there has been violation of specific requirement of law etc legislation that expresses ru of conduct in specific and concrete terms as opposed to general or abstract principles in some few states at least in older cases not apparently disapproved distinction has been drawn as to ordinances and violation of an ordinance rather than violation of statute has been ruled to constitute at most evidence of negligence14 thus whether violation of statute constitutes negligence per is question of state law unless federal stat ute provides that one who violat it shall be held strictly liable in civil action one could therefore in terpret this provision of the statute to mean that if plaintiff alleges that the defendant violated statute and the statute is federal statute that provides that one w ho violates it shall be held strictly liable in civil actionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22074crs6 15 note that this exception unlike the first excep tion which requires that the defendant have been convicted under 18 usc 924h requires that the defendant merely have violated state or federal statute the plaintiff presumably woul d have to prove violation by preponderance of the evidence whereas conviction requires proof beyond reasonable doubt it is difficult to predict when defendants viola tion of statute would be deemed the proximate cause of third partys criminal or unlawful misu of firearm or ammunitionor the applicable state law provides that one w ho violates statute or ordinance of the sort violated shall be held strictly liable th the plaintiff may proceed if however applicable state law allows the question of negligence to go to the jury even when the defendant has violated statut ie if there is negligence per rule then the statute would preclude lawsuit unless one of its other six exceptions in the definition of qualified civil liability action applied the other three exceptions in the definition of qualified civil liability action ie the other three types of actions th at the statute does not bar are iii an action in which manufacturer or seller of qualified product knowingly and willfully violated state or federal statute applicable to the sale or marketing of the product15 and the violation was proximate cause of the harm for which relief is sought iv an action for breach of contract or warranty in connection with the purchase of the product or v an action for death physical injuries or property damage resulting directly from defect in design or manufacture of the product when used as intended or in reasonably foreseeable manner except that where the discharge of the product was caused by volitional act that constituted criminal offense then such act shall be considered the sole proximate cause of any resulting death personal injuries or property damage or vi an action or proceeding commenced by the attorney general to enforce the provisions of chapter 44 of title 18 or chapter 53 of title 26 us code the exception to exception v raises stions the exception to exception v would apparently come into play if for ex ample criminal fired gun without aiming at his victim but because of defect in the gun the bullet hit the victim in such case the manufacturer would be immune from suit but suppose that the criminal used the gun in holdup but did not pull the trigger yet defect caused the gun to fire spontaneously would the holdup constitute volitional act that would immunize the manufacturer from suit in addition would constituted cr iminal offense mean that the gunman had to have been convicted by proof beyond r easonable doubt or merely that the plaintiff would have to prove by pr eponderance of the evidence th at the defendants volitional act constituted criminal offense if the latter would the plaintiff be permitted to prove that the defendants volitional act constituted criminal offense even if the defendant had previously been acquitted with regard to that volitional act s 397 as passed contains two sections th at were originally added on the senate floor section 5 with exceptions requires ch ild safety locks on handguns and section 6 amended 18 usc 922a and 924c which with exceptions prohibit the manufacture or importation of armor piercing ammunition and estab lish penalties for the commission of crimes with such ammunition
