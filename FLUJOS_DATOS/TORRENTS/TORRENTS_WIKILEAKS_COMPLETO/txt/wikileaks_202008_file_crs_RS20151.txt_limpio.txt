fy19902001 mary t tyszkiewicz analyst in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division summary this report provides data on trends in funding for the national guard and reserve components of the us armed forces from fy1990fy2001 the percentage of national guard and reserve ngr funding has held fairly steady over this period at 78 of the department of defense dod budget the ngr budgets range from high of 282 billion in fy1992 to low of 227 billion in fy1997 as measured in constant fy2001 dollars personnel endstrength for the ngr has decreased from high of 1154570 service members in fy1991 to low of 870917 in fy1999 this is 33 decline over that period this report will be updated as new data is available this report provides data on trends in funding for national guard reserve components and endstrength levels1 for fiscal years fy 19902000 and the budget request for fy20012 the reserve components include the army national guard air national guard army reserve naval reserve marine corps reserve and air force reserve the national guard and reserve units of the us military have somewhat different heritages the national guard descends from the british and colonial american militia traditions in which armed citizens would drill and be ready to defend their localities and homes the national guard is thus dual statefederal force functioning both as the militia of the states under the control of state authorities and as federal military reserve force in contrast the reserves of each service are purely federal forces created in the 20th century 1 endstrength level is defined as number of military personnel on duty as of the last day of the fiscal year september 30th 2 fy2000 data in tables 13 represent dod estimate and include administrationproposed supplemental appropriations and rescissions the fy2001 data in table 1 represents the administrations february 2000 request and does not include changes due to congressional action fy19901999 data in tables 13 represent actual figures congressional research service the library of congress crs2 trends in recent years congress has perennially debated whether the pentagon adequately funds guard and reserve components each year in the 1990s congress has added money to the pentagons guard and reserve budget table 1 shows national guard and reserve funding for fy19902000 and the fy2001 budget request by appropriations title appropriations titles are the most general category in the annual dod appropriations bills approved by congress the major titles for national guard and reserve funding are military personnel operation and maintenance om procurement and military construction the last column of table 1 shows endstrength levels for fy19901999 personnel endstrength for the ngr has decreased from high of 1154570 service members in fy1991 to low of 870917 in fy1999 this is 33 decline over that period new equipment for national guard and reserve forces is normally procured in regular appropriations procurement accounts for each of the services this account category is shown in table 1 as the service procurement accounts in addition congress has sometimes set aside funds in separate ngr procurement account for additional equipment not requested by dod in the active service accounts3 this account category is shown in table 1 as ngr procurement it is important to remember that most guard and reserve equipment is funded in the active component accounts the ngr procurement account is for additional equipment over and above equipment in the active component accounts table 1 shows national guard and reserve funding in budget authority 4 in current year dollars tables 2 and 3 show the same data for fy19902000 by appropriations title and component respectively in constant fy2001 dollars constant dollars measure the cost of goods and services in terms of prices in given constant year fixing the purchasing power of the dollar to given year eliminates changes in prices due to inflation in comparing budgets from year to year as figures 1 and 2 show measured in constant fy2001 dollars national guard and reserve ngr funding has held relatively steady as percentage of the dod budget from fy19901999 the total has varied between 78 of the department of defense dod budget and ranges from high of 282 billion in fy1992 to low of 227 billion in fy1997 as measured in constant fy2001 dollars 3 the ngr procurement account is not the only or even the primary source for guard and reserve equipment guard and reserve units get cascaded used equipment from the active forces which are not accounted for in these totals 4 budget authority ba is the authority provided by congress via law to the dod to enter into obligations for the provision of goods and services current dollars are the dollar value of goods and services in terms of prices current at the time of purchase crs3 table 1 national guard reserve funding by appropriations title and endstrength levels
