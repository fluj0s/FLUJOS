reserve spr in the energy policy and conservation act epca pl 94163 to help prevent repetition of the economic dislocation caused by the 19731974 arab oil embargo the program is managed by the department of energy doe the capacity of the spr is 727 million barrels and it currently holds around 702 million barrels of crude oil in addition rtheast heating oil rese rve nhor hol ds 2 million barrels of heating oil in aboveground storage the spr comprises five underground storage facilities hollowed out from naturally occurring salt domes in texas and louisiana epca authorized drawdown of the reserve upon finding by the president that there is severe energy supply interruption congress enacted additional authority in 1990 energy policy and conservation act amendments of 1990 pl 101383 to permit use of the spr for short periods to resolve supply interruptions stemming from situations internal to the united states the meaning of severe energy supply interruption has been controversial however epca intends use of the spr only to ameliorate discernible physical shortages of crude oil beginning in 2000 additions to the spr were made with royaltyinkind rik oil acquired by the department of energy in lieu of cash royalties paid on production from federal offshore leases as prices rose during the decade some policymakers objected to rik fill arguing that it was contributing to the pressure on oil prices the administration resisted calls to suspend rik fill until midmay 2008 shortly after congress passed legislation pl 110232 suspending rik fill for the balance of the calendar year unless the price of crude oil dropped below 75barrel on may 16 doe canceled its solicitation for an additional 13 million barrels of rik oil standing rik deliveries were deferred until the period of januarymay 2009 the sharp decline in crude oil prices since spiking to 147barrel in the summer of 2008 has spurred interest in resuming fill of the spr on january 2 2009 the bush administration announced plans to purchase oil for the spr and to reschedule deferred deliveries there are four components in the resumption of fill 1 purchase of 12 million barrels to replace oil that was sold after hurricanes katrina and rita in 2005 2 the return of roughly 54 million barrels of oil borrowed by refiners after hurricane gustav in 2008 3 delivery of roughly 22 million barrels of rik oil that had been deferred and 4 resumption of rik fill in may 2009 at volume of 25000 barrels per day lower rate of rik fill than has generally been observed during the life of the program these activities are intended to fill to current capacity by the end of fy2009 the government has not acquired oil for the spr by outright purchase since the mid1990s the energy policy act

2007 world markets have had to absorb roughly five significant spikes in the price of crude oil and petroleum products1 whether driven by disruptions in the physical supply of crude or refined fuels or by uncertainties owing to international conflicts and instabilities these price increases have consequences for the united states elevated petroleum prices affect the balance of trade and owing to the relative inelasticity of demand for gasoline at prices less than 400 per gallon siphon away disposable income that might be spent to support spending investment or savings the origin of the us strategic petroleum reserve spr stems from the 1973 arabisraeli war in response to the united states support for israel the organization of arab exporting countries oapec imposed an oil embargo on the united states the netherlands and canada and reduced production while some arab crude did reach the united states the price of imported crude oil rose from roughly 4barrel bbl during the last quarter of 1973 to an average price of 1250bbl in 1974 while amount of strategic stocks can insulate any oilconsuming nation from paying the market price for oil in supply emergency the availability of strategic stocks can help blunt the magnitude of the markets reaction to crisis one of the original perceptions of the value of strategic stockpile was also that its very existence would discourage the use of oil as political weapon the embargo imposed by the arab producers was intended to create very discernible physical disruption this explains in part why the genesis of the spr was focused especially on deliberate and dramatic physical disruptions of oil flow and on blunting the significant economic impacts of shortage stemming from international events in response to the experience of the embargo congress authorized the strategic petroleum reserve in the energy policy and conservation act epca pl 94163 to help prevent repetition of the economic dislocation caused by the arab oil embargo in the event of an interruption introduction into the market of oil from the reserve was expected to help calm markets mitigate sharp price spikes and reduce the economic dislocation that had accompanied the 1973 disruption in so doing the reserve would also buy time for the crisis to sort itself out or for diplomacy to seek some resolution before potentially severe oil shortage escalated the crisis beyond diplomacy the spr was to contain enough crude oil to replace imports for 90 days with goal initially of 500 million barrels in storage in may 1978 plans for 750millionbarrel reserve were implemented the spr is currently authorized for expansion to 1 billion barrels the bush administration was unsuccessful in persuading congress to raise the authorized size further to 15 billion barrels 1 these have included the arab oil embargo 19731974 the deposing of the shah of iran followed by the iranian revolution 19791980 the first gulf war 1990 and opec production cuts and resurgence in world oil demand early 1999 into the fall of 2000 since 2003 crude oil and product prices have risen to new nominal highsand very briefly new high in real dollarsowing to blend of many factors including international tensions and armed conflicts as well as worldwide demand some of the dynamics behind recent and sustained increases in price owe to factors internal to the united states including seasonal formulations of gasoline to help meet clean air standards and strains on us refining capacity natural events such as hurricanes rita and katrina can also create havoc and alarm in domestic and world markets httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33341g22g145g142g561g21g157g155g138g157g142g144g146g140g561g18g142g157g155g152g149g142g158g150g561g20g142g156g142g155

spr comprises five underground storage facilities hollowed out from naturally occurring salt domes located in texas and louisiana the caverns were finished by injecting water and removing the brine similarly oil is removed by displacing it with water injection for this reason crude stored in the spr remains undisturbed except in the event of sale or exchange multiple injections of water over time will compromise the structural integrity of the caverns2 by 2005 the capacity of the spr reached 727 million barrels its inventory reached nearly 700 million barrels before hurricanes katrina and rita in 2005 following the storms some crude was loaned to refiners and some was sold loans of spr oil are paid by the return of larger amounts of oil than were borrowed at the beginning of 2009 the spr held nearly 702 million barrels3 spr oil is sold competitively notice of sale is issued including the volume characteristics and location of the petroleum for sale delivery dates and procedures for submitting offers as well as measures for assuring performance and financial responsibility bids are reviewed by doe and awards offered the department of energy estimates that oil could enter the market roughly two weeks after the appearance of notice of sale4 the arab oil embargo also fostered the establishment of the international energy agency iea to develop plans and measures for emergency responses to energy crises strategic stocks are one of the policies included in the agencys international energy program iep signatories to the iea 5 are committed to maintaining emergency reserves representing 90 days of net imports developing programs for demand restraint in the event of emergencies and agreeing to participate in allocation of oil deliveries among the signatory nations to balance shortage among iea members the calculation of net imports for measuring compliance with the iea requirement includes private stocks by that measure the united states has more than 100 days cushion however it is likely that less than 20 of the privately held stocks would technically be available in an emergency because most of that invent ory supports movement of product through the delivery infrastructure the administrations advocacy for expansion of the spr is partly based on this argument that the spr will need to be larger if the united states is to be able to maintain stocks equivalent to 90 days of net imports were the spr filled to its current capacity of 727 million barrels the united states would have roughly 70 days of net import protection these measures of days protection assumes total cessation of oil supply to importing nations scenario that is highly unlikely this would be especially true for the united states given that canada is currently the nations principal source for crude oil 2 oil stored at one spr site weeks island was transferred after problems with the structural integrity of the cavern unrelated to drawdown activitywere discovered in the

private sector or by both the public and private sectors including the us spr roughly twothirds of iea stocks are held by the oil industry whereas onethird is held by governments and supervisory agencies6 the energy policy act of 2005 epact requires as expeditiously as practicable expansion of the spr to its authorized maximum of 1 billion barrels congress approved 25 million in the fy2008 budget for land acquisition for site in richton mississippi that would add 160 million barrels of capacity but rejected spending for any other expansion work in fy2009 the administration once more requested funds for expanding the spr in its fy2009 request and the request was once again rejected the h ouse committee recommended 1726 million and spending level of 205 million was recommended to

the president that there is severe energy supply interruption this is deemed by the statute to exist if three conditions are joined if an emergency situation exists and there is significant reduction in supply which is of significant scope and duration b severe increase in the price of petroleum products has resulted from such emergency situation and c such price increase is likely to cause major adverse impact on the national economy the spr could be drawn down initially at rate of roughly 43 mbd for up to 90 days thereafter the rate would begin to decline although fears were expressed periodically during the 1980s about whether the facilities for withdrawing oil from the reserve were in proper readiness the absence of problems during the first real drawdown in early 1991 the persian gulf war appeared to allay much of that concern however some spr facilities and infrastructure were beginning to reach the end of their operational life life extension program initiated in 1993 upgraded or replaced all major systems to ensure the sprs readiness to 2025 congress enacted additional drawdown authority in 1990 energy policy and conservation act amendments of 1990 pl 101383 after the exxon valdez oil spill which interrupted the shipment of alaskan oil triggering spot shortages and price increases the intention was to provide for an spr drawdown under less rigorous finding than that mandated by epca this section 42 usc 6241h allows the president to use the spr for short period without having to declare the existence of severe energy supply interruption or the need to meet obligations of the united states under the international energy program as noted previously the energy policy act of 2005 made the spr authorities permanent these authorities also provide for us participation in emergencysharing activities of the international energy agency without risking violation of antitrust law and regulation under the additional authorities authorized in pl 101383 drawdown may be initiated in the event of circumstance that constitutes or is likely to become domestic or international energy supply shortage of significant scope or duration and where action taken would assist directly and significantly in preventing or reducing the adverse impact of such shortage this 6 see httpwwwieaorgtextbasesubjectquerieskeyresultaspkeyword_id4103

barrels when the iranian revolution cut supplies in the spring of 1979 purchases were suspended to reduce the upward pressure on world oil prices filling of the reserve was resumed in september 1980

of the annual federal budget deficitas well as precipitous drop in crude oil prices into early 1999generated new interest in replenishing the spr either to further energy security objectives or as

portion of the royalties paid to the government from oil leases in the gulf of mexico be accepted in kind in the form of oil rather than as revenues the department of the interior doi was reported to be unfavorably disposed to the royaltyinkind rik proposal but plan to proceed with such an arrangement was announced on february 11 1999 legislation had also been introduced hr 498 in the 106 th congress to direct the minerals management service to accept royaltyinkind oil producers were supportive maintaining that the system for valuation of oil at the wellhead is complex and flawed while acquiring oil for the spr by rik avoids the necessity for congress to make outlays to finance direct purchase of oil it also means loss of revenues in so far as the royalties are settled in wet barrels rather than paid to the us treasury in cash final details were worked out during the late winter of 1999 in midnovember of 2001 president bush ordered fill of the spr to 700 million barrels principally through oil acquired as royaltyinkind rik at its inception the rik plan was generally greeted as wellintended first step toward filling the spr to its capacity of 727 million barrels 7 however it became controversial when crude prices began to rise sharply in 2002 some policymakers and studies asserted that diverting rik oil to the spr instead of selling it in the open market was putting additional pressure on crude prices deposit of 40 million barrels into the spr during 2002 was criticized in report released on march 5 2003 by senator levin representing the minority on the permanent subcommittee on investigations of the senate committee on governmental affairs 8 the study argued that this increment of fill had been major contributor to oil price increases during that year number of industry analysts quickly dismissed the study arguing that the quantity of spr fill was not enough to have driven the market one of the most vocal critics of rik fill energy economist philip k verleger jr argued that spr fill is one of two reasons that crude oil prices were exceeding 90barrel during the latter part of 2007 in commentary released in january 2008 verleger estimated that were the administration to cease depositing sweet crude into the spr crude prices would ease dramatically were this to happen possibly to 70 per barrel 9 the administration strongly disagreed with claims that rik fill bore responsibility for the continuing spike in prices arguing in part that market fluctuations both take and restore crude supply to world markets without affecting prices at the scale that were implied by verlegers assumptions legislative attempts to suspend rik fill began in 2004 during the 108th congress an amendment to the fy2005 interior appropriations bill hr 4568 to suspend rik deliveries and cap the spr at 647 million barrels was defeated on the house floor 152267 on june 17 2004 another effort to suspend rik deliveries to the spr occurred on september 14 2004 during debate on hr 4567 the fy2005 department of homeland security appropriations bill senator byrd proposed suspension of rik fill in order to provide 470 million in additional funding for homeland security purposes the amendment was set aside despite the continued opposition to 7 the spr estimated capacity of 727 million barrels followed reevaluation of the cavern formations and other

until august 2005 when the spr held fractionally less than 700 million barrels deliveries of rik oil were suspended in august 2005 after hurricanes rita and katrina the administration had suspended rik oil on other occasions in the past in light of tightness in world oil markets and increasing prices the bush administration agreed to delay deliveries scheduled for late 2002 and the first months of 2003 the administration had intended to boost deliveries to the spr to 130000 barrels per day during april 2003 total of 39 million barrels but on march 4 2003 doe delayed delivery of all but 15000 bd of rik oil with the declared end of the military phase of the war in iraq and little effect on oil markets deliveries of rik oil were resumed as well as delivery of oil still owed from swap held in 2000 described in detail below the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 enacted in the summer of 2005 required the secretary of energy to develop and publish for comment procedures for filling the spr that take into consideration number of factors among these are the loss of revenue to the treasury from accepting royalties in the form of crude oil how the resumed fill might affect prices of both crude and products and whether additional fill would be justified by national security it is likely that these provisions of pl 10958 were partial consequence of the debate over the wisdom of rik fill on november 8 2006 doe issued its final rule procedures for the acquisition of petroleum for the strategic petroleum reserve the rule essentially indicated that doe would take into account all the parameters required by pl 10958 to be taken into consideration before moving ahead with any acquisition strategy doe re jected tying decisions to acquire oil to any specific measurable differentials in current and historic oil prices in the summer of 2007 doe resumed rik fill of the spr after soliciting and accepting bid for delivery of 87 million barrels of oil from shell at rate of roughly 50000 bd over sixmonth period on october 10 2007 doe issued solicitation for an additional 13 million barrels of rik oil and in early november contracts were awarded for 123 million barrels of rik oil to shell trading company sunoco logistics and bp north america bills to suspend rik fill hr 5146 s 2598 were introduced early in the second session of the 110 th congress introduction of these bills may have been driven in part by dissatisfaction with the november 2006 administration rule responding to the provisions in epact requiring the administration to specify how it would determine that rik fill would not affect product prices and markets in may 2008 with gasoline prices exceeding on average 360 gallon and approaching 400gallon in some regions more policymakers expressed support for halting rik deliveries on may 13 the senate by vote of 971 approved suspension of rik fill during the balance of 2008 as an amendment to flood insurance bill hr 3121 that was subsequently passed 926 the amendment would permit resumption of rik fill if crude oil fell to 75barrel on average for 90day period the house approved similar proposal hr 6022 that evening by vote of 38525 the senate then approved the house bill by unanimous consent president bush indicated that he would not veto the legislation president bush signed the legislation into law pl 110 232 on may 19 2008 however few days

in the 110th congress were not necessarily opposed to the concept of an spr when the price of crude was much less of an issue objections to rik fill were also ideological opponents of rik fill in principle contended that governmentowned strategic stock of petroleum is inappropriate under any circumstancethat it essentially saddles the public sector with the expense of acquiring and holding stocks the cost for which might have otherwise been borne by the private sector the existence of the spr this argument goes has blunted the level of stocks held in the private sector 11 with the sharp decline in crude oil prices from over 140barrel in the summer of 2008 to less than 40 per barrel at one point in late december interest appeared in resuming fill during 2009 on january 2 2009 the bush administration announced that rik fill of the spr would resume in may 2009 at an estimated rate of 25000 bd the rate of rik deliveries over the lifetime of the program has varied the rate announced in january 2009 is in general modest in comparison to delivery rates seen in the past the new rik fill along with deliveries of oil that had been deferred as well as an outright purchase of 12 million

the additional drawdown authorities enacted in pl 101383 were the basis for using spr resources during the hurricanes of 20042005 crude oil prices exceeded 50barrel during october 2004 accompanied by declines in crude and product inventories major factor was hurricane ivan which rampaged through the gulf coast in midseptember and temporarily interrupted more than 70 of offshore crude production affecting crude oil deliveries to refineries on september 23 2004 the administration agreed to request placed to the department of energy from couple of refineries seeking to borrow crude oil from the spr to be replaced within short period of time subsequent requests raised the amount of borrowed crude to roughly 54 million barrels requests to borrow oil are contingent upon greater volume of crude to be returned to the spr this is in keeping with the mechanics of swap of oil conducted in 2002 under comparable circumstances critics claimed that it was belated and insufficient use of the spr and that it even backfired in terms of calming the market however because the swap was limited and sharply focused and represented such tiny volume of oil it may have been misinterpretation to see it as intended to do anything more than it didwhich was to provide supply to refiners to whom deliveries of crude were temporarily affected by hurricane ivan the administration argued that the decision 10

policy not to suspend fill or to authorize broader drawdown for the purpose of reducing high prices the swap was not characterized as broader marketcalming measure the fact that the price of oil rose even after the announcement was reflection of much stronger factors and uncertainties then prevailing in world markets than could be offset by such limited swap hurricanes katrina and rita in 2005 shut down oi l and gas production from the outer continental shelf in the gulf of mexico the source for 25 of us crude oil production and 20 of natural gas output katrina which made landfall on august

contingency inventories many analysts in and out of congress agreed with the administration that reliance upon the marketplace during the shortages of 1973 and 1979 would probably have been less disruptive than the price and allocation regulations that were imposed but many argued that the spr should be used to moderate the price effects that can be triggered by shortages like those of the 1970s or the tight inventories experienced during the spring of 1996 and lack of confidence in supply availability early drawdown of the spr some argued was essential to achieve these objectives the reagan administration revised its positio n in january 1984 announcing that the spr would be drawn upon early in disruption this new policy was hailed as significant departure considerably easing congressional discontent over the administrations preparedness policy but it also had international implications some analysts began to stress the importance of coordinating stock drawdowns worldwide during an emergency lest stocks drawn down by one nation merely transfer into the stocks of another and defeat the pricestabilizing objectives of stock drawdown in july 1984 responding to pressure from the united states the international energy agency agreed in principle to an early drawdown rese rving decisions on timing magnitude rate and duration of an appropriate stockdraw until specific

revisited in the aftermath of the iraqi invasion of kuwait on august 2 1990 the escalation of gasoline prices and the prospect that there might be worldwide crude shortfall approaching 4550 million barrels daily prompted some to call for drawdown of the spr the debate focused on whether spr oil should be used to moderate anticipated price increases before oil supply problems had become physically evident in the days immediately following the iraqi invasion of kuwait the george h w bush administration indicated that it would not dr aw down the spr in the absence of physical shortage simply to lower prices on the other hand some argued that perceived shortage does as much and more immediate damage than real one and that flooding the market with stockpiled oil to calm markets is desirable end in itself from this perspective the best opportunity to use the spr during the first months of the crisis was squandered it became clear during the fall of 1990 that in decontrolled market physical shortages are less likely to occur instead shortages are likely to be expressed in the form of higher prices as purchasers are free to bid as high as they wish to secure scarce supply within hours of the first air strike against iraq in january 1991 the white house announced that president bush was authorizing drawdown of the spr and the iea activated the plan on january 17 crude prices plummeted by nearly 10barrel in the next days trading falling below 20bbl for the first time since the original invasion the price drop was attributed to optimistic reports about the allied forces crippling of iraqi air power and the diminished likelihood despite the outbreak of war of further jeopardy to wo rld oil supply the iea plan and the spr drawdown did not appear to be needed to help settle markets and there was some criticism of it nonetheless more than 30 million barrels of spr oil was put out to bid but doe accepted bids deemed reasonable for 173 million barrels the oil was sold and delivered in early 1991 the persian gulf war was an important learning experience about ways in which the spr might be deployed to maximize its usefulness in decontrolled markets as

vigorously opposed the idea in part because it might establish precedent that would bring about additional sales of spr oil for purely budgetary reasons as did indeed occur there were three sales of spr oil during fy1996 the first was to pay for the decommissioning of the weeks island site the second was for the purpose of reducing the federal budget deficit and the third was to offset fy1997

prices of gasoline and other petroleum products following hurricanes katrina and rita for example were not response to any shortage of crude but to shortages of products owing to the shutdown of major refining capacity in the united states and to an interruption of product transportation systems the rise in crude prices to over 140barrel by the summer of 2008 were attributable to many contributing factors including increasing international demand and concern that demand for crude might outstrip world production markets were described as tight meaning that there might be little cushion in terms of spare production capacity to replace any crude lost to the market or to provide adequate supply of petroleum products in such market where demand seems to be brushing against the limits to meet that demand refinery outages whether routine or unexpected can spur spike in crude and product prices as can weekly reports of us crude and petroleum stocks if the numbers reported are not consistent with expectations as prices continued to increase during 20072008 some argued that market conditions did not support the high prices one market analyst remarked at the end of october 2007 the market at this stage totally ignores any bearish news that would soften the price of oil but it tends to exaggerate

administration to release oil from the spr during the spring and summer of 2008 review of the dynamics in the oil market during this period provides demonstration of why an spr release in the face of high prices will not necessarily foster decline in petroleum prices by midjuly 2008 us gasoline prices were exceeding 400gallon and diesel fuel was averaging 475gallon crude oil prices had briefly exceeded more than 145barrel but declined late in the month to less than 128barrel oil prices had risen in recent years in the absence of the normal association with the concept of disruption or shortage the escalation in prices to their observed peak in july 2008 were driven by several factors that are difficult to weigh chief among them was the existence of little or spare oil production capacity worldwide and general inelasticity in demand for oil products despite high prices prices also generally prove sensitive to the ebb and flow of international tensions the value of the us dollar and even the appearance of storms that could develop into hurricanes that might make landfall in the gulf of mexico in the months prior to hurricanes gustav and ike there were some calls for an spr drawdown despite the absence of any discernible shortage on july 24 2008 legislation hr 6578 to require 10 drawdown of spr oil failed to achieve twothirds majority in the house under suspension of the rules 226190 the language was included in hr 6899 the comprehensive american energy security and consumer protection act which passed the house on september 16 th 236189 the bill would have required sale of 70 million barrels of light grade petroleum from the spr within six months following enactment the bill s tipulated that 20 million barrels must be offered for sale during the first 60 days all oil from the sale would be replaced with sour crude to be acquired after the sixmonth sale period with the replacement acquisition completed not later than five years after enactment the genesis of the proposal lay partly in an analysis by the government accountability office which observed that the proportion of grades of oil in the spr was not as compatible as it could be with the trend of refineries toward being able to handle heavier grades of crudes refiners reported to gao that running lighter crude in units designed to handle heavy crudes could impose as much as an 11 penalty in gasoline production and 35 in diesel production the agency reported that other refiners indicated that they might have to shut down some of their units 15 it was unclear what sort of effect roughly 70 million barrel draw on the spr would have on prices in market where there is physical shortage oil companies may have limited interest in 14 oil daily october 30 2007 crude continues its

into useful products or want to build crude oil stocks16 spr oil is not sold at belowmarket prices bids on spr oil are accepted only if the bids are deemed fair to the us government if the announcement itself that the spr is going to be tapped does not prompt or contribute to softening of prices there may be limited interest on the part of the oil industry in bidding on spr supply although the possibility exists that prices might decline if additional refined product is released into the market it was impossible to predict what effect an spr drawdown would have had on oil prices at any time in 2008 given the many other factors that bear on daily oil prices there were additional considerations unilateral draw on us stocks will probably have less impact on the world oil market than coordina ted international drawdown of the sort that occurred after hurricanes katrina and rita in 2005 some might argue that it would be unwise under any scenario for the us to draw down its st rategic stocks while other nations continue to hold theirs at current levels additionally it is always possible that producing nations might reduce production to offset any spr oil delivered into the market in the setting of 2008 producing exporting nations could have argued that the market was already wellsupplied and that shortterm supply concerns were not what was supporting elevated prices the spr has been perceived as defensive policy tool against high oil prices but if it is used without discernible impact on oil prices it is possible that the spr will lose some of whatever psychological leverage it exercises on prices when left as an untapped option

shortage of significant scope and duration the adverse impacts of which would be significantly reduced by use of the nhor during mid and late december 2000 the 60 differential was breached however this was due to sharp decline in crude prices rather than to rise in home heating oil prices in fact home heating oil prices were drifting slightly lower during the same reporting period as consequence while the 60 differential was satisfied other conditions prerequisite to authorizing drawdown of the nhor were not general strike in venezuela that began in late 2002 resulted for time in loss of as much as 15 million barrels of daily crude supply to the united states with refinery utilization lower than usual owing to less crude reaching the united states domestic markets for home heating oil had to rely on refined product inventories to meet demand during particularly cold winter prices rose and there were calls for use of the nhor still the price of heating oil fell significantly short of meeting the guidelines for drawdown 17 in connection with the fy2004 interior appropriations both the house and senate appropriations committees included language in their committee reports directing that doe advise congress as to the circumstances under which the nhor might be used the provision implied that some in congress were not satisfied with the formula
