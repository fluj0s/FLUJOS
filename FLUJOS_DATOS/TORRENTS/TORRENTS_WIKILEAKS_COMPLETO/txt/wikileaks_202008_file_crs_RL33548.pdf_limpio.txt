ctbt north kor ea conducted nuclear test in 2006 since 1997 the united states has held 23 subcritical experiments at the nevada test site to st udy how plutonium behaves under pressures generated by

launch an evaluation of the ctbt detection system with the results due to be presented in june 2009 history ban on nuclear testing is the oldest ite m on the arms control agenda efforts to curtail tests have been made since th 1940s in the 1950s the united states and soviet union conducted hundreds of hydrogen bomb tests the radioactive fallout from these tests spurred worldwide protest these pressures plus desire to reduce ussoviet confrontation af ter the cuban missile crisis of 1962 led to the limited test ban treaty of 1963 whic h banned nuclear explosions in the atmosphere in space and under water the threshold test ban treaty signed in 1974 banned underground nuclear weapons sts having an explosive force of more than 150 kilotons the equivalent of 150000 tons of tnt 10 times the force of the hiroshima bomb the peaceful nuclear explosions treaty signed in 1976 extended the 150kiloton limit to nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes president carter did not pursue ratification of these treaties preferring to negotiate comprehensive test ban treaty or ctbt ban on all nuclear ex plosions when agreement seemed near however he pulled back bowing to argument s that

respectivel in early 1992 many in congress favored oneyear test moratorium the effort led to the hatfieldexonmitchell amendment to the fy1993 energy and wat er development ppropriations bill which

worldwide to halt the spread of nuclear technology in weapons and the nuclear weapons in th united states arsenal are safe and reliable while testing offered advantages for safety reliability and test ban readiness the price we would pay in conducting those test s now by undercutting our own nonproliferation goals and ensuring that other nations w ould resume testing outweighs these benefits therefore he 1 extended the moratorium at least through september 1994 2 called on other nations to extend their moratoria 3 said he would direct doe to prepare to conduct additional tests while seeking approval to do so from congre ss if another nation tested 4 promised to explore other means of maintaining our confidence in the safety the reliability and the performance of our own weapons

onfirms that north korea conducted an underground nuclear explosion in the vici nity of punggye on october 9 2006 the explosion yield was less than kiloton42 most us observers cited in news repor ts believe that the event was small nuclear explosion but at most partial ccess one hypothesis is that through poor design the device did not implode pr operly greatly reducing its yield43 other hypotheses are that the device reduced th amount of plutonium used in order to conserve that material or engineers sought to test the design rather than yield of the device or the device was smaller and more sophisticated than anticipated44 on the latter point siegfried hecker former di rector alamos national laboratory stated that the north korean weapon designers most likely did not test nagasakitype device basic implosion vice because they could have had high confidence without testing that such device would work instead his analysis is that the north koreans most likely tested more advanced design even at the risk of partial failure which is what the seismic signals appear to confirm he considers it highly unlikely that they intentionally signed mininuke however even if the test was not fully successf ul he believes they lear ned much from the test45 more advanced warhead would be of greater military value to north korea than nagasaki bomb because missile could carry it but

prepare for another test by determining the lessons of the first test redesigning the device and testing com ponents of the new design moratorium during that time would have little if any impact on its test program the seismic record of the north korean test when compared with recordings of 2002 earthquake recorded at seismic station in wonju republic of korea shows differences in seismic wave patterns that are diagnostic of an explosive source47 for example seismic waves from the earthquake build up over several seconds while waves from the explosion rrive suddenly once the amplitudes are measured the yield may be estimated but this is complicated by factors such as the local geology and the specifics of the burial arthur lernerlam associate director for seismology geology and tectonophysi cs lamontdoherty earth observatory columbia university said that the seismic record is not useful for determining whether the event was nuclear or conven tional explosion without making additional assumptions or inferences48 mining explosions are ty pically detonate d over several seconds in order to break rock efficiently so their seismological signature can be interpreted in terms of such ripple firing however if north korea attempted to mimic the signature of nuclear explosion by setting off all the explosive at the same time lernerlam said it would be virtually impossible to discriminate between conventional and nuclear explosions using seismological data alone complementary observations provide more direct evidence nuclear explosion re leases radioactive isotopes of certain gases they may take days to reach the surface but once they dissipate into the atmosphere he said they may be tected by speciallyequipped aircraft or ground stations49 the ability of the seismic network to detect an explosion that most sources place at or below one kiloton and in one case as low as onefifth of kiloton may hold implications for the ctbt the treatys s upporters claim that the ability to detect subkiloton tests should negate arguments against the treaty on grounds of inadequate monitoring capability the comprehensive nucleartestban treaty organization preparatory

november 19 1993 the united nati ons general assembly unanimously approved resolution calling for negotia tion of ctbt the cds 1994 session opened in geneva on january 25 with negotiation of ctbt its top priority the priority had to do with extension of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt52 that treaty entered into force in 1970 it divided the world into nuclear haves the united states soviet union britain france and china the five 53 declared nuclear powers which are also the permanent five p5 members of the security council and nuclear hav enots the p5 would be the only states party to the npt to have nuclear weapons but they and others would negotiate in good faith on halting the nuclear arms race s oon on nuclear disarmament and on general and complete disarm ament nonnuclear weapon st ates saw attainment of ctbt as the touchstone of good faith on these matters the npt provided for reviews every five years review in 1995 25 years after it entered into force would determine whether to extend the treaty indefi nitely or for one or more fixed periods the review and extension conference of aprilmay 1995 extended the treaty indefinitely extension was accompanied by certain measures including decision on principles and objectives for nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament that set forth goals on universality of the npt nuc lear weapon free zones etc and stressed the

not concluding ctbt they saw progress on winding down the arms race as inadequate they assailed the npt as di scriminatory because it divides the world into nuclear and nonnuclear states and argu ed for regime in which nation has nuclear weapons the ctbt in their view symbolized this regime because unlike the npt the p5 would give up something tangible the ability to develop new sophisticated warheads some nonnuclear states saw npt exte nsion as their last source of leverage for ctbt other nonnucl ear states felt that the npt was in the interests of all but w ouldbe proliferators that

finally drawn between ctbt and npt lent urgency to negotiations on the former the cd reached draft treaty in augu st 1996 india argued that the ctbt should be securely anchored in the gl obal disarmament cont ext and be linked through treaty language to the eliminati on of all nuclear weapons in time bound framework54 india also wanted treaty to bar weapons research not involving nuclear tests the draft treaty did not meet these conditions which the nuclear weapon states rejected so india vetoed it at the cd on august 20 barring it from going to the general assembly as cd document as an alternate way to open the treaty for signing australia on august 23 asked the general assembly to consider resolution to adopt the draft ct bt text and for the secretarygeneral to open it for signing so it could be adopted by simple majority or by the twothirds majority that india sought avoiding the n eed for consensus potential pitfall was that the resolution the treaty text was subject

the ited states did not pay its 2002 dues in full by d ecember 31 2002 these suspensions have lasted for few months between the end of calendar year and the date when the united states paid its contribution for that year because the united states has contributed less than the amount assessed for 2002 and each subsequent year it paid fully the previ ous years balance but contributed lesser amounts to the current years assessm ent so the arrearage has grown the arrearage results from us policy since the united states does not seek entry into force of the ctbt but favors improving means of monitoring nuclear testing the administration requests only t hose funds for the prepcom that directly support the ims these funds are in th international affairs function 150 budget in the

many evasion attempts95 they maintain that the ability of the ims along with other networks to detect the north korean nuclear test of october 2006 argues for accelerating ims deployment yet the

voting rights suspended so its shortfall will have correspondingly greater impact for example statement by the group of 77 plus china noted the nonpayment by major contributor of its financial obligations to the prepcom the group is very concerned that during the recent years nearly 15 million has not been paid by major contributor such situation if it continues would create serious challenge to the ctbt verification regime and jeopardize the future of the whole system98 supporters also express concern over potential political consequences in this view us failure to meet its obligations weakens the incentive for other nations to pay their dues to the prepcom and undercuts support for other internati onal organizations more generally opponents of the ctbt see little value in being able to cast vote in an organization that operates by consensus nd that would implement treaty the united states opposes they feel that adverse consequences to us security of ratifying the ctbt and having it enter into force outweigh immeasurably whatever beneficial consequences might accrue from having the right to vote in the prepcom they note that 64 nations had their voting rights

for the stockpile stewardship pr ogram over the next decade and beyond109 the ability of the stewardship program to maintain nuclear wea pons without testing was crucial issue in the senate debate on th ctbt the treatys opponents claimed that stewardship offered gu arantee of maintaining weapons and that experiments computer models and othe r techniques might offer clue to some problems that develop over time they fu rther argued that it could be perhaps decade before the tools for the program were fully in place and by that time many weapon designers with test experience would have

arguments include the following can the united states maintain deterrence without testing the treatys supporters hold that us programs can ma intain existing tested weapons without further testing pointing to 12 annual assessments that thes weapons remain safe and reliable and claim that these weapons meet any deterrent needs opponents maintain that there can be confidence in existing warheads as many minor modifications will change them from tested versions so testing is needed to restore and maintain confidence they see deterrence as dyna mic requiring new wea pons to counter new threats and assert that th weapons must be tested are monitoring and verifica tion capability sufficient monitoring refers to technical capability verification to its ad equacy to maintain security supporters hold that advances in monitoring make it hard for an evader to conduct undetected tests they claim that any such tests would be too small to affect the strategic balance opponents see many opportunities fo r evasion and believe that clandestine tests could put the united states at serious disadvantage how might the treaty affect nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament supporters claim that the treaty makes t echnical contributions to nonproliferation such as limiting wea pons programs some supporters believe that nonproliferation requires progress toward nucl ear disarmament with the treaty key step opponentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33548crs35 believe that strong nuc lear deterrent is essen tial for nonproliferation that nonproliferation and disarmament are unrelat ed and that
