4year colleges and universities 124 million enrolled as unde rgraduates the composition of the student population the rates at which di fferent groups in the general population participate in postsecondary education and potential future changes in the enrolled population are all likely to be of particular interest to the us congress as it considers the reauthorization of the higher education act the population of currently enrolled unde rgraduates is primarily composed of white nonhispanic young adults twoth irds are white nonhispanic and nearly threequarters are between 15 and 25 none theless minority st udents constitute sizeable portion of postsecondary enrollment particularly among older students 3in10 undergraduates betw een 15 and 24 and nearly 4in10 undergraduates over 24 are either black hispanic or asian n ontraditional students ie those older than 24 or enrolling on less than fulltime basi s also make up large portion of the population nearly 4 out of every 10 enrolled undergraduates with respect to pos tsecondary participa tion rates in the general population race ethnicity and family income are clearly associated with undergraduate enrollment among all high school graduates between 15 and 24 whites and asians are more likely to be enrolled in college than are blacks and hispanics 41 and 51 compared to 37 and 34 respectively similarly highincome individuals in this age group participate at higher rates than do lowincome individuals the enrollment rate among all high school graduates with family income of 75000 or more is 58 compared to 34 among all high school graduates with family income less than 25000 since the inception of the hea the female share of total postsecondary enrollment including graduate and first professional students has grown markedly women made up 38 of enro llment in 1965 compared to 55 in 2000 even with large racial and ethnic discrepancies in curre nt participation rates there has been general increase in minority enrollment in r ecent decades the percent of postsecondary students identified as black increased from 6 in 1965 to 14 in 2000 hispanic enrollment increased from ss than 1 in 1975 to more than 9 in 2000 what are some of the implications of these findings for the hea the continued positive association between posts econdary participati on and income and lower participation rates among blacks and hispanics may spark debate about the investment in the heas needbased stude nt aid these findings may also focus attention on the hea programs that provide support services to improve disadvantaged secondary school students movement through the educational pipeline further the finding that non traditional students ma ke up substantial portion of postsecondary education enrollme nt suggests that concerns about the ability of hea student aid programs to serve these students are unlikely to abate in the near futurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31441contents introduction 1 h p l i c m k

on th 124 million enrolled as undergraduates3 in the fall of 2000 describing key attributes of this currently enrolled population it will also analyze current ra tes at which different soci oeconomic groups participate in postsecondary education finally the re port will consider the future composition of the postsecondary student population thes topics provide an important context for consideration and developm ent of federal higher edu cation policy this report will not be updated hea policymaking the core of the hea is its array of programs providing financial assistance to student s particularly those with financial need needbased aid is key element in the longstanding hea mission to expand access to postsecondary education partly as result of this mission the topics analyzed in this report raise issues that are fundamentally linked to hea policy for example thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31441crs2 4 the cps is monthly survey of approxi mately 50000 households the october iteration of the survey asks respondents supplem ental questions about their education 5 the intergroup comparisons made in this repor t have been tested using cps guidelines and were found to be statistically significant unless noted otherwise 6 the cps data do not distinguish between rollment in private nonprofit institutions and enrollment in private forprof it proprietary institutions 7 generally the youngest age cohorts considered here begin with age 15 often the earliest age at which census data indicate individuals are estimated to be enrolled in postsecondary education 8 this is the age that divides the undergraduate population in halfsheer number of individuals enrolled in pos tsecondary education is important because policy changes may affect large number of i ndividuals further costs to the federal government of policies seeking to extend assistance or services across significant portion of this enrollment are likely to be hi gh simply because of its size diversity of this student population s important implications for hea programs eligibility for current hea needbased stude nt aid programs is directly affected by such factors as students income and whether they are enrolled fulltime or parttime in addition the success or failure of the federal multibillion dollar investment in hea student aid programs has often been measured in terms of evidence of change in the access to postsecondary education of different socioeconomic groups data source this analysis of the cu rrent student population higher education participation rates and future enrollment is based on data made available by the us census bureau the first two sections which focus on the enrolled student body and on participation rates are based on cps data collected during october 20004 the concluding section relies on hi storical october cps data as well as past population estimates and future population projec tions made by the census bureau5 current postsecondary education students this section paints portrait of current undergraduate students in terms of age gender race and ethnicity family income enrollment status fulltime or less than fulltime institutional level 4year or 2year and institutional control public or private6 it also considers the relative balance between traditional and non traditional students at the undergraduate level demographics of enrolled undergraduates the postsecondary enrolled population is predominantly white nonhi spanic under age 25 and slightly more female than male also these student s are from families with incomes above the us average table 1 presents data on the enrolled unde rgraduate population in the fall of 20007 it focuses on how various character istics of the enrolled population differ across broad age

subsequent section of this report 11 these groups are subsequently referred to in this report as whites blacks asians and hispanics following us census bureau definitions hispanics can be of any race 12 students away at college are still classified as household members even though they are not present in the household during the surv ey week see us census bureau technical paper 63rv current popula tion survey design and methodology march 2002the overall undergraduate popul ation is 56 female this female majority increases markedly with age among those between 15 and 24 the proportion female is 54 among those 25 and older 60 are female among those over 34 the female share rises to 65 data not shown in table 1 it appears that women have greater propensity than men to pur sue postsecondary education at later stages of the life course10 the white nonhispanic student population accounts for 69 of all undergraduates compared to 15 for blac k nonhispanics 10 for hispanics and 7 for asian nonhispanics11 minority representation is higher among older undergraduates of undergra duates 15 to 24 years of age 29 are minority of undergraduates over the age of 24 37 are minority the best available measure in the october cps of the economic status of postsecondary students is family income that is the combined income from all sources for the student and all of those id entified by the survey as being in the students family the students family includes all relatives by birth marriage or adoption that reside in the family house hold as well as the student regardless of whether he or she lives elsewhere for part of the calendar year12 it is important to note that the ability of cps sampling methodology to link students living away from home back to their families is limited in certain cases family income is the sum of income fo r all household member s who are related to the reference person or rp ie the person who owns or rents the household sampled in the survey and not necessar ily the survey respondent among the undergraduates identified in october 2000 31 were the rp 60 were related to the rp mostly as children and spouses nd 9 were not related to the rp mostly partners and roommate s since members of the last group are not related to the rp family income is not available and they are not included in the income figures reported here among those who were the rp about half 14 of the entire sample of undergraduates had re latives in the household although family income is reported for these individuals it is equal to their personal income whether they may have access to the income of othe r possible family members is unknown without specific information about the actual funds transferred between family members the cps measures students potential access to financial resources through the amount of family income and the family relationships identified by the survey for the large majority of cases family income as measured by the cps serves as reasonable indicator of this potential in addition distinct from issues of actual versus potential resources family income is useful as measure of studentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31441crs5 13 the financial relationship between student nd his or her parents is measured differently under the system established by the hea for determining students financial need for federal student aid programs it defines students financial connection to his or her parents income and assets in terms of seve ral specific characteristics student is considered financially independent from his or her parents if any of the following apply the student is 24 years old or older by december 31st of the award year is an orphan or ward of the court or was until age 18 is veteran of the armed forces is graduate or professional student is married or has depe ndents other than spouse any student not meeting one of these conditions is considered financially dependent on his or her parents none of these conditions measures whether student is actually financially dependent or independent of parents for example fo r financial aid purposes student who has dependent child and who resides with his or her parents is treated as financially independent even if the parents contribute substantial resources to the student 14 family income data based on the federal need analysis definition of independence are gathered periodically through the nationa l postsecondary student aid study npsas this survey of nationally representative sample of students was most recently conducted for 19992000 it gathers data on student and family financing of postsecondary education as well as general characteristics of the enrolled population crs estimates using the 1999 2000 npsas show somewhat higher perc entage of undergraduates in the under 25000 category and complementary lower percentage in the 75000 and over category this is likely function at least in part of the attr ibution of income to students in npsas based on federal need analysis dependency rules ra ther than actual or potential access to the income of other family members socioeconomic background this use of family income is consistent with the following section of this report which pr esents data on postsec ondary participation rates of individuals in the general population coming from different family income levels13 just over half of those enrolled in postsecondary education are members of families with incomes under 50000 near ly onequarter were under 25000 and well over onequarter are over 7500014 median family income for students age 15 to 24 is 55000 compared to 45000 for those over 24 figure 1 presents family income for these two age groups by racial and ethnic backgroundhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31441crs6 15 npsas estimates of the distribution of st udents across institutional sectors differ from those reported here from the cps for exam ple npsas shows higher percentage of students enrolled in 2year institutions than does the cps at least 42 compared to an estimated 31 among the differences be tween the two surveys contributing to this disparity in estimates is that the npsas da ta are based on enrollments across an entire

reported by the chronicle of higher education new panel opens national dialogue on federal studentaid policy february 28 2002 to have stated that student aid programs do not address well the needs of nontraditional students cycling in and out of postsecondary education 17 see for example the discussion of who is nontraditional student in us department of education national center for education statistics nontraditional undergraduates trends in enrollment from 1986 to 1992 and persistence and attainment among 19891990 beginning postsecondary students nces 97578 november 1996 hereafter cited as nces nontraditional undergraduates 18 the nces study on nontraditional undergraduates identified seven different characteristics that it associated with non traditional status for undergraduates being financially independent parental income and assets are not considered for federal need analysis purposes having delayed entry into postsecondary education enrolling parttime working fulltime having dependents being single parent or completing high school by obtaining ged or othe r certificate for each of the 3 years analyzed by that study distinct majority of all undergraduates were considered to be at least minimally nontraditional having at least one of the non traditional characteristics the percentage ranged from approximately 646 in fall 1 986 to 6 96 in fall 1992 the three most predominant factors were age enrollment status and financial dependency the last factor continued10000 higher than for those attendi ng 2year sc hools 55000 and 45000 respectively in terms of public versus private school s significant disparities were found in the cps data with respect to age gender or race however hispanics are much less likely than nonhispanics to attend private schools in addition those who are attending private schools have higher fa mily incomes than those attending public schools 55000 and 45000 respectively traditional versus nontr aditional undergraduates there is concern among some that hea student aid prog rams are designed for the socalled traditional student and may not adequately serve the nontraditional postsecondary education student16 this portion of the report explores the extent to which the undergraduate population is nontraditional the nontraditional label is imprecise and much debated17 there is consensus on the characteristics that di stinguish traditional from nontraditional students underlying this issue is an understanding that todays student population includes significant number of individuals who differ from the majority of students in the mid1960s through early 1970s when much of the present hea student aid framework was constructed the present analysis focuses on two characteristics to distinguish the traditional from the nontraditional underg raduate populations age and enrollment status these two characteristics are among those most commonly used to make this distinction further they are likely to be associated with additional factors that others have used to identify the nontrad itional student such as working fulltime while going to school and having dependents18 with regard to age for purposes ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31441crs8 18 continued financial dependency may be somewhat problematic distinguishing characteristic since the definition of independent financial status for federal student aid purposes has changed over time leaving some question as to its utility as measure for these purposes 19 high school completion is defined in this an alysis as either the granting of diploma or the completion of general educational deve lopment ged test delineating the impact of differences in the participation rates of di ploma recipients and ged completers is beyond the scope of the present analysisthis analysis we analyze the portions of the undergraduate population that are under and over the age of 25 the enrollment stat us is divided into student enrolled on fulltime basis enrolled for 12 or more credit hours and those enrolled less than fulltime as noted above according to october 2000 cps data 72 of all undergraduates are under the age of 25 28 are 25 or older undergraduates enrolled on fulltime basis make up 72 of todays unde rgraduates while 28 are parttime if the traditional student is defined as one under 25 years of age enrolled on fulltime basis 61 of all of toda ys undergraduate s meet that definition leaving the remaining 39 of undergra duates with nontraditional status comparing the characteristics of the tr aditional and nontrad itional students we find that nontraditional students are more likely to be enrolled in 2year public institutions they are also more likely to be minority and to have relatively low income of traditional students 78 attend 4year institutions and 78 attend public schools in contrast for nontraditi onal students these percentages are 57 and 86 respectively nontraditional students are more likely to be minority than are traditional students 36 compared to 28 blacks account for much of this difference representing 13 of traditi onal students and 18 of nontraditional students the median family income of traditional students is 55000 compared to 45000 for nontraditional students nontrad itional students family income does not vary by 2year4year or publicprivate school status however among trad itional students family income varies from median of 67500 for those attending all private institutions to 55000 for those in public 4year schools nd 45000 for those in all 2year schools undergraduate participation rates the above data on currently enrolled st udents are limited in what they can say about the important issue of educational access the relevant question to ask in terms of access is not what proportion of enrolled students come from various population subgroups the question ddressed above but rather what proportion of various subgroups are enrolling in postsecondary education to this end the analysis now turns to rates of particip ation in higher education among various socioeconomic sectors of the us population first it is important to note that two factors have very large impact on participation rates age and high school completion19 among all individuals in the us 15 years old and older 6 were rolled as undergraduate s in the fall of 2000httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31441crs9 20 although many of those in the 15 to 18 age group are still in high school the cps data identifies enough individuals in this age gr oup who are enrolled in postsecondary education to warrant the use of lower age bound of 15 in this analysiscompared to 23 of those between 15 and 24 and 2 of those over age 24 similarly among all hi gh school gra duates 15 years old and older20 7 were enrolled as undergraduates in the fall of 2000 compared to 40 of high school graduates between 15 and 24 and 2 of high school gr aduates over age 24 thus the following presentation of particip ation rates by popula tion subgroup will be made while controlling for ag and high school completion undergraduate participation rates among individuals age 15 to 24 table 2 presents the rates of undergraduate postsecondary educa tion participation among various subgroup populations by age and high school completion among all those in the general population age 15 to 24 the participation rate for females is 25 and 21 for males that is 1 in 4 fe males and just over 1 in 5 males in this age group are in postsecondary education among high school graduates 1524 the

more than doubles from 15 to 34 neverthele ss there remain gaps in participation rates for high school graduates across racial and ethnic groups as shown in figure 3 below postsecondary education

undergraduate participation rat among individuals over age 24 as noted earlier the 2000 cps data reveal that about 4 in 10 undergraduates are non traditional students ie over 24 or parttime because this is significant proportion of the student population it is usef ul to look at par ticipation rates among those over age 24 by socioeconomic status review of the righthand columns in table 2 reveals that the 25 to 34 year old participation rates for high school graduates who are either female hispanic or have low family income are slightly higher than the all persons rate also larger proportions of these groups are enrolled in postsecondary education than are males whites or high income individuals fo r example 6 of females 25 to 34 are enrolled compared to 5 of males that age 9 of blacks 25 to 34 are enrolled compared to 5 of whites and 6 of 25 to 34 year olds with family income under 25000 are enrolled compared to 4 of those over 75000 useful way to look at the data presented in table 2 is to break the participation rate s into two categories 1 subpopul ations that have higher rates than their comparison population21 at every age and 2 subpopulations that have lower rates in the 1524 age group and high er rates for those over 24 females and asians fit in the first category and black s and hispanics and lower income persons fit in the second category specifically fema have higher rate s than males in all three age groupings and asians have high er rates than whites in all three age groupingshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31441crs13 22 the data used for this figure are for all individuals enrolled in postsecondary education regardless of the year of enrollment not just undergraduates as is true for the previous sections of this report further the enrolled population is capped at age 34 because that was the age limit for cps data published through much of this period as result the percentages of enrollment for different gr oups discussed here differ from those presented earlier in this report the income data used are based on the number of families with at least one dependent child in postsecondary education rather than on the number of individuals as was the case in data reported earlier in this reporton the other hand blacks had lower rate s than whites in the 15 to 24 age group but had higher rates in the 25 to 34 age group following similar trend those with low income had lower rates than those with higher income in the 15 to 24 age group but had higher rates in the 25 to 34 age group finally hispanic high school graduates have lower rates than white high school graduates in the 15 to 24 age group but have higher rates in the 25 to 34 age group comparative rates in the total 25 to 34 age group differ by one percentage point the interpretation of the findings for the femalemale comparison and the asianwhite comparison appears straig htforward females and asians attend postsecondary education at higher rate re gardless of their age or incidence of high school completion however making sense of the findings among other intergroup comparisons is more complex that blacks those with below aver age income and hispanic high school graduates had higher rates in the 25 to 34 age group could mean either that these individuals take longer to complete postsecondary educa tion degree or that they are less likely to enter postsecondary education di rectly out of high school their lower participation rates in the 15 to 24 age gr oup as well as the convergence of the income distributions among those over 24 in diffe rent racialethnic groups seen earlier in figure 1 gives strong support to the latter expl anation that is upper income whites appear much more likely to start and fini sh school before age 24 while lower income nonwhites do not follow this pattern ho wever without longitudinal data or information on time taken to complete degree it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions future postsecondary education students two sets of trendlines provide insight into the composition of the future postsecondary student population the first presented in figure 4 are the historic

over the last 35 years in 1965 only 38 of students enrolled in postsecondary education were female compared to 55 in 2000 there was similarly dramatic decline in the postsec ondary education population below the age of 25 in 1965 84 of enrolled students were 15 to 24 years old compared to 76 in 2000 although in recent years the 15 to 24 year old share has begun to rise the percentage of postsecondary education students identified as white substantially decreased from 94 to 78 the black share of enrollment more than doubled from 6 to 14 hispanic enrollment rose significantly from less than 1 in 1975 to somewhat more than 9 in 2000 finally relatively steady proportion about 63 of the enrolled population had fa mily income above the median family income for that year are these trends

steady at just over 50 the proportion of the overa ll population ag 14 to 24 r eached high point in the aftermath of the baby boom 21 in 1975 and then began to decline it is expected to continue to decline into the future down to 15 in 2015 as the elderly portion of the us population continues to grow23 further the histor ical and projected data show steady decrease in the white pr oportion of the population from 87 in 1965 to 80 in 2015 in contrast the rela tively rapid increase in the hispanic representation in the population is expected to continue rising from 4 in 1970 to 16 in 2015 comparison of the two preceding figures shows that demographics alone have not dictated changes in the characteristics of the enrolled population for some groups there clearly has been change in behavior for exampl females have made up relatively consistent share of the tota l population but have significantly increased their representation in postsecondary education over time this is primarily function of growth in the participation rate for wome n throughout this time periodhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31441crs16 24 the us department of education projects that the 14 to 24 year old

younger age cohort ppear more complex this cohorts share of total population declined from the mid 1970s until 2000 and is projected to continue to decline the representati on of this cohort in the enrolled student population declined until the mid 1990s even while declining as portion of the enrolled student population the participation rate of this age group in postsecondary education was increasing data not shown he re indeed higher proportion of this age cohort is enrolled today than previously these data are not sufficient to reach any precise conclusion about whether there will be marked changes in the representation of this younger age cohort and concurrently of older age cohorts in postsecondary education in the near future24 nevertheless given the currently substantial representation in postsecondary education of older age groups similar distribution will probably continue in the near term the forces which have given rise to increased nonwhite and hispanic participation may have an important demographic co mponent as these groups have grown into larger proportions of the gene ral population they have grown into larger proportions of the postsecondary education population the hispanic trendlines are particularly prominent the major sour ce of population growth in the united states during the last decade has been immig ration and demographers agree that immigration will continue to fuel population gr owth in the coming years since the vast majority of contemporary immigrants are hispanic the hispanic share of the total population is expected to conti nue to grow thr ough 2 015 ba sed on demographics alone it seems reasonable to expect that the proportion of hispanics in the postsecondary population will increase in the future further given their overall representation in the general population any increas in participation rates moving closer to those of whites or asians would lead to greater hispanic representation in pos tsecondary education conclusions selected findings among the significant findings presented in this report are the following race and ethnicity and family income are clearly associated with undergraduate enrollment for example wh ites and asians aged 15 to 24 are more likely to be enrolled than are blacks and hispanics similarly individuals in this age group with higher family inco participate at higher rates than do lowincome individuals at the same time blacks and hispanics constitute sizeable portion of postsecondary enrollment nearly onequart er of 15 to 24 year old undergraduates and nearly third of undergra duates over 24 years of age since the inception of the hea the minority share of postsecondary enrollment at all levels has grown markedly projected population changes sugge st that hispanics in particular will become major potential s ource of minority students nontraditional students ie those older than 24 or enrolling on less than full time basis are large portion of

three clusters of impli cations are considered below needbased student aid the continued association of family income with postsecondary participation despite substantial inve stment in hea needbased student aid may raise concerns about the ffectiveness of these programs as this report delineates individuals from higher income families are more likely to enroll than are ones from poorer circumstances am ong the questions such finding raises are the following are hea needbased st udent aid programs ad equately funded and appropriately targeted is the mix of hea grants loans and work appropriate for students from different family incomes are there needs other than financial that should also be addressed serving the pipeline the last question above helps to identify the second cluster of implications the impact of the hea on the k12 education pipeline that feeds students into postsecondary educati on the hea authorizes several programs that serve to complement the acts n eedbased student aid by supporting academic and nonacademic intervention activities for disadvantaged secondary school students these programs principally the trio programs and the gaining early awareness and readiness for undergraduate programs gear up provide such services as tutoring counseling and ntoring to disadvantaged secondary school students in an effort to enable them to finish high school and pursue postsecondary education25 such programs are premised on an understanding that enrollment of disadvantaged individuals in postseconda ry education is not function only of financial needs academic and othe r needs are there to be addressed the findings in this report that young bl ack and hispanic high school graduates participate in undergraduate education at lower rates th an do whites and asians and that lowincome individuals have much lower participation rates than do highincome individuals may raise concerns that th array of heas student aid and support services programs have not fully met their objectives this may prompt closer look at the funding levels for those programs the extent to which the support services programs effectively deliver their services and the extent to which they truly complement needbased student aid debate may also center on what further steps if any would be appropriate to take in the hea to improve the academic

has been concern about the ability of hea programs par ticularly student aid progra ms to serve nontraditional students however valid those concerns mig ht be an issue beyond the scope of the present paper it is clear that the nontraditi onal student is major presence in postsecondary education at minimum this suggests that the concerns expressed to date are unlikely to abate in the near rm further there may be merit in looking more closely at the nontraditional student first as was also suggested earlier simply defining what population is appropr iately identified as nontraditional is not without debate second cons ideration might be given to assessing nontraditional students particip ation in hea programs the actua l needs financial or other that such students have for assistance from thes programs and what barriers if any might curtail their appropriate participation
