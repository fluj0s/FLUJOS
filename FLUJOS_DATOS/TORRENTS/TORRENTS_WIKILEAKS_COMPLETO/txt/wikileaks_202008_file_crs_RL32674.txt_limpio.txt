domestic social policy division congressional research service the library of congress minorityserving higher education institutions analysis of selected institutional and student characteristics summary federal education policy recognizes different groups of minorityserving institutions msis of higher education and targets financial resources to them as the congress considers the reauthorization of the higher education act hea it will be deliberating on programs directing aid to msis in this report selected characteristics of five msi groups are analyzed this analysis helps to address several questions relevant to federal policymaking these include how msis are defined the role they play in educating minority students the diversity within and among msis their geographic distribution and the racial ethnic and income characteristics of their students this report will be updated as warranted by major legislative or other relevant developments for the purposes of this analysis msis include all title iv eligible institutions that are in at least one of the following groups majorityminority institutions mmis institutions where minority enrollment exceeds 50 of total enrollment historically black colleges and universities hbcus institutions eligible for hea title iii part b hispanicserving institutions hsis institutions where fulltime undergraduate enrollment is at least 25 hispanic tribal colleges and universities tcus institutions eligible for hea title iii section 316 and alaska native and native hawaiianserving institutions annhis current recipients of hea aid targeted to these institutions undergraduate enrollment is at least 20 alaska native or 10 native hawaiian some institutions are in more than one msi group certain institutional and student characteristics are shared by many msis yet there is substantial diversity among these institutions significant portion of msis in the aggregate are twoyear public institutions 41 yet nearly all hbcus are fouryear institutions 87 most msis are small often enrolling fewer than 1000 students yet 10 of hsis enroll 20000 or more students msis are located primarily in the southern and coastal states many in areas with high concentrations of particular racialethnic groups though most states have msis few have none the total students in each group of msis differs markedly some 13000 undergraduates are in annhis but over 2 million are in mmis students in msis are predominantly from minority backgrounds ranging from about 60 to over 80 of undergraduate enrollment msis play an important role in educating minority students often accounting for large shares of students from different minority groups msis in the aggregate enroll 61 of all hispanic undergraduates nevertheless with the exception of hispanic students the majority of students from individual minority groups do not attend msis large percentages of students at some msis are low income msis account for significant shares of all undergraduate degrees awarded to minorities particularly for hispanics hsis award more than 40 of hispanic bachelors degrees the relative distribution of fields in which these degrees are awarded does not differ for most msis from that of all undergraduate degrees contents introduction 1 informing federal policy 1 defining the groups 2 majorityminority institutions 3 historically black colleges and

institutions analysis of selected institutional and student characteristics introduction federal education policy recognizes different groups of minority1serving institutions msis of higher education and targets financial resources to them2 as the congress considers the reauthorization of the higher education act hea it will be deliberating on key programs directing aid to these institutions3 better understanding of the diversity and range of attributes of the various groups of institutions that are often collectively described as msis may assist in this federal policymaking process this report analyzes selected characteristics of the institutions and students making up five separate msi groups of institutions majorityminority institutions mmis historically black colleges and universities hbcus hispanicserving institutions hsis alaska native and native hawaiianserving institutions annhis and tribal colleges and universities tcus the definition of each of these groups of institutions is provided below data on msis in the aggregate are also analyzed informing federal policy the msis analyzed here are tied directly to current federal programs and provisions see following section this analysis will help address number of basic background questions relevant to federal policymaking for msis among these questions are the following 1 for the purposes of this analysis minority means any individual belonging to any of the following groups american indian or alaskan native asian or pacific islander black not of hispanic origin and hispanic 2 for additional information regarding federal funding for minorityserving institutions see crs report rl32396 federal funding for minorityserving institutions of higher education by charmaine jackson 3 relevant hea programs include institutional aid title iii developing institutions title v and minority science and engineering improvement program title iii these are all administered by the department of education among relevant programs administered outside of the department of education are the educational partnership program with minority serving institutions department of commerce and the minority university research and education program national aeronautics and space administration crs2 how are msis defined and what are the implications of those definitions what role do msis play in educating minority students particularly with regard to number and proportion of minority students served how different or similar are the several groups of msis how do they differ within groups across groups and from postsecondary education institutions in general how many and what types of degrees do msis award do they award the full range of postsecondary degrees how widely distributed are msis across the country are there states with direct ties to msis what are the racial ethnic and income characteristics of students served by these schools the answers that emerge from this analysis may assist in deliberation on federal policies and support for these institutions primarily because they help paint more complete picture of the msis consider for example the two primary and different ways in which the federal government has defined msis by the historical role they have played in educating minority populations eg hbcus or by the current composition of their student body eg hsis these two approaches may have some effect on the reach of these msis among all minority students it may not be surprising that hsis identified by the current level of their hispanic enrollment serve majority of all hispanic undergraduates in contrast as shown in this analysis majority of all other minority undergraduates are being educated outside of the msis as another example it may be important for policy purposes to understand that while the msis share some common characteristics eg most are twoyear institutions there is significant diversity within and across msi groups eg over 80 of hbcus are fouryear institutions policymaking premised solely on basic similarities among all msis may be less effective than efforts that also recognize diversity across these institutions finally there are limitations to the present analysis with regard to federal policymaking this report addresses selected characteristics of the msis it is beyond its scope to address wider range of issues that are potentially relevant to federal policymaking possible issues include the effectiveness of msis in educating minority students the impact of federal support on these institutions and the education of minority students in general defining the groups this section defines the groups of minorityserving institutions that are included in the analyses presented in this report although the groups of msis are distinct membership is not exclusive as result single institution can be classified in more than one group to large extent all msi groupings were constructed based upon definitions found in the hea specifically titles iii and v as result all of the institutions examined in this report msis and comparison group of institutions are degreegranting twoyear and fouryear institutions that are either public or private nonprofit proprietary institutions are not eligible to participate in hea crs3 title iii and v and hence none could be considered to be msis for this analysis4 they are also excluded from the comparison group of schools see below to allow for more accurate comparison with msis the msis and the institutions included in the comparison group are limited further to those that also meet the eligibility criteria for participation in the student aid programs under title iv of the hea5 majorityminority institutions mmis are identified by the percentage of an institutions student body that can be identified as racial or ethnic minority specifically mmis are those institutions whose enrollment of single minority or combination of minorities exceeds 50 of the total student enrollment this follows the heas minority science and engineering improvement program mseip definition for minorityserving institution6 for the purposes of this analysis each institutions minority enrollment percentage was calculated by dividing the reported racialethnic minority student population by the total student enrollment resulting in 474 institutions being defined as mmis historically black colleges and universities institutions are classified as hbcus if they are eligible to receive grant under title iii part b of the hea to qualify for grant under title iii part b of the hea an institution must have been established prior to 1964 and have as its principal mission the education of african americans this is an historical designation not one predicated on the current racial composition of the institutions as result several hbcus are majority white in terms of enrollment there are 102 institutions classified as hbcus for this analysis7 4 for additional information regarding title iii eligible institutions see crs report rl31647 reauthorization of title iii and title v of the higher education act issues for the 108th congress by charmaine jackson 5 this additional requirement which is not specified in title iii or title v is intended to limit institutions to those meeting broader array of eligibility requirements that are shared across these hea titles eg being accredited this has very small impact on only some msi groups and on the comparison group to be eligible for title iv student assistance postsecondary institution must be licensed or otherwise legally authorized to provide postsecondary education in the state in which it is located be accredited by an agency recognized for that purpose by the secretary of education and be deemed eligible and certified to participate in federal student aid programs by the department of education for additional information on institutional eligibility for title iv student aid see crs report rl31926 institutional eligibility for participation in title iv student aid programs under the higher education act background and issues by rebecca r skinner 6 unlike the mseip the definition of mmi used in this analysis includes asian americans mseip does not include asian americans in its definition of minority students 7 using the title iii part b eligibility criteria to select institutions for inclusion in the hbcu category produces group that is slightly different from some other listings of hbcus specifically both mary holmes college ms and morris brown college ga are ineligible to receive title iii aid due to their loss of accreditation thus they are excluded from this analysis in addition title iii part b section 326 provides grants to 18 selected institutions based on their contribution to certain professional fields charles drew university of medicine and science ca is included in this analysis because it is one of the 18 designated institutions although not always included in listings of hbcus finally continued crs4 hispanicserving institutions hsis analyzed in this research are intended to approximate the definition of an eligible hsi appearing in title v of the hea the ones included here were identified by the department of education ed in its integrated postsecondary education data system ipeds for fy2001fy2002 an institution received this designation if at least 25 of its full time undergraduate student enrollment is hispanic there are 237 institutions identified as hsis for this analysis8 tribal colleges and universities the tcus selected for inclusion in this analysis are the institutions that are eligible for grants under title iii part section 316 of the hea section 316 defines tcus as institutions identified by section 2 of the tribally controlled college or university assistance act of 1978 25 usc 1801 or those that are included in the equity in educational land grant status act of 1994 7 usc 3019 for this report there are 30 institutions10 identified as tcus alaska native and native hawaiianserving institutions the institutions included in this group currently receive grant under title iii part section 317 an institution is eligible for grant under this section if at least 20 of its undergraduate students are alaska native or 10 are native hawaiian11 there are eight institutions defined as annhis for this analysis 7 continued although hinds community college ms is included in this analysis the enrollment figures are not limited to the utica campus which is the designated hbcu hinds reports enrollment figures to the department of education for all six of its campuses collectively the total student enrollment as well as the racialethnic composition of the entire community college was included in this analysis 8 the full range of hsi eligibility requirements for title v part hispanicserving institutions of the hea cannot be applied due to data limitations to qualify as an hsi for the purposes of title v an institution must have at least 25 full time hispanic undergraduate student enrollment and not less than 50 of its hispanic student population must be low income these latter data are not available in addition eligible institutions must have low educational and general expenditures eg requisite enrollment of needy students be legally authorized within its respective state to award bachelors degrees or be community college and be accredited by nationally or state recognized accrediting agency title v part section 502 9 designated tcus must also satisfy the needy student requirement and have low eg as described in the previous reference for hsis hea title iii part section 312 b 10 this analysis includes institutions that meet the definition of eligibility for title iii section 316 have complete data available in ipeds for 20012002 are identified in ipeds as tribal college or university and are title iveligible of note si tanka university consists of two campuses si tanka huron universityeagle butte campus and si tanka university huronhuron campus only the former campus is identified in ipeds as tcu and only data for that campus are included in this analysis 11 in addition to the percentage requirement these institutions must also satisfy the eligibility requirements of the hea title iii part section 312 b the currently funded annhis make up this category because the requisite data on racial group membership to determine the full range of eligible institutions are not available crs5 minorityserving institutions for the purposes of this analysis msis include all title iv eligible institutions that belong to at least one of the groups of institutions under analysis in this report majorityminority institutions historically black colleges and universities hispanicserving institutions tribal colleges and universities or alaska native and native hawaiianserving institutions an institution can be in more than one msi group for example an hbcu can also be an mmi because its undergraduate student population may be greater than 50 minority there are 550 institutions classified as msis for this analysis postsecondary education institutions for the purposes of comparing the characteristics of the different groups of msis universe of postsecondary education institutions pseis was created the universe is defined as all title iv eligible twoyear and fouryear public and private nonprofit postsecondary education institutions the type and control of the msis as noted earlier dictated the attributes of the comparison group thus institutions that are not eligible for title iv exclusively award less than an associates degree or are proprietary are not included in the analysis the analysis was limited to institutions with these characteristics to allow for an accurate comparison between groups there are 3407 postsecondary education institutions included in this analysis this universe of postsecondary institutions also includes any institution that is included in any of the msi categories previously outlined data the data presented in this report are derived primarily from ipeds ipeds is series of surveys of postsecondary education institutions that gather information on such variables as location institutional control types of degrees awarded the number and minority status of enrolled students and the number of degrees awarded by field institutions participating in the hea title iv student aid programs are required to complete the series of surveys annually the ipeds data used for this analysis come from surveys of this universe of postsecondary education institutions and are not derived from survey samples12 nevertheless some of the data reported in ipeds have been imputed by ed to compensate for missing or erroneous data thus all values presented in this report should be interpreted as estimates the data on institutional characteristics including student enrollment are for fall 2001 while that for degrees completed apply to academic year 20012002 the raceethnicity categories used in this analysis are derived from ipeds currently ipeds uses five basic racialethnicity categories american indian or alaskan native asian or pacific islander black not of hispanic origin hispanic and white not of hispanic origin these categories do not disaggregate data for american indian alaskan native asian or pacific islander separately as result the student data presented in this report may differ somewhat from the institutional 12 these data were downloaded from eds peer analysis system and can be found at httpncesedgovipedspas crs6 categories for example the exact number of pacific islanders cannot be ascertained from the ipeds data because ipeds data group pacific islanders and asians the economic status of undergraduate students enrolled at these institutions was determined using ed data on the number of pell grant recipients in postsecondary education institutions at any point during the award year 2001200213 characteristics of msis in the following sections this report analyzes selected institutional characteristics of msis location size and highest degree offered and selected data for students attending msis racial and ethnic group membership of students income status of students and degrees awarded generally for each variable msis are compared among themselves and to the selected universe of title iv pseis described earlier institutional characteristics msis differ among themselves and often with pseis in general with regard to their location size and highest degree offered as is explored below some of the differences are substantial at the same time some attributes characterize the majority of msis type and control significant portion of the msis are twoyear public institutions 405 most notably 533 of tcus are twoyear public institutions as are nearly half of all hsis 468 in contrast nearly half 471 of all hbcus

states have one or more msis16 it is important to note that eight states have msis idaho nevada new hampshire maine rhode island utah vermont and wyoming see figure 1 15 map illustrating the geographic distribution for annhis is not included because these institutions are solely located in alaska and hawaii 16 the district of columbia is not visible on these maps however there are four institutions in the district of columbia classified as mmis two of which are also hbcus crs9 the different msi groups are often located in the areas of the country where there are concentrations of citizens from the respective racialethnic group this pattern can be observed for example among hsis there are large concentration of hispanics in the southern and western states and as shown in figure 4 majority of hsis are located in the southern and western regions of the country the ways in which msis are defined may influence this distribution in contrast to the hsis hbcus for example are designated on an historical basis founded prior to 1964 with principal mission of educating african americans and are not necessarily located in places that today have large concentrations of african americans figure 1 geographic distribution of msis source congressional research service estimates based on data from the us department of educations integrated postsecondary education data system

what are some of the socioeconomic characteristics of the students enrolled in minorityserving institutions and how do they differ from all postsecondary students the following analysis focuses on students race and ethnicity and their economic status it begins with an overview of the total number of undergraduates in msis in 2001 the aggregate number of students in all of the msis analyzed in this report was over 28 million 26 million of whom were undergraduates the total number of students enrolled in each group of msis varied significantly some such as the tcus enrolled few students while others such as the hsis had substantially higher numbers of students and accounted for significant percentages of all postsecondary education enrollment table 4 shows that undergraduate enrollment at msis ranged from almost 14000 tcus to over 2 million students mmis variation in the msis percentage share of undergraduate enrollment at comparable title iv postsecondary institutions was from 01 tcus to 160 mmis msis in the aggregate accounted for 196 of total undergraduate enrollment table 4 msi undergraduate enrollment fall 2001 estimated share of all undergraduate enrollment

follows the first row of numeric data shows that mmis enrolled an estimated 2150799 undergraduates in 2001 or an estimated 160 of all undergraduates excludes proprietary institutions race and ethnicity not surprisingly the enrollment in each of the groups of msis is largely minority in 2001 the portion of undergraduate enrollment in each of the msi groups that was minority ranged from 583 annhis to 841 hbcus and tcus in msis in the aggregate 671 of undergraduate enrollment was minority in general the predominant cohort of minority students within each msi group reflected the specific minority focus of that institutional sector eg hbcu undergraduate enrollment was 809 black in mmis there were two predominant racialethnic cohorts hispanic students 347 of mmi crs13 undergraduate

the us department of educations integrated postsecondary education data system notes this table should be read as follows the first row with numeric data shows the numbers of students enrolled in the mmis eg mmis enrolled an estimated 537272 black students the first row with percentage values shows the percentage of undergraduates in mmis who are members of the designated racial or ethnic group eg an estimated 250 of mmi undergraduates were black the undergraduate enrollment totals include nonresident aliens and students whose raceethnicity was reported as unknown as result the difference between the total minority percentage for each group of institutions and 100 does not equal the nonminority enrollment percentage each entry for total minority is equal to the sum of the values in that row for each of the preceding minority groups of students excludes proprietary institutions crs14 in comparison to their shares of undergraduate students msis in the aggregate and many of the msi subgroups of institutions account for disproportionately large shares of undergraduate minority students for example in 2001 msis enrolled 196 of all undergraduate students see table 4 but they enrolled the following shares of specific cohorts of undergraduate minorities well over half 605 of hispanics over third 377 of blacks more than third 350 of asianpacific islanders and nearly half 453 of all minority undergraduates see table 6 among hispanic undergraduates mmis and hsis enrolled 512 and 542 of hispanic undergraduates respectively in fall 200117 nevertheless with the exception of hispanic undergraduates undergraduate minority students are predominantly enrolled outside of the msis this is true even if one considers the total pool of individual institutions that belong to one

by james b stedman for detailed discussion of how pell grant eligibility is determined as has been noted the information presented here is derived from unpublished data provided by eds pell grant program office 19 the undergraduate enrollment data used in these calculations measure the total number of undergraduate students enrolled at any juncture throughout the 20012002 academic year not at point in time during fall 2001 as is true with all other enrollment data presented in this report given that pell grants are awarded to students throughout the award year it is appropriate to compare those counts to fullyear enrollment data the percentages shown here were derived from two different data sources that may not be strictly comparable as result these percentages are estimates crs16 undergraduate degrees awarded in academic year 20012002 with the exception of the tcus each of the msis awarded more bachelors than associates degrees though more than half of the undergraduate degrees at mmis and hsis were bachelors degrees both groups of institutions awarded significant numbers of associates degrees table 8 shows the number of associates and bachelors degrees awarded in

bachelors degrees excludes proprietary institutions as table 9 shows msis account for significant portions of the undergraduate degrees earned by different racial and ethnic groups of students this is particularly true for mmis and hsis for example hsis accounted for 556 of all associates degrees awarded to hispanics and 420 of all hispanic bachelors degrees hbcus and tcus accounted for relatively large shares of the undergraduate degrees awarded to students from single racial or ethnic group at one level of degree hbcus accounted for 231 of the bachelor degrees awarded to blacks tcus awarded

from the us department of educations integrated postsecondary education data system note this table should be read as follows the first row of numerical data shows that mmis awarded 342 of all associates degrees awarded to black students in 20012002 there are relatively few major differences between the distribution of academic fields in which msis awarded bachelors degrees and the distribution for bachelors degrees awarded by pseis20 the only institutions that appear to have noticeably different distribution from the distribution prevailing elsewhere are the tcus but it is important to stress that the tcu distribution is based on very few bachelors degrees in the aggregate msis are more likely to award bachelors degrees in the arts and humanities business management and the social sciences than in any other fields the following figures depict the distribution of bachelors degrees by 20 the focus here is on the bachelors degree level given that this is the predominant undergraduate degree level in msis nevertheless the distribution of associates degrees within msis also largely mirrors the distribution for all pseis crs18 academic field within each group of msi

minorityserving institutions play special role in the education of minority and lowincome students this group of institutions annually receives significant amount of federal funding to pursue their educational mission and educate minority students the preceding analysis reveals that there are some institutional and student characteristics shared by many of the groups of msis considered in this report at the same time it shows that there is diversity among these groups of institutions both findings are potentially important for federal policymaking in this area in general msis are disproportionately twoyear public institutions yet this attribute does not characterize all msi groups nearly all hbcus are fouryear public or private schools most msis are likely to be small institutions often enrolling fewer than 1000 students though some are large enrolling 20000 or more students msis are concentrated in certain regions with large majority of the institutions located in areas where high concentrations of particular racialethnic group reside most states have one or more msis within their borders although several have none not unexpectedly students in msis are predominantly from minority backgrounds the proportion of undergraduates in these schools who come from minority backgrounds ranges from about 60 to in excess of 80 msis play significant role in educating minority students often accounting for substantial shares of all postsecondary students from minority backgrounds nevertheless with the exception of hispanic students the majority of undergraduate students from individual minority groups do not attend msis crs22 substantial shares of undergraduate enrollment in msis are likely to be composed of lowincome students for some groups of msis this lowincome share of undergraduate enrollment is significantly higher than the comparable share of all undergraduates at title iv pseis in general more than 45 of undergraduates at hbcus received pell grant compared to 19 of undergraduates at all title iv pseis analyzed as noted most msis primarily award undergraduate degrees as their highest degree these degrees represent significant shares of all degrees awarded to minority undergraduates particularly for hispanic degree recipients the relative distribution of fields in which these degrees are awarded does not differ for most groups of msis in comparison to the distribution of undergraduate degrees for all title iv pseis included in this analysis for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32674
