rl31718 background on wahhabism definitions wahhabism is puritanical form of sunni islam and is practiced in saudi arabia and qatar although it is much less rigidly enforced in the latter the word wahhabi is derived from the name of muslim scholar muhammad bin abd wahhab who lived in the arabian peninsula during the eighteenth century 17031791 today the term wahhabism is broadly applied outside of the arabian peninsula to refer to sunni islamic movement that seeks to purify islam of any innovations or practices that deviate from the seventhcentury teachings of the prophet muhammad and his companions1 in most predominantly muslim nations however believers who adhere to this creed or hold similar perspectives prefer to call themselves unitarians muwahiddun or salafiyyun sing salafi noun salafiyya the latter term derives 1 for more on islam see crs report rs21432 islam primer crs2 from the word salaf meaning to follow or precede reference to the followers and companions of the prophet mohammed some muslims believe the western usage of the term wahhabism unfairly carries negative and derogatory connotations although this paper explains differences in these terms it will refer to wahhabism in association with conservative islamic creed centered in and emanating from saudi arabia and to salafiyya as more general puritanical islamic movement that has developed independently at various times and in various places in the islamic world history of wahhabism2 muhammad bin abd wahhab whose name is the source of the word wahhabi founded religious movement in the arabian peninsula during the eighteenth century 17031791 that sought to reverse what he perceived as the moral decline of his society in particular abd wahhab denounced many popular islamic beliefs and practices as idolatrous ultimately he encouraged return to the pure and orthodox practice of the fundamentals of islam as embodied in the quran and in the life of the prophet muhammad muhammad bin saud the ancestral founder of the modernday saud dynasty partnered with abd wahhab to begin the process of httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21695 unifying disparate tribes in the arabian peninsula their partnership formed the basis for close political relationship between their descendants that continues today since its emergence wahhabisms puritanical and iconoclastic philosophies have resulted in conflict with other muslim groups wahhabism opposes most popular islamic religious practices such as saint veneration the celebration of the prophets birthday most core shiite traditions and some practices associated with the mystical teachings of sufism in the past this has brought wahhabis based in the arabian peninsula and elsewhere into confrontation with nonwahhabi sunni muslims shiite muslims and non muslims in neighboring areas the first saudi kingdom was destroyed by ottoman forces in the early 19th century after wahabbiinspired warriors seized mecca and medina and threatened ottoman dominance similarly during the 1920s wahhabitrained bedouin warriors allied with the founder of the modern saudi kingdom abd aziz ibn saud attacked fellow sunnis in western arabia and shiites in southern iraq leading to political confrontations and military engagements with the british empire wahhabism in saudi arabia today since the foundation of the modern kingdom of saudi arabia in 1932 there has been close relationship between the saudi ruling family and the wahhabi religious establishment3 wahhabitrained bedouin warriors known as the ikhwan were integral to the saud familys military campaign to reconquer and unify the arabian peninsula from 1912 until an ikhwan rebellion was put down by force in 1930 thereafter wahhabi clerics were integrated into the new 2 for

arabia wahhabism also shaped the kingdoms judicial and educational policies saudi schoolbooks historically have denounced teachings that do not conform to wahhabist beliefs an issue that remains controversial within saudi arabia and among outside observers4 in september 2007 the state department again designated saudi arabia as country of particular concern under the international religious freedom act because religious freedom remains severely restricted according to the state departments 2007 international religious freedom report on saudi arabia the saudi government confirmed number of policies to foster greater religious tolerance to halt the dissemination of intolerant literature and extremist ideology within saudi arabia and around the world to protect the right to private worship and the right to possess and use personal religious materials to curb harassment by the religious police to empower its human rights commission to eliminate discrimination against nonmuslim religious minorities and to respect the rights of muslims who do not follow the governments interpretation of islam the report also notes that members of the shiite muslim minority continue to face political educational legal social and religious discrimination httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21695 and that there is legal recognition or protection of religious freedom5 political and religious factors what is salafiyya as noted above among adherents in general preference is given to the term salafiyya over wahhabism these terms have distinct historical roots but they have been used interchangeably in recent years especially in the west wahhabism is considered by some muslims as the saudi form of salafiyya unlike the eighteenthcentury saudi roots of wahhabism however modern salafi beliefs grew from reformoriented movement of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century which developed in various parts of the islamic world and progressively grew more conservative in line with other puritanical islamic teachings salafis generally believe that the quran and the prophets practices hadith are the ultimate religious authority in islam rather than the subsequent commentaries produced by islamic scholars that interpret these sources6 salafiyya is not unified movement and there exists single salafi sect however salafi interpretations of islam appeal to large number of muslims worldwide who seek religious renewal in the face of modern challenges the use of violence according to number of scholars the waging of violent jihad7 is not inherently associated with puritanical islamic beliefs among certain puritanical muslims be they selfdescribed salafis or wahhabis advocacy of jihad 4 michaela prokop saudi arabia the politics of education int affairs 79 1 pp 7789 5

premodern islamic thought islamic law and society 7 1 leiden 2000 347 7 jihad literally means striving or struggle it is frequently used to refer to holy war although this term does not appear in the quran but in number of hadith or recorded sayings of the prophet mohammed and his companions crs4 is relatively recent phenomenon and remains highly disputed within these groups although wahhabi clerics and converts have advocated religiously motivated violence and played military roles at key moments in saudi history most scholars date the ascendancy of militancy within the wider salafi community to the war of resistance against the soviet occupation of afghanistan during the 1980s the war against the soviets gained wide support throughout the muslim world and mobilized thousands of volunteer fighters radical beliefs spread rapidly through select groups of mosques and madrasas islamic religious schools8 located on the afghanistanpakistan border which were created to support the afghan resistance and funded primarily by saudi arabia similar us and european funding provided to pakistan to aid the afghan mujahideen also may have been diverted to fund the construction and maintenance of madrasas following the war militant salafis with ties to the afghan resistance denounced leaders of countries such as saudi arabia and egypt as apostates and as vehicles for facilitating western imperialism the taliban movement also emerged from this network of institutions violent salafistinspired groups such as qaeda continue to advocate the overthrow of the saudi government and other regimes and the establishment of states that httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21695 will sustain puritanical islamic doctrine enforced under strict application of sharia or islamic law although the majority of salafi adherents do not advocate the violence enshrined in bin ladens message violent salafist ideology has attracted number of followers throughout the muslim world analysts note that some receptive groups are drawn to the antius political messages preached by bin laden and his supporters despite the fact that these groups may hold different religious beliefs recent allegations against wahhabism and responses there have been two major allegations against wahhabism and against the saudi arabian government which is viewed as its principal proponent wahhabism spreads terrorism it is widely acknowledged that the saudi government as well as wealthy saudi individuals have supported the spread of the wahhabist ideas in several muslim countries and in the united states and europe some have argued that this proselyting has promoted terrorism and has spawned islamic militancy throughout the world9 saudi funding of mosques madrasas and charities some of which have been linked to terrorist groups such as qaeda has raised concern that wahhabi islam has been used by militants who tailor this ideology to suit their political goals and who rely on saudi donations to support their aspirations wahhabism spreads intolerance some reports suggest that teachings within saudi domestic schools may foster intolerance of other religions and cultures 2002 study by the center for strategic and international studies csis indicates that some saudi textbooks taught islamic tolerance while others viciously condemned jews 8 see crs report rs21654 islamic religious schools madrasas background 9 see council on foreign relations independent task force on terrorist financing update on the global campaign against terrorist financing june 15 2004 p 20 crs5 and christiansand use rhetoric that was little more than hate literature10 others also have argued that the global spread of wahhabist teachings threatens the existence of more moderate islamic beliefs and practices in other parts of the world including the united states11 2005 report from freedom houses center for religious freedom cites examples of what its authors calls hate ideology taken from number of saudi government publications that have been distributed in us mosques and islamic centers12 recent attention to wahhabi clerics in saudi arabia has focused on harsh sectarian rhetoric accusing shiite muslims in iraq and elsewhere of religious apostasy and political disloyalty worthy of punishment an october 2006 petition signed by 38 prominent saudi religious figures called on sunnis everywhere to oppose joint crusader us safavid iranian and rafidi derogatory term for shiite scheme to target iraqs sunni arab population13 saudi arabias response the saudi arabian government has strenuously denied the above allegations saudi officials continue to assert that islam is tolerant and peaceful and they have denied allegations that their government exports religious or cultural extremism or supports extremist religious education14 in response to allegations of teaching intolerance the saudi government has embarked on campaign of educational httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21695 reforms designed to remove divisive material from curricula and improve teacher performance although the outcome of these reforms remains to be seen confrontation with religious figures over problematic remarks and activities poses political challenges for the saudi government because some key wahhabi clerics support saudi government efforts to delegitimize terrorism inside the kingdom and have sponsored or participated in efforts to religiously reeducate former saudi combatants current us policy and legislation in light of allegations against wahhabism some critics have called for reevaluation of the relationship between the united states and saudi arabia although others maintain that us economic and security interests require continued and close ties with the saudis the bush administration has praised saudi counterterrorism cooperation and president bush has praised islam and denounced groups that have hijacked great religion15 911 commission the final report of the

thinkers the report further details the education and activities of some 911 hijackers in the qassim province of saudi arabia which the report describes as the very heart of the strict wahhabi movement in saudi arabia according to the commission some saudi wahhabi funded organizations such as the nowdefunct haramain islamic foundation have been exploited by extremists to further their goal of violent jihad against nonmuslims16 due in part to these findings the commission recommended frank discussion of the relationship between the united states and its problematic ally saudi arabia issues for congress wahhabism has been focus of congressional hearings which have examined the relationship between wahhabi religious belief and terrorist financing as well as its alleged ties to the spread of intolerance several bills in the 108th congress criticized saudifunded religious institutions and alleged that they provide ideological support for antiwestern terrorism section 7105b of the
