from michael mann memann00hotmailcom to tosbornueaacuk subject re problem date thu 05 apr 2001 153718 0000 replyto mannvirginiaedu cc kbriffaueaacuk mannvirginiaedu pjonesueaacuk xflowed hi tim thanks for looking into this so quickly i agree w your assessment it is probably just the fact that the signal of interest in soi and nino3 is really the interannual signal and this is not evident in the lowfrequency component shown which emphasizes discrepancies that are actually small compared to amplitude of the interannual signal present in both stahle et and mann et so i would urge showing the annual reconstructions in this case rather than smoothed for this reason in ipcc we only chose to show 1700 to present which is better calibratedverified interval than back to 1650 so id encourage you guys to restrict it to 1700present if you can other than that i think it is important to acknowledge that soi and nino3 have different lowfrequency trends over the 20th century and might well have different trends in the past it is true that many of the proxies used are sensitive to the soi eg mexican tree rings but others are sensitive to pacific sst eg corals from gbr new caledonia galapagos and our claim is that the calibration process will select out the best estimate of the temperature patterns rather than slp patterns associated w enso from the multiproxy network in the future well be going after slp reconstruction too and itll be interesting to see what the difference is i hope that clarifies please let know if i can be of any further help provide further clarification etc thanks again mike from tim osborn tosbornueaacuk to kbriffa kbriffaueaacuk michael mann memann00hotmailcom pjones pjonesueaacuk tosborn tosbornueaacuk mann mannvirginiaedu cc rbradley rbradleygeoumassedu subject re problem date wed 4 apr 2001 230235 0100 thanks for getting back to so quickly i could be wrong but i just want to make sure the coldseason nino3 is far more consistent w djf soi and stahles recon so i just want to be sure that is the one that is shown are you sure you have used the coldseason nino3 reconstruction as discussed and available in the mann et earth interactions paper and not the annual mean reconstruction httpwwwngdcnoaagovpaleoeiei_reconsbhtml i dont believe that has the trend that the series you show does that nino3 series agrees closely r063 w the stahle et series once the sign has been flipped on that series and the offbyoneyear date convention is taken into account dear all ive found machine with telnet and have been able to check my files programs the file im using matches the ninocoldrecondat file downloadable from the ei_reconsbhtml it also correlates at r063 with stahle i dont have access to plotting here so i cannot investigate further the reason for the apparent mismatch though i wonder whether it is due to the heavy 30yr smoothing used in the science paper much more smoothing than is typically used when looking at enso these 30yr differences are in fact quite small in comparison with some of the interannual variations and perhaps the series would look very much more alike if unfiltered anyway as far as i can tell the figure is ok moreover it is inappropriate to refer as you do the nino3 reconstruction as an soi reconstruction matter whether it has been renormalized signswitched etc there are fundamennal differences between the lowfrequency behavior of nino3 and soi consider for example the 20th century and they arent dynamically equivalent to say there is longterm trend in our soi reconstruction is extremely misleading there is longterm trend in our nino3 reconstruciton only stahle produced an soi reconstruction and it is only meaningful to correlate the two at annual timescales where they should similarly reflect largely interannual enso variability philkeith ive got copy of our paper with and i agree with what mike says above but on the other hand the lack of space constrains us i wonder whether we can squeeze anything in at the proofs stage have you had them yet phil with quick read i couldnt actually spot the phrase longterm trend but we could still add something about soi and sst being coupled on interannual time scales and possibly doing somewhat different things on longer timescales mike would you not agree however that your predictors excluding corals are mainly remote from the nino 3 sst region and that they are likely responding via atmospheric teleconnection patterns and therefore perhaps should pick up the soi even if calibrated against nino 3 sst feel free to disagree just wanted to get your reaction best regards tim _________________________________________________________________ get your free download of msn explorer at httpexplorermsncom xflowed
