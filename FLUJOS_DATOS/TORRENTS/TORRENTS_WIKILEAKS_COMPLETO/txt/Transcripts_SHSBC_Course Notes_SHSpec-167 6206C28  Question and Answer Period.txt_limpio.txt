6206c28 shspec167 question and answer period there is possibility that person with nice clean free needle is at mockery level where the needle appears clean but the case is really nowhere this case will rise up into trouble even if starting pc wasnt at mockery level you would still want to run some model session and havingness sessions before going into 3ga so that he would get an idea of what auditing was the anxiety factor will otherwise get in the way you could run ruds and havingness then give him prepcheck session even if it were only grooved in the direction of goals then you could go on to his goals list just be sure it is not the dead thetan case which will blow up in your face if you do 3ga somebody invented method for doing cchs where they started asking did you notice that physical change all the time it got to be quite method it is an evaluation the whole point of cchs is to get the guy to look if he looks he will exteriorize from that particular somatic this is deft delicate action the auditor is undertaking not sledgehammer procedure or rote activity pcs will put the process on automatic and go out of session running like woundup doll unless you stay in 2wc with them in cchs the auditor is only interested in physical originations on the part of the pc because cchs are physical not mental processes you count on the fact that he has originated something at that point if you can bring him to observe as live being he will get better and better but if you tell him he has got to observe he wont he will feel bludgeoned and criticized the old drill that you use is fishing cognition this is called training 13 see hcob 11jun57 training and cch processes pp1617 if you dont succeed ok you didnt succeed an auditor in his desire to make somebody well often pushes the pcs teeth down his throat he gets anxious to have beneficial effect and starts pressing when he does this he drives the pc out of session by adding note of urgency or impatience this puts the pcs attention on the auditor what if the pc is responding to someone elses voice and the meter is responding to hearing another session in progress in this case the beginning ruds must be out your pc is not in session with you if he reads on word mentioned by someone else in the vicinity to handle it you have to get the pc in session this is best done by ending that session taking short break and restarting making sure you get the ruds in poor insessionness used to show up as superlight overts gotten off on sec checks like i thought of stealing paper clip that is symptomatic of confidence wobbly model session and ruds not gotten in but session started over outruds you have to learn to be so smooth and so predictable that the pc would never think of doing anything else but respond to you and read on your meter when you call pcs attention to physical origination by asking whats happening and the pc says oh nothing you should just acknowledge and go on then the next time you have him in prepcheck session you get off suppression you can remedy this situation the pc is giving you social response he may feel that you are critical and so is making nothing of his reaction one approach is to vary the question eg one could ask how are you doing instead compulsive outflow in itself is not dangerous unless it runs the pcs havingness way down you want to use tr4 since not all his answer is relevant you have probably slipped up earlier by not acknowledging when he did answer in the early part of the outflow you now have to use tr4 get in understand acknowledge and return him to the session good method of handling that is to say when did that occur to you in this session he answers you acknowledge and you go back to the process when pc is properly acknowledged he has found out that he has reached you and he will stop talking so if you pick his hand up and put it on your shoulder as he runs on he will shut up he has reached you you are not trying to reach the pc you are trying to convince the pc that he has reached you you could probably stop war if you could convince the enemy that he has reached you war is saying you cant reach us but we are gonna reach you all war propaganda says this which only tends to just keep things going if the pc answers the auditing question and you acknowledge and the pc goes further than that you should consider that the pc has originated if the pc is originating he has an anxiety about reaching you so all you have to do is to cure the anxiety and there you are there is havingness process based on this principle that you can use with cchs it is quite simple repetitive touch my noncharged body part every now and then the auditor will get love turning on in the pc you have to run this out since you want to get rid of its misemotional connotations you would run this early in auditing and once per session it is good way to handle malefemale anxiety you could use this process for when cchs go roughly some auditors have pcs going out of session when running cchs this is mark of rough auditing nice easy cch run wouldnt need any rudiments but if rudiments do go out in cchs you are up creek because ruds violate the physicalprocess idea of cchs so this cchhavingness process would be way of handling this situation it would supplant all the anxiety about doing model session while doing cchs it is way of getting the pc to find the auditor this is an arc havingness process any other havingness would be risky it might not be the pcs havingness process dont waste time in auditing there is particular amount of courtesy in the reactive mind when i do auditing i do the essentials and not more than the essentials i get the job done you do want the pc in state where he will read on the meter my pcs dont have time to have ruds go out the time to put in midruds is when the goals stop reading at all on nulling say you call them each three times and nothing reads that is when to rut in midruds if you make the pc wrong for talking by putting midruds in you are misusing midruds and driving him out of session you are making him lose interest and arc breaking him then the meter wont read well the current test of completeness of list in listing goals is ta action on listing the tone arm has certain tendency to drift if the pc were to sit there with his hands on the cans and nothing else going on in an hour the ta would drift say from 275 to 30 lots of ta motion is 75 divisions in 20 minutes little ta motion is 25 divisions in 20 minutes none normal drift if nothing were happening
