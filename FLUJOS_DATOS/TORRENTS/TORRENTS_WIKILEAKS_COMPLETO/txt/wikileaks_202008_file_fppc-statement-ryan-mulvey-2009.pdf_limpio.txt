and was responsible for the final disbursements of payments for debts i worked closely with april boling our assistant treasurer and accountant i was also employed by boling during the past general

close relationships i was able t develop i saw side to tony krvaric current county chairman and ron nehring former county chairman currently serving as chairman of the california republican party cr p that others rarely witness there have been numerous occasions some over extende d periods of time during which both krvaric and nehring exhibited behavior that i found both inappropriate and questionable it is my intent to share these observations with youmay 6 2009 page 2 ron nehring while chairman of the local party insisted on r eceiving hyatt rewards points for the monthly public committee meetings held according to the election code at the manchester grand hyatt monthly costs for these meetings of ten equaled or exceeded 150000190000 on one occasion nehring realizin g the hotel had suspended this accumulation of award points since the party was paying h ad staff continuous call hotel catering services to have the points reinstated nehring tinued this behavior while at the crp and used the awards accumulated to take personal vaca tions around the world while chairman of san diego he even took an excursion to lond on for the weekend on these points or so he boasted to staff he was very liberal in his exp ensing of hotels car rentals etc even in the san diego region little more than an hour or two driv from his home in crest ca after he left san diego for the crp nehring retained party pr operty including laptop which he has yet to return as of january 2009 recent m edia reports have exposed this same sort of behavior at the crp to this day disclosures show nehring even expensing gym memberships as part of the partys victory strategy nehring also utilized county party employees in his crp election campaigns without reimbursement or rather on the local partys dime staff was asked to attend convention and required to assist in his campaigning which included but was not limited to whipping voters and distributing fliers buttons signs etc nehring and krvaric also required staff to assist in the campaigns of crp vicechair tom becaro and crp vicechairsouth warene wall at these same conventions nehring and krvaric masterminded proxy scheme by which they obtained blank signed proxy appointme nts from crp members across the state these were assigned to trustworthy alternates who were pressured to vote for particular candidates this happened to at the 2008 s pring convention i was given two proxies and threatened into voting for particular candidates though i did not ultimately do so i was accused of not being on the team i was told of special arrangement prior to my employm ent between the county party and our preferred publisher bieber communications while nehri ng was chairman he incurred campaign finance violation fines however rather than have the party pay for it and consequently have blot on his record he arranged f or bieber communications to admit culpability and pay the fined in their entirety in return the party was to use bieber for all our design and publication needs nehring encouraged bie ber to pad invoices essentially charging extra so they would eventually be repaid whe n krvaric was first chairman he was unaware of this arrangement and was rather angry that we wer continuing to use bieber at an elevated price compared to competitors eventually tho ugh he acquiesced and continued nehrings practice krvaric has also abused his financial privileges throughou t my employment he submitted numerous incomplete or suspicious reimbursement request s many of these were eventually approved by april boling in one instance invoices were unavailable but it is my understanding krvaric was still reimbursed mileage reimburseme nts hardly ever included the specifics required of employees often they consisted f merely 2000 miles for party business etc employees were required by krvaric to prov ide detailed descriptions of travel including odometer readings krvaric spent thousands of dollars on items unapproved by the executive committee including laptops when krvaric was elected chairman he may 6 2009 page 3 proceeded to submit reimbursement requests to the sum of 600000 for trip to washington dc which had taken place over year previou sly boling initially hesitated to approve this because of the length of time that had elapse d and the inconvenience of amending over year of reports krvaric was ultimately reim bursed to the best of my knowledge in full additionally during the last election cycle krvaric approved pay ment of over 4000 to jerry vandeweghe campaign manager for robert ilko candidate in san diego city council district 5 vandeweghe was thereafter given monthly c ontract payments though he provided tangible service to the party in fact krva ric often complained of vandeweghes uselessness it was understood within the off ice that this arrangement was approved in order to eliminate any competition for carl demaio who was favorite of krvaric nehring and the innercircle leadership of the pa rty which included coronado communications favored vendor krvaric organized similar scheme for michael mcsweeney vic echairman of the local party who was fired from the reelection campaign of mayor jerry sanders after it was publically revealed he had attempted to bribe one of the mayo rs opponents krvaric also withheld payment from other candidate to whom he had verb contract to pay filing fees etc these candidates included jeff perwin and dan felser krvarics refusal to reimburse felser lead to two private suits against the party and jon athan buettner former coo which were eventually settled out of court perwin who was also contr acted for database management and gotv precinct operations was repeatedly haras sed by krvaric who would withhold or delay payment of services provided krvaric acc used perwin of not fulfilling his obligations to the party as candidate and as vendor and threatened to end his involvement in local politics if he did not cooperate with his deman ds in fact krvaric ordered on numerous occasions to ignore perwins calls and emails for these stated reasons eventually payment was disbursed after krvaric btained an exofficio alternate appointment for one of his favorites krvarics relationship with coronado communications is rather picious during the election cycle there were numerous emails and joke graphic s that were passed among committee members and donors lambasting krvaric as part time partner of coronado allegedly he was getting cut of the profits from business he himself was providing as chairman of the party i meet krvaric numerous times at c oronado communications headquarters then located in downtown san diego to have check requests signed tony seemed to have his own desk at which he was always working often he would spend long periods of time at this desk he had close relationship with b oth duane dichara and jennifer jacobs the former being considered puppet m aster of local politics both in san diego and sacramento krvaric withheld payment for almost year on legal services pr ovided by mcateer mcateer of san diego he was apparently unsatisfied with their s ervices and had expected them to provide them pro bono he expressed these very sentiments to in person exclaiming they ought to be grateful they were even asked by him to provide this legal advice he told he would destroy them and their repu tation in the city telling donors to may 6 2009 page 4 take their legal needs elsewhere he hinted at doing this for other vendors as well including the partys preferred office supply printer minuteman pr ess krvaric and nehring also manipulated the committee and executive board on other elections issues krvaric rejected the standard endorsement questionn aire submitted to all gop candidates he specifically added questions regarding crimina l record to target conservative christian activist james hartline as well as whether candidates d declared bankruptcy the latter was specifically included to harass and intimidate lon gtime gop activists larry and rose urdahl james kelly member of the committee an d colleague of larry urdahl on the grossmont union high school board of trustees was ins trumental in this harassment numerous committee members protested this singlin g out krvaric refused to publically acknowledge their complaints krvaric and nehring lso pushed through numerous endorsements of local officials and candidates f or crp office without prior notification to the membership or debate within the meeting dis senting committee members were frequently accused of not being on the team espe cially if they raised concern over early appointments or those appointments made by acclamatio n i know for fact that krvaric and other executive board m embers were responsible for the publication of slates for the central committee elections jon athan buettner former coo of the party told how he was in attendance at these meetings during which names were compiled he was upset in the end since he was not been c hosen for inclusion i also learned of the existence of these secret meetings from gary felien the partys treasurer in casual conversation i was also aware that april boling the partys accountant was aware of what was going on as she was the treasurer for the slates fr ont organization i do not know the extent to which she was knowledgeable of krvaric nehring and ther committee members involvement as for other committee matters krvaric has violated numerous s ections of the state election code and the bylaws of the republican party of san diego co unty due to basic ignorance of the rules of parliamentary procedure outlined in our by laws krvaric has repeatedly refused to allow debate or to entertain valid motions despite my objections as an experienced parliamentarian and those of william baber lawye r and committee parliamentarian with whom i often collaborated this was espec ially highlighted in the controversy over the filling of vacancies to the committee n ot only did krvaric refuse to dismiss members who had violated the bylaws by universal standard picking and choosing who to remove instead he also deliberately misled committee memb ers and legal counsel both nehring and krvaric lied to charles bell of sacramento c who is often employed by the party for legal advice jonathan buettner and i too k it upon us to contact bell on numerous occasions to clarify his memoranda and expres s our hesitancy to accept what nehring and krvaric were telling him privately ultimately we retrieve d documentary evidence of krvarics wrongfulness based on footnote in one of bells memos these were provided to legal counsel and final letter was released to t he committee paid out of its funds krvaric refused to make this final memo available s he had with all the others supporting his position bell refused to take calls or to r espond to emails from members or staff krvaric confronted both buettner and over this matter accusing us of being may 6 2009 page 5 disloyal backstabbing and not part of the team to this day the memo has not been released before i left the party last january and after jonathan buettner had been dismissed krvaric invited to private lunch he took the opportunity to confront over number of the issues above including the bell memorandum he sked whether i thought him to be my leader and whether i stood behind him he continued on about loyalty and steadfastness matter what actions he might take he sug gested that staffers do not understand the complexity of politics and should merely follo w matter their consciences krvaric expressed distress over the current situation in the office he forbade former employees including nicole parsons and laura sche ncker from even setting foot in the office again accusing them of being sexual harass ment liabilities he lamented how he should be the godfather of politics in san diego he told m that we the staff had disappointed him because we had not helped him reach this im age garnering favors and debts to his name he wanted people to owe him and vice versa krvaric finally stated that the next year would involve cleaning house and taki ng care of committee members who were not cooperating with his regime i returned to the ffice having expressed hesitancy to continue in my position but promising loyalty i n the mean time i felt so physically repulsed that i resigned my position within week i remain an alternate member of the committee many member s donors and volunteers not realizing i am longer on staff approach with countle ss complaints of harassment and neglect barret tetlow the current executive director has v erbally abused more than one committee member and refuses to answer phone calls and mails on many occasions committee members are also harassed continuously by krvaric and his executive board anthony porrello dedicated party and committee member has been verbally assaulted by tetlow he is essentially banned from headquarters and has been surrounded by krvaric and tetlow have threatened calling the police if porrello does not s tay away my regular member dayna hydrick has been nearly physically accoste d by tetlow two months ago we were both surrounded by friends of tony who questio ned why were not in the assigned seats now determined by krvaric despite her handicap she wa s told to sit in an uncomfortable position eventually we moved in protest to the back of the room but such harassment is commonplace committee members are also denied access to executive boar d meetings which was not regular policy previously rosters are not provided to m embers despite the fact they are public information regarding elected officials krvaric has ggested that members collect information on their own to make their own lists attendance rep orts are longer provided for members leaving accountability as to whether individ uals are in compliance with the bylaws finally meeting announcements are not provided in ccordance with the bylaws minutes are often incomplete financial information is never p rovided in my own experience krvaric and his staff have refused to include in committee mailings and virtually ignore my appointment which has been in place ce 2006 on may 11 2009 at the latest regular central committee meetin g gary felien in his secret treasury report to committee members discussed certain ac cusations being spread around may 6 2009 page 6 the committee by certain individuals he did not elaborate nd tony refused to allow any discussion of the matter but felien seemed to be concern ed over rumors regarding financial mismanagement he ended his remarks as follows this is t direct quote even if there was something going on itd be like 1 or something and thats nothing in the large scheme of things we shouldnt be worried about that small mount of moneywe have so much somethings bound to get lost this is the sort of chicanery committee members are forced to endure month in and month out i recognize the length of this complaint but i would like to recall one more incident that is not necessarily in violation of the law but still gives an impres sion of the current leaderships attitude just weeks ago at the annual lincolnreagan dinner i was an invited guest of congressman darrell issa seated at the table were his staf f and other committee members ostracized by krvaric as disloyal originally the congressm ans table was placed near the front as it should have been given his sponsorship level and political position i know this from personal experience immediately before the event though elizabeth moyer another staffer under direction from krvaric moved our table to t he very back of the room near the service entrance naturally issas district director took tice of this moyer approached jonathan buettner that night and accused him of working to get krvarics enemies the bad committee members on issas guest list krvaric was c ertainly within his rights i suppose to do what he did but the mindset with which he di d it is indicative of his general attitude towards others towards the committee and towards politic s in general he does not care for democratic exercise or for dissent in this way i would consider him dangerous individual he will continue to harass intimidate and control as long as he possibly can i hope that what i have been able to provide is helpful in your investigation if i recall any further events which is likely given the extensive experience i have with both krvaric and nehring i will be sure to report them to you as quickly as th ey come to mind and as i mentioned previously i am more than willing to answer any stions to provide any clarification and to give any testimony as it is deemed neces sary thank you for your time and attention to this matter sincerely ryan p mulvey
