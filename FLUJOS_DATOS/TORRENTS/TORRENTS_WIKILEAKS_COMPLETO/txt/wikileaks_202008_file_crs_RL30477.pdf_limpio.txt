general administrative requirements general provisions and preemption of state law parts 161 163 reserved will consist of the various administrative simplification regulations relating to transactions

against the inappropriate use of individually identifiable health information have been made primarily by the states and that state protections are by and large incomplete and at times inconsistent hhs concluded that clear and consistent set of privacy standards would improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the health care system the proposal of the secretary of health and human services is intended to strike balance between an individuals right to privacy of their medical records and the public policy needs to have access to these medical records to promote public safety specifically the proposed regulations are intended to make the use and exchange of protected health information relatively easy for health care purposes and more difficult for purposes other than health care11 thus the information is available to those with legitimate needs after satisfying prerequisites while not being available as general rule these proposed regulations apply to specified set of covered

operations are permissible uses for which disclosure without individual authorization is approved15 additionally public policy approves the disclosure of this information for national priority activities such as reducing health care fraud improving quality of treatment through research protecting the public health and responding to emergency situations16 health care fraud is an example which clearly illustrates the need for access to individually identifiable health care information17 in order to uncover health care fraud an individuals care would need to be assessed for unnecessary treatments or bills for services which were never rendered18 some studies estimate that medicare and medicaid fraud cost the state and federal government tens of billions of dollars per year19 thus

in medical records poses very legitimate ethical issue because we are discussing individually identifiable health care information it means that this information is linked to the individual patient21 therefore confidentiality poses challenge to ensure that proper policy and legal constraints are maintained to guarantee that unauthorized access is not obtained22 the best case scenario would be to obtain permission directly from the individual whose records for health information is sought23 however instances do exist in which individual approval is not obtainable24 what follows is discussion

all those who generate maintain or receive protected health information emphasis in the original 30 64 fr 59923in the regulations hhs expressed concern that many of the holders of health information fall outside the scope of the proposed rule because of its limited regulatory authority and therefore cannot be covered by the regulation pursuant to hipaa29 examples of such health information holders include many of the persons who obtain identifiable health information from the covered entities eg contractors researchers public health officials workers compensation carriers researchers life insurance issuers employers and marketing firms30 many of the persons that covered entities hire to perform administrative accounting legal and similar services for them and who obtain health information in order to perform their duties any provider who maintains solely paper information system in background comments to the proposed rule hhs noted that it was prohibited from proposing optimal policies to protect individually identifiable information because it lacked authority to apply the proposed rule directly to any entity that is not covered entity in response to this gap hhs requires covered entities to apply many of the provisions of the proposed rule to entities with whom they contract for administrative and other services the proposed rule applies only to subset of individually identifiable health information that which is maintained or transmitted by covered entities and which is or has been transmitted in electronic form once the information has been maintained or transmitted electronically by covered entity the protections of the rulehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30477crs7 31 id at 59924follow the information in whatever form including paper records in which it exists while it is held by covered entity hhs expressed concern about the potential confusion that could result from its proposal with some health informa tion protected while other similar information paper records not maintained or transmitted electronically would not be based on its belief that application of the proposed rule only to information in an electronic form will not result in adequate protection for consumers hhs requested comment on whether it should extend the scope of the rule to all individually identifiable information including purely paper records maintained by covered entities cognizant of the issue that extending its regulatory coverage might be inconsistent with the intent of the provisions in hipaa hhs nonetheless stated we believe that we do have the authority to do so and that there are sound rationale for providing consistent level of protection to all individually identifiable health information held by covered entities31 general rules covered entities are prohibited from using and disclosing protected health information phi except as provided 164506 covered entities can use or disclose phi with individual authorization 164508 covered entities can use or disclose phi without individual authorization 164510 for treatment payment and health care operations for specified public and public policyrelated purposes including public health research health oversight law enforcement and use by coroners when required by other law such as mandatory reporting under state law or pursuant to search warrantcovered entities are required to disclose phi to permit individuals to inspect and copy phi about themselves 164514 for enforcement of this rule 164522 with certain exceptions permitted uses and disclosur of protected health information would be restricted to the minimum amount of information necessary to accomplish the purpose for which the information is used or disclosed taking into consideration practical and technical limitations and costs 164506a the proposed rule would also require with narrow exceptions covered entities to ensure that their business partners with whom they share protected information understand through contractual requirements that they are subject to standards regarding use and disclosure of phi and agree to abide by such rules 164506ehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30477crs8 the contract between the covered entity and its business partner must limit the business partners uses and disclosures of phi to those permitted by the contract and impose certain security inspection and reporting requirements on the business partner the privacy standards are to be implemented by all covered entities from the smallest provider to the largest multistate health plan implementation of the standards is to be flexible and scalable to account for the nature of each covered entities business as well as its size and resources uses and disclosures with individual authorization uses and disclosures when the individual initiates the disclosure 164508a1 under the proposed rule authorizations must meet the following requirements the authorization must include description of the information to be used or disclosedthe authorization does not have to state the purpose for the disclosure the authorization must identify sufficiently the covered entity or entities that would be authorized to use or disclose protected health informationthe authorization must identify the person or persons that would be authorized to use or receive the protected health information the authorization must state specific expiration date the authorization must include signature or other authentication eg electronic signature and the date of the signaturethe authorization must include statement that the individual understands that she or he make revoke the authorization the authorization must clearly state that when an individual authorizes disclosure of health information to other than covered entity the information would longer be protected once it leaves the covered entity uses and disclosures when the covered entity initiates the disclosure 164508a2 in addition to the requirements above when the individual initiates the disclosure when covered entity initiates the authorization by asking the individual to authorize the disclosure the following requirements must be met the authorization must include statement that identifies the purposes for which the authorizatio n is sought as well as the proposed uses and disclosu res of that information uses or disclosures inconsistent with that statement would constitute violation of the regulationthe authorization must be narrowly tailored to authorize use or disclosure of only the protected

that they may inspect or copy the informat ion to be used or disclosed that they may refuse to sign the authorization and that treatment or payment could not be conditioned on the patients authorization the covered entity must provide the individual with copy of the signed authorization formif the covered entity will be receiving financial or inkind compensation in exchange for using or disclosing the health information the authorization must include statement that the covered entity will gain financially from the disclosure the regulations include model form that covered entities and third parties that wish to have information disclosed to them could use to request authorization from individuals for use or disclosure32 the regulations also propose that all authorizations be written in plain language and that covered entities be prohibited except in the case of certain clinical trials from conditioning treatment or payment for health care on obtaining an authorization for purposes other than treatment payment or health care operations covered entity would not be permitted to obtain an authorization for use or disclosure of information for treatment payment or health care operations unless required by applicable law where such authorization is required by law it could not be combined with an authorization in the same document for any purpose other than payment treatment or health care operations eg research covered entities would be required to keep record of all disclosures for purposes other than paymen t treatment or health care operations including those made pursuant to authorization when an individual requests such an accounting or copy of signed authorization form the covered entity is required to provide it an individual is permitted to revoke an authorization at any time except to the extent that action has been taken in reliance on the authorization if the authorization has any of the following defects the effect would be that there would be authorization the date has expired it lacks required element it has not been filled out completely it is known to have been revoked or the information on the form is known by the person holding the records to be materially false uses and disclosures permitted without individual authorization 164510 throughout the entirety of section of the proposed federal regulation on privacy of

the rule is intended to grant permission without creating mandate35 at first the drafters considered allowing the use and disclosure of information only where an affirmative legal requirement mandated its use or disclosure36 in the final draft the proposal permits the covered entity to use or disclose the information regardless of legal mandate because the activities described in the proposal benefits society as whole37 expressing the sentiment that the good of the whole outweighs that of the individual38 yet in categories such as psychiatric and substance abuse records the release of the information would have to conform to the more stringent guidelines of the applicable law even if the law refuses to allow its use39 moreove r if other law requires that the information be reported the covered entity must comply40 summarily this proposed regulation would not give covered entity authority to restrict or refuse to make use or disclosure mandated by other law41 uses and disclosures for public health activities 164510b the first category of permitted uses or disclosures deals with public health activities42 where authorized by law the covered entity may disclose health information to authorized public health officials without an individuals authorization43 also where authorized by law the covered entity may disclose individually identifiable health information to nongovernmental entities who are responsible for conducting public health activities44 in conjunction with other authorizing law the proposal would allow disclosure to those persons who are at risk of contracting or

the priority to protect the public health48 thus creating the need for the individually identifiable health information to ensure that public health officials are able to fulfill their obligations to promoting health and quality of life by preventing and controlling disease injury and disability49 these public health functions are to be given broad reading to disclose wide range of public health activities50 examples of these public health activities include reporting of vital events such as birth and death to vital statistics agencies and activities undertaken by the fda to evaluate and monitor the safety of food drugs medical devices and other products51 as exemplified by the fda the public health authorities given access would not be limited to traditional entities such as the public health department52 additionally nongovernmental agencies would also have authority to request individually identifiable health information53 one example may be device manufacturer that collects information under explicit legal authority or at the direction of the food and drug administration54 yet another example could be teaching hospital or university that has contracted with public health authorities55 finally third subcategory of individuals who may receive individually identifiable health information are those who could have been exposed to communicable disease or may

information being requested relates to either the party in the proceeding for which it is requested or if the disclosure is otherwise available through the proposed regulation60 another instance which may preclude the necessity of court order is one in which party to the judicial or administrative proceeding is both government entity and also the covered entity with the information61 summarily the proposal would permit covered entities to disclose protected health information in judicial or administrative proceeding if the request for such protected health information is made through or pursuant to court order or an order by an administra tive law judge specifically authorizing the disclosure of protected health information62 this section of the proposed regulation is intended to provide access to individual health information in situations that involve judicial and administrative proceedings63 it anticipates that litigants government agencies and others request information

see id subpoenas duces tecum notices of deposition interrogatories and administrative proceedings64 the covered entity would be required to confirm the validity of such order prior to releasing the information65 this confirmation would simply entail determining that the request is pursuant to court orderor if the individual who is the subject of the protected health information is party to the proceeding and his or her medical condition or history is at issue66 yet the covered entity would not be required in this instance to conduct an independent investigation to determine the legality of the court order or request67 simply reviewing the request and finding it compliant with the terms of the proposed regulation would be sufficient68 for example if the request is accompanied by court order the covered entity may rely on the statement within the order which requests the individuals health information69 however the covered entity may not release more information than is requested by the order70 when request is not accompanied by court order the covered entity must determine the following whether the request relates to the protected health information of litigant whose health is at issue written statement from the requester certifying that the protected health information being requested is about litigant to the proceeding and that the health condition of such litigant is at issue at such proceeding71 also under these proposed regulations the party to the proceeding who is seeking the release of the information would generally need to seek judicial review prior to submitting the request72 the exception to this requirement would be one in which the information is relevant to the proceeding which allows for the party in opposition to object through his or her counsel73 finally the proposed regulations also note that more stringent rules exist which protect individual medical information and acknowledge that these other rules would remain in place74 for

coroners and medical examiners 164510e because coroners and medical examiners have legal duty to identify deceased persons and determine cause of death they maintain legitimate need for readily available individually identifiable health information76 this portion of the proposed regulation is particularly important for expediency reasons since there is limited amount of time in which an autopsy may be done after death77 however covered entities would have an obligation to verify the identity of the coroner or medical examiner making the requestand the legal authority supporting the request78 disclosure for law enforcement 164510f law enforcement officials have enhanced access to individual medical records when conducting criminal investigations79 the proposed regulations would not curb law enforcement access to these medical records only require them in some instances to gain subpoena or warrant in order to gain access80 section 164510f permits covered entities to release individually identifiable health information without the individuals authorization when the law enforcement official is acting in his or her official capacity with certain qualifications81 the law enforcement official may be conducting lawful intelligence activities82 other incidents may include when the law enforcement official needs the protected health information and it is related to the victim of crime abuse or other harm if the information is needed to determine both whether violation of law by person other than the victim has occurred and whether an immediate law enforcement

constitute evidence of criminal conduct that constitutes health care fraud occurred on the premises of the covered entity or was witnessed by an employee of the covered entity85 many of these requirements that precede the release of protected health information are consistent with the rules governing criminal procedure most notably they are consistent with the fourth amendment to the constitution the fourth amendment to the constitution provides the right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized86 in order for person to qualify for the fourth amendment protections they must satisfy two requirements the person must demonstrate actual subjective expectation of privacy and this expectation of privacy must be one that society recognizes as being legitimate87 society generally recognizes that person has right to privacy in regard to their medical records88 thus necessitating warrant in order to divulge the contents of these protected records or probable cause to proceed without warrant law enforcement official must have probable cause89 prior to search taking place in order to have probable cause for search it must be more likely than not that the specific items to be searched for are connected with criminal activity and that these items will be found in the place to be searched90 furthermore when there are exigent circumstances the warrant clause may not apply91 the most common exigent circumstances are as follows preventing the imminent destruction of evidence preventing harm to persons and being in hot pursuit of suspect92httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30477crs16 93 standards for privacy of individually identifiab health information supra note 1 at 59960 94 see supra note 39 95 see supra note

prerequisites for law enforcement officials are reflective of the standards in criminal procedure many times the law enforcement official will obtain necessary evidence by first obtaining judicially executed warrant an administrative subpoena or grand jury subpoena93 thus this step of the legal process is consistent with the fourth amendment requirement94 yet the proposed regulations also allow for other circumstances such as time constraints to necessitate the release of information without first obtaining warrant95 the example which is given is when health information may be needed when law enforcement official is attempting to apprehend an armed suspect who is rapidly fleeing96 this example also parallels when the warrant clause of the fourth amendment would not apply in exigent circumstances97 the exigent circumstance here is hot pursuit the officer is chasing fleeing suspect when the release of protected health information is in the public interest the proposed regulations favor making them available to law enforcement officials98 specifically when the information is being sought as part of an investigation or as evidence at trial99 the proposed regulation suggests that the covered entity review an administrative request by applying threepart test100 the distinction put forth is that the administrative actions lack the protections that exist with an independent judicial officer or the secrecy of grand jury101 therefore covered entity could disclose protected health information pursuant to an administrative request after determining that i the records sought are relevant and material to legitimate law enforcement inquiry ii the request is as specific and narrowly drawn as reasonably practicable and iii deidentified information could not reasonably be used to meet the purpose of the request102httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30477crs17 103 standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information see supra note 1 at 59963 104 see id 105 standards

should review board not meet this criteria the covered entity would then not be permitted to disclose the information however if the review board meets the criteria then the date of approval must
