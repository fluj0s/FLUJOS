doctrine holds that the united states cannot be sued without its consent5 in other words the united states is liable fo r its wrongful acts and those of its employees only to the extent affirmatively allowed by federal law congress waived sovereign immunity for some tort suits by passing the federal tort claims act ftca in 19466 with exceptions the ftca makes the united states liable for injuries caused by the negligent or wrong ful act or omission of any federal employee acting within the scope of employment in accordance with the law of the state where the act or omission occurred three major excep tions under which the united states may not be held liable even in circ umstances where priv ate employer could be held liable under state law are the feres doctrine which prohibits suits by military personnel for injuries sustained incident to servi ce the discretionary functi on exception which immunizes the united states for acts or omissions of its em ployees that involve policy decisions and the intentional tort exception which precludes suits against the united states for assault and battery among some other intentional torts unless they are committed by federal law enforcement or investigative officials7 in addition the federal employees compensation act feca prohibits federal civilian employees from bringing suits under the ftca with respect to workrelated injuries8 in this respect feca is similar to other workers compensation laws damages for the columbia crew at least six of the seven members of the crew of columbia were apparently federal employees within the meaning of 5 usc 81011 and at least five crew members were us military personnel although the ftca contains explicit exclusion for injuries sustained by military personnel the supreme court has denied the right to sue to recover damages incurred incident to service in feres v united states the court held that the government is not liable under ftc for injuries to servicemen where the injuries arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to the service9 federal court applied the feres doctrine in dismissing ftca claim brought against the united states by the widow of the pilot of the space shuttle challenger following its 1986 explosion10 although nasa is civil agency the court found that the astronauts activity on challenger was i ncident to military service because of his active duty military status and participa tion in program in which military personnel were detailed to nasa by the armed services11 because feca blocks suits against the united states

defective booster rockets blamed for the explosion the settlement rms reportedly included paymen ts of at least 1 million to each family with morton thiokol and the federal government sharing the cost15 in the same year that the challenger settlements were nnounced however the supreme court recognized government contractor defense in boyle v united technologies corporation allowing contractor that is sued for damages to assert that it manufactured the product according to govern ment contract and that the design was required by contr act specifications16 the courts rationale wa s that uniquely federal interests are so committed by the constitution and the laws of the united states to federal control that state law is preempted and replaced where nece ssary by federal law of content prescribed by the cour ts so called federal common law17 although the government contractor defense appears to shield private contractors for work done according to government specifications pub lic opinion may encourage the government and private contractors to reach settlements to avoid litig ation as was done in the challenger case18 additionally nasa may indemnif private contractors and

indemnified united space alliance joint venture of boeing corpor ation and lockheed martin corporation that manages shuttle operations and other shuttle contractor s for major shuttle accidents although it is not clear whether the indemnif ication extends to lawsuits over astronauts deaths20 damage caused by shuttle debris while the federal government is insulated from suits by or on behalf of its employees for workrelated injuries it may not be secure from suits by individuals who suffer damages to themselves or their property as result of falling debris vivid example of such damage is the footlong tal bracket that smashed through the roof of dentists office in nacogdoches texas21 in that particular instance there were personal injuries although there was damage to the property its elf other widely reported incidents involved debris landing on runways at airports it is reasonable to anticipate that such property owners will seek to collect damages under the ftca although personal injuries appear to have been repor ted nasa and epa have issued warnings that debris may contain dangerous toxic chemicals22 subsequent injuri or property damage resulting from exposure to debris may also lead to claims damage recovery under the ftca depends upon finding of negligence in laird v nelms 406 us 797 1972 the supreme court he ld that damage allegedly caused to residential home by sonic booms produced by military aircraft wa s not actionable under the ftca the plaintiffs were unable to s how that the department of defense had been negligent in planning or ope rating the flights and the court relied upon its holding in dalehite v united states 346 us 15 45 1953 that the ftca applies only to negligent or wrongful acts or omissions and does not impose strict liability for dangerous or ultrahazardous activities23 in addition the discretionary function exception to the ftca precludes liability for negligence in the exercise of discretionary function such as designing spacecraft or establishing program of inspection of manufacturers compliance with minimum safety standards united states v varig airlines 467 us 797 1984httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21426crs5 24 nasa nasa
