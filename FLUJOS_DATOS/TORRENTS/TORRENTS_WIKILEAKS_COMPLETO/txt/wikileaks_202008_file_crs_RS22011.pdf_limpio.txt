power is defined for purposes of fi sa in section 101a of the act 50 usc 1801a to mean 1 foreign government or any component thereof whether or not recognized by the united states 2 faction of foreign nation or nati ons not substantially composed of united states persons 3 an entity that is openly acknowledged by foreign government or governments to be directed or controlled by such foreign

added new subparagraph 101b1c 50 usc 1801b1c as refl ected in italics below as amended by section 6001 agent of foreign power under fisa means 1 any person other than united states person who acts in

in international rrorism or activities in preparation therefor 5 foreignbased political organization not substantially composed of united states persons or 6 an entity that is directed and controlled by foreign government or governments 3 in light of the phrasing in the definition of f oreign power in 50 usc 1801a4 and of the definition of agent of foreign power in 50 usc 1801b2c therefore as it appears in the new subsection c added to 50 usc 1801b1 seems likely to have been intended to read therefor international terrorism is defined in 50 usc 1801c to mean activities that 1 involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life that are violation of the criminal laws of the united states or of any state or that would be criminal violation if committed within the jurisdic tion of the

an application for electronic surveillance under 50 usc 1805 he or she must find that 1 the president has authorized the attorn ey general to approve applications for electronic surveillance for fore ign intelligence information 2 the application has been made by federal officer and approved by the attorney general 3 on the basis of the facts submitted by the applicant there is probable cause to believe that the target of the electronic surveillance is foreign power or an agent of foreign power provided that united states person may be considered foreign power or an agent of foreign power solely upon the basis of activities protected by the first amendment to the constitution of the united states and b each of the facilities or places at which the electronic surveillance is directed is being used or is about to be used by foreign power or an agent of foreign power 4 the proposed minimization procedures meet the definition of minimization procedures under section 1801h of this title and 5 the application which has been filed contains all statements and certifications required by section 1804 of this title and if the target is united states person the certification or certifications are not clearly erroneous on th basis of statements made under section 1804a7e of this title and any other information furnished under section 1804d of this title 50 usc 1805a in making determinati on of probable cause under section 1805a3 the fisc judge may consider past activities of the target as well as facts and circumstances relating to current or future activities of the target 50 usc 1805b similar findings must be made by fisc judge issuing an order granting an application for physical search under fisa 50 usc 1824a b each provision also requi res that judge

section 101a1 2 or 3 of fisa 50 usc 1801a1 2 or 34 thus under the subsection added by section 6001 of pl 108458 nonus person who engages in international terrorism or in activities in preparation for international terrorism may be considered an agent of foreign power for purposes of fisa an applicant for fisa court order using this definition of agent of foreign power need not provide f acts and circumstances justifying belief that the target of the electronic surveillance or physical search is connected to foreign nation foreign group or international terrorist organization nor does the foreign intelligence surveillance court fisc in granting such an application have to find probable cause based on the facts submitted by the applicant to believe that such connection to foreign nation foreig n group or international terrorist group exists in order to find probable cause to believe that the target of the electronic surveillance or physical search is foreign power or an agent of foreign power5 this amendment does not change the proce dures to be followed by an applicant seeking fisa order for electronic surveillance or for physical search however thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22011crs5 6 section 6001b of pl 108458 as originally enacted was made subject to the sunset provisions of section 224 of the usa patriot act pl 10756 including the exception provided in subsection b of sec 224 sect ion 103 of the usa patriot improvement and reauthorization act pl 109177 extended the sunset on the amendment made by section 6001 by four additional years from december 31 2005 to december 31 2009 section 103 amends the exception to section 6001b2 using language th at is similar to that contained in section 224 of pl 10756 with respect to any particular foreign intelligence investigation that began before the date on which the provisions referred to in paragraph 1 cease to have effect or with respect to any particular offense or potential ffense that began or occurred before the date on which the provisions cease to have effect ch provisions shall continue in effect 7 as discussed in great er depth in footnote 1 supra fisa may be used for law enforcement purposes so long as significant purpose of th investigation is to obtain foreign intelligence information 8 section 6002 of pl 108458 redesignated the existing title vi of fisa as title vii and former section 601 as section 701 new section 601 of fisa was added which required the attorney general on semiannual basis to submit to the house permanent select committee on

or an agent of foreign power will vary dependi ng upon the definition of foreign power or agent of foreign power relied upon in the application nor does the amendment alter the requirements for such court order except to the extent that the factual underpinnings for the probable cause determin ation will also vary dependi ng upon definition of foreign power or agent of foreign power relied upon in given case the amendment to the definition of agen t of foreign power in section 6001 of pl 108458 is subject to th sunset provision of section 103 of the usa patriot improvement and reauthoriz ation act pl 109177 including the exception provided in subsection 6001b2 of pl 108458 as amended by section 1036 therefore section 101b1c of fisa 50 usc 1801b1c will sunset on december 31 2009 except with respect to any foreign intelligence investigation begun before that date or any criminal offense or potential offense that began or occurred before that date thus where foreign intelligence investigati on was underway before december 31 2009 or criminal offense or potential offense began or was committed7 before that date the definition of agent of foreign power added by sec tion 6001 of pl 108458 would still be available under those circumstances an application for fisa court order for electronic surveillance or phy sical search involving lone wolf target could still be pursued after
