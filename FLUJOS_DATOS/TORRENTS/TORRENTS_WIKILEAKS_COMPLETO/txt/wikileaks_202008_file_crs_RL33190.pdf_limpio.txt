elections rely on computers in some way the most computerized is the direct recording electronic voting machine or dre in this system votes are recorded directly onto computer memory devices while dres have been in use since the early 1990s stions about their security and reliability were previously relatively minor issue even following the november 2000 presidential election and the subsequent c ongressional deliberations leading to the enactment of the help america vo act of 2002 hava pl 107252 however at least two factors led to sharp increase in public concerns about dres beginning in 2003 first the voting accessibility provisions in hava promote the use of dres which have been the only kind of voting system that can meet the hava requirement s to permit persons with disabilities including blindness to vote privately and inde pendently second potential security vulnerabilities with dres were publicized as result of several studies several bills were introduced in the 109th congress that would addre ss these issues in different ways number of similar bills have been introduced thus far in the 110th congress in the public debate about dres there s been some confusion about what the problems and issues are arising to significant degree from the complexity of dres and of elections in general this confusion can lead to misperceptions about facts as well as issues and options for resolving them several points are worth noting dres do have unique security concerns and have only recently been studied by the scientific community however most problems in recent elections were not associated with dres security flaws in them are not known to have compromised any elections and it is not clear how much of threat those vulnerabilities pose to election integrity in practice especially in comparison to other kinds of threats the different models of dres in current use vary substantia lly in design and problems that one model exhibits may not occur in others many of the problems that have occurred are procedural not weakne sses in the technology itself it is not clear whether the unique security problems posed by dres are best addressed by requiring that they produce paper ballots or by other means while paper has useful security properties and is wellknown other methods exist that might be superior furtherm ore paper ballots used with dres called voterverified paper audit trails or vvpat are largel unproven and it is not clear how well they can meet hava requirements for accessibility or other goals such as usability as the 110th congress considers proposals relatin g to dres salient issues might include the lack of information about dre security especially in relation to other systems and other components of electi on integrity potential conflicts with hava requirements that might be associated w ith the proposals how those proposals might impact voter confidence and what impacts they might have on future innovation that could greatly improve the transparency and integrity of elections this report will be updated in response to major developmentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33190contents f q s n d m i s p r c p t i n s 2

for both voters and election officials1 questions about the security and relia bility of dres were relatively minor issue until 2003 two factors led to sharp increase in public concerns about them 1 the help america vote act of 2002 hava requires at least one voting machine in each precinct to fully accommodate disabled voters and dres are the only system that currently meets this requirement and 2 the security vulnerabilities of dres were widely publicized as the result of several studies released in 20032 much of the debate over dres has focu sed on whether they should be required to produce paper ballot that can be verifi ed by the voter as solution to potential vulnerabilities this approach is often called the voterverified paper audit trail vvpat bills to require vvpat were introduced in the 108th and 109th congresses but there is divided opi nion about both vvpat and the security vulnerabilities of dres particularly with respect to the comparative vulnerabilities of other voting methods and various ot her aspects of election administration proposals to require that dr use vvpat or another method of verification have been seen by some observers including many computersecurity experts as the method of choice for addressing the cerns however others including many election officials3 believe that vvpat is unnecessa ry or even counterproductive and that security issues are

of voters used optical scan and 40 used dres12 while technologically far simpler than dres optical scan systems are not immune from problems and many of the difficulties reported in 2004 and 2006 were for these systems however media reports and statements by activists and others sometimes do not distinguish between the two types lumping them together as electronic voting systems to the extent that

awarding of major grant by the national science foundation to several institutions to establish center for voting technology research17 are there any unique security concerns with dres dres currently in use have unique set of security vulnerabilities which has been demonstrated by several of the studies cited above see footnote 12 it re sults from the same feature reliance on computer for casting and recording of votes in single machine that gives dres their capabilities in accessi bility usability and efficiency because the machines rely on complicated software it is at least theoretically possible that someone could insert hidden computer c ode that would add subtract or change votes there are several things that such malicious code or malware might do in the best known potential exploit the hidden code would cause the dre to record different vote from what the voter sees on the face of the machine another possibility is that the malware could change vote totals after they had been recorded but before they are downloaded for tallying while an optical scan or punchcard count er could also be programmed to record different vote from that intended by the voter with those systems the ballot that the voter saw is preserved as part of norma l practice and can be checked independentlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33190crs6 18 even the most technologically unsophisticat ed

evoting machines july 8 2005 httpwwwtechnewsworldcomstory44476htmlby another machine or human that is not possible with dre where the choices the voter sees on the face of the machine are ephemeral they are reset when the voter casts the ballot the actual record of the voter preserved on an electronic medium is not something the voter ever sees in that way dres are like lever machine voting systems in which casting ballot advances mechanical counters which the voter cannot see and resets the levers for the next voter the difference is that any tampering with lever machines would have to be done one machine at time whereas malicious code need be inserted into dre software only once before it is loaded onto the machines as with lever machines lost or changed votes could result from malfunction as well as intentional tampering it is generally recognized that this vulnerability of dres poses at least theoretical risk the controversy arises over whether it poses significant risk in practice and if so what is the most appropriate response some dre proponents claim for example that the design of dres prevents the writing of malware that could change votes in predictable way in practice others claim that following appropriate security and audit procedures is sufficient to prevent successful tampering and that modern dres when pr operly managed have less risk of losing votes through malfunction than any other voting system many dre critics state in contrast that those claims are wrong or cannot be substantiate d and that the only effective solution is permanent paper ba llot that the voter has verified or some other method of verification that is indepe ndent of the technology used to cast and count the votes in fact most experts belie ve that it is impossible to prove that complex system such as dre or any other voting system18 is secure against all possible threats the question is rather wh ether they can be made sufficiently secure to make the risk from attempts at tampering acceptably low have dre security flaws compromised any elections there were substantiated reports from any state of compromised elections due to security flaws that involved computer h acking or similar attacks in 200419 as one observer has noted unlike paper ballots in th history of dres one has found any evidence of the machines bein g used for fraudulent purposes20

celebrated dre malfunctions in 2004 voting machines in carter et county north carolina stopped counting ballots on ce 3005 voters had voted although they appeared to continue accepting votes poll workers expected the machines to accommodate 10000 voters an estimated 4500 votes were lost as result attributable to lack of human oversight in upgrading machine capacities rather than security breach or an attempt to commit fraud21 because of close vote in one county race second electi on was required to resolve the contest very rare occurrence the widely reported problem of an ove rcount in franklin county oh in 2004 occurred when laptop was used in precinct to communicate the unofficial tallies from dre memory cartridge to the central office the total number of voters casting ballots in the precinct was 638 but the number initially reported as casting vote for president exceeded 4500 the memory cartridge itself and other redundant memory for the dre contained the correct count nd the error was quickly discovered and corrected22 the problem was diagnosed by the dre vendor as technical flaw relating to communication between the memory cartridge and the laptop and controls were added to prevent the problem in future23 the undervote problem in 2006 in sarasota county flor ida which some have attributed to hardware or software problems with the dr is discussed earlier in this report aside from the unique security challeng posed by dres human interaction with electronic voting machines involves chain of custody that parallels any other type of voting equipment or method in this regard there have been reports of questionable behavior by poll workers ection officials and vendors with respect to dres as with other voting methods it is not likely that most poll workers possess the knowledge to alter lever optical s can or dre voting machines and security measures should be designed to address the unique characteristics of each type of voting system to prevent tampering and fraud nevertheless some observers point out that successful attempt to tamper with dre software may be especially difficult to detect if so discovery of any resultant fraud could be unlikely some also believe that the threshold for investigation of possible election fraud is too high in many states and that as result many attemp ts at tampering may go undetected matter what voting system is used do security flaws in dres pose the greatest threat to election integrity while current dres have unique security flaws it has not been established that they pose greater risk to the integrity of elections than other kinds of problems the unique concern about dres and to lesser extent other computerassisted voting systems such as optical scan is the risk from

voting systems have security vulne rabilities and about 60 of voters in 2006 used systems other than dres24 optical scan systems were used by more voters and security vulnerabilities have also been demonstrated with those systems25 however the proportion of voters using dres could continue to increase as result of havas accessibility requirements ce dres are currently the only kind of voting

include such things as voter registration fraud voter in timidation and misdirection absenteeballot fraud flawed election procedures poor ba llot design poor functional design or maintenance of voting equipment and significant procedural error recent evidence indicates that most lost votes result from voter regist ration polling place and usability problems not security issues27 some experts argue that such flaws pose greater threat to the integrity of elections than recent concerns about dre security and too much attention is currently being paid to the latter unfortunately there does not appear to be sufficient information available to determine objectively which kinds of threat should be of highest priority to counter although some observers argue that software attacks are the least

the dres that failed in carteret c ounty nc discu ssed above were an older model with more limited computer memory than more recent systems do problems with dres result from weaknesses in the technology itself dres have vulnerabilities as noted above but most of the incidents identified with those voting machines appear to have resulted from procedural problems rather than any inherent weakness in dre technology itself31 dres are computerbased systems as are optical scan counters many voter registration databases as required in all states by hava starting in january 2006 and other aspects of election administration and they are subject to the same problems as any computerbased system but preventable problems that result from human error such as administrative or procedural mistakes and problems that occur with optical scan ballot counters not dres are often c onflated in the public eye with weaknesses in dre technology32 available evidence also indicates that dres when

fischerthe residual vote rate the percentage of ballots that did not record vote for president between 2000 and 2004 found that jurisdictions that changed to dres from any type of voting system lowered th rate particularly those changing from punch cards to dres33 while any change in voting system reduced the residual vote rate dres performed comparatively well by this measure although the residual vote rate is an imperfect measure because some voters may intentionally skip one or more races it does provide some evidence of voting system performance is certification of dres under fe deral and state voting system standards sufficient to make th em secure in general certification standards with appropriate security pr ovisions are considered to be necessary but not sufficient to achieve an acceptable level of security they provide only baseline of features controls and performance that system should exhibit as part of an overall security strategy the dres in which security vulnerabilities had been discovered in the studies cited above had in fact been certified under the fe deral voting system standards vss34 while it is not clear whether the certification testing of those systems identified any of the problems th at were discovered in the studies the process did not in any case prevent thos systems from being certified and deployed with the vulnerabilities present the election assistance commission guidelines called the voluntary voting system guidelines or vvsg that are replacing the vss have more extensive security requirements35 but the above example shows that certification alone is not sufficient protection against security vulnerabilities and it is not generally considered to be so there are at least two reasons for this first the security threat environment for information technology in ge neral is constantly evolving with new threats arising on regular basis consequently it is unrealistic to expect certification under comparativ ely static standard to an ticipate and protect against all new kinds of threats that may arise against voting systems that rely on information technology second the vvsg process l eads to certification of technology but procedures and personnel are equally important to effec tive security and often pose significant vulnerabilities36 in addition standards often require compromise to balance different functions and goals such as accuracy security speed usability and cost and unless security is cons idered paramount it will of necessity be subject to such compromise

legitimate and has not been altered in any way this may be paired with techniques to assure confidentiality that the recipient cannot read the informati on but only verify that it is authentic one

methods other than adding paper ballots which could be used to address them unfortunately none of these methods in cluding paper have been sufficiently developed to compare efficacy practicality and cost in meaningful way paper ballots used with dres usually called voterverified paper audit trail or vvpat provide permanent independent record of votes that can be verified by the voter before casting the ballot vvp at is one of class of security methods called independent verification iv37 these methods have in common the creation of two truly independent records of the vote rs choices that the voter can verify and that can be compared in any audit38 another iv method audio recordings of ballot choices may be more voterfriendly than paper and exhibit superior verifiability39 the above methods do not pr ovide true voter verifiability because the voter can verify the ballot only before it is cast third method uses cryptographic techniques40 to allow the voter to verify after casting the ballot that it was counted correctly without violating ballot secrecy41 it also permits voters to verify that ballots were changed added or subtracted inappropriately feature known as results verifiability thus this method c ould potentially make the election process far more transparent than is possible with other approaches methods could also be veloped that do not require the voter to separately verify the choices made on the dre conceptually this approach would behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33190crs12 42 see crs report rl32777 creating national framework for cybersecurity an analysis of issues and options by eric fischer for more detail 43 ibid 44 this point has been made by several security experts in different public fora perhaps most continuedequivalent to taking separate snapshot of the ballot choices listed on the face of the dre just before the voter casts the ballot security methods other than an indepe ndent ballot record might also provide ways to sufficiently manage any risks for example product standards for secure computing such as the common criteria42 could be combined with sufficiently stringent engineering and administrative security practices to improve resistance to tampering does vvpat ensure that voter knows how votes were recorded on dre one consequence of the secret ballot is that voter cannot know how his or her vote is recorded unless certain cryptographic techniques are used with vvpat voter is given the opportunity befo re the vote is cast to review paper printout of ballot choices made and to compare them to the choices listed on the dre display if the voter finds discrepancy the ballot can be cancelled and new voting session begun however once the ballot is cast the voter does not know what was actually recorded in the dres memory any discrepancies between the recorded vote and the printout can be discovered only by election officials if they compare the electronic and printed records after the ection the circumstances under which they would do that will depend on state and local election law and procedures true voter verifiability in which the voter can confirm that the ballot was counted as intended is possible without vi olating ballot secrecy but is not currently in use in us federal elections the simplest way to achieve verifiability is to have ballots publicly counted and associated w ith the names of the voters analogous to recorded vote in the house or senate classic example in public elections would be voice voting for candidates in town hall meeting however such methods would eliminate ballot secrecy which is generally regarded as an important safeguard against voter fraud and coercion other thods though could be used that do not compromise ballot secrecy for example cryptographic techniques used in national security permit secret message to be au thenticated without revealing its contents similarly they can provide voters the ability to determine that their ballots were counted accurately without revealing the act ual votes cast see above some systems using this approach have been developed43 are paperbased ballots the most secure there appears to be an assumption among many vvpat advocates that paper ballots are far more secure and less subject to fraud and tampering than are dres but whether that is so has not been established as fact it is generally accepted that paper has certain desirable security features compared to electronic records for example it is durable it can be difficult to alter without tection and it can be direc tly inspected without the use of machines or devices44 however paper also has several security weaknesses inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33190crs13 44 continued notably david jefferson computer scientis t at

ma lware if counting is done with the aid of computers and unlike electronic records it cannot take full advantage of the protections afforded th rough the use of cryptographic techniques although those techniques are not currently used in public elections in the united states45 the evolution of voting security can be considered kind of arms race with new technologies devel oped to combat fraud and miscrean ts evolving ways to attack each new technology in turn for example the bribery associated with voice voting in the eighteenth and early nineteenth cen turies was countered by the use of paper ballots which evolved into ticket ballots provided by the political parties subsequently the australian secret ballo t was adopted to combat the fraud that became associated with the ticket ballot and the lever machine came into wide use in part because it prevented certain kinds of fraud that had become prevalent even with the australian ballot46 for example lever machines and dres prevent particularly notorious kind of ballot fraud known as chain voting in which each voter obtains previously marked ballot before entering the poll deposits that ballot and leaves with the unmarked ballot the voter obtained in the polling place that ballot is then marked for the next voter othe r classic forms of ballot fraud with paper ballots include such methods as stuffing of the ballot box altering or substituting ballots and producin g fraudulent counts47 at least some of these methods can be made more difficult with the proper use of voting technology including lever machines dres and counting devices alt hough all of those systems have potential vulnerabilities of their own in addition recent technological advances have made production of counterfe it ballots and other methods fo r tampering with paper ballots potentially more feasible48 the armsrace characteristics of the evolution of voting systems strongly suggests that vvpat would have exploita ble

method is possible for any consolidated ballot it would not work with lever machines and would seem impractical for almost all public elections apparent49 for that and other reasons s imple reliance on such technological solution or any magic bullet countermeas ure is unlikely to be successful in general effective security uses yered multifaceted approach that involves procedural and technological sa feguards as well as technology50 one threat analysis that compared optical scan systems with dres with and without vvpat found that all such systems exhibited vulnerabilities and that effective countermeasures are available against them but that few jurisdictions had implemented such countermeasures the study also concluded that random partial recount s and audits are particularly useful count ermeasures but that such recounts require paper and so are unavailable for dr without vvpat51 are paper ballots essential to ensu re transparency in an election there is not generally agreed definition of transparency in the context of elections however it is usually taken to mean that election processes ar open and observable in all of their essential parts so that tampering malfeasance incompetence and other threats to integrity are difficult to hide voter verifiability is arguably an important component of transparency and to the exte nt that paper ballots provide verifiability they can be important to transparency ho wever as discussed in more detail above the requirement for ballot secrecy as an antitampering measure severely limits the ability of paper ballots to provide verifiability and othe r methods may prove superior when used with electronic voting system s consequently paper ballots are not essential to ensure the tran sparency of an election does vvpat violate ballot secrecy the secret ballot has long been recognized as important in the prev ention of fraud and coercion in voting52 some observers have misunderstood vvpat as per mitting voters to remove the printed list of ballot choices from the polling place which would compromise ballot secrecy however that is not how this verificati on method works as used in conjunction with dres vvpat can be seen by the vot er but not handled or removed from the polling place as result they cannot be used by voters to prove how they voted53httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33190crs15 54 statement of senator christopher j dodd senate rules committee hearing on voter verification in federal elections june 21 2005 available at httprulessenategovh earings2005062105_hearinghtmthere is one way in which vvpat can potentially compromise ballot secrecy most current implementations print the ballo t choices on roll of paper if someone at the polling place keeps track of the orde r in which voters use given dre which is reportedly common practice in some jurisdictions it would be possible to identify which voter cast which ballot on that machin however there are several possible countermeasures that could be implemented to combat this vulnerability in fact the only voting method currently in use in federa l elections for which violations of ballot secrecy is significant potential concern is the absentee or mailin ballot do paper ballots pose only minor inconvenience for persons with disabilities paper ballots have long posed problems for voters with disabilities including blind voters some voters with imp aired sight and voters with other types of disabilities that prevent them from filling out paper ballot in the past paper ballot could be filled out by person designated to do so by disabled voter but the ballot was not secret and blind voters had means of verifying that their choices were properly marked at polling place disabled voter needed to bring someone with them or accept the assistance of some one at the polling place often stranger hava changed that arrangement by requi ring that polling places provide at least one voting machine that is accessible to voters with disabilities and provides the same level of secrecy nd verifiability as for other voters 301a3 dres outfitted with paper audit tr ail cannot be verified at present by certain disabled voters particularly blind and sight impaired voters in senate rules committee hearing on voter verification in j une 2005 senator christopher dodd hava cosponsor noted we say in hava that ever voter must have the right to verify their ballot before the ballot is castall of the legislation or most of it that has been introduced excludes the ability of the disabled to have the same right by insisting on paper we are denying the people who cannot read because they cannot see or for reasons otherwise cannot manua lly operate the system chance to verify what they have done54 the accessibility problems with pa per ballots are potentially solvable but would require the use of additional tec hnology such as elect ronic reading aids one exception is votebyphone used in few states such as vermont as the accessible voting system in which the syst em produces printed paper ballot which it can then scan and read back to the voter to provide verifiability is vvpat proven technology that is simple to implement while the basic technology used in vvpat is pr oven the system as whole is not the vvsg include an approved fede ral standard for this ve rification method but it does not go into effect at the federal level til 2007 vvpat also adds significant level of complexity to dre voting both because of the additional technology required and the effort needed by voter to compare the onscreen and printed ballots it also adds complexity to the administration of an ection by requiring procedures for handling and processing paper ballots in addition to the electronic ballot records there was

addition to the cost of hava requirements the lack of data on its performance and problems associated with the technology in actual use there we re reports of jammed printers in some places in 200456 whether paper trail assists voters in correcting errors is unknown and probably difficult to m easure what little research is currently available suggests that voters do not use it effectively as it is currently implemented57 furthermore one study found problems in the implementation of vvpat that if uncorrected could cast significant doubt on its ability to serve as the official ballot record for recounts58 recounts and audits is an audit of an elect ion the same as recount an election recount is intended to confirm an election result because contest was particularly close or for some other reason that called the in itial result into question the focus of recount is the voted ballot rather than an examination of voting equipment or voting processes recounts and the thods for triggering them va ry by state some states require an automatic partia l recount for close race other reasons for conducting recount may include demonstrated irregu larity or other evidence that result is questionable and may require recount or formal request by candidate an audit is an indepth examination of the accuracy of the voting process as whole rather than just the voted ballots or election totals with proper record keeping an audit can facilitate stepbystep examination of how voting machine recorded cast ballots and computed vote totals to determine whether it performed accurately audits may also review the chain of custody for voting equipment printed ballots registration lists and the method of compiling them deployment of voting equipment and the votecounting pro cess presumably an audit can examine any aspect of the election process th at can be measured or recordedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33190crs17 59 ibid 60 for example if 5 out of 100 precincts reported results incorrectly selecting and recounting only 1 out of the 100 precincts woul d fail to discover the problem 95 of the time recounting 13 precincts would be needed to lower the detectionfailure probability to 50 however if 10 misreported recoun ting only 7 would be needed to yield failure probability below 50 but 50 would need to be recounted if only 1 precinct misreported curiously under this model the number of precincts that need to be rec ounted does not change greatly for given misreporting rate as the total number of precincts increases thus to detect 1 misreporting rate with 50 probability am ong californias 25000 precincts requires recounting only 69 precincts the numbers are determined using simple probability calculation analogous to that used to solve the birthday problem what is the probability that at least two people in group of given size share the same birthday if there are 100 precincts and five are reporting incorrectly that means 95 of the precincts have error then assuming recounting will always detect any error in given precinct not realistic in practice if single precinct is chosen at random for rec ount the probability that the recount would be done on precinct that reported correctly is 95 out of 100 or 95 in that case if second precin ct is counted the probability that correctly reporting one is chosen will be 94 out of the 99 remaining or 949 the probability that an incorrectly reporting precinct would be missed in both cases is obtained by multiplying the two probabilities 95 949 909 the process is repeated to determine probabilities associated with adding additiona l precincts see also c andrew neff election confidence comparison of methodol ogies and their relative effectiveness at achieving it december 17 2003

and electronic records the basic argument in favor of the pos ition is that the paper ballot is more trustworthy since the voter had the opport unity to examine it directly others however point out that this approach may actually create vulnerabilities since miscreants could simply focus their attacks on the paper ballots they say it is preferable to use the entire audit trail to determine the correct outcome in the event of discrepancy in ddition printerjamming or othe r problems that prevent dres from producing vvpat ballots could result in paper audit trail that does not accurately reflect the ballots cast59 will partial recount dete rmine if fraud occurred some vvpat proposals include the requirement that nd recounts be done of sample of the paper ballots and compared to the mach ine counts recorded by the dres the likelihood that such an approach will detect any irregular ities depends on several factors to be effective sample rec ount would need to provide for meaningful comparison of recount results with original tallies one way to do that is to recount entire precincts the number recounted woul d need to be high enough to provide reasonable probability that inaccuracies woul d be detected th at number will depend on the degree of inaccuracy election officials are interested in detecting60 as well as the probability of detection deemed necessa ry to serve as sufficient deterrent to potential miscreants at least one analysis has found that random partial recounts canhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33190crs18 61 brennan center machi nery of democracy 62 election reform information project vvpat lawsbe highly effective countermeasure against several forms of fraud aimed at computerassisted voting systems61 are hand counts more accurate than machine counts vvpat proposals often stipulate that recounts of paper ballots must be done by hand they often argue that only direct counting by humans can ensure accuracy that may indeed be the case in some circumstances but it is not likely to hold broadly in general humans are not as accurate as machines in performing simple highly repetitive tasks such as counting ballots th ey tend to make many more errors that is one reason why repeated manual r ecounts may yield different results machine accuracy is especially likely to be higher if the ballot choices made by the voter are printed as they are with vvpat in contrast machines are not as good at judging voter intent if markings are am biguous or not within machine parameters as may be the case if the ballots are marked directly by voters as in optical scan systems machine miscounts can also re sult from miscalibration or other technical failure or potentially from malware if it has been implanted however there are several ways to guard against such problems possible issues for congress as of the end of 2006 most stat required paper ballot records62 however neither maryland nor georgia which use dres statewide had enacted such requirements opting instead to focus on ot her security approaches as vvpat is used by more states and more studies of its effectiveness are done more will be known about the cost perfo rmance and any limitations of vvpat in normal use misperceptions about dres could have impor tant policy implications as states and possibly congress consider proposals to require vvpat for all electronic voting machines in particular the followi ng issues may be worth considering lack of information there remains considerable uncertainty about the relative security of dres in comparison to other voting systems how security measures such as vvpat may impact other important goal s such as accuracy reliability usability and accessibility and the effec tiveness of those security measures congress could direct the eac to fill those information ga ps through appropriate research as states move to implement vvpat nd other security measures potential conflicts w ith hava requirements to the extent that states require paperbased ballots they may be perceive d to be in violation of the accessibility requirements of hava unless their paperb ased systems can be made sufficiently accessible congress might be asked to resolve any such conflicts through changes to havahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33190crs19 63 this point was made for example by the carterbaker commission httpwwwamericaneduiacfer as one of the reasons for its recommendation that paper ballot records be required 64 see for example herrnson beyond the hanging chadvoter confidence one of the arguments used in favor of vvpat by some observers is that it is necessary to help restore voter confidence in the us election process63 however there is little evidence that confidence of the average voter is affected by this issue64 even if the adoption of vvpat does increase confidence in the electoral process if that confidence is false as might be the case if voters mistakenly believe that paperballot requirement is magic bullet security measure that could itself pose risk to the integrity of elections congress may wish to examine the extent and causes of any decline in voter confidence and the impact of various possible measures on it in considering whether to enact legislation relating to this matter impacts on innovation while the mandating of security requirements such as vvpat can result in innovation with respect to those requirements there is risk that the requirements will be written in such way that other kinds of innovation such as potentially superior security measures not using vvpat will be difficult to implement without dditional legislation for exam ple any law requiring paper ballots would have to be changed before an alternative indepe ndentverification or softwareindependent system such as those discussed in the vvsg could be implemented congress may wish to consider ways to ensure that the federal and state regulatory environment for voting systems does not inhibit such innovation
