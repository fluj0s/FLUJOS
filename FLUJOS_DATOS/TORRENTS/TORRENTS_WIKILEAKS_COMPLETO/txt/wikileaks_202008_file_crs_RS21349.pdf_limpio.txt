in 1981 the reagan administration reacted to the mass migration of asylum seekers who arrived in boats from haiti by establishing program to interdict ie stop and s earch certain vessels suspected of transporting undocumented haitians this agreement made with thendictator jeanclaude duvalier authorized the us coast guard to board and inspect private haitian vessels on the high seas and to

bertrand aristide however challenged the assumption that all haitian boa t people were economic migrant s the state department reportedly hesitated on whether the haitians should be forced to return given the strong condemnation of the coup by the united states and the organization of american states by november 11 1991 approximately 450 haitia ns were being held on coast guard cutters while the administration of thenpresident george h w bush considered the options the former bush administration l obbied for regional solution to the outflow of haitian boat people and the united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr arranged for several countries in the region belize honduras trinidad and tobago and venezuela to temporarily provide safe haven for haitians interdicted by the coast guard some of the other countries in the region were each willing to provide safe haven for onl several hundred haitians meanwhile the coast guard cutters were becoming severely overcro wded and on november 18 1991 the united states forcibly returned 538 haitians to haiti prescreening and repatriation the options for safe havens in third countries in the region proved inadequate for the sheer numbers of haitians fleeing their country and the former bush administration began treating the haitians fleeing by boat as asylum seekers the coast guard took them to the us naval base in gu antanamo cuba where they were prescreened for asylum in the united states during this period there were approximately 10490 haitia ns who were paroled into th united states after pre screening interview at guantanamo determined that they had credible fear of persecution if returned to haiti on may 24 1992 citin g the surge of haitians that month then president bush ordered the coast guard to intercept all haitians in boats and immediately return them without interviews to determine whether they were at risk of persecution the administration offered those repatriated the option of in country refugee processing7 safe haven and refugee processing the repatriation policy continued for two years until thenpresident bill clinton announced that interdic ted haitians would be taken to location in the region where they w ould be processed as potential refugees the refugee processing policy lasted only few weeks june 15 to july 5 1994 much like the former bush administration the clint on administration cited the exodus of haitian boat people as reason for suspending refug ee processing instead the new policy became one of regional safe havens where interdicted haitians who expressed
