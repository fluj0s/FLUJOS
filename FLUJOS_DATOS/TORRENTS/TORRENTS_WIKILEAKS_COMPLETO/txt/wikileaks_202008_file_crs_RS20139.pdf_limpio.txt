multilateral trade ruleshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20139crs2 us trade officials insisted that chinas entry into the wto had to be based on commercially meaningful terms that would require china to

similar c oncerns the uschina business council uscbc midyear 2003 report on chinas wto implementation stated that there were growing concerns among us firms over chinas ability to deliver on key commitments on time and in full6 finally survey of us fi rms doing business in china conducted by the general accounting office in 2003 found that majority of those questioned felt that china had implemented most of its wto obligations only to some or little extent7 us officials have raised number of wto implementation issues with chinese officials over the past year soybeans us soybean exporters have faced uncertainty and in some instances disruption in their soybean sales to china stemming from chinas announcement in 2001 that it would seen implement new rules on bioengineered foods effective in 2002 ch ina initially failed to provide details of these rules whic h led to disruption in us soybean exports to china from januarymarch 2002 president bush personally raised the issue with chinese officials which led china to agree to the interim use of us and foreign safety certificates until china implements its new biotechnology regulations on october 18 2002 china issued regulations applying this policy through september 2003 the ustrs office stated that the regulation should remove the threat of an interruption of us soybean sales to china8 in july 2003 china further extended the policy through april 2004 however us exporters have complained that the regulations require each gmo shipment have anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20139crs4 9 however us soybean exports to china durin g the first five months of 2004 declined by 32 over the same period in 2003 10 for example under the wto accession agreement chinas trq for cotton in 2002 was 818500 tons in june 2002 china announced that 500000 tons of the trq would be allocated for processing trade 270000 tons for state owned mills and 48500 tons for private mills 11 inside uschina trade february 11 2004 12 despite these problems us cotton exports to china have increased sharply in recent years growing from 144 million in 2002 to 761 million in 2003 during the first five months of continuedinterim biotech safety certificate and chinese government import license additionally in january 2003 the chinese government indicated that it might delay perm anent approval of various gmo crops and might require anothe r round of food safety st udies move that led the us to issue an official protest some analysts charge that china may be attempting to use such regulations to limit biotech imports in order to protect its domestic pr oducers as well as its own biotech industries us officials have warned that they make take this issue to the wto for resolution despite these problems us soybean exports to china more than tripled in 2003 over 2002 levels making china the largest market for us soybean exports in 20039 tariffrate quotas in november 2001 the chinese government developed new rules on tariff ra tequotas on certain agricultural products that the us charged were discriminatory and violated wto rules because they created two cat egories of import quota licenses one for domestic consumption and one for processing trade the us further charged that china has failed to provide adequate information on the administration of its tariffrate quotas trqs for farm commodities in july 2002 the us department of agriculture usda reported that chinas trq licenses had authorized relatively small levels of imports making their use impractical10 us firms charge that this allocation policy violates wto rules on nationa l treatment in other instances china announced trqs for various agriculture and manufactured products several months after thei r required implement ation date in december 2002 ustr robert zoellick sent letter to the chinese government expressing us cern over chinas administration of trqs in january 2003 zoellick was quot ed in the press as saying that the trq issue was one of the areas were most frustrated with in terms of chinas wto compliance and warned the united states was considering bringing dispute resolu tion case to the wto in october 2003 china reportedly issued new re gulations effective january 2004 eliminating subquotas and restrictive license pr ocedures and improving transparency in identifying quot allocation recipients however problems appear to remain for exam ple china has failed to publish the details of its 2004 trq allocation11 and in march 2004 the national cotton council charged that china tinues to maintain two categories of import quota licenses for cotton12 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20139crs5 12 continued 2004 us cotton exports to china totaled 11 billion export subsidies and discriminatory taxes us officials charge that china has subsidized grain exports mainly corn and cotton and uses its tax system to discourage imports nd encourage foreign firms to produce domestically contrary to its wto commitments for example china continues to give rebates on va lueadded taxes vat for certain industries especially for high tec h in some instances china imposes higher vat rates on certain importe d products such as fertilizers and various agricultural products than it does for similar products produced domestically on march 18 2004 the ustr announced that it had filed wto dispute resolution case against china over its discriminatory tax treatment of imported semiconductors charging that china applies 17 vat rate on semiconductor chips that are imported into china but gives substantial rebate of the tax if the semiconductors are produced or designed in china on july 8 2004 china agreed to this policy ipr while china has enacted variety of new ipr laws and periodical crackdowns on ipr violators the pir acy rate in china for copyrighted products is estimated to be at 90 the chinese government estimates the value of pirated g oods made in china at 19 to 24 billion us industry officials estimate that ipr pi racy in china cost us firms 26 billion in lost sales in 2003 some members of congre ss have called on the administration to bring case against china in the wto over its lack of ipr enforcement in april 2004 china pledged to significantly reduce ipr infringement levels by increasing efforts to halt production imports and sales of c ounterfeit goods and lowering the threshold for criminal prosecution of ipr violations some analysts argue that chinas compliance with its wto obligations is being hampered by resistance to reforms by central and local government officials seeking to protect or promote industries under their ju risdictions government corruption and lack of resources devoted by the central government to ensure that wto reforms are carried out in uniform and consistent manner esp ecially in regards to ipr enforcement although chinese government officials ve promised to imp lement wto related reforms it appears that they are concerned that trade liberalization could cause major employment disruptions in certain sensitive sectors especially agriculture that could result in social instability in addition many observers charge that because the chinese government is trying to promote the devel opment of various indus tries especially high tech it deems critical for th countrys future economic development it continues to maintain policies that discriminate against imports in fa vor of domestic industries andor foreigninvested firms in china despite the persistence of trade disputes between the united states and china us exports to
