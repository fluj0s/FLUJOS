promot ed through the use of congressionally authorized generic promotion programs1 to fund these programs the authorizing statutes and orders require that an assessment be co llected based on the amount of product that covered party sells produ ces or imports some producers have opposed the use of or message in generic advertisements and have brought first amendment challenges in court three of which the supreme court has decided the supreme courts first two attempts at addressing first amendment challenges to checkoff programs califor nia fruits and mushrooms respectively resulted in contrasting opinions nd some confusion for lower courts subsequent circuit court decisions for th beef pork and dairy checkoff programs for example have all seemed to struggle with determining the applicable level of scrutiny to apply to the programs nonetheless in each case the appellate courts rejected the governments argument that the checkoff programs were government speech immune from first amendment scrutiny and found the programs to unconstitutionally compel speech or compel the subsidy for the support of some type of speech in may 2005 the supreme court issued its third opinion in eight years regarding the constitutionality of checkoff program beef in johanns v livestock marketing association 2 the supreme court upheld the checkoff program on government speech grounds legal theory not addressed by the supreme court in the earlier checkoff cases this ruling is likely to have farreaching effects for checkoff programs for example it has alr eady been used to vacate the

checkoff programs congress has provided for the generic pr omotion of farm products since the 1930s3 these programs commonly known as checkoff programs are requested administered and funded by th industries themselves and in part operate under promotion and res earch orders or agreements issued by the secretary of agriculture general oversight of these programs is provided by the us department of agricultures usda agricultural marketing service however there is still some debate as to actually how much control and responsibility the usda has over the checkoff programs farm produc t checkoff programs are designed to strengthen the position of each respective commodity in the marketplace by increasing domestic demand and consumpti on and by expanding foreign markets typically the statutory language aut horizing checkoff program calls on the secretary of agriculture to appoint board eg national dairy promotion and research board council eg mushroom council or othe r type of representative body based on nominations made by the producers to pursue the statutes goals to fund the programs the authorizing statutes and orders call on th board or council to collect an assessment based on the amount of product that covered party sells produces or imports the collected funds may finance variety of programs including advertising consumer education nutr ition production marketing research and new product and foreign ma rket development in some cases large percentages of the collected funds are used to impleme nt generic promotions and advertisements4 the secretary of agriculture must approve each promotional project or plan before it can be implemented5 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32957crs3 6 for more information on the first amendment see crs report

asked to determine the constitutionality of state regulation that banned all promotional adve rtising as way to in part conserve energy in holding that the restriction was not constituti onal the court articulated the test described in the text and concluded that the regulation wa s more extensive than necessary to serve the state interest violati on of prong four the first amendment the first amendment to the constitution provides that congress shall make law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press6 in general the first amendment prohibits the government from regulating private speech based on its content and may prevent the government from compelling individuals to express certain views7 or to pay subsidies for speech to which they object8 however the right to speak or refrain from speaking is not absolute courts for example look at the context and purpose of the speech and allow greater government regulation for some types of speech than others in considering challenges to checkoff programs courts have generally looked to the co mmercial speech comp elled speech and government speech doctrines that have been developed under first amendment jurisprudence commercial speech commercial speech is speech that proposes commercial transaction9 or relates solely to the economic interests of the speaker and its audience10 the government may regulate commercial speech even truthful expressions more than it may regulate fu lly protected speech and it also may ban false or misleading commercial speech or advertisements that promote an illegal product courts typically use fourprong test th at was articulated by the supreme court in central hudson gas electric corp v public service commission of new york to determine whether governmental regulation of commercial speech is constitutional11 the central hudson test asks 1 whether the commercial speech at issue is protected by the first amendment that is whether it concerns lawful activity and is not misleading and 2 whether the asserted governmental interest in restricting it is substantial if both i nquiries yield positive answers then to be constitutional the restriction must 3 directly advance the governmental interest asserted and 4 be not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest12 determining whether the speech in question is commercial speech is important because it allows court to apply the more flexible intermediate scrutiny test ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32957crs4 13 431 us 209 1977 14 496 us 1 1990 15 abood 431 us at 235236 16 keller 496 us at 1314 thus the members had valid constitutional objection to their dues being spent for activities connected with disciplining members of the bar or proposing ethical codes for the profession becau such activities were germane to the bars goals however compulsory dues could not be expended to endorse or advance gun control or nuclear weapons freeze because they were activities not germane to the goals set out by the california bar 17 justice stevens suggested in his concurring opinion in united states v united foods 533 us 405 417418 2001 that cases such as keller and abood involving compelled payment of money may be viewed as the compelled subsidy subset of the compelled speech cases central hudson as discussed below courts have often struggled with placing checkoff programs solely within the parameters of commercial speech compelled speech the first amendment has been interpreted to prevent the government from compelling individuals to express certain views or to pay subsidies for certain speech to which they object agricultural checkoff cases have traditionally been analyzed within this category or some modification of it initially courts looked to th supreme court cases of abood v detroit board of education13 and keller v state bar of california14 when analyzing checkoff programs under the principles of co mpelled speech or subsidies in abood non union employees objected to paying service fee equal to union dues because the fees subsidized economic political professional scientific and religious activities not related to the unions collective bargai ning agreement the supreme court held that the union could constitutionally finance ideological activities that were not germane to the unions collective bargaining but only with funds provided by non objecting employees15 since collective bargaining was the authorized purpose of the union and the unions political activities were not germane to that purpose according to the court employees who disagreed with the political activities could not be compelled to support them similarly in keller the supreme court held that the state bar of california could constitutiona lly fund activities germane to its goals of regulating the legal profession out of the mandatory dues of all members but could not use compulsory dues for activities of an ideological nature that fell outside of activities germane to the bars goals16 from these two cases courts have fashioned germaneness test for compelled speech or more particularly compelled subsidy cases17 under this test courts are called on to draw line between those activities that are germane to broader and legitimate government purpose and those that are not test both the abood and keller courts acknowledged woul d be difficult to apply government speech

government enlists private entities to c onvey its own message18 so long as the government bases its actions on legitimate goals the government may speak despite citizen disagreement with the content of the message indeed the government with some exceptions pertai ning to religion may deliver content oriented message when the government speaks for instance to promote its own policies or to advance par ticular idea it is in the nd accountable to the electorate and the political process for its advocacy if the citizenry objects newly elected officials later could espouse some different or contrary position 19 in analyzing whether the government speech doctrine applies courts typically consider the governments responsibility for and control over the speech in question the more control the govern ment exerts the more likely it will be determined to be the speaker although th ere seems to be some debate as to the scope of the government speech doctrine20 its effect is still broad in that it can provide immunity to first amendment scrutiny checkoff case law over the years number of partie s assessed under checkoff programs have claimed that the mandatory assessments are unconstitutional restraints on their right to free speech generally opponents argue th at they should not be required to pay for advertisements with which they disagree for example in challenge against the dairy checkoff program the claimants were traditional dairy farmers that did not use the genetically engineered and controversial recombinant bovine growth hormone consequently they objected to subsidizing generic advertisements that they felt conveyed message that milk is fungible product that bears distinction based on where and how it is produced21 these types of challenges were most often successful under compelled speech analysis even though the cases varied in their analysis of germaneness and their attention to whether government speech approach might be more appropriate the supreme courts recent expansive view of what can constitute government sp eech however has put the entire line of earlier case law in question early supreme court cases california tree

the lower court to rely on central hudson for the purpose of testing the constitutionality of market order assessments for promotional advertising 27 id at 474 orders including generic advertising22 the marketing order at issue was derived from the agricultural marketing agr eement act of 1937 7 usc 601 et seq and provides regulatory guidelines and restraints on its participants including quality and quantity controls uniform price measures and grade and size standards ultimately the supreme court determined that the marketing orders were species of economic regulation and upheld the constitutionality of the assessments imposed on the fruit growers to cover the costs of generic advertising the supreme court began its analysis by describing the regulatory guidelines and restraints that the marketing orde r posed on the industry as whole and concluded that they fostered policy of collective rather than competitive marketing23 the court then distinguished the regulatory scheme at issue from laws that had previously been found suspect under the first amendment by determining that the orders 1 posed restraint on the freedom of any producer to communicate any message to any audience 2 did not compel any person to engage in any actual or symbolic speech and 3 did not compel the producers to endorse or to finance any political or ideological views24 next the court determined that the standards established in compelled speech case w favored finding of constitutionality because 1 the generic advertising was unquestionably germane to the purposes of the marketing orders and 2 the assessm ents were not used to fund political or ideological activities25 the glickman court further dismissed the argument that the compelled assessments required the level of scrutiny usually applied in commercial speech cases because this level was incons istent with the very nature and purpose of the collective action of marketing orders at issue26 based on these findings and the general cooperative nature of the regulatory scheme the court found that the assessments imposed did not raise first amendment concerns the court determined that the respondents criticisms of generic advertising provided basis for concl uding that factually accurate advertising constitutes an abridgment of anybodys right to speak freely27 the supreme court concluded by stating that the marketing orders in question were species ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32957crs7 28 id at 477 29 533 us 405 2001 30 id at 411 31 id at 411412 the court further noted that beyond the collection and disbursement of advertising funds there are marketing orders that regulate how mushrooms may be produced and sold exemption from the antitr ust laws and nothing preventing individual producers from making their own marketing decisions 32 id at 413economic regulation that should enjoy the sa strong presumption of validity that we accord to other policy judgements made by congress28 mushroom checkoff program in 2001 the supreme court revisited the issue of compelled marketing assessments for generic advertisements in united states v united foods inc29 in united foods the court was faced with determining whether the mandatory assessments for th mushroom checkoff program established pursuant to the mushroom promotion res earch and consumer information act of 1990 7 usc 6101 et seq violated the first ame ndment the supreme court concluded that the program authorized by the mushroom promotion act differed fundamentally from the market ing orders at issue under glickman and found the program unconstitutional the court started its analysis by declaring that it was not going to view the case in light of commercial speech jurisprudence because the government never raised the issue however the court determined that first amendment issues arose because of the requirement that producers subsidize speech with which they disagree30 accordingly the court began its examination by viewing the entire regulatoryprogram at issue and comparing it with the scheme under scrutiny in glickman the court determined that the features of the marketing sche found important in glickman were not present in the case before it for example the court concluded that in glickman the mandated assessments for sp eech were ancillary to more comprehensive program restricting market autonomy and that under the mushroom checkoff the advertising itself far from being ancillary is the principal object of the regulatory scheme 31 by underscoring these diffe rences the court moved away from the precedent established by glickman the court next turned to the compe lled speech arguments before it and found that the mandated support is contrary to the first amendment principles set forth in cases involving expression by groups which include persons who object to the speech but who nevertheless must re main members of the group by law or necessity32 in so holding the united foods court found that the compelled speech in the mushroom checkoff program was not germane to purpose related to an association independent from the speech itself the only purpose the compelled contributions served according to the cour t was the advertising scheme for the mushroom checkoff program which was not like the broader cooperative marketinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32957crs8 33 id

majority of the court in glickman 33 accordingly the court struck down the mandatory assessmen ts used to fund generic advertisements imposed by the mushroom checkoff progra m the government also attempted to assert government speech arguments however the court refused to hear such substantive claims because they had not been raised at the lower levels34 since this decision the mushroom c ouncil which administers the checkoff program under usda supervision voted to reduce the mandatory assessments and divert their revenue to non promotional activities such as research into mushrooms health and nutriti onal attributes federal circuit cases after united foods since united foods there have been challenges to the constitutionality of the beef dairy and pork checkoff programs th challenges were all successful at the appellate level35 in each case the appellate courts rejected the governments argument that the checkoff programs we re government speech immune from first amendment scrutiny generally the cour ts found that the government exerted insufficient control and responsibility ove r the checkoff programs to support the applicability of the government speech doctr ine after declarin g that the checkoff cases presented private speech the courts typically compared the checkoff program at issue with those presented in glickman and united foods all three circuit courts found the checkoff programs in question more akin to the teachings and holdings of united foods and thus unconstitutional in so holding each court appeared to struggle with placing the checkoff programs within the commercial speech compelled speech rubric all three appellate decisions were appealed to the supreme court the court however heard arguments only in livestock marketing assn v dept of agriculture where the eighth circuit had ruled that th beef checkoff program authorized under the beef promotion and resear ch act of 1985 7 usc 2901 et seq and its implementing

vacated the judgment by the eighth circuit and remanded the case to the appellate court for further proceedings consistent with its decision39 the court began its analysis by declar ing that it has upheld first amendment challenges in cases involving compelled speech and compelled subsidy but had never considered the first amendment consequences of g overnmentcompelled subsidy of the governments own speech40 in all the cases invalidating requirements to subsidize speech the court stated the speech was or was presumed to be that of an entity other than the government itself41 the court added quoting an earlier supreme court case that the government as general rule may support valid programs and po licies by taxes or other ex actions binding on protesting parties42 after recognizing these principles the court observed that it has generally assumed but not s quarely held that compe lled funding of government speech does not alone raise first amendment concerns43 the court next rejected re spondents argument that the beef checkoff program was not government speech and instea d found the promotional campaigns to be effectively controlled by the federal government itself and from beginning to end the message established by the federal government44 the court seemed to come to these conclusions primarily because 1 congress and the secretary set out

attend and participate in the open meetings at which proposals are developed45 noting the overall degree of governmental control over the checkoff messages the cour t stated that the government is not precluded from relying on the governmentspeech doctrine merely because it solicits assistance from nongovernmental sources in developing specific messages46 the court also dismissed the respondent s argument that the beef checkoff program needed to be funded by general re venues rather than targeted assessments to qualify as government speech in so concluding the court pointed out that the respondents have right under the firs t amendment not to fund government speech irrespective of where the money comes from ie broadbased taxes or targeted assessments47 in addition the court concluded that the beef checkoff program provides political safeguards that are more than adequate to ensure that the message is kept apart from private interests48 finally the court rejected respondents argument that they were unc onstitutionally forced to endorse message with which they disagreed because the promotions used the tagline americas beef producers the court stated that ch an argument involved compelled speech rather than compelled subsidy 49 the court suggested in dictum nonetheless that compelled speech cause of action might lie if party could show that an objectionable beef advertisement was attributable to it that is even if statute is constitutional on its face party may show that the government has applied it in an unconstitutional manner justices souter stevens and kennedy dissented from the majority opinion the dissent argues that the ge neric beef advertisements should not qualify for treatment as speech by the government mainly because the statute does not require the government to indicate that it is the sponsor of the message50 if the government wishes to rely on the government speech doctrine to compel specific groups to fund speech with targeted taxes the dissent states it must make itself politically accountable by indicating that the content actually is government message 51 because the government speech doctrine is not applicable the dissent noted the case should have been decided in line with united foods httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32957crs11 52 rod smith feedstuffs what they said about the ruling vol 77 22 at 5 may 30 2005 citing prof lawrence tr ibe who argued the case before the supreme court for respondents professor tribe point ed out that justice breyer and to certain extent justice ginsburg according to their concurring opi nions were more inclined to view the assessments as form of economic regulation rather than government speech 53 johanns 544 us 550 571 souter j dissenting both the majority and the dissent recognized that the beef checkoff program wa s virtually identical to the mushroom check off program the majority however seemed to sidestep the holding from united foods by deciding the case on government speech grounds 54 the exact procedure that may be used to reevaluate past decisions will depend in large part on the relief granted or order issued by the court and the overall status of the case parties for example might ask court to relieve them from final judgement under rule 60 of the federal rules of civil procedure which allows such motion to be made for any reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment possible implications of johanns v livestock marketing association the supreme courts decision to uphol d the beef checkoff program on the government speech doctrine is likely to have farreaching implications for check off programs johanns in general appears to have fortified the constitutionality of checkoff programs and has likely enhanced the ability of congress to provide similar promotional support for more agricultural products accordingly this ruling will undoubtedly be used to defend other ch eckoff programs from first amendment challenges to reevaluate those already decided and to inform future legislation creating or amending checkoff programs this opinion will probably clear up much of the confusion that the glickman united foods dichotomy established by classi fying the beef checkoff program as type of government speech the court has now made it possi ble for lower courts to avoid 1 placing checkoff program w ithin or 2 applying test from the commercial speech compelled speech line of cases task many lower courts struggled with on the other hand attorney s for the respondent claim that with five different opinions from the court ie majo rity three concurrences dissent there are as many questions left open as there were answers52 moreover the extent to which united foods is as the dissent points out d ead letter is unclear since the ruling did not expressly overrule it53 these observations notwithstanding the decision establishes precedent by whic h checkoff programs may be immune from first amendment scrutiny the johanns ruling put into question many of the earlier checkoff appellate court decisions54 indeed the supreme court has already vacated the appellate court decisions that invalidated the federal dairy and pork checkoff programs and has remanded each case including the beef ch eckoff case for reconsideration in light of the decision if it can be shown that th cases are analogous to the beef check off program it appears that court w ould now likely find these checkoff programs constitutional government sp eech this finding seems probable since the programs are authorized and administered much in the same fashion and were all declared almost identical to the mushroom checkoff program in united foods httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32957crs12 55 412 f3d 1017 9th cir 2005

concerns raised by th parties or noted by the courts58 congress for instance might consider exempting certain categories of producers who disagree with generic advertising from paying ma ndatory assessments under commodity promotion law similar to the exemption th at congress established in the 2002 farm bill for persons that produce and ma rket solely 100 organic products59 congress might also seek to further define or expand current provisions in commodity promotion laws that already require c ouncils and projects to take into account similarities and differences between certain products and producers60 congress may also wish to reexamine its position on requiring the advertisements to show that they are in fact speech by the government since this was major criticism in the dissent nd all circuit courts found insufficient governmental control cl ear indication of who is the speaker may be important as mentioned by justice ginsburg in her concurring opinion and some experts to reconcile the message in checkoff programs with other speech that is overtlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32957crs13 61 johanns 544 us 550 570 ginsburg j concurring see also parke wilde federal

guidelines and checkoff programs at 34 63 id at 2735 64 bernard supra note 58sponsored by the government particularly the nutritional and dietary guidelines eg food pyramid61 the most recent federal dietary guidelines for example encourage greater consumption of fruits ve getables whole grains and lowfat dairy within balanced lowercalorie intake diet while checkoff programs generally encourage more consumption of both wfat and highfat beef pork and dairy products62 these apparent incons istencies it has been argued might undermine one or both federal government messages and could lead to consumer confusion63 some also speculate given the courts acceptance of the government speech argument that the ruling will prompt the usda to exert greater effort in supervising checkoffs and addressing the concer ns of some of the opposing parties64 with respect to programs that are still operating many may continue operating as usual others that have modified their practices such as the mushroom checkoff program may look to return to the status quo pre united foods and impose mandatory assessments for generic promotion campaigns overall the ruling is expected to call more attention to the opera tion of checkoff programs
