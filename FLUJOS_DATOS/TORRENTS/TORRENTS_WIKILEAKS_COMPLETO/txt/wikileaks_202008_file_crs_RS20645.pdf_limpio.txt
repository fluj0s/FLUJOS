annual change in debt he ld by government accounts is not affected by the governments overall surp lus or deficit it is determined by law and government accounting practices this report will be updated as events warrant the continuing increase in total or gross federal debt in the face of budget surpluses during the 1998 through 2001 period produ ces an apparent budget paradox1 if deficits appear to make federal debt increase as happened conti nuously over the previous three decades why did the surpluses during those four years not make the debt fall the answer to the question and the resolution of th apparent paradox is that the governments total surplus or deficit affects only the part of total federal debt that is held by the public deficit requires the government to borrow money from the public increasing the amount of debt held by the public surplus allows the government to repay the public reducing the amount of debt held by the pub lic the size of the remaining portion of federal debt the portion held by government accounts is determined by law and the accounting practices of the government and is not affected by the governments overall surplus or deficit the governments surpluses over fiscal years 1998 through 2001 reduced federal debt held by the public by 4528 billion2 in the four years prior to the surpluses 1994httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20645crs2 2

table 6 oct 25 2002 surpluses or deficits and debt held by the public the governments deficit or surplus is the difference between the governments income receipts and the governments spending outlays generally receipts and outlays closely approximate the amount of mone ie cash that the government collects from and spends on the public4 as currently defined deficit exists when total outlays are greater than receipts surplus exists when receipts are greater than outlays when the government is in deficit it borrows money from the public by selling treasury issued debt bills notes bonds th rough the financial markets to the publichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20645crs4 5 congress and the president had also undertake n as they did through much of the 1980s and most of the 1990s policy changes that over time we re designed to reduce or eliminate the deficit 6 the treasury could also build large cash balances in its general accounts but such action makes little sense 7 by actively entering the market to repurchase government debt the treasury is better able to maintain its debt management objectives incl uding maintaining desired balance in the maturities of outstanding debt and market liquidity see crs report rs20302 paying down the federal debt discussion of methods by james m bickleythe additional cash acquired by borrowing is needed to pay for the governments obligations that exceed its receipts borrowing because of the deficits leads to increases in federal debt he ld by the public in theory the government could avoid an expected deficit and eliminate the need to borrow from the public by reducing spending or increasing revenues in practice at least in the shortterm making the rapid substantial changes that may be needed to increase receipts or reduce outlays to void an expected deficit is ex tremely difficult the reality as shown by the governments actions over th last 30 years has been an ongoing effort to solve the budget imbalance problem while continuing to raise the needed cash by selling government debt to the public the many efforts to reduce outlays or increase receipts were never sufficient within short periods of time to eliminate the deficits5 surpluses reduce the accumulated debt held by the public with more cash coming in than it needs to pay its bills the governme nt can through fairly automatic byproduct of normal treasury debt fina ncing shrink the outstanding debt held by the public6 in times of surplus the treasury will automatically use available cash to pay holders of maturing debt rather than pay them with cash raised by issuing new or replacement debt common practice when the governments budget is in deficit th process of reducing the debt works in slightly distorted mirror image of what the treasury does when the government increases its debt when it has ficit instead of offering debt to the financial markets to acquire needed cash as it does when the government has deficit the government now has the cash from receipts with which to acquire existing federal debt the treasury can remain relatively passive and reduce the debt by waiting for it to mature and use its available surplus cash to pay debt holders or it can as it has done over the last several years repurchase debt directly from the financial markets7 the treasury takes these actions as part of its normal debt ma nagement activities without the need for specific instructions from congress or the president as when it has deficits the government could through actions by congress and the president attempt to eliminate the surplus by increasing spending or decreasing taxes but as with eliminating deficits making the legislative adjustments in spending and receipts needed to eliminate the surplus assu ming that objective was desired in short period of time would likely prove difficult given sufficient time surpluses like deficits can be changed through legislative actions future changes in federal debt the events in the fall of 2001 along with policy changes adopted both before and after the september 11 terrorist attacks changed the budgetar expectations for the nexthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20645crs5 several years projections of large and gr owing budget surpluses have been replaced with expectations of deficits at least for the next several fiscal years if not longer this change in outlook will lead to increases in fe deral debt held by th public because of the expected deficits and as previously assumed continuing increases in debt held by government accounts the result even if the expected deficits are relatively small will be accelerated increases in total federal debt
