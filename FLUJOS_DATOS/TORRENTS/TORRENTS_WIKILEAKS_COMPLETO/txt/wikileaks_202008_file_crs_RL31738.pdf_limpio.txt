fy2002 department of transportation appropriations act pl 10787 the act set 22 safetyrelate d preconditions for opening the border to longhaul mexican trucks on november 27 2002 the secretary of transportation announced that all the preconditions had been met and directed the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa to act on the mexican applications however on ja nuary 16 2003 the ninth circuit court of appeals in public citizen v department of transportation delayed implementation pending completion of environmental impact statements and clean air act conformity determination on the fmcsas implementing regulations on june 7 2004 the us supreme court in unanimous decision reversed the decision of the 9th circuit court when the regulations are ultimately implemented the short term impact of implementation is expected to be gradual as mexican firms deal with number of stumbling blocks including lack of prea rranged back hauls higher insurance and capital costs as well as costly border pro cessing delays in the long run mexican drivers and trucks will continue to dominate the crossings at the border but the pattern of operation will change the use of drayage companies whose trucks shuttle loads back and forth across the border is likely to decline as they lose part of their market share to mexican longhaul carriers the most common trips for these carriers will probably be from the mexican interior to warehouse facilities on the us side of the border or to nearby citie s in the border states operating beyond the border states at profit would almost always require an arranged backhaul in contrast relatively few us firms are expected to apply for operating authority in mexico most are expected to operate thr ough their mexican subsidiaries or

nullification and impairment to take possible actions under nafta dispute settlement so that if the us requirements are found to be inconsistent w ith the nafta the process established under article 2019 suspension of benefits could be considered in response to the mexican complaints of discriminatory treatment the bu sh administration ordered that the rules for us and canadian new entrant motor carriers be rewritten as of january 1 2003 new entrant us and canadian carriers must pass an audit similar to that required of mexican companies during an 18 month provisional aut hority period see us federal register v 67 92 may 13 2002 p 3197831986 the main substantive difference in treatment now is the requirement that 50 of mexican companies must pass the onsite audit prior to issuance of provisional authority 10 mexican embassy spokesperson said to th best of her knowledge us trucking firms have attempted to apply for operating au thority in mexico an fmcsa official said in february 2003 that the agency was getting calls nearly on daily basis from us carriers asking how to apply for authority to operate in mexico fmcsa refers these requesters to the mexican ministry of communication and transportation 11 one interesting possibility which might or might not pass judicial review would be for fmcsa to provide for safety examinations on the us side of the border of 50 of the applicants that have passed their paper revi ew and to suspend the remaining 50 of the applications until the protocols for onsite safe ty examinations in mexico are agreed to such an action by fmcsa woul d however be controversialcarriers especially the prospect of competing with us trucks for the maquiladora trade and resentment of some of th new regulationsparticularly the onsite inspection and english lang uage requirementshas motiv ated the mexican trucking association canacar to pressure presid ent vincente fox to ban us domiciled trucking firms from operating in mexic in addition mexicos secretary of communication and transportation has reporte dly argued that some of the conditions set forth by the us for allowing mexican trucks to operate throughout the united states are discriminatory and has r ecommended that mexico keep open all its options under nafta including the possible banning of us trucks9 as mentioned earlier the mexican government as of this writing has not set forth its procedures to pro cess applications by us firms to operate in mexico10 mexico has also yet to agree to prot ocols under which fmcsa officials would complete the onsite safety reviews that are required before mexican trucking firms can be awarded provisional authority to operate beyond the border zones in the united states11 if either of these situations continues or if mexico adopts retaliatory policy of banning u s trucks us response c ould be either to put hold on awards of operating authority to mexican trucking firms or to eliminate those already granted another possibility would be to file complaint against mexico under nafta assuming however that both the us and mexico will implement naftas trucking provisions any scenarios will be influenced by the scope of and characteristics of crossborder commercial trucki ng operationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31738crs5 12 the us customs service does not track outgoing truck movements as carefully as incoming crossings but it can be assumed that total truck crossings are roughly double the incoming crossings or about 9 million the estimate of 80000 trucks was based on 1999 data figure 1 incoming truck

nafta trucks carry roughly 80 of the cargo by value across the border and trends in crossborder truck movements track closely with trends in mexicous trade under nafta the value of trade between the two nations crossing the bor der by truck increased from 74 billion in 1994 to 171 billion in 2000 in the year 2000 over 45 million truck crossings were made from mexico into the united st ates by roughly 80000 trucks 63000 of mexican registry12 the impact of the 2001 recession is evident in figure 1 as total trade with mexico by truck fell to 160 billion and incoming truck movements dropped to

procedures and inspections which can vary greatly but typically include the following steps13 mexicous crossings traditional crossborder shipping by truck from the interior of mexico to the interior of the us can involve over 20 separate steps these steps are described in some detail because one of the envisioned benefits of nafta implementation is that it will enc ourage the streamlining of cross border truck movements in simplified form the movement of truck cargo for import into the us is as follows the mexican carrier picks up the shipment prepares the bill oflading and hauls the ship ment to the border region at poes where allowed us customs brokers may maintain small offices where they may prepare us entry documents and file them electronically the entry must be accompanied by evidence that sufficient bond is posted with us customs to cover any potential duties taxes or penalties mexican broker prepares mexican export pedimentos paperform similar to us export declarations after inspecting the vehicles cargo mexican validator files the pedimento electronically into themexican customs broker associa tion database and validated pedimento is created to release the shipment to mexican customs mexican duties are paid drayage vehicle shorthaul truck used to shuttle truck trailers back and forth across the border picks up the load and hauls it to the mexican customs facility at the mexican customs facility the export pedimentos are checkedagainst the electronic forms and then about 2 of the trucks are pulled aside for closer inspection by mexican customs agents the truck crosses the border payi ng bridge tolls if required and enters the us customs primary inspection station at the primary inspection station the us customs inspectordetermines citizenship of the driver and any passengers and then questions the driver for declara tions of any agricultural goods narcotics merchandise or cu rrency in excess of 10000 once the agent verifies the paperwork and computer information the vehicle is either sent on to the final us customs checkpoint or is selected for secondary inspection all hazar dous materials loads are inspected and most agricultural food pr oduct pharmaceutical and medical equipment shipments are sent to the agricultural inspection docks where the department of agricu lture inspectors and the food andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31738crs8 drug administration inspectors inspect the goods it is at the primary inspection station or in the queue that k9 units patrol around the vehicles and if the dog reacts to truck the vehicle will be

facilities usually take place out side the final check point drayage company delivers the shipment to us broker carrier or freight forwarders facility us driver picks up the load for delivery to the interior usmexico crossings traditional crossborder truck shipping from the interior of the united states to the interior of mexico may also involve many separate processing steps truck move ments and inspections simplified sequence of steps that are supposed to take place for the m ovement of cargo by truck for import into mexico is as follows us exporter prepares bill of lading and certificate of origin for load the us carrier picks up the shipment and hauls it to the carriersterminal broker or freight forwarders facility in some cases the forewarder is bypassed and the exporter deals directly with mexican customs broker the us freight forwarderbroke r fills out the shippers export declaration and verifies the load the us broker is liable for the accuracy of the form the mexican customs broker fills out the mexican importpedimentos facilitates the payment of duties and verifies the load the mexican broker is legally responsible and liable for the contents of shipments across th border the broker makes sure that the required prepayment of mexican duties taxes or fees has been made at the banking module the pedimentos are submitted electronically to mexican customs generally the mexican broker then arranges for mexicandrayage company to provide truc k or truck tractor to haul the shipment across the border ma quiladoras however may use their own trucks at us customs export loads requiring inspection most oftenfirearms computers specialized electronic equipment and hazardous materials are inspected and registered with us customs load is hauled across the border at

inspectionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31738crs9 14 ibid p 46 15 traditional trade is defined in the binational study as nonmaquiladora nonagricultural or nonhazardous materials tradeat the final check point all the pa perwork is collected and the truck may leave the import compound the shipment is taken to either the mexican brokers facility or to atruck corral where the drayage tractor is disconnected and the trailer is stored until longhaul carriers tractor arrives to transport the shipment to the mexican interior the maquiladora exception maquiladora or maquila is manufacturing plant located in mexico usually near the us border under foreign ownership that typically has sister plant on the us side of the border supplying parts to be assembled at the mexican plant that are then shipped back to the us shipments to and from maquiladora facilities benefit from systems established by both us and mexican customs to speed the processing of maquiladora shipments these changes eliminate both the us and mexican broker processing time in effect most maquiladora cargo is precleared for cro ssing some maquila dora trucks however are selected for inspection as mentione d earlier maquiladoras may also use their own trucks and thereby eliminate any delays waiting for drayage operator pick up basically this means that unless they are selected for regulatory inspection or are caught in traffic congestion most trucks operating in the maquiladora trade may cross the border with virtually delay 14 hazardous materials and agricultural trade the movement of hazardous materials is governed by strict er regulation advance notice is required by both us and mexican customs prior to moving hazardous material over the border the authenticity of the licenses of all drivers whose tr ucks carry hazardous materials must be checked under nafta any byproducts from the use of hazardous materials must be returned to the country of origin for proper disposal this rule has increased the movement of hazardous wastes across the border agricultural trade has some characteristics of traditional trade but may be pre cleared as in the maquiladora trade15 it is also subject to special inspection requirements for example inspection fo r pest infestation varies depending on whether the agricultural product is consider ed high or low risk low risk products are often precleared and only one load in twenty may be randomly inspected high pestrisk loads may all be inspected and receive pest control treatment the borders distinctive inst itutions drayage and mexican customs brokers the predominant use of drayage for cro ss border hauling of freight and the role of the mexican customs broker are distinctive institutional characteristics of the mexicous borderhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31738crs10 16 based on us bureau of transportation sta tistics data some believe the us customs administration data that the bts sta tistics are based on undercounts the number of canadian border empty crossings however ev using other sources the mexican rate is twice the canadian rate 17 giermanski james r fresh look at nafta whats really happened logistics

exception of trucks serving the maquiladora trade truck car go crosses the mexican border under drayage system under this system truck cargo is delivered to the border where drayage company provides truck that pi cks up the load on one side of the border crosses the border and drops it off to be picked up by long haul domestic carrier in the destination country the predominan ce of this characteristic of the mexico us border of commercial cr oss border traffic leads to an unusually large percentage of deadhead and bobtail crossings dea dhead crossing is any truck crossing with an empty trailer and bobtail crossing is tr uck tractor crossing without trailer in 2002 43 of the truck trailers that ente red the us from mexico were empty compared to 15 from canada16 this peculiarity of the mexican border traffic has two important results that are signif icant to any discussion of postnafta implementation scenarios first drayage is big business for the mexican trucking firms in the border region and second dea dheader and bobtail crossings are major component of the traffic congestion that impedes the cross border flow of freight despite the arguments that fully implementing nafta and thereby allowing mexican and us trucks to pick up and dr op off international loads anywhere in each others territory will lead to major reduction in the use of drayage services across the mexicous border there are reasons to expect that the drayage system will not contract quickly or as much as some ve argued although on its face drayage would seem to be inefficient and costly given extensive processing inspection and traffic delays drayage actually makes more economic sense to some motor carriers than having their equipment held up for day or more awaiting crossing reportedly drayage adds roughly 100 to each cross border shipment17 although the overall aggregate cost that the drayage system adds to cross border trade is staggering for many carriers 100 is much less than carrier would lose if it s truck and driver idle for day or more awaiting clearance even efficient traditional shippers can expect paperwork delays of 4 to 5 hours second not only is drayage big business for mexican carriers based in the border regi on but it is also major formative factor in the border region economy of warehouses truck corrals nd related service industries local interests may support th status quo for fear that the demise of drayage would lead to job losses in the mexican border towns and in some us border towns from fear of being bypassed18 third drayage companies often have operating agreements with mexican custom s brokers who often have financial interest some argue that this provides strong incentive for the brokers to keep the processing times long enough to keep drayed freight competitive with single vehicle cross border trucking although most observers expect nafta implementation would probably reduce the number of dea dhead and bobtail crossings over time few expect that they will fall to the level experienced on the canadian borderhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31738crs11 19 binational study task 31 p 36 20 whitten daniel l mexican freight handlers warily eye us competition carriers brokers seek to protect paperworkprepara tion fee longtime ties to shippers transport topics june 3 2002 13descriptions of the drayage system ar often oversimplified truck dedicated to drayage can cross the border roughly two to four times each day or up to 1000 times year however the 80000 trucks i nvolved in crossborder trucking averaged only 50 crossing per year this indicates that trucks used for drayage may also be used for domestic carriage following nafta implementation these trucks may continue to provide drayage services it is also likely that more of these trucks will operate more deeply either legally or illegally in the border states some believe however that in the postimplementation nvironment the risk of getting caught will be much higher than before mexican customs brokers the degree of control that the mexican customs broker has on the cross border m ovement of cargo could have major implications for the scope and speed of impact of the implementation of naftas trucking provisions customs brokers are businesses or individua ls that assist in preparing the required documentation for the cross border movement of goods mexican customs brokers are active on both sides of the border processing the paperwork and verifying the shipped goods for both us exports to mexico and mexican exports to the us whereas in the united states broker or freight forwarder is only liable for the accuracy of the form in mexico the broker is liable for the accuracy of the paperwork and the content of the shipment because of this mexican brokers generally act ually take look at the cargo this along with the paperwork process adds significant am ount of processing time to cross border shipments the binational border planning and programming study found that for frequent south bound shippers the preparati on of paperwork by the mexican broker took 4 to 5 hours and for infrequent shippe rs up to three days northbound into the us the mexican broker processing time was 4 to 5 hours if anything is wrong with the paperwork used to compile the mexican pedimentos it takes longer the study found that the minimum total crossing time south bound was just over 8 hours and northbound was just over six hours19 thus under the best of conditions ie minimum mexican broker processing time traffic delays narcotics inspection or customs secondary inspections etc the mexican brokers role was responsible for nearly half the crossing time southbound and nearly twothirds northbound mexican broker processing time could therefore be sufficient to deter some carriers from engaging in cross border carriage of cargo as mentioned earlier mexican brokers are often affiliated with drayage companies and most observers believe that they will resist changes that could reduce the attractiveness of cross border drayage some believe that the confluence of interest between these two institutions is so powerful that drayage will dominate the movement of cargo across the border for the next 15 to 20 years20 this is powerful alliance for the status quo many feel that potential us entrants into cross border trucking will not be able to bypass the customs brokers which in effect will make them opt for an alternative to direct competition with mexican carriers many of the brokerage firms are familyrun firms that have been in the business for generationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31738crs12 21 karaim reed on both sides now the costly consequences of vigilance washington post march 10 2002 b3 see also gao nafta

border crossings and can be caused by wide variety of processing and inspection activities that occur in poes as well as traditional causes of traffic congestion such as infrastructure limitations excess traffic volume and vehicle breakdowns different poes ve differing levels of congestion and differing reasons for its occurrence most poe congestion occurs during certain peak periods usually mid af ternoon with the decline in cross border volume in 2001 traffic congestion has been less of an issue postseptember 11 security concerns on the other hand have at times increased delays for northbound traffic21 once economic growth picks up and traffic volumes increase the cost of traffic delays to longhaul trucking firms could make them less willing to commit their equipment to crossing the border and make it likely that drayage will retain significant share of cross border haulage case can be made however that for some operators the location of the next available load will have more

written or said about the likelihood of us domiciled trucking firms operating in mexico however the short term prospects for m exican longhaul trucking in the united states there are number of reasons that few mexican carriers are expected to operate beyond the commercia l zone in the short term the most immediate reason is the delay resulting from the ninth circuit court ruling implementation

federally regi stered mexican commercial trucks had been manufactured after 1994ol der trucks would have more difficulty meeting us safety standards and were not built to us emissions standards the english language requirement will limit the number of federallylicenced mexican truck drivers that can operate legally in the us mexican carriers have less access to financial resources and paymuch higher interest rates than us based companies in addition new trucks cost more in mexico than in the us 35 one unusual possibility is that some mexican carriers are concerned that some of their drivers may be tempted to abandon their trucks deep inside the us and seek work in the us the presence of more active safety and regulatory enforcementeffort in the postimplementation environment will discourage some longhaul mexican motor carriers from entering the united states mexican carriers on the other hand do have some advantages that could eventually give them competitive edge in certain

short term prospects for us longhaul trucking in mexico the likelihood of significant numbers of us trucking firms directly providing long haul international trucking services deep into mexico is very

applications for operating authority some us firms will apply but the number is expected to be small th 10 us trucking firms contacted by crs all stated that they had plans to use thei r usbased

trucking service providers who are interested in operating in mexico 39 see delgado et 40 some us firms headquartered in the border region with their lower than the us average driver wages and spanish speaking workforce may try to send their drivers and trucks into mexico but are not expected to gain much of market share it is likely that once the mexican government begins accepting pplications some us firms will apply for operating authority simply for the flexibility of being able to send some of their drivers and continuedaccepting applications from us carriers for operating authority in mexico there is great deal of uncertainty as to how soon nafta implementation will take place in meaningful way on the mexican side of the border the short term outlook gradualism will probably be the predominant characteristic for at least the first couple of years of nafta implementation it could be 2005 before mexico agrees to rms for the onsite inspections of mexican carriers required under us law once this occurs mexican firms that are certified to operate beyond the commercial zone w ill likely begin testing the waters for deliveries to destinations clos enough to the border that allow them to have at least prospect of breaking even without having prearranged backhaul where back hauls can be arranged mexican carriers will operate farther into the us but most observers expect the vast majority of truck loads will be to destinations in the border states as long as there are significant delays at the border however the majority of truck freight crossing the border into the us will continue to be brought in by drayage operators despite this short term gradualism the limited activity is important because it will be time of tes ting of different business patterns one feature of this period may be the evol ution of cooperative agreements between mexican and us haulers which could ve major impact in the longterm outlook for international trucking in the us and mexico39 the long term business structure and competition in the long run the outlook for interna tional trucking acro ss the border is less function of regulation than of business practices and th economics of international trucking within this context there are number of factors that will influence the shape and scope of nafta implementation most disc ussions of the likelihood or extent of mexican or us trucks entering the longhaul trucking market within each others borders focus on the difficulties that would be faced by mexican trucking firm going it alone in the us market or us firm going it alone in the mexican market only few brave companies on either side of the border are expected to provide direct trucking services deep in to the other country but many are expected to operate crossborder

mexican drivers to operate deep within the united states in the long term it is important to remember that the main factor in the growth of truck crossings has been the gr owth in trade which determines the amount of freight that must be moved across the border41 consequently it is doubtful that eventual implementation of the trucking provisions of nafta by itself will lead to major increase of the amount of freig ht shipped it will however have an impact on how and by whom the fre ight is moved across the border the crossborder business paradigm despite having been banned for many years from delivering cargo in each others countries beyond the border zones us and mexican trucking firms have offered seamless delivery throughout each others territory to their customers throug h working arrangements with counterparts across the border42 these arrangements are commonl referred to as partnerships but are generally interlining or interchang agreements interline

such an adjustment however might put downward pressure on the wages of us drivers vis àvis their mexican counterparts as mentioned earlier an area where mexican companies have expressed concern over possible direct competition with us carriers is in the provision of trucking services to the maquiladoras the location of their factories near the border and the expedited processing of maquiladora freight at the border might attract us competition especially from companie s headquartered near the border an alternate business pla n reportedly raised by some mexican carriers as possibility would

pounds ltl carriers specialize in sh ipments of quantity of freight too small ie less than 10000 pounds to get the tl rate and generally involve the use of terminals to break and or consolidate shipments46 nearly all carriers of cross border freight by truck as well as nearly all major mexican longhaul carriers are tl carriers this differs from the us ma rket where many trucking firms are ltl carriers some see ltl as market niche that us carriers could develop in mexico the low cost producer time and distance is money two of the basic precepts of making money in trucki ng are minimizing the time that trucks and drivers are idle and reducing the miles that empty trailers are hauled or tractors are driven without load for an independent mexican carrier operating in the us its significant cost advantage is limited to its lower driver costs its main disadvantages are the aforementioned probable lack of backhaul higher insurance rates increased inspection costs higher state registration fees and more expensive financing of its equipment over the long run the effect of these disadvantages will probably mitigate but w ill not go away entirely mexican firms that are closely affiliated with or are subsidiaries of major us firms will probably get help from their us partner or parent firm to assist them in reducing their nonlabor costs in either case the key to prof

differential vary substantially for federally licenced mexican truck driver engaged in international carriage of cargo to the us versus the cost of u s driver but they generally range from one third

getting information on costs can be difficult due to the proprietary nature of business information however using the costpermile estimate of 110 to 170 and the estimate that federally licenced mexican drivers earn one third to one half what us truckload drivers earn can provide rough estimate that the labor cost savings are lost in the first third of deadhead return near the border this does not mean great deal but the farther into the us mexican truck travels the more im portant backhaul or cabotage load becomes to the profitability of the operation 51 see cabotage rules for

overall truck operating expe nses reportedly ranging from 110 to 170 per mile the majority of the labor cost advantage is quickly lost on any job without revenue earning backhaul49 the labor cost benefit would pr obably be lost within the first third of return run to the border without backhaul load50 most observers believe that the border states will be the main zone of competition with only the mexican companies with connections for backhau l loads operating beyond the border states with any regularity cabotage legal and illegal one way mexican trucking firms could avoid hauling an empty trailer all the way back to mexico would be to use the tractor to pick up and make domestic us deliver on the way back to mexico in the language of the trucking industry ch domestic movements are referred to as cabotage nafta does not allow mexican tr ucks to engage in domestic trucking in the us or vice versa the us custom s administration has made an exception for canadian vehicles which may

of trucks to their base country cabotage is contentious side issue in nafta implementation regarding mexico opponents of imp lementation see the inc idental exception as an enormous loophole on the

mexican trucks has been declining and that the condition of mexican trucks correlate with the level of inspection at the border 55 the point where these companies interline or interchange with their mexican partners may move deeper into the us border statestrucking firms will lease their trucks and drivers to us partners or parent companies who might arrange for work visa for th leased driver and then provide both international trucking services as well as cabotage within the us53 the distinctive institutions as mentioned earlier there is common view that the mexican customs brokers and drayage companies will do what they can to maintain the status quo there are reasons to believe however that resistance is overstated to begin with it is not only th drayage operators that have developed working relationships with the mexican cu stoms brokers over the years but also the longhaul companies that will be providing single truck service to the us side of the border second reason is that in th long run mexican brokers profits are determined by the amount of freight they pr ocess this will eventually provide them with an incentive to work with the long haul carriers and also to streamline and automate their procedures although it is lik ely that the share of cargo hauled by the drayage operators will decline over the next ten years it is unlikely that drayage will decline to the 15 share drayed across the canadian border the quality of trucks used for drayage reportedly is improving in part because of the increased safety and environmental scrutiny they will face at the border54 as the drayage share declines some of these operators may change their business strategy and seek more business in local haulage in mexico and some will also probably tr operating beyond the border zones in the united states this is not to say that these institutions will not resist change but just that estimates that nothing will change for ten to fifteen years can probably be viewed as overly conservative should the two count ries economies grow more rapidly the resulting increase in trade will probably provide plenty of business for both long haul and for drayage operators the irony for the drayage companies is that the threat to their dominance of crossborder trucking is going to come from mexican longhaul carriers not from us trucks55 also regular shippers have model for

writing it has not issued th rules under which us firms can apply observers have menti oned several reasons for this s ituation the reason most often discussed in press accounts is mexican indignation over the us preconditions required under pl 10787 the mexican g overnment may be considering seeking compensation or the suspension of us trade benefits under nafta on grounds that the us preconditions discriminate against mexican trucking firms relative to us and canadian firms57 mexicos secretary of co mmunication and transportation reportedly has argued that some conditions set forth by the us for allowing mexican trucks to operate throughout the united states are discriminatory and hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31738crs25 58 fmcsa official in conv ersation of january 17 2003 59 authers john and sara silver mexico could retaliate over ban on trucks financial times jan 18 2003 p 9 the article quotes former trade minister louis calle mexico has retaliation rights under naftaif mexican trucks were prohibited then we should retaliate on products going beyond trucking but the pressure would be to retaliate in the trucking sector 60 fmcsa official in conv ersation of january 17 2003recommended that mexico should keep all of its nafta options open including possible retaliatory ban on u s trucks some have suggested that mexico should simply use the fmcsas regulations for mexican carriers applying to operate in the united states and apply them reciprocally for us carriers applying to operate in mexico58 the problem with this approach is that the mexican government does not have the well developed safety regulatory and compliance system for motor carriers that exists in the united states also gi ven that the number of us trucking firms dwarfs the number of mexican firms it is doubtful that mexico has the resources to regulate compliance potential question for congress is that if significant period of time goes by and us applications for operating authority are still not being accepted or if mexico impleme nts retaliatory ban on us trucking should the us put hold on awards of operating authority for mexican trucking companies andor eliminate those already granted anothe r possibility as mentioned above would be to make complaint against mexico under nafta on the other hand should delays from the us side continue mexico also coul d have grounds for retaliating against the united states under nafta dispute resolution rules59 the fmcsas new entrant rule effectiv january 1 2003 which sets forth new requirements for us and canadian motor carriers that apply for operating authority in the us raises two issues that ma receive congressional attention the bush administration ordered the rule be written to raise the requirements faced by us and canadian new entrant motor carriers to level similar to the requirements being imposed on mexican motor carriers this may have been done to counter mexican charges that the certification rules discriminate against mexican carriers us and canadian new entrant carriers must now so undergo safety audit within an 18 month period of provisional operating author ity including onsite reviews the difference in treatment is narrowed to the requirement that at least 50 of mexican companies undergo onsite reviews befo re being given provi sional authority to operate beyond the border zone one issu is how significant these regulatory changes imposed on us and canadian ca rriers should be in considering policy response to any mexican move to seek compensation or suspension of benefits under nafta second issue is how c ongress will respond to the funding and staffing needed to carry out the audits of us and canadian new entrant carriers an fmcsa official estimated that as ma ny as 25000 new entrants will have to be processed and audited60 if the role of mexican customs brokers and drayage operators becomes an impediment to the efficient flow of freight across the border it would raise the issue of whether these particular institutions have role in preventing us firms from operating directly in mexico if after implementation these institutions continue to have degree of control over cross border trucking that is deemed detrimental to ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31738crs26 61 whitten p 13 62 fmcsa officialstrucking firms some may view them as nontariff trade barrier to us trucking services61 another issue is the number of trucks th at have operating authority restricted to the border zones and that operate illegally beyond thos zones this includes concerns about the fate of mexican dr ayage trucks after implementation if implementation reduces the demand for drayage services some operators may try to use their drayage equipment to haul load s to destinations beyond the border zone the drayage trucks would not simply disappear and some would undoubtedly risk going beyond the commercial zones th case can be made however that the combination of increased enforcemen t the fmcsa alone has 252 personnel assigned to the mexican border and state police and safety inspectors will also be on the lookout for mexican trucks opera ting beyond their authority and penalties placing mexican truck far from the bor der outofservice is very expensive proposition for mexican carrier in add ition fines can be imposed should reduce this kind of cheating62 however it is worth watc hing the numbers of mexican domiciled trucks that are caught operating beyond their authority the leasing of mexican trucks and driv ers by us firms may become major implementation issue the ban on using l eases to circumvent the prohibition on mexican trucks from operating beyond the border zones ends with nafta implementation leasing may become an important element in the post implementation business nvironment if us firm so arranges for work visas for leased mexican drivers it could make them available for more cabotage loads and could have mexican drivers competing more often against us drivers in the united states should this happen congress ma want to revisit the leasing issue
