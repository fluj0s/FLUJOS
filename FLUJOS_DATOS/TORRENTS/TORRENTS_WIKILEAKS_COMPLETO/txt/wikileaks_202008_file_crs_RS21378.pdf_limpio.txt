see discussion below under the statutory paygo requirement gislation proposing new direct spending or decreasing revenues for fiscal year must not result in net cost for that year the paygo requirement generally is intended to keep an onbudget deficit from being increased or an onbudget surplus from being reduced direct spending which is expected to amount to about 12 trillion in fy2003 excluding net interest is controlled by the legislative committees of the house and senate through substantive law and funds entitlement and other mandatory programs such as medicare federal military

with regard to direct spending the paygo requirement app lies to outlay levels rather than levels of budget authority budget authority represents the legal authority for agencies to incur obligations annual appr opriations are perhaps the most well known form of budget authority outlays represent the liquidation of the obligation usually in the form of an electronic funds transfer or the issuance of check by the treasury department outlays rather than budget au thority are compared to revenue levels to determine the amount of the surplus or deficit the paygo balances for each fiscal ear are maintained on rolling paygo scorecard that accumulates the budgetary eff ects of laws enacted during the session and in prior years beginning with fy1992 th threshold test for paygo sequester deals with how legislation affects the net cost for fiscal year on the paygo scorecard not how it changes the surplus or deficit for that fiscal year in the federal budget the sequestration process established by the 1985 balanced budget act and initially used to enforce the acts annual deficit targ ets was retained by the bea of 1990 and 1997 as the means of enforcing the paygo requireme nt as

previe w report midway thr ough the congressional session the update report and within 15 da ys after the end of the session the final report the congressional budget office cbo issues sequestration reports in advance of the omb reports but they are advisory only if the omb directors final sequestration report indicates that enacted direct spending and revenue levels ve incurred net cost for the fiscal year on the paygo scorecard then the president must immediately issue sequestration order to remedy the violation through automatic acrossthe board spending reductions if sequester under this process is required it must occur within 15 cal endar days after congress adjourns at the end of session and on the same day as an sequestration tied to enforcement of the discretionary spending limits the sequester would eliminate any net positive balance on the paygo scorecard for that fiscal year and the prior fiscal year combined caused by the enactment of legislation durin g the session and in prior years any required reductions would be made in nonexempt di rect spending programs emergency direct spending and revenue legislation so designated by the president and in statute is not covered by the paygo seque stration process as mentioned previously spending for the social security program except for administrative expenses is exempt from sequestration as are many other direct spending programs any reductions in medicare spending are limited to 4 the senate paygo rule the congressional budget process establis hed by the congressional budget act of 1974 pl 93344 as amended contains several mechanisms to enforce decisions regarding the recommended levels of direct spending and revenues these mechanisms include among other things binding ceilings on aggregate spending under section 311 of the act binding spending allocations to committees under section 302 of the act and reconciliation procedures under sections 310 and 313 of the act in addition the so called elastic clause in section 301b4 aut horizes the budget resolu tion to set forth such other matters and require such other procedures rela ting to the budget as may be appropriate to carry out the purposes of this act pursuant to the elastic clause authority the house and senate sometimes include special procedural features in the budget resolution the senate using the acts elastic clau

indicated in the preview sequestration report for fy2003 that the balance for that fiscal year on the paygo scorecard was 110694 billion6 the balance for fy2002 which was to be combined with the fy2003 ba lance to determine whether sequester for fy2003 would be required previously had been reduced to zero7 the balances for the remaining years on the scorecard fy 20042006 were 130 billion 131 billion and 135 billion respectively although the house and senate did not reach agreement in 2002 on budget resolution for fy 2003 it was clear that neither house intended to pursue policies that would eliminate the fy2003 balance on the paygo scorecard through revenue increases and direct spending reductions rather it was expected that congress and the president would agree to use procedural means for preventing paygo sequester from occurring as had been done in recent years8 as the session unfolded congress and the pr esident enacted legislation that added net costs to the paygo

could be cut under paygo sequester because most direct spending is exempt from sequestration consequently violation of more than 90 billion would remain even if full paygo sequester were to occur the paygo measure with the largest budg etary impact enacted during the 2002 session was an economic stimulus measure the job creation and worker assistance act pl 107147 march 9 200210 omb estimated the
