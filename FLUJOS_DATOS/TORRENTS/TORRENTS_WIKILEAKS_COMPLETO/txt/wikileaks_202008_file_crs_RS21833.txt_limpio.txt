security planners face variety of challenges domestic threats until recently greeces record in combating domestic terrorism was widely regarded as deficient group called the revolutionary organization 17 november 17n had acted with impunity since 1975 claiming responsibility for assassinating four us officials and many others following the fortuitous arrest of 17n terrorist in june 2002 after bomb exploded in his hands prematurely greek authorities captured and successfully prosecuted suspected leaders and members of the group new acts of terrorism have been attributed to 17n since the 2002 arrests although the greek police chief claimed 17n does not exist anymore minister of public order george voulgarakis has admitted that questions remain that continue to keep the file open3 the us state department has kept 17n on its list of httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21833 foreign terrorist organizations in patterns of global terrorism 2003 quoting the chief that additional members of the group are at large and investigations are continuing4 after their success against 17n greek authorities focused on the revolutionary peoples struggle ela ela also had been active since 1975 and had claimed responsibility for hundreds of bombings and at least two murders patterns of global terrorism 2003 lists revolutionary nuclei rn as foreign terrorist organization and refers to it as probable successor to or an offshoot of ela which had not claimed responsibility for any acts since 1995 and is longer on the state department list rn engaged in arson and lowlevel bombing it has not claimed an attack since 2000 five members of ela captured in january 2003 and accused of crimes including bombing vehicles and facilities used by the us military are now on trial the greek government believes that ela has been effectively dismantled some analysts suggest that if remnants of 17n and ela were still at large they would not act during the olympics because of their professed patriotism5 however such sentiments may not inhibit anarchist groups that abound mainly in the athens area and target popular us and allied businesses for example american express citibank and mcdonalds usually with

by ela and rn and denounced foreign involvement in olympic security and affluent western olympic tourists8 there also have been attacks foiled and hoaxes near us and olympicrelated sites domestic terrorist groups have not been tied to international terror networks but media reports have alleged that ela trained in palestinian camps in lebanon suggesting that international links are possible9

democracy and to attack western citizens and interests11 countries whose nationals are considered to be at high risk include the united states britain israel saudi arabia and russia dissenting view is heard from those who suggest that anxiety about qaeda terrorism at the olympics may be exaggerated or maintain that greek security measures see below will accomplish their purpose of effectively hardening otherwise soft tourismrelated targets12 concern about greeces vulnerability to penetration by international terrorist groups is partly due to the existence of countless points of entry and to its arguably defective or lax border and passport controls greece has thousands of islands in the aegean ionian and mediterranean seas and is close to middle eastern and balkan hot spots albania bulgaria and former yugoslav republic of macedonia will be closely monitoring greeces northern borders prior to and during the olympics however greece already has many illegal residents from the balkans and the middle east moreover it has not yet fully implemented plan for central control over issuing passports which remains the prerogative of local prefects nor has it begun to issue more

believes that there is domestic threat it is primarily focusing on external threats given the nature of the greek government where ministers usually operate autonomously and are responsible solely to
