trade organization wto deal with the issue of currency manipulation it also discusses apparent discrepancies in their charters and ways those differences might be addressed g11g151g157g142g155g151g138g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g15g152g151g142g157g138g155g162g561g8g158g151g141g561 the imf is the leading international organization in the area of monetary policy with the end of the cold war its membership is now nearly universal only north korea the vatican and four other minicountries in europenone having its own currencyare not members of the fund the imf makes loans to countries undergoing financial or balance of payments crises it provides technical assistance to governments on monetary banking and exchange rate questions it does research and analysis on monetary and economic issues and it provides forum where countries can discuss international finance issues and seek common ground on which they can address common problems although the imf is monetary institution the promotion of world growth and balanced international trade are also among its basic goals article i of its articles of agreement says among other things that the imf was created in order to facilitate the expansion and balanced growth of international trade and to contribute thereby to the promotion and maintenance of high levels of employment and real income and to the development of the productive resources of all members as primary objectives of economic policy it was also created to assist in the establishment of multilateral system of payments in respect to current transactions between members and in the elimination of foreign exchan ge restrictions which hamper the growth of world trade between 1946 and 1971 the imf supervised fixed parity exchange rate system in which the value of all currencies was defined in terms of the us dollar and the dollar was defined in terms of set quantity of gold countries could not change their exchange rates from the level recognized by the imf by more than 10 without the funds consent moreover said the original language of the imf articles member shall not propose change in the par value of its currency except to correct fundamental disequilibrium 1 this system broke down in 1971 when the united states devalued the dollar twice without any consultation with the imf after period of turmoil in world currency markets an amendment to the imf articles was adopted in 1978 it said that countries could use whatever exchange rate system they wishedfixed or floatingso long as they followed certain guidelines and they did not use gold as the basis for their currencies the new language of article iv which went into effect in 1978 said that countries should seek in their foreign exchange and monetary policies to promote orderly economic growth and financial stability and they should avoid manipulation of exchange rates or the international monetary system to prevent effective balance of payments adjustment or to gain unfair competitive advantage over other members some countries claim that their exchange rate policies are not in violation of article iv because they are not seeking to gain competitive advantage though this may be the result of their actions but rather to stabilize the value of their currency in order to prevent disrupt ion to their domestic economic system to date the imf has not publicly challenged this statement of their objective 1 this language is quoted from section 5 of the original language of article iv as approved by the 1944 bretton woods conference and confirmed by all member countries when the imf officially came into existence in 1946 t httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22658g5g158g155g155g142g151g140g162g561g15g138g151g146g153g158g149g138g157g146 g152g151g497g561

fund was required to exercise firm surveillance over the exchange rate policies of all members and to adopt specific principles for the guidance of all members with respect to those policies the imf adopted the requisite standards in 1977 before the amendment went into effect and it updated them in 2007 the 1977 agreement said that among other things protracted largescale intervention in one direction in exchange markets might be evidence that country was inappropriately manipulating the value of its currency the 2007 agreement added requirement that member should avoid exchange rate policies that result in external instability when countrys current account balance of payments is not in equilibrium the imf said in its explanation of the new provision the exchange rate is fundamentally misaligned and should be corrected 2 the imf can exercise firm surveillance but it cannot compel country to change its exchange rate nor can it order commercial foreign exchange dealers to change the prices at which they trade currencies it can offer economic advice and discuss how changes in countries exchange rates might be in their own interest it can also provide forum such as its new multilateral consultation mechanism or discussion on the imf executive board where other countries can urge country to change its exchange rate procedures however in the end the authority to make the change resides with the country alone g25g152g155g149g141g561g22g155g138g141g142g561g17g155g144g138g151g146g163g138g157g146g152g151g561 the wto is the central organization in the world trade system when the wto was created in 1995 countries were required to accept as condition of wto membership the existing trade rules embodied in the general agreement on tariffs and trade ga tt they also had to accept new rules governing other areas of international commerce such as services and traderelated international property rights the agreement establishing the wto says that the members recognize that their relations in the field of trade and economic endeavor should be conducted with view to raising standards of living ensu ring full employment and steady growing volume of real income and effective demand and expanding the production of and trade in goods and services and to do this in manner consistent with their respective needs and concerns at different levels of economic development 3 unique among the major international trade and finance organizations the wto has mechanism for enforcing its rules if country be lieves another country has violated wto rules to its detriment it may request the appointment of dispute settlement panel to hear its complaint the other country cannot veto the establishment of panel or adoption of wto decision by wto members the panel reviews the arguments in the case and renders judgment based on the facts and wto rules if the losing party does not comply with the ruling within reasonable period of time the wto may if requested by the complaining party authorize it to impose retaliatory measures usually increased customs duties against the offending country or to take other appropriate retaliatory measures against that countrys trade whether currency disputes fall under the wtos jurisdiction is debatable issue the wto rules specify that countries may not provide subsidies to help promote their national exports most analysts

exports it is questionable however where currency undervaluation is an export subsidy under the wtos current definition of the term4 the term subsidy has precise definition in the wto it requires that there must be financial contribution by government to the exporter or some other form of income or price support government financial support can take variety of forms such as direct payments to the exporter the waiver of tax payments or special government purchases or the provision of lowcost goods or services other than general infrastructure that lowers the cost of production currency manipulation would not appear to qualify under the wto definitions in addition an export subsidy is subsidy that is contingent on export performance in the case of an undervalued currency everyone who exchanges money will be affected by the current exchange rate matter whether they are buying or selling and matter whether or not they are involved in international trade while subsidies must be specific to an industry to be actionable in the wto prohibited subsidy such as an export subsidy is considered to be specific per until the world financial system frayed in the 1970s the imf exercised strict control over exchange rates it was inconceivable that country could persistently value its currency at level below that approved by the imf when the imfs rules were changed in 1978 so that it longer governed world exchange rates the gatt rules were not adjusted to reflect the new reality of international finance when the wto was created in 1995 it adopted the existing gatt rules as its own without fundamental change g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g17g153g157g146g152g151g156g561g146g151g561g157g145g142g561g15g158g149g157g146g149g138g157g142g155g138g149g561g21g153g145g142g155g142g561 number of countries have been suspected or accused in recent years of manipulating the value of their currency for the purpose of gaining unfair trade advantage as noted before the imf articles of agreement prohibit this sort of behavior but the fund has capacity to enforce that prohibition by contrast the wto has the capacity to adjudicate trade disputes but to date it has done nothing to suggest that trade issues linked to currency manipulation are within its zone of responsibility if policymakers want to address this situation several options might be considered g3g150g142g151g141g561g157g145g142g561g3g155g157g146g140g149g142g156g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g11g15g8g561 one option might be changes in the imfs articles of agreement that would give the fund more authority over international exchange rates and more authority to require that countries comply with its rules this would restore to some degree the power the imf exercised over exchange rates from 1946 to 1971 two objections might be raised however first an 85 majority vote of the imf member countries is necessary if any change in the imf articles is to become effective most countries seem to believe that the present system of floating and fixed exchange rates is working reasonably well and there seems to be little desire on the part of the members to amend the imfs current rules second few countries want the imf to have the kinds of power over their economies that it would need to compel violators comply with its rules for example if the imf had the power to 4 agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures articles 1 to 3 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22658g5g158g155g155g142g151g140g162g561g15g138g151g146g153g158g149g138g157g146 g152g151g497g561 g22g145g142g561g11

currency was undervalued and to require adjustments it would also have the power to declare the us dollar or the euro were overvalued and to require the united states or the euro zone countries to make changes in their domestic policies in ways that would correct the situation g3g150g142g151g141g561g157g145g142g561g25g22g17g561g3g144g155g142g142g150g142g151g157g156g561 another possibility might be formal change in the wto agreements that would define currency manipulation as prohibited form of export subsidy it is not be easy to amend wto agreements however since the process basically requires the unanimous consent of all members countries that manipulate their currencies could easily bloc k the approval of the amendment however they would have to argue that currency manipulation is an acceptable trade practice notwithstanding the language of the imfs article iv it seems more likely that any such change in the wto rules will be the result of discussions during multilateral trade negotiations in which restrictions on currency manipulation will be balanced by other changes desired by the countries that believe currency manipulation is an acceptable trade practice g21g142g142g148g561g3g141g147g158g141g146g140g138g157g146g152g151g561 alternatively the united states might consider taking its complaint against countries that manipulate their currency to formal wto dispute settlement panel while in the past currency issues have not been seen as being encompassed by the wto dispute settlement process the united states could argue that changed conditions in the world economy now require adjudication of such disputes article xv of the gatt agreement says that when disputes between signatory countries involve questions about balances of payments foreign exchange reserves or exchange arrangements gatt countries shall consult fully with the inte rnational monetary fund and shall accept the imfs determination as to matters of fact and as to whether countrys exchange arrangements are consistent its obligations under the imf articles of agreement gatt article xv also says that countries shall not by exchange action frustrate the provisions of this agreement nor by trade action the intent of the provisions of the imf articles of agreement traditionally these references to exchange arrangements have been seen as referring as they did when the gatt was created in 1947 to currency controls exchange licenses transaction taxes and other official actions that limit potential purchasers ability to get the foreign exchange needed to purchase goods from abroad 5 the ga tt allows countries to impose temporary import restrictions when they face balance of payments difficulties article xii or when they are at risk for serious decline in their foreign exchange reserves article xviii in recent decades however the term exchange arrangements has expanded to reflect new developments in the world economy the langua ge of article iv adopted by the imf in 1978 says section 2 that each member country shall notify the imf of the exchange arrangements it intends to apply in other words whether its currency will float in value or be pegged to another currency it says the imf shall oversee the intern ational monetary system to ensure that each 5 see for example john h jackson world trade and the law of gatt new york the bobbsmerrill company

under article iv imf article iv also says that in its oversight of countries exchange arrangements the fund shall exercise firm surveillance over the exchange rate policies of its member countries in effect case can be made that the term exchange arrangements arguably has become synonymous with the concept exchange rate regime and exchange rate policies as it is used in ga tt article xv the term exchange arrangement refers to issues that are the sole province of the imf thus one could argue that the meaning of the term in the gatt should reflect its current meaning at the imf and not the meaning prevalent in 1947 an undervalued currency encourages exports by reducing their cost and it discourages imports by making them more expensive than they might be otherwise consequently one might argue that countries with this type of exchange arrangement are engaging in exchange action that may have the effect of frustrating the provisions of the ga tt agreement there has never been definitive ruling by the ga tt or wto on the meaning of article xv including how provisions of the gatt agreement might be frustrated by exchange action some might argue that currency undervaluation raises the price of imports in way that unilaterally rescinds tariff concessions approved during multilateral trade talks accordingly case could be made that the wto should use the broader meaning of the term exchange arrangements and take currency valuation arrangements into account in its dispute settlement process there has also been increased interest in recent years in the issue of currency manipulation and its impact on world trade and financial relationships it could be argued therefore that this might be an appropriate and perhaps auspicious moment for issues relating to the trade impact of currency manipulation to be raised in the wto dispute adjudication process g11g150g153g155g152g159g142g561g157g145g142g561g11g15g8g556g25g22g17g561g3g144g155g142g142g150g142g151g157g561 another option is to strengthen the current inte ragency agreement between the wto and the imf the present agreement was signed in 1996 and updated in mid2006 among other things it says paragraph 1 that the two organizations shall cooperate in the discharge of their respective mandates6 it says paragraph 2 the two agencies s hall consult with each other with view to achieving greater coherence in global economic policymaking it also says paragraph 8 that the two agencies shall communicate with each other about matters of mutual interest article xv of the gatt agreement says that the ga tt now wto shall cooperate with the imf in order to pursue coordinated policy with rega rds to exchange questions that are within the jurisdiction of the fund it is unreasonable to expect that the wto should be expected to enforce the rules of the imf nevertheless one might expect that conversations about the ways the activities of one organization might be hindering the other in the discharge of its assigned duties could transpire their different policies towards the question of exchange rate manipulation do not seem to encourage greater coherence in global economic policymaking changes in the existing interagency agreement can be effected by majority vote in each institution such agreement can change their basic rules however it might provide that their disparate treatment of currency manipulation is inconsistent with their promise to cooperate in the discharge of their respective mandates and to promote greater coherence in global economic 6 agreement between the international monetary fund and the world trade organization updated june 30 2006 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22658g5g158g155g155g142g151g140g162g561g15g138g151g146g153g158g149g138g157g146 g152g151g497g561
