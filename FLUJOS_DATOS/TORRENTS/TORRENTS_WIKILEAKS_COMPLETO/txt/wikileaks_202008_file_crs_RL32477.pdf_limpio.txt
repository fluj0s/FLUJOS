haltzel domestic social policy division july 9 2007 abstract in february 2004 proposal the sec asked for public comment on the need for additional changes to rule 12b1 among other things it proposed requiring distributionrelated costs to be directly deducted from individual shareholder accounts rather than from aggregate fund assets potentially beneﬁtting investors by giving them more direct and thus better understanding of sales charges but critics say the proposal would result in investors accounts eventually paying smaller nominal amounts as they age giving brokerdealers added incentive to churn the accounts there are additional concerns that the proposal might result in complicated recordkeeping burdens and added tax liabilities for investors the 2004 proposal also asked for public comment on whether rule 12b1 should be repealed but critics responded that the plans are ingrained in the ﬁnancial system and repeal could mean reduced service for small investors by brokers and shift to frontend loads which do have the beneﬁt of greater visibility relative to 12b1 fees in the spring of 2007 sec chairman cox announced that due to the perception that 12b1 fees had strayed beyond their original intent the agency would be reexamining 12b1 during the year to help in its deliberations the agency sponsored 12b1 roundtable during june 2007 in which variety of diﬀering perspectives were voiced on the fees meritshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32477 order code rl32477 social security the public servant retirement protection act hr 2772s 1647 updated july 9 2007 laura haltzel specialist in social security domestic social policy divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32477social security the public servant retirement protection act hr 2772s 1647 summary worker is covered by social security if he or she pays into social security through the oldage survivors and disability insurance oasdi payroll tax currently 96 of all workers are covered by social secu rity the majority of non covered positions are held by federal state and cal government employees the currentlaw windfall elimination provision wep reduces the social security retirement or disability benefits of workers who also receive pension from employment not covered by social security the goal of the wep was to remove an unintended advantage that the regular soci security benefit formula provided to employees who divided their careers be tween covered and noncovered positions as of december 2006 approximately 971300 beneficiaries appr oximately 2 of the entire beneficiary population at that time had their benefits reduced as result of the currentlaw wep on june 19 20 07 representative kevin brady introduced hr 2772 the public servant retirement protection act psrpa which would alter the currentlaw wep formula for those who first enter nonsoci securitycovered employment one year after the bills enactment the psrpa would maintain the currentlaw wep for workers who have worked in noncovered employment prior to this date except in cases where the psrpa wep provides them with higher benefit on june 19 2007 senator kay bailey hutc hison introduced the sister bill s 1647 both b ills would replace the currentlaw wep formula with new wep formula that provides benefit in rough proportion to the percentage of earnings worked in social security covered employment when compared to currentlaw the effect of the psrpa wep on workers benefit levels varies both by earnings level and the number of years of social security coveredearnings the currentlaw wep ge nerally provides be nefit that increases with additional years of social security c overage by contrast the key determinant of the new proportional benef it amount is the percentage of the highest 35 years of covered and noncovered earnings that can be attributed to social security covered work the higher the value of these covered earnings compared to the highest 35 years of covered and noncove red earnings the larger the benefit under the psrpa thus the psrpa wep provides benefit that increases with rise in the proportion of social security covered earnings rela tive to overall earnings regardless of the number of years worked in social security covered employment this report will be updated as legislative activity warrantshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32477contents background 1 currentlaw windfall elimination provision wep 1 r t i

currentlaw wep reduces the social security retirement or disability benefits of workers who also receive pension from employment not covered by social security1 the base social security be nefit the primary insurance amount pia is the amount that worker would receive as social security retirement benefit if he or she retired exactly at the full retirement age 65 years and eight months in 2007 the pia formula applie s three progressive factors 90 32 and 15 to three different levels or brackets of workers average indexedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32477crs2 2 the aime is dollar amount that represents the average monthly earnings from social securitycovered employment over most of th workers adult life indexed to the increase in average annual wages to calculate the aime for retired worker workers earnings prior to age 60 are first indexed to the year that the worker reaches age 60 the highest 35 years of indexed yearly earnings are used to compute the aime the sum of the indexed earnings in these 35 years is divided by the num ber of months in these 35 years to obtain the average indexed monthly earnings 3 for determining years of coverage after 1978 for individuals with pensions from non covered employment the amount is 25 of what the contribution and benefit base otherwise would have been if the 1977 social security amendments had not been enacted in 2007 the oldlaw taxable wage base is equal to 72600 and thus to earn credit for one year of coverage under the wep worker would have to earn at least 1 8150 in social securitycovered employmentmonthly covered earnings aime2 in 2007 for those who reach age 62 or who become disabled the pia formula is 90 of the first 680 of the aime plus 32 of the aime between 680 and 4100 plus 15 of the aime exceeding 4100 under currentlaw this regular pia formula is modified for those receiving pensions from nonsocial security covered employment by adjusting the 90 factor based on the number of years the worker had substantial em ployment covered by social security ie having earned at least one quarter of the oldlaw social security maximum taxable wage base for each year3 the higher the number of years of substantial social security coverage the higher the first formula factor used in the wep pia formula the lowest form ula factor is 40 which applies to those with 20 or fewer years of substantial social security covered employment for each additional year of substan tial social security covera ge over 20 the formula factor increases by five percentage points until it reaches 90 for those with 30 years of substantial social security covered employment the sa first formula factor as under the regular pia formula thus wo rker who would otherwise be subject to the wep would be exempt from any benefit reduction if he or she had at least 30 years in covered employment the 32 and 15 pia formula factors continue to apply as under the regular pia formula figure 1 demonstrates how the benefit level resulting from the currentlaw wep formula varies by years of covered earnings forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32477crs3 4 year of coverage should not be confused with year of covered earnings in 2007 to earn credit for one year of coverage unde r the wep worker would have to earn at least 18150 in social securitycovered employme nt year of covered earnings is any year in which the worker had earnings from social securitycovered employment regardless of the amount earned because the psrpa does not rely on the currentlaw definition of years of coveragein calculating wep benefits as determined by measuring substantial earnings the common denominator of years of covered earnings is used in all charts for example in 2007 minimumwage worker in social security coveredemployment would earn 10712 although this minimumwage worker has year of social security covered earnings he or she would not have ear ned year of coverage towards the current law wep formula that requires worker to ea rn at least 18150 in social security covered employment any attempt to graphically represent minimumwage workers currentlaw benefit under the wep by years of coverage would have been impossible as the minimum wage worker never qualifies for single year of coverage worker with average earnings4 in case can the reduction in benefits under the wep exceed more than half of th pension based on noncovered work rationale the goal of the wep was to remove an unintended advantage that the regular social security benefit formula provide d to employees who divide their careers between covered and noncovere d positions the regular so cial security formula is intended to replace higher proportion of ear nings for those workers who spend their working years in low paying jobs relative to those who have high earnings however the regular formul cannot differentiate between those who work their whole lives in lowpaying jobs and those who simply appear to be low paid because they work for many years in jobs not covered by social security because those who work in nonsocial security covered positi ons do not contribute to social security through the payroll tax each year of nonc overed employment is recorded as year0500100015002000250030003500 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35years of covered earningsbenefit level constant 2007

security formula because their few years of covered earnings were averaged over their entire working career to determine the average covered earnings on which their social security benefits we re based the wep formula is intended to remove this advantage for these workers social securitycovered and noncovered work worker is in position covered by so cial security if he or she pays into social

differently from current or past noncovered workers when calculating social security retirement or disability benefits future noncovered workers applies new proportional pia fo rmula to those who first begin noncovered employment one year after the bills enactment the psrpa legislation establishes new pi formula that takes into account the proportion of workers career earnings attributable to social securitycovered employment first to represent the pia that worker would receive if he or she had worked full career in social securitycovered employment pia is calculated using the workers highest 35 years of earnings from both covered and noncovered employment second this careerbased pia is multiplied by ratio that reflects the portion of the workers lifetime earnings attributable to covered employment this ratio is equal to the currentlaw aime which is based on the workers highest 35 years of social securitycovered earnings divided by an aime based on the workers highest 35 years of earnings from both covered and noncovered employment the new pia is therefore equal to the portion of the career pia that the worker is eligible to receive based on his or her social secu ritycovered earnings thus the new pia formula for future noncovere d workers is as follows new pia pia using covered x aime using highest 35 years covered earnings and noncovered earnings aime using highest 35 years covered and non covered earnings current and past noncovered workers holds harmless individuals who already work or have worked in noncovered employment those individuals currently working in nonsocial securitycovered employment those who have worked in noncovered employment in the past and those who begin work in noncovered employment within oneyear of the bills enactment would

the reduction in benefits caused by the currentlaw wep cannot exceed more than half of the pension based on noncovered work however if the pia calcu lated under the proportional wep formula would be higher than th at provided under currentlaw the worker would receive the higher pia figure 2 demonstrates the basic relations hip between the currentlaw wep formula and the psrpa proportional benefit

benefits between currentl aw and the psrpa most of the following analysis of the results deals with explaining the difference in the gaps for workers with varying levels of earnings and ears of covered earnings how will the psrpa affect benefits under the currentlaw wep benefits are driven by the number of years of coverage while under th psrpa benefits are driven by the value of covered earnings rela tive to overall earnings regardless of the number of years spent accruing those covered earnings while the currentlaw wep formula provides increase in the first pia formula factor of 40 for those with between 10 and 20 years in covered employment the psrpa uses 90 formula factor and thus would provide higher percen t increase in benefit levels for each year of covered earnings future noncovered workers who sp end 30 years or more in social security covered employment w ould not be exempt from reduced social security benefit as are workers under currentlaw

workers with various earnings levels who spend differing numbers of years working in social securitycovered employment in the casesimulation model it is necessary to specify not only the number of years of covered employment but also when thos years occurred because we are relying on hypothetical earnings patterns for workers in all of our examples higher earnings levels come towards the end of the worke rs career therefore individuals whose years of covered earnings occur later in their career experience slightly higher benefit levels under the psrpa than those indivi duals who have cove red earnings earlier in their career while the relative importance of the timing of covered earnings holds true for individuals with earnings historie s that start low and increase throughout the career it would not necessarily hold true for other earnings patterns the appendix provides series of tabl with examples of how the psrpa would affect future noncovered workers ba sed on differences

series or 4 the maximum wage creditable under social security 10 this constant rate is primarily functi on of the assumptions used to generate the hypothetical earners used in this analysis par ticularly the longterm constant rate of growth in the national average wagecurrentlaw and the psrpa wep formulas with respect to years of covered earnings by earnings levels in all cases the wep benefit leve l under both current law and the psrpa increases with years of covered earnings however the current law wep generally increases at varying rate with years of covered earnings whereas the psrpa wep increases at constant rate10 also the slope of both the currentlaw wep and psrpa wep with respect to years of coverage increases as earnings increase eg compare figure 3 with figure 4 these formula features account for the differences in benefits illust rated in subsequent figures with respect to years of covered earni ngs and earnings levels given our assumed earnings historie s the psrpa provides strictly proportional benefit howe ver the currentlaw wep formula replaces higher proportion of the aime of higherwage work ers than lowerwage workers higher wage workers tend to have larger aimes and larger portion of their benefit is based on the 32 and 15 formula factors under the currentlaw wep pia lower wage workers tend to have smaller aimes and larger portion of their benefit is based on the first pia formula factor which can be as small as 40 under the current law wep furthermore under the curre ntlaw wep minimumwage earners do not have high enough earnings to qualify fo r year of coverage under the wep therefore while their aimes increase with additional years of covered earnings their wep years of coverage do not and so the first pia formula factor remains at 40httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32477crs14 0500100015002000250030003500 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35years of covered earningsbenefit level

impact of this year of coverage requirement can be seen by comparing figure 3 minimumwage worker with figure 2 scaled averagewage worker the pattern of currentlaw benefits by year s of covered earnings for the minimumwage worker does not exhibit the typical bend points one expects from the wep formula because the first pia formula factor neve r rises with additiona l years of covered earnings this same pattern holds true for scaled lowwage workers figure 4 but to lesser degree scaled lowwage work ers earn high enough wages in some years to qualify for year of coverage but even then the first pia formula factor only reaches 60 thus when the new proportional pia is used and the regular pia formula using the 90 first formula factor is put in place minimumwage and scaled lowwage workers experience the greatest percent increase in benefits scaled averagewage scaled highwage and max imumwage earners ll have high enough earnings in each year of covered earnings to qualify for year of coverage under the wep and thus their first pia formula factors rise every year between 20 and 30 years of covered earnings figure 2 figure 5 and figure 6 the difference in the

the key determinant of the new propor tional benefit amount is the percentage of the highest 35 years of covered and nonc overed earnings that can be attributed to covered work the higher the value of covered earnings to career earnings the larger the benefit under the psrpa in order to separate out the effect of the number of years of covered earnings we examined workers with identical earnings histories but with different numbers of years of c overed earnings for example figure 8 highlights how the percent change in benefit level fo r scaled averagewage worker who has covered earnings at the end of his career va ries by the number of years of coverage11 as seen in figure 8 the averagewage worker who has between 10 and 20 years of covered earnings experiences large percent increase in social security benefit level compared to the currentlaw wep the currentlaw wep formula limits the first pia formula factor to 40 instead of 90 for regular workers matter how many additional years of coverage worker earns between 10 and 20 with the psrpa pia workers would receive an increase in benefit pr oportional to the increase in their earnings for each ear of additional covered earnings for those workers with 21 to 29 years of covered earnings the percent increase in benefit under the psrpa declines for each year of covered earnings gained again this pattern is due to the current law wep

provides higher benefit than the psr pa would once covered earnings exceed 275 years relative to currentlaw individuals who work 30 to 34 years of covered earnings would experience the largest percent decrease in their social security benefits under currentlaw individuals who work 30 or more years in covered employment are exempt from any reduction in benefits under the wep because their benefits are calculated using the regular pia formula with the 90 formula factor under the new psrpa these individuals w ould now be affected by the proportional wep pia individuals who work for 35 years in c

work at age 21 in 2005 and retires at the full retirement age of 67 in 2051 it is assumed that the maximum wage worker follows typical lifetime earnings pattern that would produce social security benefit equivalent to that of workers with career earnings equal to the maximum wage cred itable under social security this scenario is for illustration only and is not meant to fully represent every possible scenario that actual workers may experience for example by relying on stylized workers we have assumed gaps in employment this scenario focuses on workers with between 10 and 35 years of covered earnings because worker generally needs 40 quarters of coverage 10 years to qualify for social security benefits and the highest 35 years of earnings are generally used in cal culating social security benefits these estimates do not include the currentlaw wep provision that would limit the reduction in social security benefits to 50 of the noncovered pension amount
