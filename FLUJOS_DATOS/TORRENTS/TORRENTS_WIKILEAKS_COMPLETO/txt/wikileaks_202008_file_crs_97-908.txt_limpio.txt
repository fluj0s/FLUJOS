simple categorization based on per capita income level of 16783 large services sector and hundreds of dynamic hightech companies it is modern and advanced based on the large role the government still plays in the economy it is interventionist and regulated and based on the countrys high defense requirements chronic trade deficits and political economy it can be described as distinctive or unique since 1948 the economy has experienced three different stages of development the first 19481972 and third stages 19891995 were classic boom periods fueled primarily by rapid increases in the stock of labor the second stage 19731988 was characterized by considerable economic instability and turmoil the israeli economy currently may be entering fourth stage where concerns once again are being raised about stability and performance the increase and size of the current account deficit 48 of gdp in 1996 combined with an overvalued exchange rate are matters of particular concern because they can be precursors to financial crisis this is situation of special concern to israel because it already imports large amount of capital to finance its deficit and there is certainty that sources of funding at reasonable cost will continue indefinitely these economic problems have been fueled by an expansionary fiscal policy and relatively restrictive monetary policy in order to promote economic stability most economists agree that israel needs to pursue less expansionary fiscal policy mainly by cutting nonproductive government expenditures this in turn would allow central bank authorities leeway to run less restrictive monetary policy without jeopardizing other macroeconomic objectives reduction of the high degree of government intervention in economic activity also could help israel promote economic growth and macroeconomic stability through more efficient use of the countrys resources given the likelihood of slower growing labor force productivity increases brought about by structural reforms may become even more critical in the future however progress has been gradual in reducing the governments role in owning and running enterprises as well as reforming capital and labor markets progress has been more rapid in liberalizing foreign trade and currency barriers and in increasing competition in certain sectors although there appears to be consensus within israel on the policy actions that should be taken to avoid serious economic problems implementation of coherent economic strategy continues to be politically difficult perennial problem is that as israels political system produces coalition governments the majority party in the government is often hampered in implementing its preferred economic policy by competing claims from small coalition partners

based on per capita income level of 16783 large services sector and hundreds of dynamic hightech companies it is modern and advanced based on the large role the government still plays in the economy it is interventionist and regulated and based on the countrys high defense requirements chronic trade deficits and political economy it can be described as distinctive or unique advanced economy attributes based on population of 57 million and gross domestic product of 95 billion the per capita income level in israel in 1996 was 16783 the world bank categorizes countries at this level as highincome economies countries with comparable per capita income levels include ireland spain and new zealand the structure of the israeli economy is also representative of an advanced industrialized country services public and private financial transportation commerce and tourism now account for nearly 70 of the total output of the economy industry including construction accounts for around 30 of total output and agriculture for less than 3 the dominance of the service sector prompted the international monetary fund to reclassify israel as an economically advanced country in 19771 in addition to its large and modern services sector israel today has large and diversified manufacturing sector skilled highly educated and innovative labor force is perhaps its most important asset the economy is exportoriented and well integrated into the world economy the heart of israels manufacturing capability is thriving rapidly growing and innovative hightech sector this sector consists of an estimated 1000 startup companies electronics and software companies with annual sales of 7 billion lead the way all these startup companies rely on an abundance of highly trained and educated scientists and entrepreneurs many of whom immigrated from the soviet union in the past seven years israel now boasts the highest number of scientists and engineers per capita in the world 1 ezrahi yaron in israel peace means prosperity new york times january 21 1997 p 23 crs2 many of israels hightech companies have utilized technologies developed in the army and defense industries recent products providing improvements in internet security systems encryption and realtime video services all emanated from military technologies2 approximately 90 of israels hightech companies are traded on nasdaq the us exchange devoted to young and aggressive companies here and abroad this is more than any country other than the united states and canada these companies attracted over 1 billion in financial investment in 1996 compared to 543 million in 1995 and 335 million in 19943 with small economy and relatively limited domestic market israel depends increasingly on international trade for its economic growth in 1996 exports of goods and services accounted for approximately 30 of gdp and imports of goods and services accounted for about 40 of gdp the extent to which international trade plays key role in israels growth is highlighted not only by the contribution of exports to final demand but also by the composition of its imports in 1996 for example production inputs and investment goods accounted for 69 of israels imports thereby serving as major source for bolstering the productive capacity of the economy4 the european union eu assisted by geographical proximity and 22year old free trade agreement is israels main trading partner in 1996 the eu purchased 31 of all israels exports and supplied israel with 49 of its imports the united states is israels other main trading partner in 1996 the united states purchased 28 of israels exports and supplied 21 of its imports5 israels export base is welldiversified with metals machinery and electronics accounting for growing share of total exports israel also remains one of the leading centers for diamond cutting and polishing with diamond exports accounting traditionally for onefourth of total exports in addition israel exports substantial amounts of chemicals6 2 sugarman margo lipschitz hightech highstakes jerusalem report february 6 1997 p 37 3 rosenberg david hard times for hightech jerusalem report february 6

appendix tables 5 and 6 6 us department of state background notes israel october 1996 p 2 for more detail see appendix table 7 crs3 interventionist attributes by tradition circumstances and ideology the government of israel has played leading role in developing the economy and in influencing economic activity when israel was established in 1948 the economy was primarily agrarian with only small manufacturing sector the state possessed minimal natural or financial resources little economic infrastructure and few public services faced with the daunting task of settling huge influx of immigrants from europe and the middle east who generally lacked savings or skills israels political leadership gained control over large part of the countrys investment resources and economic activity to provide food clothing housing and jobs for its new citizens government control of the economy was also prompted by the need to deal with these challenges in hostile external environment7 significant part of all business came to be controlled by three sectors private public and histadrut the general federation of laborers in the land of israel histadrut whose membership initially encompassed nearly all the labor force came to own or control significant portion of israeli industry as result of its vast pension fund holdings while significant steps have been taken over the years to reduce the governments high level of intervention in the economy the israeli economy retains an interventionist character today security challenges social welfare considerations and the small size of the economy have served as justifications by israeli authorities for keeping sizeable portion of economic activity under government regulation or control or for going slow on reducing the level of intervention government expenditures which in the 1990s have averaged 46 to 48 of gdp symbolize the large role government still plays in the economy8 continued ownership or control of approximately 116 companies with the largest ten companies accounting for over 20 billion in assets is second vivid illustration9 other notable manifestations include some 600000 public sector jobs which account for 30 of all jobs an estimated 93 of the land is also owned by the government condition that has contributed to rising land and housing prices and the government still controls or supervises number of retail prices such as meat transportation fares and medicines these goods constituted 18 of the consumer price index cpi as of august 199610 the government has played dominant role in capital markets from the beginning due to its need to finance large budget deficits and its interest in channeling the flow of capital within israels economy high levels of spending on 7 kreinin mordechai

more detail 10 see appendix table 9 for more detail crs4 civilian services health education and welfare bolstered by strong domestic consensus in favor of the welfare state and defense have driven the domestic budget deficits historically by controlling bank and other credit lines and by establishing tax incentives the government has exercised major influence on the scale and pattern of investment throughout the economy high concentration of capital among handful of large conglomerates continues to stifle competition11 israels labor market is affected by structural rigidities and restrictive government regulations the labor market is dominated by histadrut which now represents about 60 of all israeli workers including the vast majority of workers employed in the public sector or governmentowned enterprises12 cartels and monopolies many of which are legal affect significant portion of the israeli economy the resulting lack of competition in certain sectors is often preserved by considerable albeit declining level of import protection despite having negotiated free trade agreements with the european union and the united states the israeli economy remains relatively protected from imports from generally lowerwage asian countries the protection mainly takes the form of variety of user taxes and high duties due to these myriad governmental interventions in the marketplace israel often is ranked relatively low on various surveys of international competitiveness or economic freedom most of these surveys attempt to develop one overall measure of governmental interference in economic activity based on analysis of the states tax trade budget regulatory and monetary policies distinctive attributes the israeli economy has several distinctive features three of the more prominent ones are associated with high defense requirements chronic balance of payments problems and political system that make economic policymaking more difficult or uncertain since its establishment israel has been subject to almost constant hostility from neighboring states as result defense has almost always come first in terms of the overall allocation of resources annual defense expenditures have been high compared to other countries both in per capita terms and relative to the size of the economy in recent years defense expenditures have declined but still average around 10 of gdp13 israels defense burden can be measured by the budgeted resources diverted to defense that could have been used for other civilian purposes the defense burden also includes the opportunity cost of labor working for the defense sector that is unavailable to work in the private sector thereby reducing the economys potential 11 rivlin paul the israeli economy westview press 1992 p115 12 see appendix table 10 for more detail 13 imf staff report p81 crs5 output in addition defense spending has been an important factor behind the size of the state budget and persistent budget deficits14 israels precarious security environment has also insured that foreign policy or geopolitical considerations are given priority over purely economic policy issues as result sound economic policy decisions eg to cut government expenditures in order to promote macroeconomic stability are often given short shrift when the security environment is tense chronic balance of payments deficits are second distinctive feature of the israeli economy driven by its need to import most all of its energy requirements most of its raw materials and considerable weaponry israel historically has run merchandise trade deficits to finance the deficits israel has long had to rely on foreign capital transfers via loans grants foreign investment and borrowing perennial concern is that rising trade deficits and capital imports together can lead to precipitous decline in the value of the israeli currency this concern in the past however has also been the catalyst for economic policy changes that would avoid selloff of foreign currency reserves and financial crisis third distinctive feature relates to israels political system where seats in the 120member knesset are allocated according to proportional representation any political party that receives 15 of the national vote is allocated seats in the knesset the effect of this system is to produce coalition governments where the power of small mostly single issue parties is greatly enhanced currently nine such parties ranging from the ultrareligious to the leftwing peace parties hold almost half the seats in the knesset while the two main parties labor and likud combined control slim majority15 the need for the prime minister to consult leaders representing nearly every faction of the governing coalition on most major decisions serves as formidable constraint on pushing ahead with fundamental economic or structural reform initiatives 1996 political reform that provided for the direct election of the prime minister arguably has served to reinforce this tendency by encouraging the formation of small parties and by forcing the prime minister to cater to the whims of the support groups that elected him within the israeli government the bank of israel remains the main force supporting macroeconomic stability particularly low inflation and liberalization of the economy acting as independent central bank only since the last decade its willingness to raise interest rates to combat inflation is considered critical however number of political and business leaders have advanced proposals to dilute the 14 pelzman joseph israels economy in israel country study us library of congress 1988 pp 141176 15 hunt albert r the wonders of israelpolitics and all new york times august 28 1997 p a15 crs6 independence of the central bank if passed by the knesset most economists fear that stability of the israeli economy could be jeopardized16 stages of economic growth since the establishment of the state of israel in 1948 the economy has experienced three different stages of economic growth and related macroeconomic developments the first 19481972 and third stages 19891995 were classic boom periods fueled primarily by rapid increases in immigration that boosted the stock of labor the third stage 19731988 was period of considerable economic instability and turmoil the israeli economy currently may be entering fourth stage where combination of problems are raising concerns once again about the stability and future performance of the israeli economy first two stages 19481972 and 19731988 from 19481972 the first 24 years of the state of israel the economy grew at very rapid rate during this period real gnp increased at an annual rate of 104 percent one of the highest rates in the world this high rate of growth allowed for steady rise in per capita incomes at the same time inflation averaged less than 10 on an annual basis rapid increases in both the stock of labor and capital were largely responsible for the rapid growth of the economy between 1948 and 1973 the population of israel increased nearly fourfold rising from 870000 to 33 million the growth in the capital stock was even greater increasing eightfold from 1950 to 196717 between 1973 and 1986 by contrast the israeli economy performed very poorly and unevenly the economic growth rate slowed to an annual average of about 2 per year with increase in per capita incomes the rate of inflation skyrocketed reaching high of 445 in 1984 and the economy experienced balance of payments crises in 1975 1983 and 19841985 18 three factors major increase in defense expenditures following the 197374 yom kippur war world energy crisis and sharp increase in expenditures on social welfare help explain the deterioration in economic performance during this period in the aftermath of the june 1967 war defense expenditures between 1970 and 1982 escalated to over 25 of gdp up from 10 to 16 of gdp range prior to the war sharp increases in oil prices in 1973 and again in 1979 imposed huge cost on the israeli economy estimated at 12 billion or the equivalent of one years 16 marcus dockser and david wessel israels central banker stirs controversy new york times september 26 1997 p a18 17 rivlin paul pp 67 18 pelzman joseph israel the economy p 141 crs7 gdp at the time in addition to deal with rising social unrest government spending on education housing and welfare increased substantially during this period19 the deterioration of the israeli economy continued in 1985 with hyperinflation and precipitous fall in foreign exchange reserves to stabilize the economy the government in july 1985 introduced an economic stabilization program the program involved an immediate 188 devaluation of the shekel freeze on price and wage increases deep cuts in government expenditures and monetary restraint the stabilization program was dramatically successful it not only reduced inflation from over 400 in 1985 to around 20 by the end of 1986 but it also laid the foundation for the consideration of additional reforms affecting taxation foreign currency and privatization in the years ahead20 stage three 19891995 beginning in 1989 israel experienced huge influx of immigrants mostly from the former soviet union from 19891995 approximately 760000 new immigrants increased israels population from 452 million to 554 million 13 increase these mostly young immigrants represented according to one analyst the greatest migration of highly skilled human capital in the twentieth century21 the israeli governments strategy for immigrant absorption placed primary responsibility on the promotion of private sector employment without direct labor market intervention government expenditures for absorption which averaged approximately 6 annually of the domestic budget were directed substantially to the construction of public housing in addition the government provided hebrew language and vocational training as well as loans to new immigrants to start up their own businesses22 the rising supply of labor spearheaded very rapid economic growth that averaged over 6 in real terms from 199095 real per capita incomes experienced healthy rates of increase during this period as well rising from an average of 13977 in 19861989 to 16783 in 199623 the economic expansion was led primarily by investment that grew at an annual average rate of 162 from 19901995 compared to around onetenth of 1 in the 19 ibid 143144 20 for an overview of the israeli economy from 19851990 see wertnan patricia the israeli economy and its

demand was channeled into construction for new houses but it later spread to increases in plants and equipment the new immigrants also stimulated private consumption expenditures on consumer durables which increased on average by 71 in the 1990s compared to 5 annual growth in the 1980s24 the impressive growth record was accompanied by favorable developments on the inflation and unemployment fronts unemployment fell from 101 average in 199091 to 90 in 1995 and the numbers of employed increased from less than 15 million in 1989 to over 18 million in 1995 inflation measured by the consumer price

economic growth during this period as well since the madrid conference in 1991 agreements reached between israel and the palestinians and with jordan allowed the expansion of contacts with countries and companies which once boycotted israel the peace process also stimulated tourism sector which provides roughly 10 of israels gross foreign exchange earnings25 the most important new markets opened to israel have been in the far east facilitated by the weakening of the arab boycott israeli exports to all of asia which now constitute about onefifth of total israeli exports leapt 86 from 1992 to 1995 as compared to an overall growth rate of 45 during that period the israeli finance ministry calculated that over 60 of the increase in exports in 1994 and 1995 was 24 imf staff report p 40 25 us department of commerce israel commercial guide july 1996 p3 crs9 due to the opening of new markets previously closed to israeli goods principally located in asia26 the fruits of the peace process are also reflected by increases in foreign direct investment flows with record 22 billion entering the economy in 199527 growing number of multinational companies such as intel motorola and ibm have established plants and rd sites mostly to tap the economys skill base in science medicine and technology28 stage four 1996present beginning in 1996 the israeli economy has experienced slowdown in growth compared to the early 1990s rise in the unemployment rate inflationary pressures and growing current account deficit this combination of problems which has occurred simultaneously with slowdown in the immigration rate has raised some concerns about the stability and the future performance of the israeli economy growth israels gdp growth rate declined in 1996 to 44 from the 71 rate in 1995 the drop was mainly due to sharp decrease in export sector growth and slowdown in construction both residential and nonresidential29 26 link magazine links tour of the new israeli economy found at

israeli enterprise blossoms new york times june 5 1997 p d 2 29 bank of israel 1996 annual report p6 crs10 source bank of israel 1996 annual report the slowdown in the export growth rate was concentrated in services while exports of goods rose by 79 in 1996 rate similar to 1995 services exports fell by about 1 in 1996 compared to 145 rise in 1995 most of the rapid expansion of goods exports was in hightech industries such as software and biomedical equipment while traditional goods exports such as footwear and clothing continued to shrink steep decline in tourism following the terrorist attacks in march 1996 accounted for large share of the decline in services exports30 the economy has continued to slow down in 1997 during the first six months it grew at only 18 rate well below the 44 growth in 1996 slower growth can be expected to have both positive and negative consequences for the economy on the one hand it is likely to help moderate inflationary pressures and to reduce the current account deficit through reduced demand for imports on the other hand it is likely to lead to reduced government revenues creating more pressure for significant cuts in government expenditures in order to meet budget deficit targets in addition slower growth combined with population rising at about 25 means there will be little or increase in per capita incomes such increases are an israeli government goal in order to attract new immigrants particularly from eastern europe31 30 ibid p 7 31 dempsey judy netayahu pledges cuts and extra cash financial times july 12 1997 p 4 crs11 employment israels labor force grew rapidly in the 1990s with the influx of new immigrants from 19901992 the civilian labor force including foreign workers and workers from the occupied areas grew by 58 following 31 rise in 1993 the labor force grew by 52 and 66 rates in 1994 and 1995 respectively in 1996 the expansion slowed to 34 over 2157 million workers were in the labor force in 1996 up from 2109 million in 1995 despite the increase in the supply of labor the growth of demand during the 1990s outstripped the supply this is reflected in declines in the unemployment rate from an average of 101 in 199091 to 90 in 199295 and to 67 in 1996 during 1997 unemployment is projected to reverse this downward trend by rising to 7932 source annual report regarding the composition of business sector employment the trend of the previous three years continued in 1996 rising numbers of israeli and foreign workers and declining numbers of workers from the territories such as gaza and the west bank israeli workers expanded by 28 and documented foreign workers by 40 but employment of workers from the territories declined by 33 the number of registered foreign workers rose form 58000 in 1995 to 83000 in 1996 elevating their share to roughly 4 of total employment this development is related to security events and the closure of the territories early in 199633 the entry of rising number of foreign workers has led to downward wage pressures as well as reduction of jobs in many traditional industries this development which has been reinforced by the ongoing liberalization of foreign trade barriers has occurred at the same time that demand for highly skilled labor has 32 bank of israel 1996 annual report p4 33 government of israel website found at httpwwwmofgovilbeinle nutbug1htm1maintrends as of october 2 1977 crs12 soared causing their real wages and employment to rise as result israel is seeing the gap between rich and poor widen in recent years34 inflation in 1996 price increases as represented by the cpi rose by 106 slightly surpassing the upper limit of the bank of israels inflation target of 810 this slight inflationary upturn was driven by increases in the price of fruits and vegetables and housing 25 and 14 respectively other contributing factors included an expansionary budget policy and low unemployment35 in 1997 inflation has continued to run near the upper limit of the central banks 710 target zone as result the bank of israel announced in august 1997 an increase in the key lending rate it charges commercial banks this interest rate hike by 07 percentage points to an annualized 134 was the first since july 1996 continuation of tight monetary policy combined with slower growth in 1997 is expected to keep inflation in check36 given that large percentage of israeli wages contracts and mortgages are indexed or linked to changes in the consumer price index lowering the inflation rate to single digits through monetary restraint is quite difficult the government however has tried to lessen this structural component of inflation by decreasing the extent to which prices are indexed balance of payments israel traditionally has run large external trade deficit that largely has been offset by cash grants from foreign governments and individuals in recent years the deficit on goods and services has outpaced the inflow of these unilateral transfers resulting in significant increase in israels current account deficit in 1995 this deficit reached 39 billion or 47 of gdp in 1996 the deficit widened to 44 billion which represented about 48 of gdp the deficit is large relative to past levels and by comparison with other countries37 34 bank of israel 1996 annual report pp 89 35 the government of israel website at

of israel 1996 annual report most of the growth in the deficit was caused by decline in israels savings rate this rate dropped from an annual average of 205 in 199092 to an annual average of 175 in 199596 low and even negative public savings reflecting budget deficit occurred in 1995 and 1996 at the same time the investment rate has remained strong in recent years due largely to surge in housing and infrastructure outlays38 israel has faced problem in financing this deficit thanks to an upsurge in foreign direct investment expansion of the number of longterm loans and to its borrowings under the fiveyear 10 billion us loan guarantee program that runs through 1998 implied capital imports averaged an 68 billion in 199596 an amount well in excess of the current account deficit39 nonetheless the current account deficit is matter of concern particularly over time rising deficit combined with an overvalued currency are often leading indicators of possible balance of payments or financial crisis this is situation that israel needs to be especially concerned about because it already is heavily dependent on foreign capital to finance its deficit and there is guarantee that these sources of funding will continue at reasonable cost forever40 the rise in israels current account deficit has caused israels net external debt to rise in absolute terms from 165 billion in 199092 to 200 billion in 1996 but due to strong gdp growth israels net external debt has declined from 276 of gdp in 19901991 to 205 of gdp in 1996 the manageability of israels debt is 38 ibid 39 bank of israel

199141 during 1997 the slowdown in economic growth has helped reduce the current account deficit42 this has occurred as home demand for imports has slackened and world demand for israeli exports has increased due to continuing depreciation of shekel strong export performance is also key to keeping israels debt service payments at manageable levels current macroeconomic policy issues israels current economic problems are fueled in large part by widening gap between fiscal and monetary policies while fiscal policy has been expansionary in recent years monetary policy has been restrictive this has imposed an economic cost on the country primarily in terms of high interest rates most experts agree that major fiscal consolidation or tightening is necessary before monetary policy can be eased the slowdown in economic growth however is placing added pressures on monetary authorities to lower interest rates in order to avoid domestic recession the problem is that too large drop in interest rates could lead to an large outflow of capital precipitating an abrupt depreciation of the shekel fiscal policy until 1995 the burden of absorbing large influx of immigrants was accomplished without an expansionary fiscal stance although the domestic budget deficit increased from 32 of gdp in 1989 to 53 in 1991 tight controls on expenditures helped drop the domestic budget deficit steadily to 20 of gdp by 1994 but with an election approaching in the fall of 1994 large increases in public sector wages and tax cuts as well as by receipt of less revenues than estimated turned fiscal policy expansionary the result was that in 1995 the domestic budget deficit reached 33 of gdp well above the 275 target established by the 1992 budget deficit reduction act43 fiscal policy became more lax in 1996 with the domestic deficit rising to 47 of gdp this deficit also significantly exceeded the deficit reduction target prescribed by law44 41 imf staff report p 48 and 1997 loan guarantee report p 12 42 the current account deficit has declined from 36 billion during the first six months of 1996 to 23 billion during the first six months of 1997 43 in addition the methodology

israel 1996 annual report the deviation of the actual budget from the deficit target arose again in 1996 on the basis of both an overestimation of domestic tax revenues and failure to cut the rate of spending45 as in the case in 1995 more than half of the deficit overrun was caused by revenue shortfalls rather than overspending46 the shortfall in revenues in turn was attributable to decline in income and other direct tax collections as well as to the growing role of foreign workers who are paid in cash47 on the expenditure side large increases in public sector spending occurred prior to the may 1996 election particularly noteworthy were rapid increases in both public sector salaries and public sector jobs48 viewing recent shifts in the composition of expenditures two developments stand out the first is that defense spending as percentage of gdp has declined from around 115 in 1992 to just 95 in 1996 at the same time transfer payments to households and nonprofit institutions have increased from 135 in 1992 to 156 of gdp in 1996 the share in the budget going to nondefense public sector salaries also has risen from 51 of gdp in 1992 to 63 of gdp in 199649 to date in 1997 israeli efforts to reduce the budget deficit to 25 of gdp have proven difficult in december 1996 the government did get its 1997 state budget approved by knesset the initial 568 billion budget package included variety of 45 while government expenditures as of gdp declined from 482 of gdp in 1992 to 462 in 1996 revenues also declined from 444 of gdp in 1992 to 419 of gdp in 1996 46 loan guarantee

without raising taxes but intense opposition to proposed cuts in transfer payments and subsidies however forced the likudled government to rely on increased taxes to obtain approximately half the proposed reduction in the budget deficit50 subsequent efforts by the government early in the summer of 1997 to obtain additional expenditure cuts have been thwarted by political pressures to increase spending particularly for projects favored by minority parties in the coalition thus meeting the budget deficit target could prove difficult again this year as the economy continues to grow more slowly the 1997 economic slowdown increases the likelihood that revenues will run below projected levels as the baseline 1997 budget assumed an economic growth rate of 4 actual growth at around 2 could translate into revenue gap of at least 425 million51 the slowdown may also increase political opposition to budget cuts while economic theory suggests that significant budget cuts could facilitate lower interest rates and lower exchange rate that in turn could generate increases in domestic production cuts in government spending are traditionally unpopular among influential interest groups monetary and exchange rate policies since 1985 the main objective of israels monetary and exchange rate policies has been to reduce inflation to levels prevailing in most advanced industrialized countries the central banks principal tools are control over the money supply and interest rates as israels fiscal policy turned expansionary in 1994 monetary policy turned restrictive throughout 1995 and 1996 tight monetary policy has persisted with the bank of israel holding real interest rates at 4 to 5 percentage points above the underlying rate of inflation combined with an attempt to maintain downward crawling peg exchangerate mechanism this policy has had number of sideeffects first high real domestic interest rates in 1995 and 1996 encouraged surge in shortterm capital inflows by the end of 1996 shortterm deposits had boosted m2 monetary aggregate that includes shortterm deposits to level that exceeded foreign reserve holdings threefold this development raised concerns that if interest rate spreads between israel and other countries narrowed huge supply of shekels could be dumped on the market as domestic agents switched to foreign currency assets52

israel 1st qtr 1997 report p 14 crs17 second the largescale capital inflow has led to moderate 5 since 1993 real appreciation of the shekel while stronger currency helps in the fight against inflation it is controversial in the business community because it increases the price of israeli exports third the tight monetary policy and accompanying high interest rates have encouraged israeli firms to increase substantially their use of foreign denominated credit the rising demand for foreign currency borrowing has forced the central bank to engage in activities to soak up the supply of shekels it has pumped into the economy in order to prevent the monetary base from growing and undercutting its inflationary targets this process know as sterilization has imposed quasifiscal cost on both the bank of israel and the public53 in june 1997 the bank of israel acted to counter the negative pressures from capital inflows and the sterilization requirements exchange controls were further liberalized to allow provident and mutual funds more freedom to invest abroad and the exchange rate band was widened to make speculation riskier the bank also dropped its main lending rate from 139 to 127 after the cabinet agreed to cut the deficit by an additional 600 million shekels54 monetary authorities hope that the interest rate reduction will reduce the demand for shekels in the foreign exchange market and allow some real devaluation of the shekel to take place gradually their concern is that diminution of interest rate spreads between israeli and foreign markets could prompt large outflow of foreign capital that in turn could lead to precipitous depreciation of the shekel without substantial cuts in budgetary expenditures however monetary authorities can be expected to maintain very cautious policy towards any further interest rate reductions structural reforms recent developments attainment of israels macroeconomic objectives particularly rapid economic growth can also be facilitated by range of structural reforms that would reduce the level of government intervention in the economy the government of israel has for long time pursued these structural reforms not only to improve the governments finances but also to promote more efficient use of the economys resources given the likelihood of slower growing labor force the main spur to the rapid growth in the early 1990s productivity increases brought about by structural reforms that enhance efficiency may become even more critical in the future since 1985 the governments record on implementing structural reforms has been varied on the one hand limited progress has been made in the privatization of staterun enterprises and the deregulation of markets for capital labor and land on the other hand more significant progress can be discerned in efforts to liberalize foreign trade barriers and to interject more competition into specific sectors that have 53 bank of israel 1996 annual report p18 54

owned stake in some 160 companies whose output accounted for bout 10 of gdp the plan which was adopted by the government in 1988 identified 75 commercially oriented companies that could be sold both through direct sales to inventor groups and public equity offerings on the tel aviv stock exchange tase in addition 30 companies were identified as prime candidates for privatization within the next five years47 privatization either through direct sales to investor groups or through public offerings is desirable not only because it could enhance the economys competitiveness but it could also attract more foreign direct investment in addition sales of state assets could help the government meet its deficit reduction targets48 since the privatization program began israel has raised about 2 billion of an expected 5 billion from sales of stateowned companies in addition sales of shares in governmentowned banks have raised about 29 billion compared to an expected 45 billion as shown below

through september 2370 source government companies authority number of factors are often cited for the relatively slow pace of the privatization process one important factor concerns the question whether the government should restructure industries before privatizing or should privatize enterprises before restructuring potential problem is that if procompetitive structural reform is not implemented prior to privatization the result could be the substitution of private monopoly for public one other factors include lack of crs19 political will resistance from unions and management and depressed conditions in the israeli stock market55 at present the government retains control over some 116 companies about half of these companies are commercially oriented such as tourism and half provide public services such as airports in july 1996 prime minister netanyahu promised to privatize everything in sight as sign of his intention he relocated the privatization authority from the ministry of finance to the office of the prime minister56 in january 1997 ministerial privatization committee approved limited plan that called for 12 government corporations to be sold in 1997 the leading candidates include bezeq the israeli telephone company zim israel navigation shipping company the national airline and israel chemicals57 the governments efforts to carry out this plan have been met with predictable resistance by the unions and workers the sale of 125 of bezeks stock to merrill lynch for 250 million for example prompted oneday general strike on july 24 1997 this strike which involved over 60000 workers disrupted telephone services and halted all outgoing flights from bengurion international airport unable to block the sale histadrut may have called the strike to negotiate maximum benefits for any workers that might lose their jobs as result of the privatization58 despite organized resistance the government raised over 23 billion in revenues from its privatization efforts in 1997 through september in addition to successful offerings on bezek and israeli chemicals the government sold the countrys largest bank bank hapoalim59 capital markets reforms

characterized by considerable government intervention and subsidization variety of regulations and restrictions affect the portfolio allocations of institutional investors and private savings these include complex system of taxation of different assets and the issuance of government bonds with guaranteed real rates of return in addition the israeli capital market lacks number of financial instruments found in other industrialized countries such as corporate bond issues and simple fixedincome money market certificates as result the flow of funds to the private sector remains distorted60 in july 1996 committee chaired again by mr brodet was established to explore structural reforms of the capital markets the committee identified five major problems absence of longterm institutional investors high degree of concentration tax discrimination between investors and savers lack of regulation of financial agents and limited supply of stocks recommendations centered on ways to encourage longterm private savings attract more investors into stock and bond markets and make more funds available for mortgage lending in the fall of 1996 the knesset voted to adopt only part of these recommendations while deferring action on proposals affecting shortterm savings and pension fund reform61 labor market reforms israels labor market historically has been relatively inflexible due substantially to wage setting system and minimum wage law in regard to wage settlements histadrut the huge and powerful labor federation negotiates sector and industry wage agreements with the government and the organization of private sector employees the agreements reached constitute framework of wage scales for the different sectors of the economy and with occasional changes of detail also provide for automatic payment of costofliving allowance as compensation for inflation62 minimum wage law enacted in 1987 further reduced labor market flexibility the law establishes minimum wage equivalent to 45 of the average wage and it is adjusted semiannually as the average wage changes histadrut has vigorously opposed efforts to make adjustments in the law63 more flexible labor markets

many of whom take nonunion jobs and to changes in the wage bargaining process however the labor markets arguably have become more flexible in recent years the impact of growing labor force can be seen in terms of minuscule real wage increases for nonpublic sector workers from 19891995 during this period real wages have declined for four of the seven years and in the years when real wages have risen the increases have been small 18 in 1992 03 in 1993 and 02 in 199564 structural changes in the wage bargaining process may have contributed to real wage restraint in the business sector as smaller share of the wage bill is now negotiated at the national level with more freedom in wage bargaining at the local level firms may have been able to negotiate wage settlements more in line with their ability to pay65 significant rigidities in the heavily unionized and regulated labor market however persist the decline in real wages in the business sector has been more pronounced in the lessheavily unionized services sector of the economy such as construction and in contrast to the real wage declines in the business sector from 19891995 real wages of public sector employees increased on average by 25 annually this gap between public and business sector wages continues to blunt the movement of labor from the public to the private sector in addition it is uncertain how slower growing labor force will affect wage flexibility in the future foreign trade and currency reforms in an effort to increase domestic competition and to expand exports israel has opened its economy increasingly to foreign trade during the 1970s and 1980s israel substantially liberalized its trade barriers to imports from the european union eu and the united states trading partners that supply israel with bulk of its imports within the context of its free trade agreements fta with the european union and the united states israel eliminated or will eliminate tariffs on the bulk of its imports from the eu and the united states israel has also signed agreements with number of scandinavian and eastern european countries that are essentially equivalent to its fta with the eu as well as an fta with canada in january 1997 beginning in 1991 israel began to gradually liberalize trade with third countries namely those in latin america asia and eastern europe not covered by free trade agreements nearly all quantitative restrictions on nonagricultural products were initially replaced with tariffs ranging from 20 to 75 with higher tariffs for such products as wood and textiles in 1992 maximum tariffs were reduced to 60 for most products and to 110 for wood and textiles all tariffs were reduced to maximum rates of 8 for raw materials and 12 for finished and intermediate goods by september 1997 however tariff reductions on some 64 see appendix table 7 for more detail 65 israeli ministry of foreign affairs website op cit crs22 traditional manufactures eg wood products footwear textiles and clothing will not be implemented until later66 while ftas and unilateral initiatives as well as membership in the world trade organization have substantially reduced tariff barriers between israel and its major trading partners significant nontariff barriers remain these include high purchase taxes on luxury goods artificial customs uplifts and quotas on agricultural products as is the case worldwide number of these remaining barriers protect local producers67 since 1985 the israeli government has substantially liberalized once rigid system of foreign exchange controls in particular reserve requirements on domestic foreigncurrency deposits have been significantly lowered in recent years68 the government has also taken number of steps designed to make the shekel fully convertible in support of this objective the government recently lifted several restrictions on israeli companies investing abroad the measures will also eliminate curbs on the foreign activities of israeli banks and provident funds restrictions limiting the amount of foreign currency individuals may purchase for travel abroad 1000 and on pension funds from buying foreign securities however remain69 other reforms since the late 1980s the israeli government has tried to increase competition throughout the economy by lifting streamlining or reducing burdensome regulations the objective of the reforms has been not only to enhance the overall efficiency of the economy but also to reduce prices to consumers reforms have cut across broad spectrum of different sectors including telecommunications energy and transportation initial steps have also been taken to make the market for land more efficient and to reduce subsidies to the business sector in general steps that have been either proposed or implemented represent modest progress towards realizing prime minister netanyahus goal of massively deregulating the israeli economy in the telecommunications sector the monopoly status of bezek is being gradually eroded the process began in 1994 when second operator was allowed to compete with bezek for cellular phone service in the summer of 1997 two new companies one backed by sprint began providing service on international calls by the end of 1977 new tenders in the telecommunications field are expected for third cellular telephone operator and for allowing broadcast satellite tv to

substantial private sector investors including merill lynch and british company70 regarding the transportation sector the government recently approved plan to open several intercity bus routes to competition and to license one additional baggage handling company at bengurion airport and in the energy sector the government is considering proposal to increase the number of gas stations and to reduce the control of the major fuel chains over individual station operators71 in 1994 the israel lands administration ila which administers the usage of nearly all land through leases initiated process to deregulate and privatize its activities contracts to lease plan and develop land for residential purposes are now offered through public tenders resulting in more than 400 projects being launched outside the ila despite these reforms more streamlined approval process for building permits and greater number of tenders for public lands for housing construction could help bring down high housing costs72 the government of israel has also tried to reduce as well as restructure subsidies provided under the 1953 capital investment encouragement law the restructuring has focused on directing economic incentives to promote investment in human capital and research and development as opposed to previous concentration on subsidies for the building of factories and the purchase of capital equipment73 outlook the potential strength of the israeli economy has increased in recent years due to number of factors these include skilled and highly educated labor force growing and dynamic hightechnology sector and an economy that increasingly is integrated with other major world trading powers to realize its economic potential in the mediumterm as well as to avoid any possible financial crisis there appears to be broad agreement among israels policy elites about the proper course of action first and foremost cut in government spending is advocated by many in order to increase domestic savings this would not only forestall any potential balance of payments problems by curbing any rise in israels persistent high reliance of external resources but it would also help fund investmentled growth meeting the domestic deficit reduction target for 1997 and beyond would also reduce the burden on monetary policy in stabilizing the economy and contain the possibility of an escalation in inflation in addition containment of generally nonproductive expenditures some business subsidies and tax preferences transfer payments could free up domestic resources for necessary investments on infrastructure 70 rubin david growing on ingenuity p 9a 71 economist intelligence unit 1st qtr 1997 report p 21 72 imf staff study p 28 73 economic intelligence unit 1st qtr 1997 p 13 crs24 the acceleration of significant structural reforms could also complement efforts to promote economic growth by generating more efficient and productive use of the countrys resources more rapid program for privatizing state enterprises could free up resources both capital and labor that could be employed more efficiently by the private sector and attract more foreign direct investment reforms promoting greater competition could improve productivity growth despite an apparent consensus on the proper policy actions that appear most supportive of macroeconomic stability implementation is far from certain formidable internal and external obstacles could continue to thwart movement in this direction internally israels political system tends to result in coalition governments where the majority party is hampered in implementing its preferred economic policy by competing claims from small coalition partners as their support is necessary for the government to continue in power small parties ranging from ultrareligious to leftwing propeace parties tend to predicate continued participation in coalition governments on the direction of government funds into their own preferred projects as result announced economic policies and goals continually conflict with political promises74 in the current likudled coalition for example prime minister netanyahu agreed at special cabinet meeting held in june 1997 to cut an extra 168 million from this years budget to order to meet the deficit reduction target of 28 of gdp since then mr netanyahu has renewed his pledge to make the cuts while at the same time promising his coalition partners substantially more funds for their favorite projects similarly mr netanyahus need to consult leaders representing nearly every faction of his coalition on most major decisions serves as formidable constraint on pushing more forcefully ahead with sweeping structural reform initiative75 larger unknown is the commitment of the two major parties likud and labor to implementation of budget cuts and more rapid structural reforms both parties have sizeable constituencies in favor of maintaining the current system and blocking real reforms thus in the event that likud and labor ever formed national unity coalition it is debatable how much of difference this could mean in terms of economic policymaking76 some observers maintain that any push for serious reform is undermined by the considerable amount of foreign aid israel receives this view is that the aid 74 murphy emma structural inhibitions to economic liberalization in

process is in doubt there is greater likelihood that israels economy will be adversely affected on the margins by declining investor confidence if the stability of the region is viewed as problematic foreign investors are likely to hold off on making any major new investments and international financial markets are more likely to downgrade israels credit rating 77 rabushka alvin scorecard on the
