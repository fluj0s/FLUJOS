merchandise is being sold or is likely to be sold in the united states at less than fair value and 2 the us international trade commission itc determines that an industry in the unite d states is materially injured or threatened with material injury or that the establishm ent of an industry is materially retarded due to imports of that merchandise similar statute 19 usc 1671 et seq authorizes the imposition of countervailing dutie s cvd if the ita finds that the government or any public entity of foreign country has provi ded prohibited subsidy on the manufacture production or export of the merc handise and the itc determines injury these laws are part of larger body of statutes also known as trade remedies in the united states ad and cvd actions represent the vast majority of

protection cbp reportedly has had considerable difficulty collecting the actual amount of ad and cv duties owed on subject merchandise this problem r eceived special attention begi nning in fy2001 the first year in which us industries we re eligible to receive di sbursements under the cdsoa according to cbp records uncollected duties from fy2001 through fy2007 amounted to more than 613 million3 for example louisiana crawfish producers estimated and cbps annual disburse ment reports later confirmed that between fy2002 and fy2004 cbp collected only 255 million of about 1955 million in ad duties owed on crawfish4 recent report by the government accountability office gao estimated that the ability of new shippers to mporarily post bonds in lieu of cash deposits while the ita conducts an inve stigation of their sales in the us market accounted for about 40 of these uncollected duties5 any shortfall in collections of ad or cv duties affects us producers of the subject merchandise in two ways 1 the protection afforded by the ad or cv action intended to assist the domestic industry to compete against unfairly traded lowerpriced goods is diminished and 2 domestic producers are not ab to collect all of the duties available to them under the cdsoa6 in addition with the repeal of cdsoa duties that wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22290crs3 7 19 usc 1673dc1b 19 usc 1671dc1b the ita can also

cvd investigation by the ita the agency generally determines separate weighted average dumping margin or subsidy rate for each exporter or producer of subject merchandise that was inves tigated individually during the period of investigation poi and an estimated generally much higher allothers rate for all those not individually investigated7 these are the duty rates assessed if the investigation results in final affirmative determinations by the ita and itc and an ad or cv duty order is s ubsequently issued since most exporters who are individually investigated are likely to receive significantly lower rates than the allothers rate it is often in the interest of an exporter to request an investigation so that it can be assigned separate rate after the conclusion of an ad or cvd proceeding if the ita r eceives request from an exporter or producer who 1 did not export the subject merchandise during the initial poi and 2 is not affiliated with any producer or exporter who exported the merc handise the ita must conduct review to establish an indivi dual ad or cv duty rate for the exporter8 this type of review commonly known as new shipper review ma take from 270 to 450 days to complete pending on complexity9 prior to april 2006 any importer purchasing from the new shipper undergoing investigation received the right at his or her option to post bond or security in lieu of cash deposit to cover the additional ad or cv duties to be assessed at the completion of the review10 congress suspended this new sh ipper bonding privilege until june 30 2009 sec 1632a of pl 109280 as re sult all importers must now post cash deposit to cover the estimated ad or cv duties in terms of collecting the duties owed this eliminates the risk of linquency provided that the fina

depart ment of commerce internati onal trade administration import continuedalleged abuse of new shipper rules many us producers of goods subject to ad or cvd orders cited the new shipper bonding privilege as one of the ways that im porters circumvented the duties owed one method that was reported invol ved exporters subject to high ad duty rates setting up shell companies in the source country to act as new shippers other such companies were set up in the united states to act as the importer of record or arrangements were made with other collusive importers these new shippers exported minimal amount of the goods at fair price and subseque ntly requested that the ita undertake new shipper review of its export sales price12 while the new shipper review was underway the importer posted bond generally for substantially lesser amount than the adcv duty amount that was assessed at the end of the investigation13 administrative authorities so metimes discover this or other types of fraudulent arrangements in the course of the new shi pper review if not discovered however the new entity can receive very low dumping margin and continue to supply the market with the original shippers merchandise at much lower adcv duty rate than previously assigned even if the arrangement was discovered the receiving company can succeed in importing unlimited quantities of the subject merchandise for many months14 second since the united states uses retrospective system of assessing adcvd tariffs the time between the actual entry of the merchandise and recei pt of the final bill assessing the duties is 33 years on average which can add to the risk that duties are uncollected especially when dealing with illegitimate importers15 during the elapsed time the shipper the importer or both may have gone out of business or have declared bankruptcy therefore in many cases the higher duties owed remain uncollected ita and cbp efforts the ita and cbp have both made significant policy changes in an effort to restrict abuses of the new shipper bonding privilege and other forms of duty circumvention in procedures implemented in october 2002 the ita began requiring additional certifications and qualifying paperwork from all exporters requesting new shipper reviews in order to 1 ensure that these exporters actually meet all regulatory requirements and 2 limit the application of the bonding priv ilege so that the new shipper under review could not become conduit for exports fro m producers not involved in the review16 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22290crs5 16

shipper measure included in pl 109280 suspended the availability of bonds to importers from new shippers retr oactively from april 1 2006 to june 30 2009 thus requiring them to submit cash deposit to cover the entire estimated adcv dutieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22290crs6 24 the suspension does not apply to mexico or canada because the north american free trade agreement nafta specifies that any ame ndments to ad or cvd laws apply to nafta countries only to the extent specified in the amendment see 19 usc 3438 25 us customs and border protection suspension of new shippe r review provision memorandum august 16 2006 26 pl 109280 sec 1632b and c 27 gao report p 25 28 gao report p 42 29 ibidfor entries of the targeted merchandise24 the measure was implemented by cbp on august 16 200625 the law further requires the secretary of the treasury in consultation with the secretary of commerce the us trade representative and the secretary of homeland security to report to congress on the effectiveness and traderelated impact of the suspension and to make recommendations on its extension later than december 31 2008 the same officials were also requi red to report on previous duty collection issues during the 4 most recent fiscal years for which data are available including any fraudulent activity intended to avoid payment of duties w ithin 180 days of enactment26 conclusion suspension of the new shipper bonding privilege may par tially improve the effectiveness of ad and cv duty collecti ons because until july 2009 importers must post cash deposits roughly equivalent to the am ount of duties assessed at the time of entry into the united states provided the final amount of duties assessed is equal to or lesser than the deposit rate supplemental duties that may be accrued due to possible rate increases either during the final ita determin ation as result of annual reviews are not protected however27 furthermore congress faces the issue some time in 2009 of evaluating its effectiveness and determining whether to allow it to lapse extend the suspension or require cash deposits for new shippers permanently congress could also revise the level or number of shipments necessary for exporters to apply for new shipper status28 according to ita officials abusers of the privilege typically exported one shipment of the goods subject to ad or cv duties at relatively high price resulting in relatively low cash or deposit being required if subsequent shipments were found to be dumped or subs idized cbp had to issue retrospective bills for the duty amounts asse ssed which were likely to be uncollected29 therefore congress could choose to increas the dollar amount or number of shipments required prior to application for new shi pper review or to provide ita with the discretion to do so on the other hand this approach could unfairl burden legitimate new shippers by requiring them to export much rger amount at relatively high rate of duty prior to receiving an individual presumably lower rate finally the requirement that cbp report all uncollected adcv duties was repealed along with the cdsoa congress may also want to consider reinstating the reporting requirement
