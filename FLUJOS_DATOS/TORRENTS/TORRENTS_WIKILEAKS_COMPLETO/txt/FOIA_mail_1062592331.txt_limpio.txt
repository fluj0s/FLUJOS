from edward cook drdendroldeocolumbiaedu to keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk subject an idea to pass by you date wed 3 sep 2003 083211 0400 xflowed hi keith after the meeting in norway where i presented the esper stuff as described in the extended abstract i sent you and hearing bradleys followup talk on how everybody but him has fucked up in reconstructing past nh temperatures over the past 1000 years this is bit of an overstatement on my part i must admit but his air of papal infallibility is really quite nauseating at times i have come up with an idea that i want you to be involved in consider the tentative title northern hemisphere temperatures over the past millennium where are the greatest uncertainties authors cook briffa esper osborn darrigo bradley jones mann infinite i am afraid the mike and phil are too personally invested in things now ie the 2003 grl paper that is probably the worst paper phil has ever been involved in bradley hates it as well but i am willing to offer to include them if they can contribute without just defending their past work this is the key to having anyone involved be honest lay it all out on the table and dont start by assuming that any reconstruction is better than any other here are my ideas for the paper in nutshell please bear with 1 describe the past work mann briffa jones crowley esper yada yada yada and their data overlaps 2 use the briffaosborn blowing hot and cold annuallyresolved recons plus crowley boreholes not included for comparison because they are all scaled identically to the same nh extratropics temperatures and the mann version only includes that part of the nh we could include manns full nh recon as well but he would probably go ballistic and also the new mannjones mess 3 characterize the similarities between series using unrotated maybe rotated as well eof analysis correlation for pure similarity covariance for differences in amplitude as well and filtering on the reconstructions unfiltered 20yr highpass 10020 bandpass 100 lowpass to find out where the reconstructions are most similar and different use 1steof loadings as guide the comparisons of the power spectra could also be done i suppose 4 do these eof analyses on different time periods to see where they differ most eg running 100year eof windows on the unfiltered data running 300year for 20lp data something like that anyway and plot the 1steof loadings as function of time 5 discuss where the biggest differences lie between reconstructions this will almost certainly occur most in the 100 lowpass data taking into account data overlaps 6 point out implications concerning the next ipcc assessment and ebm forcing experiments that are basically designed to fit the lower frequencies if the greatest uncertainties are in the 100 year band then that is where the greatest uncertainties will be in the forcing experiments 7 publish retire and dont leave forwarding address without trying to prejudice this work but also because of what i almost think i know to be the case the results of this study will show that we can probably say fair bit about 100 year extratropical nh temperature variability at least as far as we believe the proxy estimates but honestly know fuckall about what the 100 year variability was like with any certainty ie we know with certainty that we know fuckall of course none of what i have proposed has addressed the issue of seasonality of response so what i am suggesting is strictly an empirical comparison of published 1000 year nh reconstructions because many of the same treering proxies get used in both seasonal and annual recons anyway so all i care about is how the recons differ and where they differ most in frequency and time without any direct consideration of their true association with observed temperatures i think this is exactly the kind of study that needs to be done before the next ipcc assessment but to give it credibility it has to have reasonably broad spectrum of authors to avoid looking like biased attack paper ie like soon and balliunas if you dont want to do it just say so and i will drop the whole idea like hot potato i honestly dont want to do it without your participation if you want to be the lead on it i am fine with that too cheers ed dr edward r cook doherty senior scholar and director treering laboratory lamontdoherty earth observatory palisades new york 10964 usa email drdendroldeocolumbiaedu phone 8453658618 fax 8453658152 xflowed
