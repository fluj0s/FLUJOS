on auditing lecture given on 26 may 1961 all right this is the 26th of may 1961 special briefing course saint hill now you may believe that good publicity in the newspapers will take scientology someplace you may believe that good public opinion on the part of the kings and presidents and janitors of the world will get scientology someplace and you may believe that itd be wonderful if the head of the bma or the ama or the qbcs or the ku klux klan or some other fascist organization would announce that he was in favor of scientology you may believe all these things have value well i want to tell you today that they have value of any kind whatsoever they are as sounding brass and the tinkle of the temple bell they are nothing if you get the idea that scientology will rise or fall by public opinion circa 1961 or 1960 you are very much mistaken they will have absolutely bearing on scientology it isnt necessarily that scientology belongs to the ages but this is vividly true vividly if you dont get results all the publicity good opinion in the world will do nothing your standard is quality not opinion from quality opinion stems the advance of this world does not depend on bunch of wogs who happen to be heading the bma the ama the ku klux klan or the worlds betterment association for emaciated cats it depends exclusively on better people and the more better people you turn out the better this world will be and that is the end of it it goes further than this it is behind this that my press policy has long been when the newspaper reporter knocks on the door let him climb the stairs so that you can kick him down them we care nothing for adverse publicity or publicity that is for us i certainly would not go ask the opinion of tinker on the quality of the atomic bomb now you say well people will beat trail to your doorstep if everybody is talking about how wonderful you are this is only seeking public approval when your case level is well enough up you couldnt care less about public approval now i dont say that im in the most wonderful shape that anybody has ever been in but i will tell you this i just couldnt care less whether there has been bad publicity good publicity rumors scrumors who cares my job consistently and continually has been over period of years to get the ammunition to the front that is all incidentally i try to handle administrative affairs and other things to make things run smoothly while things are going on but administrative affairs are always secondary to quality always secondary to quality if you make better mousetrap fellow by the name of emerson who is very much overquoted the whole world will beat trap to your door but nevertheless there is some item of truth in that if you want lots of preclears if you want lots of activity if you want lots of students you have to furnish the goods first last and always furnish the goods the world itself in its status that it is in today depends utterly upon whether or not you can produce better people it doesnt depend on the freakish political pronunciamento of the duke of algiers it doesnt depend on it for moment it doesnt depend on it whether the race hate society of north manchester or the race hate society of south cape town have anything whatsoever to say look ill call something to your attention the bma the ama the ku klux klan and all the rest of it have uniformly and routinely been expressing opinions for great many centuries and the world is better off if you see this in its proper perspective you will stop trying to fit yourself into the framework of the environment of society which is already going down the chute this is sort of senseless its rather senseless activity but what would happen if here and there in this society an able man suddenly arose what would happen well the society would recover as matter of fact southern rhodesia probably has yet to recover from the shock of clear appearing in its midst evidently this fellow had been one of the worst off fellows he kept walking into walls and into women and down manholes an auditor there cleared him and the two hundred employees that worked where this fellow worked couldnt get over it his family couldnt get over it nobodys gotten over it yet you see theyre all standing back in fantastic marvel about all this but that isnt the direct result what happens is that in his immediate vicinity it starts to get calm and things start to happen and he starts to get effective well now on this particular program of clearing we have not made very many clears yet but this program is only few months old it began actually at the end of january 1961 this new research for the better part of that period ive been trying to find out what people can do ive been trying to find out what auditors will do you see this is big difference between what should be done and what would be done im afraid that i have been well disciplined in this direction i have very often produced techniques which were rather resounding techniques but nobody ever used them so what good was the technique its something like building the better mousetrap and then somebody uses it to fill up the ballast of ship without ever setting it see it has bearing on the beautiful what could be done its what will be done that is important and since the end of january ive been trying to sort it out carefully on what will be done well you have the bulletin may the 25th 1961 which says preparatory steps for sop goals and apparently from the experience i have now had over telexes and at the other end of hgc lines this bulletin will be done people will do these two things if they know how to do them and they can learn how to do them rather easily so lets look at this whole subject of clearing as an effective activity which if effectively put into practice will bring about considerable resurgence of this particular civilization this is fairly obvious that this will happen and lets stop worrying about and dividing our time around amongst great many superficial activities that have bearing on much of anything lets just go ahead and get the show on the road im always asking this question when somebody threatens to sue or something like this we get threatened with suits every once in while suits for breathing suits for and its very interesting because ive be had to become an expert on the legal background of about five continents now and this is quite interesting because when they sue you in australia its quite different than being sued in the united states being sued in the united states is contest of trying to wait it out because of course itll almost never get to court as matter of fact as one of the most serious suits in the united states was fellow who had fraudulently obtained great deal of money from the organization and i think its been going on now for about two and half or three years or something like this and everybody has been fighting this thing and having an awful time with this thing and its operated along the administrative lines im talking now about the nonsense you see how you could split up your attention and get nothing done and its gone on continually thereve been attorneys and thereve been this and thereve been papers and despatches and cables about this now for the better part of three years and it was finally heard the other day and the plaintiffs lawyer failed to turn up in court and it was thrown out now weve heard of the plaintiff not turning up in court but the plaintiffs lawyer and that dismissed the suit in other words this thing that theyve been worrying about for three or the better part of three years and then when it finally comes to court why the judge throws it out because theres nobody standing in front of the bar i think if any one of you had the amount of money that had been spent on cable traffic and attorneys fees with regard to this suit why you could probably buy yourself very nice little car anyway look at the wasted time look at the tremendous wasted time of this activity so long since i have had method of adjudicating these things which i dont always apply but most of the time do and that is i try to find out what game is being played and if its not our game then i dont play it and this is the most disconcerting type of activity that people ever had to confront i look something over and soandso and soandso well so and so and so well all right well thats not our game that particular one thats not our game so therefore just end the game but then they start talking to about the moral principles of actually surrendering or apologizing or the moral principles of not fighting the situation or the this or the that or something of the sort or they talk to about the right ways to play the game you get the idea ah i just dont listen and this becomes very maddening to people when i say like this this fellow is busily suing us for 16 pounds 10 and obviously suzie has bad time with this because every once in while she comes in in high dudgeon and says look at the unfairness of this situation you see and it should be fought and i will say well how much is it and she says 16 pounds 10 and i say forget it oh i know but its unfair you see and its not just and so on and ill say well uh i so its not just claim so what pay it forget it skip it dont answer the letter who cares what you do with it its not our game were not solicitors this is amazing but do you know it keeps more randomity off the lines than you could possibly count you have to take some little countermeasure occasionally but you just take the measure to end that game you dont play that game see i know clearly what game im playing and what game we ought to be playing the game we ought to be playing is getting ourselves technically perfect with the mostest that can be learned and as soon as weve got that game straight and that ones all squared around well thats our game and frankly nothing can stand up against that type of game so all these other incidental nonsense games that people keep shoving in to you trying to say this is the game you should play in the society at this time and one of those games is publicity one of those games is newspaper one of those games is quote public opinion unquote south africa learned with horror that there were twentyeight people after newspaper blast who believed that our tests were longer valid and i think the whole organization worked day and night for two months on campaign to convince the public that our tests were valid oh that has nothing to do with the game were playing has nothing whatsoever to do with it the game we have to play is quality producing the results clearing and straightening up the human race thats the game were playing what does this have to do with public opinion and whether twentyeight people in johanne you know for the length of staff hours that were spent on this i could have called each one of them up on the telephone well i wouldnt say that i would do this but say well this is the president of witwatersrand university and ive just called up to tell you that the tests given at the johannesburg test centre are perfectly valid thank you very much goodbye if you want to play these games you can play some weird games but im afraid the opinion of twentyeight people very aberrated people probably down there in one of those deep rand mines eight thousand feet below the surface im afraid their opinion is not going to alter the course or destiny of scientology and theres sense in spending any time in on it well what is there sense in spending time on we know what can be done we have demonstrated it and demonstrated it i have been able to audit and produce results since about 1947 but i havent had vocabulary formed up that evidently communicated because were not talking english when we talk about the mind believe were not talking english nor are we talking latin or spanish or greek man has not known anything about the mind how could there possibly be language that described it and its taken quite long time trying to get some communicative syllables together that would mean something to thee and and get them clarified so that weve got our communication straight now thats scientologese theres something on the order of about 472 words in scientologese there are 8767942 latin terms that medical student must learn so i think were allowed 472 thats an exaggeration they actually wouldnt be able to remember that well but if you want to look at medical or psychiatric dictionary we have actually less terms in scientology than appear in the single classification chart used in germany we have less actual terms nauticalese now these days im amusing myself im taking shadow on the water and putting yacht under it and it takes some doing because i cant afford one of these big beautiful streamlined yachts like you write somebody check for hundred thousand pounds and say deliver to the front door with pink bow round its funnel and the probability is even if i could i wouldnt do it you talk about scientologese and its communication complications imagine this one nauticalese the language of the sea even confounds sailors on architects for instance ive had several letters recently where we were talking back and forth trying to find out what each other meant now here is language that goes back at least ten thousand years in its development its made out of egyptian and phoenician and greek and latin and scandihoovian anglosaxon frankly practically every nation has contributed something to this which now appears in some outrageous mispronunciation in this language called nauticalese and there must be several thousand words in the technical vocabulary of going to sea i have just run into this headon because ive decided to use spanish yard so i decided i would translate all my english nauticalese into spanish coo and i was impressed i was impressed with the tremendous vocabulary that i actually had to confront translating over and becoming able to use in brandnew language and its staggering its several thousand words we have now approximately 472 words in scientologese each one of these words means very definite and positive thing they are not susceptible to very much misinterpretation an engram is moment of pain and unconsciousness oddly enough give you an idea of the precision of the definition contained in mental image picture in the reactive bank of the pc now when you get precision definition you get package of understanding and these words are understanding packages but they are understandings which were never understood before therefore they couldnt be otherwise than new words but itd be very worthwhile to know those words because theyre packages of understanding i know right now i am working on the fringes of and have been for some little time dictionary of scientology which contains the precise upto date definition of each word weve been lacking that but remember weve also been lacking the ability to communicate to people how to clear people and weve also been lacking short and practical method of communicating with the preclears reactive bank and communicating with the pc well now when were able to communicate directly and immediately to the pc now is the time to publish dictionary because it means that we must have ended sort of cycle of communication do you follow that all right were in the business then of quality the production of results and not showing what we can do you see you dont make clear and then hang him up on the wall or hang him up on signboard this has nothing to do with it youre not showing people what you can do youre dealing with living beings and when you make living being that can really function effectively in the society you dont have to show people what you can do things will get done you get the enormous difference you put him out there in the society or hes functioning in the society and hes happy as clam about what youve done for him and hes happy as clam about what hes doing and now you get new functional aspect youre building society youre not trying to show society that you are doing something now i know the economics of the situation sometimes press upon us to have to represent this or that or attract public attention all right thats okay but ill give you this lesson i myself to keep things going have undoubtedly from the viewpoint of many people overstressed what we could do you understand well do nothing more serious than that than hold it up as good example hold it up as an example well ron said we could do this and that and we werent able to do this and that so therefore this was not good thing to do all right therefore after this lets just do good job of it and then you see this thing will work out in total reverse you understand see i dont mean to apologize for cause all of my reality on scientology is based first and foremost on what i can do and then secondarily on what i see other people near do with scientology and after that it sort of fogs out im not positive about what can happen out there beyond line of sight for one of the reasons is i get fallacious reports on it all the time people are telling the weirdest wildest things and i go check up on these things and write people indignant letters and say why did you do soandso i think one of these rampages i went on one time resulted in the death of person pc had died as result of very poor auditing indeed very very bad auditing indeed from my point of view and i jumped all over the auditor and this was many many years ago and the auditor up and died this was here in england it was considerable shock to but looking over the thing i found out the pc had been inclined toward death for many years and as result it was rather inevitable that the pc should kick the bucket and that it wasnt the auditors fault you get the idea there was actually false representation about the bad quality of that auditing you understand the auditing wasnt that bad now of course people expect to stand back and go on big withhold thats good way to damage somebody so they expect to get on big withhold about everything that goes on well im not on this kind of withhold what we are doing is what we are doing not what i would like to make it look like all kinds of things have happened this has been rather dramatic arena for the last eleven years its rather fantastic some of the things that have happened one way or the other this way or that good or bad but the good of the last eleven years doesnt just overbalance the scales it practically goes through the ground with thud its tremendous tremendous i the letters which i get rather routinely the people that come up to at congresses the people i stumble into one way or the other letter i get out of the blue of course you dont remember because it was way back in 1952 but you audited for two hours and it was tremendous experience and evidently the experiment failed because you turned over to another auditor after that but it was tremendous and it changed my whole life and i have been well ever since and now i want to thank you very much for that experience this nine years later and before organizations letter from fellow thank you very much for saving my foot they were going to cut it off and you came in and audited and i didnt know who you were or where you were until i saw an article about you the other day in time magazine the article says hubbard is bum hes rat you know my fan mail doesnt answer up to the quality of the article but the lesson we can learn out of all this is if we want to get anything done we better do it in other words we shouldnt put up for instance science and then have various armed services become very enamored with this idea and then put us to work you think i want to work for some armed service you know i resigned from the united states navy in 1950 when they tried to pull in and put to work on the subject of research in the human mind they might have been writing to people well were we keep all kinds of records on dianetics we keep records on dianetics and they had standard letter which the united states navy bureau of personnel i think ive seen so many copies of it scientologists have sent in so many copies of it it must be just form letter and its to the effect that theyre keeping files and watching it carefully but in 1950 they tried to kidnap they told that i would be returned to active service to do this research if i did not return to do so as in civilian capacity at high pay arc break now theyre very equivocal to the public they dont know now all of sudden eleven years after the fact theyve suddenly awakened once more and they have some of our people in the united states now doing the security checking for them which is apparently official im supposed to softpedal this im not supposed to say anything about the bureau of naval intelligence one of the reasons why nobody can really list us as red in the united states is very interesting reason is because i was once an officer of the bureau of naval intelligence and of course they have my full record so every time anybody tries to clobber one of our organizations with being red organization or communist associated or something like that it runs through the files and runs into this fact now that first service with which i had contact has now turned around and is apparently using scientology you say well this is great it isnt great ah to clear up the chief of naval operations now that would be great if one of you were to write letter and say that you had made clear out of the chief of naval operations i would say now were getting somewhere but that the chief of naval operations has written long letter saying how wonderful he thinks scientology might be for some of his junior officers im afraid i would not pay too much attention to it now perhaps by understanding these attitudes of mine youll be able to understand the course of publicity and what we do and what we dont do little more easily the final analysis of an auditor is not what good press agent he is but how well he can audit the final analysis of an organization is not what good press department it has but how well it can train and process people that is the final test there is further test finance the amount of money person makes is some index of success it always is in this society but it operates as an index of success this person is that able i dont care how many rabblerousers are going around saying people who make money are good it is always an index of certain amount of service the amount of money that person makes but look if it is not an index of service then it must be dishonest money right so your basic mission is the delivery of quality in service and that is the only mission weve got now if we can do this and if we ourselves in the process get the bonus of getting clear this gets to be pretty darn terrific youve got the fundamental building blocks under new civilization you havent got bunch of rickety props holding up rickety civilization and i dont think too well of this idea of holding up bunch of clunks that how many wars have we had within our own memories its quite numerous isnt it well war is symptom of insanity how many broad cataclysms of one character or another have are we not being piloted through you think you can bolster this thing up im afraid not but you can lay the fundamentals and foundations of new civilization not new order brandnew thing brandnew thing not by saying to people you must do soandso and you mustnt do soandso or were going to shoot you that is the old pattern but actually having in their midst people who do know what theyre doing and who are not guided by their aberrations now if that thing all by itself could happen you would get new civilization it isnt up to us to tell people what kind of civilization they should have it is more up to us to put it in their reach to have one and thats what man has never been able to do before the whole mission of the special briefing course at saint hill is making people able to get results and if we dont do that then we have failed utterly thats the whole mission now part of getting people to get results of course is part and parcel of this other idea of putting able people into existence so you notice that unlike an acc here you are being processed directly and immediately by staff auditors youre not puttering around over another case while that other case putters around over you you get the idea i mean thats not what were trying to do and were getting rather fast results this way now these results may not look fast to you but theyre fast enough tolerance of change has an awful lot to do with how fast the result occurs now youre changing peoples tolerance to change all the time but you have to redu increase their tolerance to change before you can change them so it goes up on sort of of swaybacked curve it starts in very slowly and then it starts going faster thats because tolerance to change is coming up change is pain to most people because the fundamental of change is simply shift in space of location its shift of location in space that is what change is you have space and then you have shift of location this is very interesting and you have this other factor called time which is actually basically just postulate but time is change on mechanical level it isnt shift in space per unit of time because that would be shift in space per unit of shift in space that sounds kind of weird when you start thinking it over rate of change is something i had an awful hard time getting through my head in engineering school i mean it was one of these things rate of change i never could understand why this thing just wasnt quite right rate of change and then i eventually found out the reason it isnt quite right is that rate of change is measured by rate of change and everybody was pretending to that rate of change was measured by constant called time which wasnt any change which was just some odd phenomena of some kind or another it was phenomenon that sort of drifted around in our midst and had nothing to do with it you see time has temperature yeah theres startler time has temperature time has certain temperature if you dont believe it put some meat in the ice box doesnt decay as fast does it put it out in the sun in august it decays much more rapidly doesnt it ah yes you say but this is the decomposition of the bacteria which is operating against the roodlepuffs it isnt time is temperature i dont know what that temperature is in kelvin but now that i know that time is temperature i can find it and the moment i find the exact temperature i could make any area at any given instant timeless or speed its time up i know that sounds very strange but this is great discovery in physics only you know about it but it is great discovery in physics its rather staggerer we have several of them c is not constant is one of them you know the constant they use in atomic physics is not constant the speed of light is not constant it varies well yes you say well within all practical purposes it doesnt vary but now whats this practical purposes whose practical purposes now heres something else the speed of light depends upon the velocity of emission so c is not constant thats one of these discoveries another one is zero is variable and of course every time you have zero in an equation youve got trouble and mathematicians since time immemorial have known this all you have to do is divide by zero or multiply by zero or something and something weird happens in the equation and you mustnt do that and yet these fellows have never deduced from this the horrible truth that zero is variable there is absolute called zero ill give you an idea you say well theres nothing nothing of what and the second youve said nothing of what well there could be nothing of ton of apples and there could be nothing of pinch of sand well which is the greater figure the nothing of the ton of apples or the nothing of the grain of sand so in other words zero is fabulous variable and accounts actually for what they call inelegantly the bugger factor in physics its technical term in physics its also technical term in the navy but we wont go into that im sorry to bring it up but zero is variable and apparently if you divide by zero youre in trouble and you add you can apparently add zeros without too much difficulty unless youre dealing with money and you now wherever you have holes of this character in the basic sciences of civilization of course you have trouble they cant quite handle this particular zone or area and it keeps getting out from underneath them and trouble keeps occurring now zero and the constant of time most got out of control with the atomic bomb and produced oddly enough difficulty with thing called temperature because the atomic bomb is very hot and when exploded in amongst city or over the top of it succeeds in roasting the population rather thoroughly and the only real there is that theres nobody around to eat them i think or some zero is variable and they didnt know it c is not constant and they didnt know that and they got this trouble called temperature and hot temperatures and bad temperatures and so on well theres some odd things about this when the atomic bomb was exploded in hiroshima nothing moved for twenty minutes not even the twenty minutes something weird happened with time and most of the survivors and some of the data that comes out of there if you read it carefully theres hardly any record that doesnt mention time some disturbance of time well if time is temperature and you get tremendous temperature alteration youre certainly probably going to do something with time right thats going to mess up now thats as far as i am into it at the present moment only i know now for sure that time is temperature and that is brandnew principle of physics but what this present society at this particular time doesnt know is basically that it doesnt know that we have also discovered for instance we have diplomats running around settling problems on international affairs which could have enormous consequence and they dont know that they dont know anything about diplomacy they couldnt possibly because their efforts result dont they in wars and upsets and so on all right so there is another factor that we are dealing with is that it is very extremely dangerous thing to not know that you dont know apparently that is probably the greatest there is to have an area of knowingness which you dont know that you dont know well what is scientology doing to the society at large isnt it telling the society at large rather consistently and continually that it doesnt know it doesnt know that it doesnt know and its apparently painful for them to confront the fact that they do but your best road your best road is to find out what you dont know and remedy the situation that is always road to wisdom its not selfcancellation you know or cancelling out what you do know but its just finding out what honestly what you dont know and as soon as you know what you dont know you are far wiser than you were moment before so that all study should actually begin on the basis of finding out what you dont know not finding out something new now thats rather odd thing but it becomes very clear in just moment several of you have had assessments on sop goals and have come up with your goal and have come up with your terminal do you feel different about existence do you feel different about existence yeah kind of weird isnt it well now that is the exact same principle applied look it few years ago decade or so ago you didnt know that you didnt know this did you and then for while you found out that you didnt know what you didnt know but you knew you didnt know something do you remember not knowing but knowing that you didnt know what your goal and terminals was well its an odd feeling isnt it but do you know that is way in advance of not knowing that you dont know anything about it see its an increase even if its uncomfortable its an increase of knowledge now all of sudden as youre running in auditing youre finding out more and more about this terminal and more and more about this goal you see coo whats this and great deal more knowingness and wisdom is at your command than was before right but it had to be entered in upon at its rockest rock bottom with finding out that you didnt know about it and oddly enough the only thing that is wrong with your case is that vast area of their own beingness that they dont even know they dont know about and thats what makes them aberrated all right lets say some fellow up here is going into the subject of lets say some fellow in parliament and hes beating the drum he is absolutely sick to the point of nausea over the fact that these poor herring are being slaughtered off of iceland and hes just having one awful time you see about this and hes just causing all sorts of fuss and consequences of one character or another and he wants to sign treaties and suppress the catching of herring or something but he doesnt even know that hes trying to suppress catching of herring hes just trying to pass what he calls fish conservation regulations or something like this all of which will amount to catching more herring much more brutally he doesnt know that he spent his whole last life as fisherman catching herring off of iceland nor would he even know that this would open him up for the consequence you see with this many overts on herring of now protecting herring madly but what he also wouldnt know that this reactive obsession with protecting herring will only lead him to slaughter of herring you see what he doesnt know so of course hes very unhappy man because he doesnt know where hes going why hes doing it he has practical solution because if he did get one he himself would be the first to defeat it now hes in puzzle hes going around in circles what it would mean for the destiny of england if you in this room were suddenly turned loose as crew to find the immediate four last lives on every member of the house of commons itd be fantastic itd be fantastic there are fellows there who just got through being officials in india indians who are now running english bodies thats for sure there are people there who are doing this who are doing that who are doing the other thing they have understanding of why they are doing it but because they dont they will immediately come off with defeat whatever they try to do they will defeat themselves thats part of the aberration so we have whole bureau of the government or big department of the government set up to prevent war do you know that its going to prevent war madly day and night but because its doing it reactively not analytically it is going to do nothing but bring on war what they resist they become because its all reactive they have way of handling this whatsoever thats why i say not that you cant do anything about the society as it exists but that the best remedy for the existing society is to put able men amongst it and the first thing you do when you do that is put men amongst it who will one know and two will know when they dont know and that way youve opened up the whole highway toward enlightenment education and future for this race now the bulletin to get down to much more practical matters the bulletin of may the 25th 1961 gives how to bring about release its the preparatory steps of sop goals how you bring about release now whats release person is release who knows he wont get any worse that is the oldest definition there is to release when he finds out hes not going to get any worse now you can call him release and he knows hes not going to hit the skids and go so thats very low definition very low order of definition i mean its very very low state of case actually but it is far better than nonrelease because this fellow knows at least that he isnt there yet see he knows that well miss zilch up here selling lingerie in london doesnt know that see and neither does some fellow wearing enormous ceremonial robes up in london either he doesnt know it either they know theyre going to get worse amongst their knowledge and that theres nothing can be done about it so the first test of release is just that they know theyre not going to get any worse now what would release look like on an emeter well you would have your sensitivity fairly low on mark iv british meter you would have your sensitivity fairly low down here and you would get something on the order of wholedial swing or little bit better than that when you squeeze the cans you ask him to squeeze the cans with the sensitivity all the way off its going to go plong it doesnt have to hit the pin and come back over and hit the other pin in other words it doesnt have to be seven or eight dials but its your meter manifestation is something of that order and the tone arm here is not too far goofy see its not down here at 12 or its not over here at 65 it doesnt say that auditing wont put it there but it does say that it stays down here in the middle range someplace 25 30 35 40 something like this its going to be in that zone ordinarily if youd pick the fellow up anytime during the day and put him on an emeter if he werent being audited why hed strike into the 25 30 40 range hed be in here someplace that would be kind of an emeter manifestation of what release is now i had question the other day which was quite interesting and that was the people who have loose needles at low sensitivity must be bad off because they dont get much needle action when you ask them charged questions well lookahere the looser the needle gets the less charge is effective on the person so of course the questions get less drop and you may get into situation where you have to jack up your sensitivity on looseneedle case to get off the little tiny withholds because they dont really think theyre withholds but at the same time those withholds dont prevent them from being audited what do you know pt problem will prevent this person from being audited but little tiny withhold hed still stay insession on it you got it now the state of release is more then than the fact the fellow knows hes not getting any worse probably that he knows hes getting better this is quite important quite an important thing for person to be able to get to that state that is the first most important step on the ladder to clear he knows he isnt going to get any worse well this would mean at the same time that he has reality on scientology he knows it works so he knows there is remedy to make him better this would also then be part of the test of release does he have reality on scientology he knows itll clear things up that appears to be something thats merely selfcongratulatory to scientology but it isnt the fellow knows that he can get someplace with it thats important he knows he can go someplace he knows theres higher zone or area that he can go into all right the next thing if you were to make release test and get very rough about the test and actually upgrade the state considerably so that you would be sure this fellow isnt going to fall on his head you would have your help control and communication levels in such state that when you say communication to this fellow he doesnt flinch and fall off the pin and get very upset or the needle doesnt instantly stick you got the idea you dont get then bad needle reaction on these buttons of help communication and control those are pretty good then now you know this fellow is going to be credit to you before you start patting him on the back actually its slight deception because the fellow is release before you establish this point but now weve got the further point is this fellow going to be able to hold his own and for our own satisfaction then we require that he isnt going to get oddball needle reactions just because you say communicate to him or help to him or control to him and then for sure youve got release and thats all the state of release is now that is the state of release actual the fellow knows he isnt going to get any worse and hes got reality on scientology and he knows its working see if fellow knows scientology is working he has reached state where he can asis by inspection certain things so therefore he will tell you scientology works when fellow tells you scientology doesnt work he doesnt have the ability to asis by inspection you got that it is nothing more complicated than that when these people go around talking about scientology doesnt work scientology does work you know one or the other phooey theyre just saying i can asis by inspection or i am totally incapable of doing cottonpicking thing with my bank thats all theyre saying to you in actuality all right so you have this these two first conditions that is the actual state of release so that you would actually have then another condition special type of release which wed call tested release or stable release which would be the fellow had adverse needle reactions on the buttons of help control and communication do you follow that well at that stage you can issue him certificate and lapel button i mean he hes all right now this doesnt say that if he gets tangled up with fire engine and loses his grandmother on whom he dotes utterly that he isnt going to practically go into flat spin because life still is very much capable of putting the thumbscrews on our boy you understand but hell be able to come through it better than he ever would have been able to before all right now lets take our next state up and the next state up is actually mest clear and mest clear is simply somebody who has floating needle with the sensitivity well off and who doesnt get reactions on normal routine questions and who is reading at the time he ends his processing at 30 for male and 20 for female 20 for female he she has floating needle 30 for male has floating needle and under ordinary questions about life and so forth you dont get any needle reaction thats mest clear and thats all there is to mest clear thats the total test reaction whats important to you about it is that mest clear isnt stable so just as we have the stable or tested release so do we have the stable or tested clear and it takes lot more sop goals to stabilize clear after he is clear see he reaches mest clear now weve got to make stable clear now thats quite important and you just run more goals you just find more goals and more terminals and try to audit them and they actually start blowing by inspection because the keynote and the common denominator of any case is the better off it is the more it can blow by inspection the more it can asis by inspection and you get somebody who is in the zone of clear and i wont tell you that firetruck running into him wont mess him up but i will tell you that the engram has persistence his healing rate is fabulous thats because he can asis the incident he looks it over and it blows now trying to run an incident on somebody whose tone arm is 12 whose sensitivity is 16 and whose needle is just like glue matter what you say to him now were going to run an engram on him of course we get him into the beginning of the engram and that sticks him hes better off because he was actually in the beginning of the engram hes better off in now that he doesnt know now what is in the rest of the engram and if he were never going to get any more auditing hed never find out either all right compare this to trying to run an engram on him on release well youd probably be able to flatten engram on release in maybe three four hours two three hours something like this even if you did it pretty badly you see its kind of sloppy auditing but an engram being flattened on clear if you could find it if it would react you know the fellow has just fallen down and had an accident or something like this and you get reaction on this thing the process of looking for it and trying to locate what happened is the end of the engram but on the other hand he could put up the engram again and could react again if you ask him to and he might do it to be pleasant and then you would probably get reaction on it but hell do this to relatively slight extent in other words its thinkingness has an effect upon the bank that is the common denominator of all case states up to clear how much effect does his thinkingness have the on bank now you first start person in you see giving the person sop goals is pretty therapeutic actually giving him goals assessment it goes along slowly youre using one of the oldest processes known repeater technique coupled with another old old process of about 1957 which is goals processing and these two are actually processes youre not running them for processes youre trying to find the goal thats the reason youre running them but they are processes and they do result in therapeutic gain for the case which is pretty good but you will notice at the beginning of goals assessment that the length of time it takes to get goal to null on some cases practically make you hold your head i mean the goal stays in and stays in and stays in and stays in and stays in and then all of sudden gets little less and then little tiny bit less and then little tiny bit less and then little tiny bit less and then it disappears whereas toward the end of your goals assessment let us say youve gone on an heroic longstretch goals assessments thats going to take about thirtyfive to fifty hours and dont be surprised if one takes that long sometimes you get goal you repeat it twice and it disappears you see thats how fast thinkingness is able to effect make an effect upon the reactive bank thats all there is to that that is the common denominator of all cases psycho the bank has total effect upon him and he has effect of any kind on the bank effect on the bank he cannot control this in the faintest so that he does everything it says psycho is actually an engram bank in full dramatization whether hes computing psycho or dramatizing psycho see the individual not only cant have any effect on the bank this would be utterly unthinkable the bank has total effect upon him you see now he gets up to the point where he doesnt really have any effect on the bank but it isnt really total effect upon him then we get up to the grade the person has little bit of an effect on the bank and then we get up to higher grade of the person can affect the bank quite easily and then we get up to higher grade of where what bank thatd be your common denominator of cases now the thing you should do to encourage field auditors to encourage scientologists who dont know too much about this new routine you who are here at saint hill the things that you should say to them is may 25th 1961 hcob follow it very closely because therell be two or three clearing series books more than that therell be four or five clearing series books which amplify it in other words by reading these books you could do this other thing the may 25th bulletin and that is to produce release but this is pretty high quality of release youre producing with this you see this is pretty high actually it is something like building with an engineering factor of safety of about hundred you know you know most bridges are built to take five times as much weight as theyll ever be called upon to take well in this particular case if youre using this hcob may 25th youre building about hundred times as much stress as is required to qualify for release you see but you tell them to do that one thats the one to do and to leave goals assessments alone and not to fool with goals assessments until they have had special training in them and that way you could do the most good for auditors around you actually could it theres nobody trying now to compartment up things so that theres the nobility and the plebeians amongst auditors you understand i mean nobodys trying to do this im just trying to get every moment of auditing to count thats all now supposing all the auditing done around the world supposing every hour of it counted wow it would be big gain supposing there were none of this wasted at all all right i just had case today of fellow whod just had seventy five hours of auditing and he claims that hes in ruins and in flinders and hes made advance of any kind whatsoever well ive asked for total review of the case but i inevitably will find that somebody has been trying to assess case who didnt know how and spent great deal of that seventyfive hours messing around with an assessment and then that the person didnt know how to do security check and then that the person didnt know how to do an assessment or make up fiveway bracket for running and of course seventyfive hours went up the spout well its just silly to waste auditing like that but you can encourage people to learn to use an emeter and to give security check youll find them very interested in learning how to give security checks how to use an emeter and how to give security check that should be the most elementary action that person could undertake with it because you see if person cant do security check and get each level asked clear he cant ever clear rudiments so he shouldnt be auditing the pc should he ah so your first task would be to get somebody to be able to do security check all right if he learns how to do security check and can do security check well and can get every level clear and get the reaction off of the needle at every level as he goes down and wind up at the end absolutely confident that the pc at that stage of case of course at certain stages of case naturally pc does not know all of his withholds dont go on the basis that at any given moment pc knows everything he is withholding because you see hes withholding it from himself the only reason you dont remember your past track 100 percent is that youre withholding it from you forget withhold you understand well now the keynote of this case that made progress during the seventyfive hours is that the auditor gave him at least two security checks and the case is complaining that his memory hasnt improved add those up ahhhh that means that there was security check given that was effective in the least bit because if any security check particulary this new joburg hco ww form 3 you mean that can be given to person all the way down the line and his memory doesnt improve oh come off of it nobody could convince of that you see because i know exactly what forgetfulness is memory trouble and forgetfulness is withholdingness thats all you pull few withholds off somebody and his memory improves i imagine your memory when you were little shaver and had just busted the cookie jar ill bet you you couldnt remember the top of the house from the basement for few minutes you know for day or two or three you were going around i hope nobody finds out who busted the cookie jar you know and your attention is all involved with this and youre withholding it from people and then youve undoubtedly had this odd phenomenon happen you forgot that you did it well withholding things from people results in withholding things from self and when you cure up withholding things from people you stop withholding lot of things from self so the inevitable result of security check would be an improvement of memory right somebody says i want my memory improved security check the living daylights out of him now security check represents what the person knows he is withholding at any given instant and few little borderline things that hed forgotten he was withholding see those will come up too now hes got to have an increase of well you could say sloppily hes got to have case gain we could be much more technical he has to have an increase of responsibility on the dynamies before hell get different security check pattern now if you increase his responsibility he is going to remember bunch more withholds ah the second that you increase his social responsibility personal responsibilities familial responsibility he all of sudden is going to remember bunch more withholds lord help the fellow who has his responsibility increased without getting them pulled without getting the withholds pulled god help somebody who is going over that hurdle because you know whatll happen lessening the overt comes in under that category the individual has made his withholds and overts all right by lessening the withhold lessening the overt and hes pushed it out of sight he says well the central organization isnt any good anyway so it was perfectly all right for to do mean things to it and then one fine day one fine day he suddenly discovers that the central organization is doing the best it possibly can for him and does him an enormous favor and the withhold unlessens his withhold you know the overt the overt gets up in size he realizes its an overt see it was perfectly all right before it was all explained because the central organization was good but all of sudden he finds out the central organization was some good and immediately the overt that he had notised springs up into full life and beingness and he gets very unhappy he becomes miserable he comes slinking in the front door afraid to look at anybody and if he dares confront the organization at all you get the idea now thats the unlessening of the overt some fellow said one time you know when i was sixteen my father knew nothing absolutely nothing he was the most ignorant man i ever had met in my whole life and by the time i was twentyone it was surprising how much that fellow had learned now supposing this were accompanied at the same time by realizing that the guy was some good see lets say he wasnt fairly standard circle lets say he was finally fairly good guy and all of sudden the overt appears everything youve done to this guy suddenly swells up now when youve done lot of overts to somebody who then kicks the bucket and then you found out they were perfectly innocent of all the things you accused them of you feel terrible why the overt unlessened because the reverse process is the one engaged in to make oneself feel comfortable one lessened the overt by saying the target for the overts was good perfectly all right to do to this fellow he was only bum he was good now all of sudden we find out he isnt bum and this unsettles the basic human mechanism of making our overts all right you see this is weird mechanism well now the same mechanism occurs under the heading of responsibility and responsibility goes this way the individual is totally irresponsible in the society and hes going around robbing lollipops from little babies and hes doing all sorts of weird things in the society and he didnt consider this was wrong but now his responsibility increases and all of sudden he says hey what do know ive stolen lollipops from little babies and that wasnt so good at that moment it becomes withhold you will have criminals tentimers you know theyve just been in and out of the jail doors so fast that they might have caught pneumonia in the breeze you know theyll sit down oh yes i murdered this fellow and i robbed that one and i did this and i did that and theres not even tremble on that meter yeah raped marred and burned took an old ladys false teeth kicked her in the head knocked her down the stairs yes i routinely went around and upset wheelchairs with cripples in them you know yeah oh yeah yeah oh ive been bad boy all right i sure have and you dont get tremble on the meter the guys social responsibility is so microscopically small that he doesnt regard any of them as necessary to withhold and that is the definition of criminal and why criminals are rather dangerous fellows to have around because nothing they do has any faintest bearing on anything theyre irresponsible in other words theyre at the behest of the reactive bank and they have nothing to say about it at all all right youll say someday when youre doing security check you didnt get reaction on the needle but you asked the fellow well did you ever burgle anyone you know and the fellow says oh yes yes at this place and that place and the other place and so forth and then i was there i remember this and they sent to the pen in cincinnati for doing that and then i came over and i was in wormwood scrubs and uh uh youll say boy hey im really getting somewhere with this case aw the hell you are he isnt confessing hes bragging he doesnt consider these withholds hes trying to convince you hes dangerous man and it is all too easy to think you have really done good security check on this person because he does have things that the needle will fall on that are withholds you do security check by the needle not by the conversation its not what you would consider withhold but what the person being checked considers withhold got the idea with lot of criminals its out there on second substitute his pal the things he wont tell you about his pals and you can go right back over security check that person has passed with the greatest of ease hes told you rape murder sudden death revenge arson oh yes yes desertion mutiny he goes down the line yes oh yes yes yes and you say well im really getting someplace needle isnt doing anything see im really getting someplace and so forth well dont make that mistake when you get to the end of it and you dont think youve gotten any place and that needle hasnt wobbled and this case is better off than he was before youre going to have to do another security check on this fellow in some other guise or wise youre going to have to find out what are withholds to this guy and youll very commonly find theyre about his pal so ask just hobsonjobson the whole security check into second dynamic proposition do you know of anyone being burgled do you know of anyone burgling anybody in other words ohh clang oh i cant tell that dayd rub out its by the meter the meter reacts on what the person is withholding and the security check is not designed to do check on the life story of john q criminal see it is designed to get off what he considers withholds so that would be one of the little fine points about giving security check so this seventyfivehour pc was undoubtedly sitting there giving all sorts of long and sad stories about all the mad and mean horrible things hed done but on none of those security checks did the auditor look at the meter to see if he was getting reaction on what the pc was talking about and he didnt probe around with those security check questions until he did get reaction and then get it off do you see how smart you have to be to give security check in other words you run security check by the meter not by the life history of the person and you say well youve ever burgled anyone ah needle doesnt do anything and he says well yes there was doakes and buthernther nuthr and you say well thank you thank you good good thank you all right good all right now do you know of anybody who ever burgled anyone ahhhh huhuhuhuhuhuhuh thats different ahhhuhhuhmmbluthhmhm huhuhuummhuhuhbuhummmhuhmmm you get this kind of twist around you have to find out where the guy lives on the responsibility scale in order to do good security check and you have to pull those things which can be made to fall all right now you turn around and what do you do you give him an assessment on the prehav scale and you just run up that prehav scale assessment and the very best way to do it is to find the level that ticks and then find the secondary scale and then go over the whole secondary scale until you find the level that goes clang and then you take the level that goes clang and you run it on the person in fiveway bracket on the subject of something or someone or make up your fiveway bracket you can say something to the person you get fall you say someone to the person you get fall so your fiveway bracket is made up on something you get the idea you have to test your auditing command which is another subject entirely but in other words you give him this run on the prehav scale you flatten out the motion on the tone arm and when the motion ceases to be wild on the tone arm and comes down and gets rather narrow you give him another assessment on the prehav scale and you run him with another fiveway bracket till the motion comes out of it now you havent assessed this person you dont have this persons terminal you know or anything like that and when you flatten off this second run you pick up your joburg security check sheet new one fresh form and you roll up your sleeves and you give him new security check and you are all of sudden going to find that he has withholds that he never suspected before now what is this all about it means that the individuals responsibility rises with the general run on the prehav scale and it brings him up to bunch of zones and areas where the overts have unlessened the targets of the overts have unlessened and if you dont get those withholds off and those overts off as they come up of course the case will make further progress from there on hell be in agony i saw this happen to fellow one time he had tremendous he was an organizational staff member and he had tremendous overts on the organization none of them very criminal but the more he they audited him the worse off he got it was his opinion there was nobody in the organization that was any good the organization was good and that everything it was selling was blue sky when he found out this wasnt the case hed been sitting back there in lord knows what corner of his medulla oblongata he was living in if he was living in that it was probably the back of the tip of his right his grandmothers right ear all of sudden all these overts unlessened see they became overts after that they were perfectly justified but they suddenly werent justified anymore because the organization was some good coo how horrible and the guy just went into misery he just went into agony it was in johannesburg but we werent using johannesburg security checks along with auditing at that particular time and he moped and he moped and he moped and the more the more effective the auditing got the worse the fellow felt look that over naturally if hes been saying scientology is good to himself all the time and yet here is scientology working on him like mad obviously scientology is some good therefore the overts were on scientology he was being processed into his tomb practically and the only way he finally saved his bacon was fly out of the organization and take up job that didnt bring him into very much contact with scientology he did do that too you get the exact mechanism which was proceeding there as the individual went along then and improved in his case mechanism existed to thoroughly pull off all of his overts on life so unless you pull off the persons overts on life fairly routinely as youre auditing him as contained crudely viciously and meanly in the johannesburg security check the person can get miserable under auditing gains see hes suddenly waking up and he realizes that there are some people around who arent total tramps amongst them you his auditor or something like this and this makes all of the meanness of his actions against you suddenly recoil on him well all right if you believe in poetic justice dont give him johannesburg security check just keep auditing him on as effective an auditing regimen as the prehav scale general runs youll practically kill him you see why hes gaining in responsibility therefore his overts are looking bigger and bigger and bigger to him and then dont give him any opportunity to get them off at all just skip that and go on and improve his case and improve his case and improve his case and improve his case and dont give him any chance whatsoever to get off that and of course he will get into double twisteroo his case doesnt dare improve because itd kill him and he sets his heels and makes auditing gains you got the idea now theres the exact mechanism behind this may 25th hcob bulletin now this is what field auditors ought to be doing they ought to learn their how to do security check and they ought to learn how to give general runs on prehav scale and if they could do those two things they would be in the stars they would be getting case gains all over the place do you see that every hour of auditing they put in would have some effectiveness and usefulness before it furthermore they would make release and that is how you make release you give the fellow security check this puts him in communication with you to some extent enough for the purposes of auditing and then you assess him on the prehav scale primary secondary scale and then you run the level in fiveway bracket and you flatten one level you flatten two levels thats probably enough now pick up the security check and give him new security check and youre going to find some new things have turned up you get those things off and he is now happy to progress some more otherwise he wont be happy to progress any more because hes got these overts one way or the other so you give him his new security check and then you assess him and you run him on two more levels on the general prehav scale and then you give him another security check and youre going to find out that every security check is bit different and warning if the security checks arent bit different he hasnt had any gain in responsibility and is making case progress so the johannesburg security check serves another purpose it serves the purpose of telling you total absence of graphs and tests it tells you whether or not the case is making any gain and if the case is making gain then theres obviously these two things exist first and foremost he either is suffering with tremendous arc break with you or hes being audited straight up against present time problem one of those two things exist if hes making case gain thats all that exists by the way because youre going to get all the withholds with johannesburg security check so it reduces case gain down to fantastic arc breaks or horrendous present problems now how do you handle somebodys present time problem supposing you were field auditor who didnt have any education along this line at all and you were giving somebody present time problem sortout and this is the second time the person has come in to you with tremendous present time problem with his motherinlaw and it just seems that this one is getting in your road all the time now ill let you in on something it would be very easy for you to do this little less easy for somebody else to do this you would assess the person on the prehav scale primary scale only dont spend any time at it assess this person in the pt problem in other words the personnel of the pt problem on the prehav scale and run maybe two three brackets only because look its such microscopic piece of track that it wont run any time and your twentyminute rule disappears instantly the second that you handle the prehav scale the twentyminute rule vanishes you couldnt run twenty minutes on level on his former wife you just couldnt do it you see youre running it by name and you just couldnt run that that that you could run it on wife or something like this because this has got some track to it but you couldnt run it that way you got it all right now youd have to sort out then your rudiments and this can get sometimes very tricky sorting out your rudiments model session trs and so forth this can get out this can be very tricky various things can happen there are various booboos can be made one way or the other the pc selfaudits himself between sessions is one of them pc has had tremendous bustup of some kind or another between sessions and you dont detect it and you audit him in spite of it in other words youve got present time problems or something of the sort messed up here but you did you mishandled the rudiments thats all this amounts to something went wrong with the rudiments and when i say something went wrong with the rudiments i simply mean the person wasnt set up to go into session now there are ways of doing rudiments with meter but theres also your power of observation and the pc comes in with one arm in sling well now you dont put him on the emeter to find out if hes had an accident to his arm you get the idea the pc has been very very able to talk to you in all other sessions and this session isnt saying word something has changed here well youd better find out what it is even though youve started the session you know and the pc formerly has been able to be communicated with you is perfectly happy is perfectly cheerful in being audited and in everythings going along fine or is awfully mean in being audited and is awfully vicious and all of sudden isnt mean or vicious id sort of keep my eye open on it maybe the pc is sunk into apathy or something could be you see or the pcs gotten better i would at least ask him have you have you experienced any peculiar or particular change that you have noticed between the last session and now the pc would say oh yes ive decided ill live well this would account for his longer being mean but these wild changes that occur without your auditing are something that you should suspect the commonest action is the pc leaves the session with the tone arm at 30 and returns to the next session with the tone arm at 50 now something has gone on between sessions thats for sure but this straight routine using your trs and model session getting johannesburg security check then running couple of runs general on the prehav scale and johannesburg security check is what you ought to tell field auditors to do and tell people to do who dont know how to do sop goals you got the idea all right thank you
