carol migdalovitz specialist in middle eastern affairs foreign affairs defense and trade division congressional research service the library of congress turkey update on selected issues summary prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and his justice and development party akp remain popular and have firm hold on power in turkey the akp is trying to recast itself from an islamistrooted party to centrist conservative democratic party although some akp actions fuel secularist suspicions of hidden islamist agenda the high priority that the party gives to attaining european union eu membership may mitigate fears about its intentions and support its centrist ambitions the government remains focused on the economy with the aid of the international monetary fund imf it has undertaken major macroeconomic reforms achieved solid growth and reduced inflation the imf has reviewed the governments economic performance positively and is expected to approve new threeyear standby agreement for 20052007 the government also has been challenged by terrorism and is dealing with both kurdish terrorism radical religious terrorist threat with possible international links and remnants of leftist terrorism in order to obtain date to begin accession talks with the european union eu the turkish parliament has passed many reforms to harmonize turkeys laws and constitution with eu standards the eu is expected to scrutinize implementation of the reforms carefully before setting date for accession talks the situation on cyprus is not expected to affect eu decisionmaking usturkish relations were shaken on march 1 2003 when the turkish parliament rejected resolution to allow the deployment of us troops to turkey to open northern front against iraq bilateral ties have been strained by other developments in iraq the turkish parliaments october 2003 decision to authorize the deployment of turkish peacekeepers to iraq helped to improve ties even though the offer was not accepted however turkey continues to be concerned about the situation in iraq and us actions there which fuel antiamericanism turkey remains important to the united states turkish air bases were used in the afghan war and its airspace in the iraq war its ports airbases and roads are used to resupply coalition forces and for reconstruction efforts in iraq us troops rotate to and from iraq via turkey turkey will be an important transit route for pipelines carrying energy resources from the caucasus and central asia to the west and the often sabotaged oil pipeline from iraq to turkey could be helpful to iraqs recovery turkish and us intelligence agencies are cooperating closely in the war on terrorism turkish peacekeepers have served in many hot spots in support of us policies and commanded the international security assistance force isaf in afghanistan finally some us officials and analysts believe strongly that turkey as predominantly muslim democratic country could serve as an example to

seats in parliament and formed the first singleparty government in turkey in over decade1 deputy party leader abdullah gul became the first akp prime minister he ceded the position to party leader recep tayyip erdogan in march 2003 after parliament lifted ban on erdogans political participation and he won seat in parliament2 gul then became deputy prime minister and foreign minister prime minister erdogan and the akp appear to be securely in power and with its parliamentary majority akp has been able to pass its legislative program divisions within the akp evident on march 1 2003 when parliament rejected government resolution to approve the deployment of us forces to turkey to open northern front against iraq have faded3 although akps parliamentary group is cumbersome it is not ripe for fissures mainly because of the strength of erdogans personality and his popularity with the grass roots and partly because members enjoy the perquisites of office erdogans power and charisma are making akp increasingly similar to traditional turkish personalitydominated political parties to avoid the short lives of series of earlier islamist political parties the akp claims the popular centerright of the political spectrum erdogan rejects the islamist label preferring to call himself and his party conservative democrats some of his statements could be part of an american debate regarding churchstate relations for example he has said while attaching importance to religion as social value we do not think it right to conduct politics through religion to attempt to transform government 1 for more see crs report rs21355 turkeys november 3 2002 national election as of july 2004 akp held 369 having gained seats due to defections from chp and the affiliation of former independents the party thus has the twothirds majority 367 seats needed to change the constitution without recourse to national referendum 2 erdogan was banned because he had been convicted in 1998 for inciting hatred based on religion by publicly reciting poem declaring minarets are our bayonets domes are our helmets mosques are our barracks believers are our soldiers 3 see crs report rl31794 iraq turkey the deployment of us forces and related issues last updated may 2 2003 for an examination of turkeys policies before and immediately after the iraq war known officially as operation iraqi freedom more recent developments are discussed below crs2 ideologically by using religion religion is sacred and collective value it should not be made subject of political partisanship causing divisiveness to make religion an instrument of politics and to adopt an exclusionary approach to politics in the name of religion harms not only political pluralism but also religion itself4 the priority that erdogan and other party leaders give to beginning accession talks with the european union eu aids the akps political repositioning eu reforms and the values they impose would pull the entire country to the center and to western values for example the eu requires equal freedoms for all believers for muslims who are not sunni and not accepted as muslim by the akps more passionate islamists for christians jews and others who heretofore have not been treated equally in turkey for more on reforms see european union below however erdogans attempt to distance akp from its islamist roots is undermined when some party officials and members of parliament raise issues with religiopolitical overtones that generate friction with the secular establishment in the military political opposition and elements in the media for their part secularists create discord when acting preemptively to counter real or suspected signs of encroaching islamism there have been many instances of such tension head scarves are major issue in turkey head scarf can simply be sign of religious piety or it can be an assertive expression of opposition to secularism the wearing of head scarves is banned in public buildings such as parliament and universities the military is particularly sensitive to this matter on april 23 2003 armed forces commanders declined to attend reception because the speakers wife wears head scarf and they did not know if she would attend she did not in august 2003 chief of staff general hilmi ozkok pointedly did not invite any officials wives to reception in october president ahmet necdet sezer invited wives of all his guests except those of akp deputies who might wear head scarves to republic day reception even some ardent secularists criticized the presidents action as divisive erdogan refuses to enter this fray saying that he is waiting for socialnational consensus to emerge on the issue he was saddened by the presidents discrimination but attended the reception briefly with most members of his cabinet to avoid further tension the european court of human rights has ruled once again on june 29 2004 that turkeys ban on wearing head scarves in state schools does not violate freedom of religion but rather safeguards the principle of secularism necessary for the protection of the democratic system5 there have been other controversies about akps supposed islamist agenda foreign minster gul sent circular to embassies encouraging contact with turkish nongovernmental organizations abroad including the national view milli gorus which promotes an islamic state in turkey an akpdominated parliamentary committee voted to add 15000 new positions in the directorate of religious affairs which oversees mosques reportedly

bbc monitoring european hereafter bbc crs3 promises to the international monetary fund imf of public employment cuts6 the finance minister said that such appointments would be made7 finally on three occasions the prime ministers first gul then erdogan and defense minister vecdi gonul have expressed reservations about the expulsion of allegedly fundamentalist soldiers from the armed forces at meetings of the supreme military council yas insisting that those expelled be afforded the right to judicial review8 of potentially longterm consequence for turkeys secular identity is education the most heated disputes involve the akps attempts in october 2003 and may 2004 to have the government exert greater control over the higher education board and to allow graduates of religious imam hatip vocational high schools equal access to universities as those of normal high schools opponents viewed the bills as an effort to boost attendance at religious schools or to enable imam hatip graduates to qualify for government positions secularists on the board in opposition parties universities and the office of the chief of the general staff argued that the initiative was aimed at undermining the basic principles of the republic and they denounced it9 the prominence of the military command in the debate raised concerns about the countrys political stability and highlighted differences between civilmilitary relations in turkey and the rest of europe at time when the akp government is seeking eu accession talks some questioned why akp decided to raise the issue at this time since the militarys sensitivities are well known with municipal elections just over and national elections years off akps stated rationale of needing to reward grassroots was unconvincing president sezer vetoed the bills asserting that they were incompatible with the spirit of the constitution which is based on the ataturk mustafa kemal founder of the turkish republic principles10 although it could have overridden the vetoes by passing an identical bill again the government withdrew the bills from consideration it may resubmit the bill again aside from the education bills erdogan has generally been politically adroit considering that the turkish armed forces are the constitutional guarantors of turkeys secularism and have displaced civilian governments several times in the past for example he acceded to chief of staff general hilmi ozkoks request that the national security council mgk be headed by military figure for one more year before it passed to civilian in august 2004 as required by eurelated reforms for more on the mgk changes see european union below erdogan has benefitted from having the moderate enlightened discreet ozkok as chief of staff ozkok consults privately with government officials voices his opinions at closed national security council meetings at an april 2004 news conference he noted that the turkish armed forces should not be expected to adopt stand

means diminished role for the armed forces and the continuation in office of what the military views as an islamist government the imam hatip bill provoked the general to issue rare public criticism of government action in addition to the military erdogan and the akp often clash with president sezer popular former judge and ardent secularist who wields his veto power liberally12 sezers vetoes have delayed but not prevented passage of parts of the government program he has been more successful in blocking akps appointees to the government many of whom he views as nonsupportive of the secular state13 however the akp reportedly has placed many of those denied presidential approval in government positions not requiring presidential action march 28 2004 municipal elections14 akp won 416 of the vote in the municipal elections strong showing which exceeded the combined total of 38 of the vote won by its next three rivals strikingly akp won 57 out of 81 mayoral races including 12 out of 15 races in major metropolitan areas in other words akp confirmed its dominance of the centerright the most popular segment of the turkish political spectrum there are several reasons for akps victory first its success in sustaining the countrys economic stability has created widespread optimism second its steady pursuit of eu membership is very popular because of peoples expectations of economic advancement with accession15 third its national leaders including the charismatic erdogan who spoke in 55 cities campaigned energetically and throughout the country finally akp profited from generally tame uncritical media coverage of its tenure akp also courted its islamist grassroots by choosing 80 of its mayoral candidates from the national view movement the party fielded almost women mayoral candidates ostensibly in order to avoid raising the visibility of the controversial head scarf issue women who wear head scarves ran for less prominent local assembly seats and won 11 gen

document gmp10040331000197 crs5 akp made noteworthy inroads into opposition republican peoples party chp strongholds on the mediterranean and aegean coasts and into the kurdish democratic peoples party dehap cities in the southeast the retrogressive poorly led centerleft chp nationalistically opposes the governments cyprus policy and many of its other policies but has not truly led opposition to them it made electoral headway by taking these positions receiving 182 of the vote down from 194 in the 2002 national election this leftist party failed to draw the working class and middle class vote and is now said to be party of fierce secularists the upper middle class and the alevis heterodox sect mixing turkish customs with shia islam whose secularism provides shelter from dominant sunni islam chp leader deniz baykal has kept his position by outmaneuvering party dissidents not by policy achievements dehap had allied with four small leftist parties to field candidates jointly as the union of democratic forces but together they polled fewer votes than dehap alone had won in 2002 akp won 37 of the vote in the southeast in other words akps conservatism or islamism trumped kurdish nationalism the combined votes of all of the socalled left parties fell from 30 in 2002 to 25 in 2004 nonetheless the election results failed to herald the demise of the opposition the centerright true path party dyp and the farright nationalist action party mhp made comebacks registering some gains and rising to 103 and 104 of the vote respectively primarily due to their jingoistic dissent from akps compromises on cyprus were this national election they would have passed the threshold for entry into parliament economy turkey appears to have recovered from the severe recession of 20002001 it achieved economic targets for 2003 set by an international monetary fund imf monitored reform program including 5 59 gross national product gnp growth rate an inflation rate of below 20 184 and 65 budget surplus the rate of inflation was the lowest in decades exports grew 30 to 48 billion and interest rates dropped targets for 2004 5 growth rate 12 rate of inflation and 65 budget surplus are expected to be met the state institute of statistics has announced that the gnp growth rate for the first quarter of 2004 was 124 while the rate of inflation fell to 9516 imf reviews of turkeys economic performance have been complimentary yet significant problems remain unemployment remains high at more than 12 and underemployment is probably higher imports outstrip exports despite export growth the goal of earning 4 billion in revenues from privatization of state enterprises was not met in 2003 with only 22 billion gained and government expectations of 3 billion in revenues from privatization in 2004 are probably unrealistic in june 2004 the court halted the sale of the turkish oil refinery corporation tupras to russian firm for about 13 billion earlier the 16 turkeys economic growth in first quarter above expectations anatolia june 30 2004 bbc industry and trade minister coskun expects endyear inflation at 78 pct turkish daily news august 5 2004 crs6 government had canceled the sale of the state tobacco monopoly after bids were deemed too low while protracted preparations for the sale of 51 of the state telecommunications monopoly turk telecom have not been concluded moreover corruption scandals involving the uzan family accused of defrauding motorola of billions of dollars probably have affected sales to western investors despite the effects of privatization difficulties on revenues the government increased pension payments and the minimum wage prompting the imf to seek and obtain offsetting budget cuts and increases in tax revenues the imf continues to encourage turkey to improve tax administration to combat tax evasion and to undertake social security reforms saying such measures would boost policy credibility and underpin the success of the reform program17 current arrangements between turkey and the imf end in february 2005 officials plan to sign new threeyear standby agreement to cover the period 20052007 turkey remains economically vulnerable because its public debt consumed about 75 of gross domestic product gdp as of december 2003 although the ratio of debt to gdp is diminishing much of the debt is shortterm and rolled over at fluctuating interest rates18 the need to pay down the debt especially the part carrying high interest rates is the reason for imf demands 65 budget surplus turkey relies heavily on borrowing partly because of lack of alternative sources of capital it has very low foreign direct investment only 015 of the worlds foreign direct investment inflows in 200219 foreign investors have been wary of investing in turkey because of timeconsuming bureaucratic procedures and problems with transparency and rule of law in business relationships the average time between authorization and investment reportedly is two years turkey ranked 77 out of 133 countries on the 2003 transparency international corruption perceptions index20 in june 2003 parliament passed new foreign investment law to guarantee equal rights for foreign investors and ease procedures for establishing companies investors probably will monitor implementation of the law before rushing to invest in turkey in addition to these measures the government believes that economic stability resulting from the economic reform program and possible accession talks with the eu in 2005 should attract more investors 17

turkish armed forces fought war against pkk insurgents turkish kurds who sought autonomy or independence the pkk operated mainly in southeast turkey although it also attacked elsewhere in turkey and turkish targets in europe the pkk has appeared to flounder since its leader abdullah ocalan was captured and imprisoned in 1999 in april 2002 the pkk renamed itself the kurdistan freedom and democracy congress kadek but retained many of the same leaders in november 2003 kadek dissolved itself and the peoples congress of kurdistan kongragel was established kongragel claims to be purely political organization embracing the kurds of turkey iraq iran and syria its constitution calls for durable solution to the kurdish question by promoting democratic forces and does not mention independence or autonomy21 as the pkk transformed itself into kadek and kongragel its military wing the peoples defense forces was termed independent and did not dissolve or disarm turkish officials and media refer to pkk successor groups jointly with the pkk eg pkkkadek or pkkkongragel on november 14 2003 the us state department spokesman said the pkkkadek under any alias is terrorist organization and name change or press release can alter that fact and on january 13 2004 the department designated kongragel as foreign terrorist organization the pkkkadekkongragel was relatively inactive as terrorist group until recently and its capabilities may be doubted although the state departments and turkish authorities allege that about 4000 pkk members have taken safe haven in northern iraq that number dates from before ocalans capture and given the possible dispersal of followers since then the real strength of the group may be lower or different22 moreover kongragel appeared to suffer schism in 2004 involving ocalans brother osman and others which may have distracted it from the fight23 another sign of pkk decline may have been apparent in kongra gelpkks support for the union of democratic forces which included the kurdish party dehap and performed poorly in the march 2004 municipal elections kongragel announced that it was ending fiveyear unilateral ceasefire on june 1 2004 and warned foreign investors and tourists against coming to turkey there has since been an upsurge in incidents in southeast turkey which turkish 21 constitution of kurdistan peoples congress fbis document

turkish kurdish parliamentarians released from prison in june called for the kongragel to continue the ceasefire an unusual public display of dissent the pkk remnants may longer pose major threat to turkey they nonetheless remain an obsession of the turkish military which views pkk with possibly nonviolent political agenda as the same as an active terrorist pkk24 this unchanging view of the pkk

could be islamic terror and challenged attributions of qualities such as terrorism to our sacred religion35 he declared that terror is an act of perversion detached from all beliefs and that islam can never be associated with terrorism36 wellknown turkish commentator suggested that in order for the government to succeed against terrorist organizations however it had to identify the target by name and to focus on it resolutely37 he implied that the akp could not crack down on islamist terrorists if it could not recognize their possibility the broad intent of the november 2003 istanbul bombings was to kill jews and strike at britain us ally and former regional colonial power the attacks coincided with president bushs state visit to the united kingdom which may or may not have been significant turkey also may have been the target because of its secular identity close ties to the west especially the united states membership in nato and perceived good relations with israel

parliament also passed reassociation or rehabilitation law limited amnesty reducing sentences of some prisoners and pardoning others it did not apply to pkk leaders and expired on february 8 2004 the

reforms however the ep said that reforms could only be judged on the basis of how they are put into practice and repeated criticisms of the role of the military in politics and deficiencies in human rights practices the report suggested that turkey may need new constitution to replace the current one which carried the seal of the authoritarian regime of 1982 ie military government44 erdogan has lobbied for turkeys eu accession extensively in europe he emphasizes the beneficial effects that entry into the eu of country that successfully reconciled islamic culture with democracy could have on the eu image in the eyes of the worlds 15 billion muslims according to him it would prove that the eu is not christian club45 and that compromise of civilizations is preferable to clash of civilizations46 it is not certain if turkey will be able to adequately address deficiencies in its implementation of reforms or to overcome the qualms of many europeans regarding its membership by december the predominantly christian member states already face problems integrating muslim immigrants and many europeans blame muslims for extremism terrorism and antisemitism many europeans are grappling with issues of identity and do not believe that turkey can be european they disagree with the us official argument that admitting turkey might help to spread democracy and moderation to other muslim states some europeans know that if populous turkey enters the eu it would be more populous than france and soon be larger than germany with the right to demand commensurate clout in eu political bodies this undoubtedly adds to their doubts as sign of the sensitivity of the issue the european commission has decided to formally consult all 25 member countries before issuing its next progress report in october 2004 cyprus47 although settlement on cyprus is not criterion for eu membership it is generally understood that turkey will not be admitted to the eu unless there is settlement without settlement greece and greek cyprus both eu members probably will veto turkeys accession however greece supports the beginning of accession talks and the greek cypriot government has indicated that it will not veto accession talks if there is consensus among all other members on the issue the november 2003 eu progress report declared the absence of settlement could become serious

part of the island greek cypriots govern the southern part of the island and are the internationally recognized government of cyprus the united nations has made repeated efforts to reunify the island in november 2002 secretary general kofi annan presented new settlement plan and subsequently revised it several times based on comments from the parties prime minister erdogan accepted the annan plan as the basis for further negotiations under pressure due to his eu aspirations erdogan repeatedly asserted that the continuation of solution on cyprus is not solution in contrast to former turkish leaders who had argued that the issue had been settled in 1974 his government was able to make joint reassessment of policy with the turkish cypriots after december 14 2003 parliamentary elections in northern cyprus brought prosettlement forces to power erdogan first secured the support of the national security council for new initiative on january 23 2004 the council reiterated its political determination to rapidly reach solution through negotiations in line with the realities on the island with the annan plan as reference49 on january 24 erdogan informed annan that turkey was ready to resume negotiations with his plan as reference with the goal of reaching an agreement and holding referenda to approve it before may 1 when cyprus was scheduled to join the eu erdogan boldly said that if the two sides cannot fill in all the blanks then turkey would allow annan to fill them in if the greek cypriots accept that as well talks between greek and turkish cypriot leaders on cyprus settlement resumed in midfebruary predictably due to their hard line views greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos and turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash failed to agree on revising annans plan

consultations with the in switzerland on march 29 annan presented revised plan turkey accepted it the plan was put to referenda on the island on april 24 the greek cypriots decisively rejected it with 76 of the vote while the turkish cypriots clearly accepted it with 65 of their votes notwithstanding the outcome cyprus entered the eu on may 1 as previously scheduled the turkish government escaped blame for the failure which shifted to the greek cypriot leadership many in the eu longer view cyprus settlement as precondition for commencing accession negotiations with turkey other issues have
