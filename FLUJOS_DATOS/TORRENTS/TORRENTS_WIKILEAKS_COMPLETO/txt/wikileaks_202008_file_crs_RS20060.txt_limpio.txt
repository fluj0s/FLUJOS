macroeconomic policy government and finance division summary the federal government in an effort to protect the purchasing power of social security benefits indexes those benefits to increases in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers cpiw there is concern however that the cpiw may not accurately reflect the inflation experience of the elderly population on average the elderly spend relatively more on health care whose price has tended to rise faster than overall prices other things being equal that would suggest that the cpiw tends to understate the inflation experience of the average elderly household the bureau of labor statistics bls has developed an experimental price index to track inflation for the population aged 62 and older the average annual rate of change between december 1982 and december 2007 for the experimental index was 33 over the same period the cpiw rose at 30 rate inflation measure for large population group will exactly account for the experience of each member of that group differences in spending patterns in combination with different rates of price change for all of the various goods and services included in the cpi mean that individual inflation rate experiences may range significantly above or below the measured average this report will be updated if economic or legislative developments warrant background the federal government in an effort to protect the purchasing power of social security benefits indexes those benefits to increases in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers cpiw there is concern however that the cpiw may not accurately reflect the inflation experience of the elderly population it has been asserted that the elderly face higher inflation rate because they tend to spend larger share of their household budget on goods and services whose prices have been rising faster than average more to the point it is argued that increases in social security benefits have not kept pace with increases in the prices of those goods and services purchased by the elderly and that some other index might be more appropriate as congress takes up the issue of social security reform one item of consideration may be crs2 the way in which benefits are indexed some may call for change in the index which is used to determine costofliving adjustments colas for benefits the cpiw is published monthly by the bureau of labor statistics of the department of labor bls it is designed to measure changes in the prices of goods and services purchased by those who earn more than half of their income from clerical or wage occupations and have been employed at least 37 weeks in the previous year1 this group accounts for about 32 of the total noninstitutional population but it only tracks the employed to the extent that retirees purchasing patterns differ the effect of inflation on their standard of living may be different from what is indicated by the cpiw expenditure patterns of the elderly to establish the composition of the marketbasket of goods and services whose prices are gathered in calculating the cpi bls collects data regularly concerning how households spend their money via the consumer expenditure survey table 1 presents some of these data on total dollar expenditures and how those expenditures were allocated across different categories of goods and services in the survey consumer unit refers primarily to households it may be family an individual or group that pools its income for consumption purposes the figures show the distribution of expenditures in 2006 for the population as whole as well as for the elderly population the largest differences in spending patterns between the elderly and the general population are found in the shares of expenditures accounted for by health care2 those aged 65 and older spent more than twice as large share of their total outlays on health care than did the overall population with respect to the population aged 75 and older the share of their spending allocated to health care was close to three times as large as that of the total population three other expenditure categories differed by more than 2 percentage points for the over65 population shelter insurance and pensions which includes life insurance premiums and contributions to social security and other pension plans and cash contributions which are payments to persons outside the household and include alimony child support and care of students outside the home 1 specifically clerical workers craft workers operatives service workers or laborers 2 in the cpi expenditure shares for health care are based on health insurance premiums and out ofpocket outlays the cpi does not include health benefits paid by employers or federal government programs health care expenditure shares in the cpi marketbasket are consequently smaller than is the case in the national income and product accounts see us department of labor

109 53 68 30 source department of labor bureau of labor statistics health care costs have consistently risen more rapidly than the average price level between december 1982 and december 2007 the cpiw increased at an annual rate of 30 compared to 54 rate of increase for the medical care component of the cpiw because the elderly consume greater than average share of good whose price has tended to rise faster than overall prices the cpiw may tend to understate the inflation experience of the average elderly household averages and individuals as noted above the argument is often made and not without justification that the cpi does not represent the average inflation experience of the elderly population but crs4 just as the inflation experience of the elderly population may differ from that of the population at large so too are there differences within the elderly population itself summary inflation measure for large population group will exactly account for the experience of each member of that group differences in spending patterns in combination with different rates of price change for all of the various goods and services included in the cpi mean that individual inflation rate experiences may range significantly above or below the measured average if there is great deal of variation in both the general population and within subgroups such as the elderly small difference in average inflation rates between groups may not be significant3 suppose the average inflation rate of the elderly population is slightly higher than the rate for the overall population but that the distribution of individual inflation rates among the elderly is widely dispersed in this case all of the elderly would be better off if their benefits were indexed to an inflation measure based on the average elderly household within the elderly population however there would be several different consequences first there would be some elderly whose inflation rates would be understated by the overall rate but exaggerated by the elderly inflation measure second there would be those elderly whose inflation rates were higher than either the overall measure or one based on elderly consumption patterns finally there would be number of elderly whose actual inflation rates would be lower than either the overall measure or one based on the elderly one study of the distribution of inflation rates across the population found with regard to inflation rates that differences between demographic groups were small in comparison with the variation within those groups further it was found that differences between groups tended not to be stable over time this study argued that one group suffered disproportionately from inflation4 if the variation in consumption patterns is great among the elderly and if the average inflation rate of the elderly is not dramatically different from the average rate of the overall population then arguments for separate index for the elderly population might be less compelling bls experimental cpi for the elderly in 1987 congress amended the older americans act of 1965 to direct bls to develop an experimental price index to track inflation in the population age 62 and older bls has calculated estimates of such an index that go back to december 19825 3 see department of labor bureau of labor statistics the consumer price index

inflation journal of money credit and banking vol 11 issue 1 february 1979 pp 3246 5 nathan amble and ken stewart experimental price index for elderly consumers monthly labor review may 1994 pp 1116 crs5 table 2 presents those estimates alongside actual data for the cpiw and the consumer price index for all urban consumers cpiu the cpiu measure is based on larger population than the cpiw and unlike the cpiw takes the elderly population into account the cpiu is the measure of inflation most often cited in press reports the figures show that there have been only two years 1983 and 2007 in which either of the two official indexes rose more rapidly than the experimental one the average annual rate of change between december 1982 and december 2007 for the experimental index was 33 over the same period the cpiw rose at 30 rate and the cpiu rose at 31 rate that the cpiu was closer to the experimental index than the cpiw was due at least in part to larger weight given to health care outlays because its marketbasket is influenced by the spending patterns of the elderly although the differences in the three indexes are usually in the direction that might be expected there are number of considerations to keep in mind because this is an experimental index fewer resources were used in its development for example the survey on which its marketbasket is based was considerably smaller than the surveys used for the cpiw and cpiu and so is subject to greater sampling error further additional survey was conducted to determine if the elderly shop in different outlets than the population as whole if bls were to initiate an official cpi for the elderly program it would involve more resources and might yield different results from those presented here the experimental index shown here is based on different weights assigned to different categories of goods and services however there may also be substantial differences in consumption patterns within those categories that could also change the figures shown in table 2 study by bls looked in particular at spending by the elderly on prescription drugs6 among other things this study found that there was considerable variation in the types of drugs purchased by age however the study found strong evidence that there were significant agerelated differences in prescription drug inflation policy considerations aside from the practical considerations such as how much of difference having separate price index for the elderly would make there are number of other things to consider for example if the primary purpose of developing separate index is for social security cost of living adjustments it should be kept in mind that not all social security recipients are elderly thus the elderly population might not be the appropriate one to measure in adjusting social security benefits 6 ernst r berndt et prescription drug prices for the elderly monthly labor review september 1998 pp 2334 crs6 table 2 consumer

is appropriate to have separate elderly price index for adjusting social security benefits should that new index be used to adjust income tax brackets of elderly taxpayers which are currently indexed to the cpiu finally because there is substantial variation in inflation rates among individuals and between different groups of individuals any single measure of inflation is going to over or understate the inflation actually experienced by many for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20060
