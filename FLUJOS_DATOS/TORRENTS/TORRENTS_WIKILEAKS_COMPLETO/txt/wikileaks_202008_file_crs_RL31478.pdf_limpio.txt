emergency reserve fund an automatic continuing resolution and biennial budge ting for each reform option the analysis includes summary of the procedural i ssues related to the reform option the arguments that have been raised for nd against the proposal and the legislative history of past proposals first key enforcement procedures unde r the budget enforcement act bea of 1990 expire at the end of fy2002 ie september 30 2002 these include the statutory caps on discretionary spe nding and the payasyougo paygo requirement for direct spending and reve nue legislation possible considerations related to an extension of these budget enforcement procedures include the time frame covered possible categories for caps on discretionary spending the types of automatic or permissible ad justments to the caps and the application of the paygo requirement second joint budget resolution would require the presidents signature thereby formally and directly involving the president in cong ressional deliberations on the budget early in the process under the existing budget process there is concurrent resolution on the budget that re presents an agreement between the house and senate concerning overall budget policy it is not presented to the president for his signature and thus does not become law third proposals for an emergency reserv fund are intended to change the way congress and the president budget for emergencies and other unanticipated situations instead of appropriating funds for such situations as the need arises emergency reserve fund proposals would requi re congress and the president to set aside money for such purposes in the budg et with the appropriation of such funds tied to meeting specific criteria of what constitutes an emergency fourth an automatic continuing resolu tion would provide an automatic source of funding for discretionary activities in the event one or more regular appropriations acts are not enacted by the start of ne w fiscal year this reform proposal is intended to prevent shutdown of the fede ral government due to the expiration of funding finally biennial budgeting proposals woul d change the budget cycle to 2 years from one year this reform has been discussed as way of promoting better management of both congresss and th administrations budgetary workload biennial budgeting proposals could involve multiyear authorizations 2year budget resolutions 2year appr opriations or some combination of the three this report will be updated to reflect changes in congressional concerns or actionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31478contents

budget process reform analysis of five reform issues introduction the budget has become central issue in american politics because it reflects decisions concerning how big the federal government should be and priorities for what the government should do how those decisions should be made by whom and under what constraints has also become part of the modern political dialog although the basic framework for budgeting s remained relatively stable in recent years there has been recurring reexamin ation of the budget process to determine if it works to meet the changing demands of government1 in an earlier era of government reform william f willoughby the director of the institute for government research wrote that among the specific problems of public administration none exceeds in importance that of the establishment of an orderly and efficient system for the handling of the financial affairs of the government2 arguably this is less true today than it was then and its salience is illustrated by the number and variety of proposals made to change one or more aspects of the budget process in recent years this report includes five reform issu on which congress has consistently demonstrated high leve l of interest focused on specifically defined reform proposals some of these issues such as biennial budgeting have extensive legislative histories these proposals repr esent just part of the total spectrum of proposals that have been discussed both insi and outside of c ongress this report does not include those reform issues that are primarily conceptual in nature such issues reflect level of dissatisfaction with the current process but they generally are not focused on specific single reform option examples of these include authorizationappropriations issues which concern the relationship between authorizations and appropriations including timing and sequencing issueshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31478crs2 3 for more on these issues see crs issue brief ib89148 item

guidelines for the consideration of revenue or spe nding legislation4 t h constitution however does provide congress authority to lay and collect taxes duties imposts and excises to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the united states5 and requires that money shall be drawn from the treasury but in conseque nce of appropriations made by law6 through these provisions the constitution grants congress the power of the pursehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31478crs3 7 for more on the budget process see crs report 98720 manual on the federal budget process by

mechanisms by the budget enforcement act of 1990 title x iii of pl 101508 omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 104 stat 13885731388630 originally enacted with sunset date of fy1995 they have been extended twice through fy1998 title xiv of pl 10366 omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 107 stat 683685 and through fy2002 budget enforcement act of 1997 title x of pl 10533 balanced budget act of 1997 111 stat 677712this general authority has been subseque ntly fleshed out through number of laws and congressional rules that underp in the federal budget process7 two statutes in particular provide much of the basic legal framework the first key statute is the budget and accounting act of 1921 pl 13 67th congress 42 stat 2027 now codified in title 31 of the united states code this act established the statutory basis for an executive budget process it gives the president responsibility for submitting to congress proposed budget for the entire federal government at the beginning of each year it also created the bureau of the budget reorganized as the office of ma nagement and budget omb in 1970 to assist him in carrying out his responsib ilities and the genera l accounting office gao to assist congress as the principal auditing agency of the federal government the second key statute is the congre ssional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 pl 93344 88 stat 297339 th provisions of this act have been modified on number of occasions but it remains the statutory basis for the congressional budget process the act provides for the annual adoption of concurrent resolution on the budget as mechanism for coordi nating and facilitating congressional budgetary decision making it also established the house and senate budget committees with jurisdiction over the annual budget resolution and created the congressional budget office cbo to provide budgetary information and analysis to congress independe nt of the executive branch in addition the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 as amended title ii of pl 99177 99 stat 10381101 has had significant impact on budgetary procedures and outcomes by creating additional control mechanisms this act established the sequester mechan ism as means to enforce statutory budget requirements currently ther are separate mechanisms to control direct spending and revenues the payasyougo or paygo process and discretionary spending spending caps8 the budgetary impact of all legislation is scored by omb and reported three times each year preview with the presidents budget submission an update with the midsession review of th budget and final report within 15 days after congress adjourns if the final re port for either the paygo or spending caps indicates that the statutory requirements of that mechanism have been breached the president is required to issue an order making acrosstheboard cuts of nonexempt spending programs subject to that control mechanismhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31478crs4 9 for more on this requirement see crs report 98605 the presidents budget timing of the midsession review by robert keith 10 concurrent resolution is the legislative form used to make agreements between the house and senate concurrent resolutions are not sent to the president for signature or veto they are not legislative form used to make lawthe budget cycle the president is required to submit to congress proposed budget by the first monday in february although this budget does not have the force of law it is comprehensive examination of federal revenues and spending including any initiatives recommended by the president nd is the start of extensive interaction with congress the presidents budget submission is itsel f the result of process that typically began 10 months earlier during this stag federal agencies prepare budget requests under variety of internal procedures omb plays coordinating role in this process through communications circulars and bu lletins providing instructions schedules and other materials to ensure that budget requests adhere to st andardized conventions and formats agency budget requests are subsequently reviewed by omb and the agencies notified of the omb directors recommenda tions for changes through passback in the fall prior to the presidents s ubmission agencies may appeal these recommendations to the director and in some cases directly to the president once final decisions on the budget requests are made agencies revise their requests accordingly and prepare supporting material s for inclusion in the presidents budget submission the presidents budget submission does not complete administration action agency officials testify at congressi onal hearings and provide written budget justifications in addition the president is required to submit formal midsession review of the budget by july 15 of each year9 and may also submit additional budgetary requests during the year within 6 weeks of the president s budget submissi on congressional co mmittees are required to submit their views and estimates of spending and revenues within their respective jurisdictions to the house and senate budget committees these views and estimates along with information gleaned from hearings testimony cbo reports and other sources are then used by each budget committee in drafting and reporting concurrent resolution on the budget to its respective house although it does not have the force of law the budget resolution is central part of the budget process in congress as c oncurrent resolution if adopted in the same form by each house it represents an agr eement between the house and senate that establishes congressional budg et priorities and define s the parameters for all subsequent budgetary actions10 the spending revenue and public debt limit laws necessary to implement decisions agreed to in the budget resolution subsequently are enacted separately discretionary sp ending which is enacted through thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31478crs5 appropriations process invol ves annual actions that must be completed before the beginning of new fiscal year on october 1 the reconciliation process may be used to change laws affecting direct spending or revenues reconciliation typically follows timetable established in the budg et resolution for that year other budgetary legi slation such as changes in direct spending or revenue laws separate from the reconciliation process changes in the public debt limit or authorizing legislation are not tied directly to the annual budget cycle however such legislation could be necessary part of budg etary actions in any given year after appropriations and ot her budgetary legislation become law the executive branch again becomes the focus of the budget process after the end of the congressional session the president is re quired to determine if sequester is necessary to remedy any breach of the limits established under the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act the executive branch is also responsible for the execution of spending laws funds provided in statutes are apportioned to the appropriate agencies and programs in accordance with the antideficiency acts 31 usc 134142 15111519 which prohibit agencies from obligating funds in excess of levels provided in law the president also may propose adjustments in spending laws under the provisions of the impoundment control act of 1974 title x of pl 93344 the act defines two types of im poundments deferrals and resc issions deferrals delay the spending of funds while rescissi ons permanently cancel budgetary resources deferrals remain in effect unless overturned by congress but rescissions require the approval of congress through the enactment of law the president must report both deferrals and rescissions to congress if congress does not enact legislation approving the presidents re scission proposals within 45 days of continuous session the president must make the funds available for obligation the budget resolution and reconciliation the budget resolution represents an ag reement between the house and senate concerning the overall size of the federal budget and th general composition of the budget in terms of functiona l categories the amounts in functional categories are translated into allocations to each committ ee with jurisdiction over spending in process called crosswalking under section 302a of the congre ssional budget act legislation considered by the house and senate must be consistent with these allocations as well as with the aggregate vels of spending and revenues both the allocations and aggregates are enforceable through points of order these allocations are supplemented by nonbinding programma tic assumptions often included in the reports from the budget committees that accompany the budget resolution in each house in some years the budget resoluti on includes reconcilia tion instructions reconciliation instructions direct specified committees to recommend changes in laws affecting revenues or dir ect spending programs within their jurisdiction in order to implement budget resolution policies all committees receiving such instructions must submit legislative language to the budget committee in their respective chamber which packages them as an omnibus measure and reports the measurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31478crs6 11 for more on the appropriations process see crs report 97684 the congressional appropriations process an introduction by sandy streeterwithout substantive revision in some cases single committee may be instructed to report reconciliation legislation directly reconciliation bill would then be considered and possibly amended by the full house or senate in the house reconciliation bills are typically considered under the terms of special rule in the senate reconciliation bills are consider ed under limitations imposed by sections 305 310 and 313 of the congressional budget ac t these sections limit debate on reconciliation bill to 20 hour s and limit the types of amendments that may be considered the appropriations process the annual appropriations pr ocess provides funding fo r discretionary spending programs through 13 regular appropriations bills congress must enact these measures prior to the beginning of each fiscal year october 1 or provide interim funding for the affected programs throug h continuing resolution by custom appropriations bills originate in the house but may be amended by the senate with any differences negotiated by conference committee congress may also enact supplemental appropriations m easures during the course of fiscal year to provide funding for additional or unanticipated purposes11 the house and senate appropriations committees are organized into 13 subcommittees each of which is responsible for developing one of the 13 regular appropriations bills each bill is subse quently considered by the full committee appropriations bills are c onstrained in terms of both their purpose and the amount of funding they provide appropriations are constraine d in terms of purpose because the rules of both the house rule xxi nd the senate rule xvi generally require authorizations prior to cons ideration of appropriations for an agency or program authorizations are legislation that blish continue or modify an agency or program and explicitly or implicitly auth orize the enactment of appropriations for that purpose authorizations may be mporary or permanent and their provisions may be general or specific but they do not themselves provide funding although house and senate rules ge nerally prohibit unauthorized appropriations both provide exceptions in their respective rules and the prohibition itself may be waived constraints in terms of the amount of funding exist on several levels for individual items or progra ms funding might be limited to the level recommended in authorizing legislation total spending for fiscal year incl uding both direct and discretionary spending is limited to the vel established in the budget resolution under section 311 of the budget act so since fy1991 the level of discretionary spending provided in appropriations acts has been limited by discretionary spending caps these spending caps are described below finally the allocations from the budget resolution made to the appropr iations committees under section 302a of the budget act provide limits that may be enforced procedurally through points of order in the house and senate during c onsideration of the legislation these allocations must be consistent w ith the discretionary spending capshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31478crs7 12 separate sequestration process was establis hed to enforce outlay limits for the violent crime reduction trust fund in title xxxi of the violent crime control and law continuedsection 302b of the budget act fu rther requires the house and senate appropriations committees to subdivide th amounts allocated to them under the budget resolution among their subcommittees these suballocations are required to be made as soon as practicable after c oncurrent resolution on the budget is agreed to because each subcommittee is responsib for formulating single general appropriations bill the process of making suballocations effectively determines the spending level for each of the 13 regula r appropriations bills legislation or amendments that would cause the suballo cations made under 302b to be exceeded is subject to point of order the appropriations committees usually issue revised subdivisions over the course of appropriations actions to reflect changes in spending priorities effected during floor consideration or in conference budget enforcement and sequestration budget enforcement procedures were fi rst adopted as part of the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 as amended by the budget enforcement act of 1990 the act provides tw separate mechanisms spending caps in section 251 designed to limit discretionary spending to designated level and the paygo process in section 252 designed to limit changes in the level of revenues and direct spending by new legislation in both cases the mechanism is enforced both during congressional consideration of budg etary legislation and by presidential sequester order after the end of congressional session if legislation is enacted that would violate the discretionary spendi ng caps or the paygo requirement the president is required to issue an order for an acrosstheboard spending cut of nonexempt spending programs within that category although ultimate enforcement of these mechanisms is through presidential order by enforcing the allocations and aggregates for spending and revenues pr ovided in the budget resolution that are consistent with these limits congress may also use points of order to enforce them during consideration of budgetary legislation discretionary spending caps the control mechanism applied to discretionary spending programs is stra ightforward the level of discretionary spending has been subject to statutory spending limits from fy1991 through fy2002 these limits were extended genera lly on two occasions the extension and modification of this mechanism is one of the options discussed in this report currently adjustments may occur automatica lly under procedures provided in the act eg to reflect amounts design ated as emergency spending or changing concepts and definitions the spending caps may also be adjusted through specific legislative action in some years discretionary spending has been divided into multiple categories in fy1991fy1993 discretionary spendi ng was divided among defense international and domestic spending in fy1994 fy1997 there was single category for discretionary spending genera lly separate category for violent crime reduction was established for fy1995fy200012 when discretionary spending capshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31478crs8 12 continued enforcement act of 1994 pl 103322 108 stat 21022108 this provision was subsequently modified to harmonize it with th extension of discretionary spending caps in budget enforcement act of 1997 title x of pl 10533 13 categories for highway and mass transit spending were established for fy19992003 in subtitle of title v iii of the transportation equity act for the 21st century pl 105178 112 stat 488492 section 801a of the interior appropria tions act for fy2001 pl 106 291 114 stat

for defense and nondefense spending for fy1998 and 1999 in addition to that fo r violent crime reduction for fy1998 fy2000 with single genera l discretionary spending l imit for fy 2000fy2002 further categories were subsequently blished for highway mass transit and conservation spending13 discretionary spending limits are enforced through presidential sequester order enacting spending legislation that would cause spending cap to be exceeded would subject all nonexempt spending within that category to an acrosstheboard cut sufficient to reduce spending to the level of the limit currently there are general discretionary spending limits for fiscal years beyond fy2002 also because section 275 of the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act provides sunset for the sequester mechanism there is means to enforce spending limits for special categories beyond fy2002 payasyougo the paygo process is not based on achieving specific level of deficit or surplus but instead fo cuses on the net impact of legislation under the paygo process congress is not prohib ited from enacting legislation increasing direct spending or decreasing revenues instead the budgetary impact of all legislation changing direct spending or revenues is tracked by omb for inclusion in its sequestration reports on paygo sc orecard amounts on the paygo scorecard reflect spending and revenue changes for fiscal year based on legislation enacted in prior years as well as the current year all such changes must be offset so that there is not net balance remaining on th paygo scorecard for any fiscal year if the net effect of all such legislation is to cause positive balance for fiscal year on the paygo scorecard the president must issu sequester order to reduce spending in all nonexempt direct spending accounts to eliminate the balance the paygo provisions currently apply only to legislation enacted before october 1 2002 but the enforcement process is scheduled to remain in effect through september 30 2006 to capture the budgetary effects of such legislation in the outyears reforming the process while the general framework of the budget process has remained relatively stable in recent years congress has continued to examine the question of how budgetary decisions should be made by whom and under what constraintshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31478crs9 14 the threefifths vote requirements in the senate to waive certain points of order and to sustain an appeal of ruling of the chair re garding those points of order expire on sept 30 2002 see section 904 of the cbakey enforcement procedures under the budget enforcement act of 1990 ie discretionary spending cap s and paygo expire at th end of fy2002 whether congress should extend either or both of th mechanisms in what form and for how long are questions that could be addressed in the 107th congress other proposed reforms would add new mechanisms or procedures to the current process there is unifying theme for this divers group of proposals single problem that they are all intended to correct rather they address diverse viewpoints concerning the current process some proposals have been directed toward improving management of the congressional budgetary workload some have been directed toward promoting better coopera tion between congress and the president and others have been directed towa rd providing greater enforcement for congressional rules or decisions the options discussed in this report ar five specific options on which congress consistently has expressed high level of interest they are as follows extending the duration of budgetary contro l mechanisms in order to retain the budgetary discipline that has been in place since 1990 establishing joint budget resolution that would require the presidents signature thereby formally and direc tly involving the president and congress in deliberations on the budget early in the process establishing an emergency reserve fund in order to change the way congress and the president budget for emergencie s and other unanticipated situations creating an automatic continuing resolution to provide an automatic source of funding for discretionary activities and prevent federal government shutdown and changing to biennial budget length ening the budget cycle to 2 years from one year as way of promoting better management of both congresss and the administrations budgetary workload extension of budget enforcement mechanisms most of the budget enforcement mech anisms under the congressional budget act are permanent14 in

procedures but indicated that his administration will work with congress to develop budg et enforcement mech anisms including extending the bea procedures15 background the budget enforcement act was enacted to modify the budget enforcement procedures established in 1985 by the ba lanced budget and emergency deficit control act title ii of pl 99177 commonly known as the grammrudman hollings act the balanced budget act created sequestration process tied to annual maximum defic it targets established in law declining to zero by fy199116 if the budget deficit exceeded those target levels plus marginoferror amount in some years automatic acrosstheboard spe nding cuts would be triggered to bring the deficit to within the allowable level the process was intended to provide an incentive to congress and the president to reduce the deficit through legislative action to avoid an automa tic sequestration the budget enforcement act of 1990 changed the focus of the sequestration process instead of maximum deficit targets the bea tied sequestration to new statutory limits on discretionary spending and payasyougo paygo requirement for new direct spending and revenue legislation the change was intended to hold congress and the president accountable for projected budget outcomes that would re sult from new legislation rather than the level of the deficit which could be affected by factor s beyond their direct control such as economic growth inflation and mographic changes the bea procedures were extended in 1993 and 199717 currently adjustable discretionary spending limits exist for the following categories highway and mass transit spending for fy2002fy2003 conservation spending divided into six subcategories for fy2002fy2006 and other discretionary spending also called

transit and conservation the initial bea of 1990 required the adjustment of the spending caps to accomm odate various factors the 1997 extension modified the set of various factors currently the spending caps must be adjusted to reflect 1 changes in concepts and definitions 2 discretionary spending that the president designates as emergency requirements and that congress so designates in statute 3 special outlay allowances to accommodate estimatin g differences between omb and cbo 4 appropriations for continuing disability review s 5 allowance for international monetary fund contributions 6 allowance for interna tional arrearages and 7 appropriations for an earned income tax credit compliance initiative 19 unless the discretionary spending limits nd the associated sequestration process are extended beyond fy2002 this particular pro cedure will have effect this yearrevenue legislation enacted for fiscal year may not cause positive balance reflecting an increase in the onbudget deficit or reduction in the onbudget surplus on multiyear paygo scorecard for each fiscal year this scorecard maintains the balances of the accumulated budgetary effects of laws enacted during the session and prior years the paygo re quirement applies to legislation enacted through fy2002 but it covers the effect s of such legislation through fy2006 the discretionary spending limits and paygo requirement are enforced primarily by seque stration which involves automa tic largely acrosstheboard spending cuts in nonexempt programs sequestration is triggered if the omb director estimates in the final sequestration report that one or more of the discretionary spending limits will be exceeded or the paygo requirement will be violated the president is required to issue sequestration order cancelling budgetary resources in nonexempt programs within the applicable spending category by the amount of any spending limit breach or paygo violation withinsession sequestration is possible if supplementa l appropriations bill causes the spending levels of the current fiscal year to exceed the statutor limit for particular category if supplemental appropriations act cau ses discretionary spending limit to be exceeded in the last quarter of fiscal year ie july 1 through september 30 the spending limit for the applicable category for the following fiscal year must be reduced by the amount of the violation19 the discretionary spending limits as well as paygo requirement similar to the statutory one also may be enforced th rough points of order while

discussion many members of congress as well as outside observers agree that the budget enforcement mechanisms associated with the bea promoted fiscal discipline throughout the 1990s and contributed to th federal government achieving unified budget surplus in fy1998the first in almost 30 years some have argued that such fiscal discipline mechanisms are necessary even in times of surpluses and that the bea should be extended for this purpose th return of budget deficits at least in the short term has further increased the inte rest in some form of budget enforcement procedures beyond fy200220 the success of the 1990 bea and its ex tensions in 1993 and 1997 is generally attributed to the fact that the procedures were used to enforce multiyear agreements on budget policies thus consensus on budget policies was prelude to the creation and previous extensions of th bea procedures presumably then an agreement on budget policies would be cr itical to the success of any extension beyond fy2002 an extension of the bea by itself is not likely to create consensus on budget policies where none exists if congress and the president decide th at these budget enforcement mechanisms should be extended they will need to deci whether the bea procedures should be extended in their current form or m odified possible questions congress might consider include21 what time frame should the extension cover the initial bea of 1990 and its extensions in 1993 and 1997 each covered 5 fiscal years22 congress might want to base the time frame on the number of fiscal years determined to be necessary to achieve specific budget go eg an onbudget balance for instance the 1997 extension was inte nded to produce unified balanced budget at the end of the 5 fiscal year s however the initial 1990 bea and the 1993 extension were not intended to achie ve specific budget goal at the end of their 5 fiscal years other than certain amount of deficit reduction should one overall discretionary spendi ng cap be established or should separate caps for different cate gories of discretionary spending be established under an overall discretionary cap any breach would result in sequester in all nonexempt discreti onary programs under separate caps any breach of one or more of the caps would result in sequester only in nonhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31478crs13 23 for example see us congress

programs within the violating category therefore an advantage of separate caps is that they ensure vi olation and subseque nt sequester in one category would not harm programs in other categories in addition they would prevent spending cuts in one category from being used to increase spending in another category disa dvantage of separate caps is that they would reduce the flexibility of congress and the president by limiting the ability to make tradeoffs between programs in different categories what if any adjustments to the spending caps should be allowed many would agree that some adjustments or safety valves are necessary to make the spending caps realistic and secure their compliance this may be especially important at this time because of the uncertainty of future demands on federal resources for the war on rrorism and homeland security an adjustment for such purposes may be desirable in any extension of discretionary caps while other existing adjustments may be reexamined the adjustment for spending designated as an emergency requirement in particular has been criticiz ed by many in congress as costly loophole which has been used to circumvent the stat utory spending caps rather than respond to true emergencies23 critics have proposed liminating the emergency designation adjustment assuming cer tain level of em ergency spending within the new caps specifying criteria in statute regarding what constitutes an emergency or combination of these proponents of an emergency spending adjustment argue that realis tic discretionary spending caps would prevent the misuse of the emergency desi gnation for more on this issue see the discussion of budgeting for em ergencies later in this report should the paygo requirement for new direct spending and revenue legislation be modified to permit direct spending increases or tax cuts as long as onbudget deficit results under the existing paygo requirement any onbudget surplus cannot be used for dir ect spending increases or tax cuts24 opponents of the current requirement ar gue that this should be changed to apply only to new direct spending or revenue legislation that would increase the onbudget deficit or cause an on budget deficit similar to the current paygo point of order in the senate25 proponents of the existing requirement argue that any onbudget surplus shoul d be used for bt reduction or to extend the solvency of the social s ecurity and medicare trust funds instead of direct spending increases or tax cutshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31478crs14 26 for example the fy2002 budget resoluti on hconres 83 assumed discretionary spending amounts much higher than the existin g caps for fy2002 as well as direct spending and revenue legislation that would have violated the paygo requirement in add ition during the 1st session of the 107th congress legislation was in troduced in the house hr 3084 and senate s 1575 to revise the discretionary spending caps for fy2002 and

surpluses but different ones than those created in times of deficits in the last few years congress nd the president have made ad hoc modifications to the bea to avoid sequester for the upcoming

budgetar decisions however can sometimes reduce or exacerbate budgetary conflict some mbers of congress argue that the annual adoption of the congressional budget in the form of concurrent resolution

proposed to transform th annual congressional budget from concurrent resolution to joint resolution and thereby formally and directly involve the president in congressional deliberations on the budget early in the process like bills joint resolutions are legislative form used to make law background prior to the congressional budget act cba of 1974 titles iix of pl 93 344 congress did not adopt an overall budget plan but rather considered authorization revenue and appropriations legi slation separately there was formal mechanism in place to develop consider and approve comprehensive congressional budget plan the 1974 cb established the annual concurrent resolution on the budget as the centerpiece of the congressional budget process the budget resolution sets forth aggregate sp ending and revenue levels and spending levels by major functional area for at leas t 5 fiscal years the budget resolution also may contain reconciliation instructions directing one or more committees to recommend legislative changes to achieve th levels of direct spending revenues and the debt limit agreed to in the budget resolution because the budget resolution is in the legislative form of concurre nt resolution it is not presented to the president for his signature and thus does not become law instead if adopted with the same language by both the house and senate it constitutes an agreement between the house and senate on congressional budget plan providing framework for subsequent legislative action on budgetary legislation during session of congress during the development and considerat ion of the congressional budget act congress intentionally decided to express its overall budget plan in the form of concurrent resolution in order to creat budget process independent of the president and dependent solely on c ongressional action under which congress would be unconstrained by presidential preferences30 the concurrent budget resolution provides congress with its own statement of budget policy generally as response to the presidents budget critics argue that this process highlights and may even encourage the conflict betw een the two branches during the initial formulation of budget policies each year th ey further argue that this process makes it more difficult for the two branches to cooperate later in the process when substantive spending and revenue measures require the presidents signature in particular critics claim that this disincentive for early cooperation in the process contributes to the recurring inability of congress and the president to enact the regular appropriations acts by the beginning of the fiscal year on october 1 in the 27 years since the creation of the budget resolution in 1974 all regular appropriations bills were enacted by the start of the fiscal year only four times in 1976 1988 1994 and 1996httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31478crs16 31 for summary of these negotiations and the subsequent agreement see pact aims to

budget into joint resolu tion requiring the presidents signature they argue that joint budget resolution would be more effective in guiding budget policy by formally and directly involving the president in cong ressional deliberations on the budget early in the process acco rding to proponents this early involvement would foster cooperation between the two branches leading to less conflict when spending and tax legisla tion implementing budget reso lution policies are finalized later in the session proponents of joint budget resolution poi nt to the apparent success of budget summits where congressional leaders and the president have negotiated an agreement on an overall budget plan and then implemented that agreement with the subsequent enactment of legislation recent example is the interbranch negotiations that led to the 1997 bipartisan budget agreement31 joint budget resolution advocates argue would formaliz these negotiations effectively requiring congress and the president to begin negotia tions on the budget early in the process each year they claim that early negotiations and the requirement that the president sign the budget resolution would increase th likelihood of the two branches reaching an agreement over broad budget policies if an early agreement is not reached proponents argue that at the very least th formal process would force congress and the president to confront the disagreements early in the process instead of at the end when there is rush to enact all the appropriations measures by the start of the new fiscal year in order to avoid government shutdown critics of joint budget resolution count er that formalizing early negotiations between congress and the president w ould not guarantee agreement on budget policies they contend that interbranch negotiations nd any subsequent agreement largely depend on the degree of consensu s on budget policy rather than budget procedures opponents further argue that requiring the president to sign the budget resolution may even make an agreement more difficult to reach by aggregating the budget disputes into one piece of legislati on and thereby raising the political stakes opponents also argue that agreement on broad budget policies would not prevent disagreements from arising over details in subsequent legislation implementing those policies thus they contend that transforming the concurrent budget resolution into joint resoluti on would not itself result in more timely enactment of budgetary gislation as in tended by its supporters the 1997 bipartisan budget agreement is cited as an illustrative example even though congress and the president agreed to br oad 5year plan to balance the budget by fy2002 in late spring 1997 final action on budgetary legislation

than he already exercises under the existing budget pro cess they point to the fact that the presidents signature is required on th spending and re venue legislation implementing the budget resolution policies thus joint budget resolution would simply entail obtaining the presidents pproval at the beginning of the process instead of only at the end legislative history early congressional interest in converting the conc urrent resolution on the budget into joint resolution coincide d with the practice of negotiating budget agreements between congressional leaders and the president commonly referred to as budget mmits beginning in the late 1980s33 since then joint budget resolution has been perennial component of budget process reform proposals in congress between 1989 and 2000 at least 26 bills were introduced that would have converted the concurrent budget resolution into joint budget resolution on march 31 1998 the task force on budget process of the house budget committee held the first hearing specifically concerned with the question of whether the concurrent budget resolution should be converted into joint resolution34 this hearing along with other hearings on the subject

discussion proposals to reform the existing proce ss of budgeting for emergencies largely involve establishing reserve fund for em ergencies with the appropriation of such funds tied to meeting specific criteria c oncerning what constitutes an emergency proponents of an emergency reserve f und argue that the average annual amount of overall emergency spending can be pr ojected based on past experience even though specific emergencies cannot be predic ted therefore they further argue that an expected amount of emer gency spending should be in corporated into the overall amount of spending in the presidents budget and the budget resolution as well as any statutory spending limits if they are extended beyond fy2002 proponents of an emergency reserve fund suggest that an historical average of actual emergency spending would provide sufficient funds to meet specific emergenc ies as they arise for instance the most recent emerge ncy reserve fund proposal hr 853 106th congress the comprehensive budget pro cess reform act of 1999 required that such fund be based on 5year rolling average of actual emergency spending some critics have ques tioned whether setting aside funds for unknown emergency situations is ppropriate particularly when the federal budget shows deficit the money set aside for an emergency reserve fund presumably would require limiting and may even require reducing spending for ongoing programs andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31478crs23 activities making such choices at the be ginning of the budget process would require congress to make tradeoffs between sp ecific ongoing programs and general emergency situations that is congress would be required to make offsetting cuts in ongoing programs without knowing wh at specific situation or purpose it was financing or even if all of the funding would be needed in contrast under the current process congress can weigh the rits of spending for ongoing programs with those of specific em ergency situation some may argue that this existing process allows congress to make more rational budgetar tradeoffs in addition setting aside large specified amount of funds may provide an incentive to appropriate more funds than necessary in order to spend the entire amount in the reserve fund by the end of the fiscal year in contrast the current process does not provide any incentives to spend speci fic amount on emergencies but only an amount determined as emer gency situations arise emergency reserve fund proposals also require that appropriations from the reserve fund meet specific criteria regarding what constitutes an emergency proponents often suggest vari ations of the omb criteria issued in 1991 for instance hr 853 106th congress defined an emergenc as situation that requires new spending for the prevention or mitiga tion of or response to loss of life or property or threat to national security and is unanticipated this proposal defined an unanticipated situation as one that is sudden urgent unfor eseen and temporary critics of enacting specific criteria into law often argue that such mechanisms could hinder the ability of congress and the president to respond to emergency situations quickly they maintain that any specific criteria would not eliminate the subjective nature of the decisionmaking process instead they argue that reserve fund mechanism tied to specific criteria would give few decision makers presumably the chairs of the budget committees effective control over emergency spending decisions therefore disagreem ents over the application of the specific criteria with those in congress who would be responsible for releasing such funds potentially could cause unnecessary delays in responding to emergency situations in addition requirement to meet each criterion might neglect the unique circumstances of any given emergency situ ation for instance the urgency of particular situation may outweigh the failure to meet all criteria proponents of an emergency reserve f und mechanism also propose to eliminate the emergency designation process associated with the budget enforcement act as noted above spending designated as an emergency by congress and the president is effectively exempt from the statutory spending caps if the bea procedures are not extended beyond fy2002 the emergency designa tion issue will be irrelevant if the bea procedures are extended proponents ar gue that new discretionary spending limits should assume certain level of emergency spendi ng based on an historical average making an adjustment for emergencydesignated spending unnecessary they maintain that the emergency design ation process is costly loophole which has been used to circumvent the statutory spending caps rather than respond to true emergencies opponents however argue that allowing adjustments for unanticipated spending provide necessary safety valve within the restrictive spending constraints they claim that this safety

in the consideration and enactment of appropriations have been source of chronic difficulties in the budget process when delays prevent the enactment of regular appropriations before the start of the fiscal year october 1 congress and the president typically enact stopgap funding in the form of continuing resolutions crs if neither the regular appropriation for an agency nor continuing resolution is enacted funding will lapse for that agency such lapse or funding gap will result in shutdown of the affected ag ency one possible reform of the budget process that has been proposed is to provide for the automatic continuation of appropriations at the start of fiscal year in the absence of an agencys regular appropriation to avert shutdowns60 in some ways an automatic continuing resolution is an alternative to biennial budgeting as method for dealing with dela ys in the consideration and enactment of budgetary legislation rather than provide longer defi ned period for consideration an automatic continuing resolution would pr ovide an indefinite period and alleviate the most dire consequence of failure to enact appropriations in timely fashion background continuing resolutions have been empl oyed to provide temporary funding of federal agencies and programs since 1876 and have become regular part of the annual budget cycle since the start of th fiscal year was shifted to october 1 beginning with fy1977 there have been only 3 years for which continuing resolutions have been enacted fy1989 1995 and 199761 table 2 below shows the number of regular appropriations bills that were enacted at the beginning of the new fiscal year since fy1990httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31478crs26 62 from the late 1970s through the late 1980s it was common practice for continuing resolutions to become vehicles for one or more regular appropriations acts this practice reached its peak in fy1987 and 1988 when the fi nal continuing resolution incorporated all 13 regular appropriations acts there are requirements concerning th duration of continuing resolutions some may provide funding for single da while others may provide funding for several weeks or even through the end of the fiscal year62 consequently the number of continuing resolutions enacted can vary independent of the length of time after october 1 required to comple action on appropriations in addition to regular appropriations bills enacted table 2 shows the number of continuing resolutions that have been enacted since fy1990 table 2 regular appropriations enacted by october 1 and continuing resolutions

continuing resoluti ons because continuing resolutions are generally written for short periods of time they are usually framed in terms of rates of spending roughly the nnual level of funding divide d by the duration of the cr rather than specific amounts of money continuing resolutions typically provide funds at some formuladriven rate such as some percentage of the previous years rate or the rate provided in an appropriations bill passed by the house or senate but not yet ready for transmittal to the president however continuing resolutions may also provide exceptions to such form ulas providing more or less funding ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31478crs27 63 first enacted in 1870 and strengthened in 1905 and 1906 the antideficiency act is codified at 31 usc 13411342 15111519 the

programs it should also be noted that in most cases continuing resolutions provide funds only for the continuation of funding for existing agencies and programs and not for any new spending initiatives continuing resolutions are necessary b ecause lapse in funding for an agency or program will result in shutdown of the affected agency this is because the antideficiency act generally prohibits an agency from entering into any obligation to spend federal funds in th absence of appropriations63 as result in the event of funding gap federal agencies are re quired to shut down all nonemergency functions and activities the budget enforcement act subsequently provided that the exception for emergencies does not in clude ongoing regular functions of government the suspension of which would not imminently threaten the safety of human life or the protection of property64 one factor complicating the consideration of an automatic continuing resolution in recent years has been how they are rega rded under the current system of budgetary control the current system differentiates between discretionary and direct spending although continuing appropriations are considered discretionary spending an automatic continuing resolution would be regarded as direct spending because it would provide legal authority to obligate funds outside of the regular appropriations process as result the cost estimate for hr 853 and s 558 prepared by cbo would have significant impact on the paygo process65 under current procedures the consideration of bill to provide an automatic continuing resolution could thus be potentially subject to points of orde r enforcing paygo the enactment of measure containing direct spending could also be problematic under current procedures and could trigger sequester if it were not ffset by reductions in other direct spending increases in revenues or some combination of bot h or if statutory language was not also enacted to make compensatory adjustments to the paygo scorecard options and discussion the main feature for distinguishing am ong the possible options for an automatic continuing resolution has been the funding level proposals have been discussed that would provide funding at the level of the pr evious fiscal year r the previous fiscal years level adjusted for inflation set percentage of the level of the previous fiscal year such as 95 or 98 the house r senate passe d level or even the level recommended in the presidents budgethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31478crs28 to some observers shutdown of the fe deral government is disproportionate consequence of delays in acting regular appropriations they suggest that it would be better to provide for the automatic tinuation of current ppropriations allowing the appropriations process to proceed in an orderly if not timely fashion without the threat of government shutdown cong ress and the president would be able to enact spending laws wit hout crisis atmosphere proponents of an automatic continuing re solution also point to the costs of federal government shutdown these costs include not only the direct costs to the government of shutdown but also pay fo r federal workers during the period of the shutdown which has been customary even though work is not performed it also includes less direct costs such as the costs to beneficiaries of fe deral programs whose benefits might be delayed and private sector entities whose business with the government is disrupted opponents of an automatic continuing re solution counter by suggesting that an automatic funding mechanism would be st rong disincentive for lawmakers to reach an agreement on new appropriations they assert that while government shutdown is an undesirable outcome it provides all sides with an incentive to reach agreement therefore by eliminating the threat of shutdown an automatic continuing resolution could undercut that incentive and budget agreement might be more difficult to achieve opponents also argue that by providing guarantee for level of funding in the absence of new legislation an automatic continuing resolution could provide an advantage in negotiations to those who are opposed to the proposed new level of spending and thus an incentive not to reach agreement in such situation the level provided for by the automatic continuing reso lution would be critical issue level of 98 or 100 of the previous years funding level could be seen by some as providing adequate funding leaving little incentive to negotiate proposals to use the presidents proposal as the fallback vel could provide little incentive for the president to negotiate the level of appropria tions this opponents argue would undermine congresss constituti onal responsibility to wield the power of the purse since it negates their ability to exercise deliberate choice in making appropriations legislative history although the idea of an automatic conti nuing resolution has been discussed for number of years it has received formal consideration by congress on only few occasions in the 105th congress proposal was consider ed in both the house and senate in conjunction with supplemental appr opriations measure for fy1997 s 672 in that case the proposal would have pr ovided for an automatic continuation of appropriations if necessary for fy1998 but would have had effect beyond that year the proposal as originally form ulated would have continued funding in fy1998 at 98 of the fy1997 level an amendment was offered during senate consideration that would have struck the

permanence of much federal spending the process of formulating enacting and executing budgets has remained characteristi cally annual this annual budget cycle poses dilemma for congress on th one hand annual re view of spending legislation can afford congress the opportun ity to maximize its influence concerning the operation of various prog rams and policies on th other hand annual action on budgetary matters consumes significant amount of congresss time resulting in desire by some members to reduce the num ber or frequency of budget measures that need to be considered one possible re form that has been proposed to accomplish this is to change the budget cycle to 2 years from one year70 background the efficient operation of an annual budg et cycle is in many ways dependent on the timely enactment of budgetary legisl ation consideration of budget questions in the form of concurrent resolutions on the budget authorization measures regular appropriations supplemental appropriations continuing resolutions public debt legislation revenue measures and reconciliation bills are often closely linked so that delays in consideration of one measure will have an impact on several other budgetary measures one consequence of this is that budgetary legislation particularly final action on regular appropriations m easures has significantly contributed to the need for extended congressional sessions as shown in table 3 final action in recent years on the last regu lar appropriations bill either separately or as part of an omnibus measure has occurred an average of 75 days after the start of the fiscal year on october 1 considering budgetary legislation with duration of 2 years might be one way to reduce the like lihood that congress would need to endure extended sessions as frequentlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31478crs31 71 most recently the administration of george w bush made biennial budgeting part of its initial budget proposals blueprint for new

2002 107115 107116 107117january 10 2002 102 source calendars of the house of representatives one consistent source of support for bie nnial budgeting has been the presidency the administrations of the past four presid ents have all supported the idea of biennial budgeting71 one of the most visible examples of this occurred during the clinton administration th 1993 report of the national performance review the gore report noted considerable time could be savedand used more effectivelyin both the executive and legislative bran ches of government if budgets and appropriations were moved to biennial cycle72 options and discussion because budgeting for the federal g overnment encompasses number of processes biennial budgeting can have several meanings biennial budgeting can involve 2year budget resolutions 2year appropriations and multiyear authorizations in addition biennial budget proposals typically require that executive branch planning and performance reviews be revised so that they be based on 2 year cycle typically biennial budgeting proposals such as hr 981 107th congress the budget responsibility and efficiency ac t of 2001 include all three aspects ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31478crs32 congressional budgeting alt hough proposals embracing only one or two are possible options for example the biennial budgeting component of reform proposal reported by the senate rules and administration committee in 1994 s 1824 103rd congress the legislative reorganiza tion act of 1994 included 2year budget resolutions and multiyear authorizations but not 2year appropriations another significant option concerns the period for which money will be appropriated one option would be to retain the current syst em of fiscal years and enact budgetary legislation allocated between two oney ear periods alternately biennial appropriations could pr ovide funding for the entire 2year fiscal period increasing flexibility for apportioning money ove r the course of the biennium advocates of biennial budgeting feel that reducing the number of times that congress has to consider budget questi ons will likewise reduce the amount of time consumed by the process supporters proj ect that the benefits of 2year cycle would include more time for congress to conduct agency and program oversight and more time for budget planning within cong ress as well as better longrange planning by federal agencies and by state and local governments proposals to convert the fede ral budget process to 2year cycle are also favored by some who believe that 2year cycle provides greater flexibility with regard to deadlines without the pressure to enact budgetary legi slation every year there would be greater time available for making decisions within the budget cycle and more efficient coordination of budgetary d ecisions this they assert would result in fewer delays and mo re timely enactment of necessary legislation supporters also point to the multiyear nature of the summit agreements between congress and the president that have been part of the budget process for more than decade as evidence of the efficacy of mu ltiyear budgeting and as major factor in recent years for promoting more efficien t consideration of budgetary legislation critics of biennial budgetin g have countered by arguing that some of the projected benefits could prove to be illusory reducing the number of times that congress considers budget matters they suggest may only raise the stakes and thereby heighten the possibility for conflict and increased delay in addition enacting budget resolution and spending legislati on every other year could be effective in reducing congressional workload or aiding longerterm planning only in the second year of the cycle with only limited ab ility to anticipate future conditions critics argue that 2year cycle could require congress to choose between allowing the president greater latitude for making budget ary adjustments or engaging in mid cycle corrections to degree that coul d nullify any anticipat ed time savings or planning advantages furthermore they argue that annual revi ew of appropriations requests is an important part of oversight that would be lost under biennial budget with guarantee that separate oversight session w ould be effectivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31478crs33 73 for more detailed
