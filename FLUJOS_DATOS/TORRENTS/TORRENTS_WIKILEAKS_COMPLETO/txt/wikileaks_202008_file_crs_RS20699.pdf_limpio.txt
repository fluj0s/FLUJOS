vs traditional taxexempt bonds steven maguire analyst in public finance government and finance division summary this report outlines the16 billion qualified zone academy bond qzab program and provides estimates of the implicit borrower subsidy and the estimated federal revenue loss arising from the tax credits it provides qzabs are debt instruments that local education agencies sell to finance school renovation and modernization the interest on these bonds is paid by the federal government through tax credits to the bond holder the bondholders are allowed to apply the credits to their federal corporate income tax or alternative minimum tax liability the current qzab program is more expensive to the federal government than traditional taxexempt bonds the joint committee on taxation estimates the federal revenue loss to be 649 million through 2009 almost three times the cost of traditional taxexempt debt in addition to subsidy and revenue loss estimates this report briefly reviews hr 1076 and chapter 2 of s 7 both of which include 1 qzab program expansion and 2 additional tax credit bond capacity for school construction this report will be updated as legislative events merit introduction and background in june 2000 report the national center for education statistics projected that the nations schools needed about 127 billion to repair or upgrade facilities to good overall condition1 to encourage more school renovation and repair congress passed legislation in 1997 pl 10534 that lowers the cost of borrowing for some school districts

committee on taxation general explanation of tax legislation enacted in 1997 joint committee print part 2 105th congress 1st session washington gpo 1997 pp 4041 4 ibid debt instruments called qualified zone academy bonds or qzabs the qzab program was extended for two additional years in 1999 by pl 1061702 specifically the zone academy typically state education authority or local school district receives zero interest rate loan for school renovation and the lender is allowed tax credit against federal income taxes the 1997 legislation limited the volume of such debt to 400 million annually for 1998 and 1999 the program was extended in 1999 with another 400 million for both 2000 and 2001 for total of 16 billion over the fouryear life of the program following is brief overview of the zone academy program qzab qzab is bond issued by state or local government containing provisions requiring that 1 95 of the proce eds be used for the purpose of renovating providing equipment to developing course materials for use at or training teachers and other school personnel in qualified zone academy and 2 private entities promise to contribute to the qualified zone academy certain equipment technical assistance or training employee services or other property or services with value equa l to at least 10 of the bond proceeds3 qualified zone academy school qualifies as zone academy if 1 the school is public school that provides education and training below the college level 2 the school operates special academic program in coope ration with busine sses to enhance the academic curriculum and increase graduation and employment rates and 3 either the school is located in an empowerment zone or enterprise community including empowerment zones designated or authorized to be designated under the act or b it is reasonably expected that at least 35 of the students at the school will be eligible for free or reducedcost lunches under the school lunch program established under the national school lunch act4 qzab capacity the states which allocate bond capacity to the local academies can carry forward any unused bond capacity within certain time limits the allocation to the states is made on the basis of their portion of individuals below the poverty line thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20699crs3 5 26 usc 1397e the term of the bond is equal to the following log2log1 r the variable r is the discount rate of the average annual interest rate of the taxexempt obligations having term of 10 years or more which are issued during the month 6 not mentioned in this report are the gains to taxexempt bondholders in marginal income tax brackets above the market clearing rate the aftertax equivalency between taxexempt debt and taxable debt depends upon the marginal tax rate which we implicitly assume is constant however if taxpayer holding taxexempt debt is in marginal tax bracket greater than the rate which deter mines the market clearing rate the subsidy is actually greater because the investor would have accepted lower taxexempt bond return1998 and 1999 qzab allocations must be made by december 31 of 2001 and 2002 respectively the 2000 and 2001 allocations must be used by december 31 2002 and 2003 respectively qzab buyerslimited to banks insurance companies and corporations actively engaged in the business of lending moneyare allowed to claim an annual federal tax credit for the life of the bond qzab term and credit rate the maximum term shall be the term which the secretary of treasury estimates will result in the present value of the obligation to repay the principal on the bond being equal to 50 of the face amount of the bond5 the term has fluctuated between 12 and 14 years because fluctuating interest rates change the present value estimate the credit is equal to the credit rate set by the department of treasury multiplied by the face value of the bond because the credit is included in taxable income investors require an aftertax yield equivalent to that of taxable bonds for this reason the treasury establishes the credit rate based upon the average yield of mix of high gradecorporate bond yields with maturities of 10 years or more analysis of the current qzab program three general types of bonds many different types of bonds are available to investors this discussion and analysis is limited to three general categories one the qzabs described above two bonds whose interest payment is included in taxable income taxable bonds and three bonds whose interest payment is not included in taxable federal income taxexempt bonds the potential federal revenue effect of the three bonds is presented in table 1 the most expensive bond in terms of federal revenue foregone is the qzab taxable bonds are the least expensive because they do not generate federal revenue loss the three types of bonds in table 1 have face value of 100 and an aftertax return of 4875 the difference between the taxable bond interest rate and the taxexempt bond interest rate is calculated to maintain equivalent aftertax returns in theory the aftertax return of the two investments should converge all else equal the second column b represents the amount borrower must pay for use of loaned funds6 clearly the qzab where the federal government pays for the zone academys use of the borrowed funds is the most advantageous to the borrower the lender is indifferent among the three because the aftertax return is fixed at 4875 dollars for every 100 borrowedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20699crs4 7 if the marginal tax rate were lower the federal loss from qzabs would be larger lower marginal tax rate generates less revenue from inclusion of the credit in taxable income though the credit is fixed rate regardless of marginal tax ratecolumn d reports the taxable interest income multiplied by the corporate taxpayers tax rate 35 in our example7 both the taxable bond interest and the qzab tax credit are included in taxable income thus both generate federal revenue however the qzab also provides tax credit and creates revenue loss equal to the tax credit rate multiplied by the bond face value as reported in column the tax credit which is based upon the taxable bond interest rate results in net revenue loss equal to the interest rate on tax exempt bonds 2625 750 4875 the 2625 is the additional federal revenue from inclusion of the credit in income and the 75 is the tax credit allowance on july 26 2001 the qzab rate was 699 and the term was 13 years table 1 calculating the implicit subsidy to

qualifies and has tax liability column f represents the implicit federal subsidy to the borrower the subsidy is measured by the percentage points below the taxable bond interest rate arising from the favorable tax treatment that the borrower paid for the use of funds generally there is not tax advantage to holding taxable bonds with taxexempt debt the subsidy is the difference between taxable and taxexempt bond interest rates or 2625 in our example and finally for qzabs because there is little or interest cost to the borrower the subsidy is equal to the taxable bond interest rate table 2 presents the estimated potential federal revenue loss in nominal dollars of the present qzab program through 2009 the joint committee on taxation jct published estimates of the revenue loss for each qzab bill pl 10534 and pl 106 170 and the total revenue loss presented in the last column is the sum of the two estimates the 1997 estimates for pl 10534 for 2008 and 2009 were not reported the estimates are in nominal dollars and thus do not account for the time value of money generally the loans for construction today will be repaid through credits in laterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20699crs5 years with cheaper dollars the revenue loss relative to the construction cost is overstated for this reason table 2 estimated federal revenue loss generated by

1400ga1 of s 7 and 1400la1 of hr 1076 both state that 95 of the proceeds must be used for the stated purpose 9 the implicit subsidy for taxexempt bonds is the difference between its interest rate and the interest rate on taxable bonds 2625 in our example for tax credit bonds it is the taxable bond interest rate 75 in our exampleacquisi tion of land on which such facility is to be constructed8 these new bonds modeled after qzabs would not be more than 15 years in term and the national limit would be 11 billion each for 2002 and 2003 of the 22 billion 60 would be allocated to states based upon their schoolage population and the remaining 40 to the 125 school districts with the largest number of lowincome children in addition indian or tribal schools would be allocated 200 million annually for 2002 and 2003 which would be administered by the department of the interior the legislation would also expand qzab spending to include new construction remove the restrictions on the holders of modernization bonds and extend the initiative to 2002 and 2003 with another 14 billion in debt capacity for each year summary the qzab program represents shift in the burden of financing the renovation of qualified institutions from state and local taxpayers to federal taxpayers for every dollar of spending on school infrastructure through the qzab program the implicit subsidy of federal taxpayers and benefit to borrowers appears to be almost three times9 as much as an alternative financing mechanism traditional taxexempt municipal bonds and as indicated by table 2 the joint committee on taxation has estimated the federal revenue loss to be about 649 million through 2009 however the federal revenue loss for the entire program is probably greater in nominal dollars than this estimate because the bonds are outstanding for 12 or 13 years or well beyond 2009 for example qzabs issued in 1998 will not expire until 2010 and those issued in 2001 may not expire until 2014 alternatively the time value of money does attenuate the potential real ie inflation adjusted revenue loss from the qzab program
