divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31617the economic effects of 911 retrospective assessment summary the tragedy of september 11 2001 was so sudden and devast ating that it may be difficult at this point in time to wr ite dispassionately nd objectively about its effects on the us economy this retr ospective review will attempt such an undertaking the loss of lives and proper ty was not large enough to have had measurable effect on the productive capacity of the united states even though it had very significant localized effect on new york city and to lesser degree on the greater washington dc area thus for the tragedy to affect the economy it would have had to have affected the price of an important input such as energy or had an adverse effect on aggregate demand via such mechanisms as consumer and business confidence financial panic or liquidity cr isis or an international run on the dollar it was initially thought that aggregate demand was seriously affected for while the existing data showed that gdp growth was low in the first half of 2001 data published in october showed that gdp had contracted during the 3rd quarter this led to the claim that the terrorist att acks pushed weak economy over the edge into an outright recession we now know based on revised data this is not so at the time the economy was in its third consecutiv quarter of contraction positive growth resumed in the 4th quarter this would suggest th at any effects from september 11 on demand were short lived while this may be true several events took place before on and shortly after ptember 11 that made recove ry either more rapid than it might have been or made it possible to take place first the federal reserve had eased credit during the first half of 2001 to stimulate aggregate demand the economy responds to policy changes with lag in time thus the public response may have been felt in the 4th quarter giving the appearance that the tragedy had only limited effect second the federal reserve on and imme diately after september 11 took appropriate action to av ert financial panic and liqui dity shortage this was supplemented by support from foreign central banks to shore up the dollar in world markets and limited the contagion from spreading to other national ec onomies nevertheless us trade with other count ries especially canada was disrupted while oil prices spiked briefly they quickly returned to their preseptember 11 levels thus it can be argued time ly action contained the short run economic effects of september 11 on the overall economy over the longer run the tragedy will adversely affect us productivity growth because resources are being and will be used to ensure the security of producti on distribution finance and

flig ht crashed three of them into buildings symbolic in various ways of what they found offensive about the united states and changed the course of american history shortly after this occurred group of crs analysts was called upon to assess the possibl effects of the terrorist attacks on the us economy and the ability of the government to deal with them this was but small part of much larger crs effort on various aspects of terrorism that became an online electronic briefi ng book th is briefing book has been extraordinarily successful and has been used thousands of times by congressional staff over time most of the economic entries served their purposes and were withdrawn while the studies of the crs staff on the economic effects of terrorism were very useful they were not designed to address other important questions related to this tragedy for example what did we learn from this experience that might be useful if the united states were to expe rience other acts of terror while we know how the government re sponded in this inst ance were alternative responses available if they were what were they and why were they not used does this episode suggest that new remedial standby programs s hould be put in place now or are acts of terrorism likely to be so unique that onesizeforall remedial programs are unlikely to be useful it is to address such ques tions that crs presents this retrospective assessment an overview economywide implications and the fiscalmonetary response when the terrorist attack occurred it was known that the us economy was in transition from an unsustainable to sustainable rate of growth to accomplish this the federal reserve began to tight credit in mid1999 this tightening continued through may 2000 key economic indicators reflected this tightening industrial production reached peak in june 2000 and slowly began to decline the two consumer confidence indexes peaked in may 2000 and the unemployment rate began to rise reaching 49 in august 2001 from low of 39 late in 2000 the then available data on gdp growth showed that it was quite low but positive during the first half of 2001 clearly the ec onomy was softening and the possibility of recession loomed httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31617crs2 however the actual state of the economy was quite different from that depicted by the gdp data as result various cl aims were made for the economic effects of 911 which were unfounded in particular that it pushe d weak economy over the edge into an outright contraction this conclusion was based on data released in september october and n ovember which showed large rise in the unemployment rate fall in consumer confidence and contraction in gdp for the 3rd quarter of 2001 as data revisions for gdp were released in the summer of 2002 we learned that gdp began contracting in the 1st quarter of 2001 contr action that continued through the 3rd quarter and that positive growth began again in the 4th quarter at an annual rate of 27 this period of contraction would of course explain the rise in the unemployment rate moreover the fall in consumer confidence seems now to be largely explained by such underlying fact ors as the rise in the unemployment rate the increase in the rate of infla tion and the fall in stock prices thus the events of 911 tragic though they were did not push weak economy over the edge into outright contraction the economy was contracting when 911 occurred and it was poised to shift toward positive growth shortly thereafter the terrorist attacks did cause so severe localized effects especially in and around the target areas and that may have mute d the magnitude of growth in the 4th quarter this fairly modest effect may have been due to assurances given by the federal reserve within hours of the attack that it was still in business and that sufficient liquidity would be available for the financ ial community over the next three days the federal reserve added some 100 billion per day in liquidity as result it can be argued human tragedy was not compounded by financial crisis terrorism and national productivity the lasting economic effect of 911 will be of different nature large amounts of resources are and will be committed to making produc tion distribution finance and communication more secure in the ited states resources that could have been used to enhance the productive capacity of the country will now be used for security since it will ta ke more labor and capital to produce largely unchanged amount of goods and services this will result in slower rate of growth in national productivity price that will be borne by ever american in the form of slower rate of growth of per capita real income oil supply and prices crucial part of us imports whic h now amounts to about 15 of gdp is energy primarily in the form of oil shar p and prolonged increases in the price of oil popularly termed price shocks can have si gnificant negative effects for gdp growth in the short run the individuals involved in the terrorist att acks came from an area that is an important source of the worlds oil producti on it is possible that an oil price shock with possible negative effects on the us economy could have followed from the attacks in this instance it did not except for brief spike in prices that eased within little more than week also it is somewhat reassuring that when major mechanism for determining current and future petroleum prices the newhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31617crs3 york mercantile exchange was closed for week other commodity and futures markets filled in as did the spot mark et and the oil industr was not materially affected world economies because of the large size of the us economy america is an important market for many countries sharp shifts in the health of the us economy can have important short run consequences for th economies of us trading partners especially canada mexico and japan about 40 of canadas output is exported to the united states mexico is also an important trading partner of the us while trade with both countries especially cana da was disrupted in the short run various measures were put in place to minimize these disruptions and indeed they may actually expedite border crossings for an im portant class of trad motor vehicles thus far it would appear that apart from an initial adverse r eaction the short run effects of 911 have not been great on foreign economies the quest for greater security will however impose longer r cost on the world economy both in terms of decline in productivity growth and possibly greater impediments to the free movement of goods services and cap ital these flows have contributed immeasurably to the integration of the wo rld economy and its efficient functioning international capital flows and the dollar while international trade plays an importa nt role in the us economy it is not the only role played by international forces characteristic of the economic expansions of the 1980s and 1990s was the rge net inflow of foreign capital to the united states during the late 1990s this net inflow furnished between onethird and onehalf of the us net saving in times of international crisis and uncertainty foreign capital has often sought refuge in the united states this time however the united states is the battle ground even though there was panic selling of dollar denominated assets after 9 11 it would appear that there was short run decline in the net purchase of us assets by foreig ners this was clearly over by midoctober however this may be due to timely action of the federal reserve which restored confidence in the smooth functioning of the nations payments system action supporting the dollar in intern ational financial ma rkets by the bank of japan and the european central bank among others and inte rest rate cuts by key central banks in support of similar cuts by the federal reserve financial markets while much economic analysis tends to concentrate on the determinants of output and employment modern market ec onomies depend to an important extent on wellfunctioning financial system and financial institutions such as insurance companies commercial banks pension funds stock exchanges etc these institutions play vital function in ensuring that resources represented by saving are transformed into new capital goods they were put in harms way by the terrorist attackshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31617crs4 1 edward wong is bankruptcy good for the airlines new york times

great uncertainty for financial institutions timely action by the federal reserve the city and state of new york the federal emergency management agency and individua ls in the financial sector resulted in the quick return to business by the stock and commodity exchanges in the affected area this not only ensured the timely return to normal operations by the financial system but was also major boost to confidence sectoral industry and geographic effects as the contraction of gdp in the us during the first three quarters of 2001 has adversely affected some sectors and ge ographic areas of the economy more than others so the costs of the terrorist attacks have been borne disproportionately by few industries especially airlines touris m and insurance small businesses in the target areas and the city of new york the major target area airlines the use of commercial airplanes as assault vehicles to wreak havoc on the united states has precedent in aviation history at the time of 911 the industry was already in financial trouble due to the recession 911 severely compounded the industrys financial problem even though the federal government quickly responded with an aid package that gave the airlines access to up to 15 billion consisting of 5 billion in short term assistance and 10 billion in loan guarantees it is by means certain th at the industry will not have to undergo major reorganization typified by us airways filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy and united suggesting that it may take similar course of action1 b insurance insurance was one of two industries profoundly affected by 911 the loss of life and property gave rise to the largest propertycasualty claim in history estimated at 40 billion2 while the industry as whole has both the reserves and liquid assets to settle these claims this will not be the case if terrorist attacks become more frequent occurrence the risk posed by terrorism is new and the industry has little or prior experience upon which to base insu rance rates and hold reserves as result only few insurers are offering limited restricted and expensive coverage for terrorism3 this could have negative effect on the ability of firms and households to acquire the fi nancial wherewithal with which to put in place new buildings and equipment thus far large number of new projects inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31617crs5 diverse geographical

in itial economic setbacks due to the halt of commodities futures trading and losses from delayed shipments of perishable commodities by air and by truck along us borders with canada and mexico these losses proved transitory nonetheless the changing geopolitical developments that have followed 911 have injected sign ificant amount of uncertainty into any predictions about world markets and their

23rds of gdp thus consumer confidence is thought by these individuals to play an important role in business cyclesto business travel and tourism and by th temporary shock to confidence that the terrorist attacks engendered6 these predictions and the theory that 911 caused the recession have proved to be largely unf ounded yet at the time they seemed plausible in retrospect they were in pa rt the product of data that failed to give complete picture of the economy in fact the picture was quite misleading the existing picture of the economy on 911 during 1999 and the first half of 2000 the us economy was growing at between 3 and 5 per year the unemployment rate 39 in september and october 2000 was at 30year low and substantially below estimates consistent with fully employ ed economy this suggests that the economy was character ized by excess demand which could potentially be inflationary to reduce gdp growth to more sustainable rate the federal reserve began in mid 1999 to tighten credit this continued until may 2000 during this period the key federal funds in terest rate was rais ed to 65 from 50 the index of industrial produc tion available monthly reached peak in june 2000 and slowly began to decline by d ecember it had fallen 14 the pace of gdp growth slowed noticeably during the second half of the year from an annualized rate of 5 in the first half to 2 during the second half industr ial production continued to fall during 2001 and by august it wa s down an additional 35 from december however the data then available showed that gdp growth during the first half of 2001 was low but positive the annualized ra during the first two quarters shown by these data was respectively 13 nd 02 the unemployment rate was also on the rise reaching 49 by august clearly the economy was softening and the possibility of recession loomed the data for september and october we re startling indus trial production fell 11 in september the largest single dec line

the gdp contraction coul d have been due to 911 given the few days rema ining in the third quarter the picture of the 2001 economy in 2002 in march and july of 2002 quite different picture of the economy dur ing this crucial period began to emerge on march 26 the national bureau of econo mic research the th ink tank that dates the business cycle for the united states declared that the economy had entered recession beginning in march 2001 6 months before the attacks on july 29 the commerce department published the re visions to the gdp accounts for 19992001 these results are reproduced in table 1 th ey show that gdp had begun to contract in the first quarter of 2001 contracti on that was to continue through the 3rd quarter of the year thus when the terrorist attacks t ook place the us economy was in the third quarter of contraction and in recession whatever effects the attacks may have had on the economy they did not push w eak economy over the edge into outright recession table 1

911 that supposedly pushed the economy into r ecession has recently come under critical scrutiny why it is asked if consumers were so adversely affected by the attacks did they respond in such numbers to the sp ecial financing incentives offered by the automobile companies in october 2001 that d to record motor vehicle sales for that month and another near record month in november crisis in confidence supposedly leads consumers to refrain from purchasing durable goods in this case it did not while it is true as shown above that the indexes of consumer confidence fell did they fall by more than can be explained by the underlying economic variables that confidence depends upon r ecent study suggests that this is not the case9 this implies that the negative eff ects of 911 on the overall economy may have been quite small even if they deepened or prolonged the recession their effects were not long lived for the data in table 1 show that economic growth resumed in the 4th quarter10httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31617crs9 10 continued highernotwithstanding their tragic effects on human life the direct effects of the attacks were too small to make significant dent in the nations overall economic output the direct effects were also too geographically concentrated to cause national recession singleha ndedly although localiz ed recession is certainly possible for new york until the rebuilding process gathers steam local gdp data will not be available for some time but one can see from the unemployment data shown in table 1 that unemployment in new york city rose more sharply after the attacks than in the rest of the country in its 2001 third quarter gdp release th bureau of economic analysis bea stressed that most of the direct effects from the attacks were embedded in the data so that overall estimate could be made for the attacks direct effect on gdp for example consumption of transportation nd recreation services were both negative in the third quarter but it is difficult to say how much of this decline was due directly to the terrorist attacks and how much of the decline would have occurred anyway due to the recession the effects on the insu rance industry were one area where bea could single out the effects of the attack s it adjusted down output in the domestic insurance industry which is measured as premiums less be nefits paid by 213 billion and output among foreign insurers by 44 billion the loss to foreign insurers is counted as decline in imports howev er which boosts measured gdp thus the net effect of the attacks on insuran ce output was to boost nominal gdp by 227 billion when adjusted for inflation howev er the effects on the insurance industry had impact on real gdp because they were considered price adjustments rather than changes in output work interruption and the loss of rental income from destroyed capital are other areas where the attacks directly lowered national income an equivalent measure to gdp the largest cost of the attacks the destruction to capital is not included in gdp although it is measured in other economic statistics while certain aspects of the destruction are not measured in gdp most aspects of the reconstruction are included boosting economic output for example overtime wages of police and firefighters raised national income by 08 billion in the third quarter that the direct effects of the attack are small relative to gdp and shortlived does not mean that the attacks had impact on the economy if the attacks were to have lasting effect on the economy it would have been due to indirect effects for example sharp drop in consumer confid ence or decision by business to postpone capital investments in the face of uncertainty could deepen the recession indeed the university of michigan consumer confiden ce index fell to its lowest level since 1996 in september 2001 and has not yet returned to its august 2001 value another potentially harmful indirect eff ect could be reluctance by fo reigners to invest in the us economy by contrast the rebuilding process could have positive indirect economic effects the indirect effect of the attacks that is likely to be permanent is that greater portion of our national in come will likely be devoted to security measures both public and private see th productivity section any estimates of the indirect effects are purely speculative there is simply comparable historical experiencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31617crs10 11 see robert t parry the us economy after september 11 frbsf economic letter number

resumed september 13 futures and options markets in chicago reopened september 14 and stock markets reopened september 17 it w ill take months to determine the total impact on the insurance i ndustry however the airline tourism and insurance indus tries are the sectors of the economy that have been singled out as potentially suffering the most harm from the terrorist attack in the medium term sectoral gdp data for 2001 are not yet available so it is difficult to determine how seriously these sectors have been affected there are employment data available however and these data show that only the airline industry experienced decline in employment that was significantly larger than the overall decline in employment it is important to remember that declines in the output of these sectors would not lead to equivalent declin in overall economic output for example in this case lower ai rline revenues would be partially offset by higher bus and train revenues actions undertaken monetary policy to forestall any possibility of financial panic or break down in banking activity the federal reserve immediately after the attacks issued simple 17word statement the federal reserve system is open and operating the discount window is available to meet liquidity needs this immediately reassured the financial system that ample liquidity would be available on request to supplement the liquidity sought by banks through the discount window the federal reserve bought large number of gove rnment securities through open market operations in addition the backlog of unc leared checks caused float or federal reserve credit to the financial system to rise on the three days after the attack the federal reserve by all three means injected over 100 billion per day into the financial system11 in addition the federal reserve entered into or expanded existing agreements with the european central bank the bank of canada and the bank of england to swap dollars for foreign curre ncy in order to suppor t foreign financial institutions operating in the united states by these means an additional 90 billionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31617crs11 12 federal reserve bank of chicago 2001

exchange reopened the federal reserve lowered the key federal funds rates by 05 percentage points in the next 3 months it made three additional rate cuts bringing the federal funds target to 175 on december 11 2001 these moves continued the easing of policy that had already reduced the federal funds rate from 65 in january 2001 to 35 prior to 911 in response to the r ecession in evaluating the success of these monetary policy initiatives it is important to keep in mind that shifts in monetary policy ge nerally affect the economy with lag of between 6 and 18 months this implies that the economy may have r eceived significant boost after the attacks from policy changes made months before 911 meaning that the rapid recovery after 911 was not solely attributable to the economys selfcorrective mechanism fiscal policy fiscal policy operates primar ily through the budget deficit larger structural budget defi cit increases aggregate spending in the economy in the short run following september 11 fi scal policy became mo re expansionary although much of the increase was either uni ntended or previously planned federal expenditures rose sharply led by the 40 billion emergency appropriation pl 107 38 to fund relief efforts and these expe nditures were deficit financed automatic stabilizers in the budget were allowed to function for example the decline in tax revenues associated with the decline in th stock market and pe rsonal income was not offset by spending cuts or tax increases in january 2002 components of the major tax cut of 2001 egtrra pl10716 we re phased in as scheduled which increased the budget deficit by an estima ted 31 billion in 2002 these phaseins were planned before september 11 finally stimulus bill was enacted on march 9 2002 pl10747 it included an extension in unemployment benefits and accelerated depreciation rates for corporate investment it is projected to result in revenue loss of 51 billion in 2002 looking to the future the response to 911 dramatically hi ghlights economists arguments favoring monetary policy over fiscal policy the difference in implementation lags changes in monetary policy were implemented on the day of and largely completed within the week following the attacks the fiscal response was sign ificantly slower while the automatic stabilizers and incidental emergency expenditures occurred fairly quickly the stimulus bill was not sign ed into law until march 9 2002 and turned out to be much smaller than either party had originally intended by the time the bill went into effect the recession may have alread ended even though the accelerated depreciation can be claimed for the next 3 years although congress can change budget policies quickly to respond to r ecession or other fiscal emergency the development of significant legislative response to the problem usually requires substantial investment of time and effort consequently such emergency legislation sometimes is enacted and implemented after the need for it has become much less pressing or ceased altogether while pr esidents from time to time have requested extraordinary budgetary powers in order to deal more quickly with fiscalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31617crs12 13 prepared by brian cashell government and finance divisionemergencies congress by and large has re sisted such requests during the 107th congress for example congress rejected president george w bushs request for blank check to fund counterterrorism and related activities in the aftermath of the 911 and instead provided emergenc supplemental appropriations for this purpose under customary procedures septem ber 11 also highlighted the crucial role played by the federal reserve this suggests that the ability of the federal reserve to exercise discretion in ch circumstances is of v ital importance to the economy some have suggested that backup system be put in place to allow the federal reserve to act quickly even if ma jority of the seven governors become incapacitated and cannot act in timely fashion or in wa ys required by law such as having quorum present fo r the conduct of business it is worth noting that decision making on all levels will have to contend with the fact that the available data are unlikel to give an accurate picture of the economy when an attack takes place even if they are produced without much of lag while this is unlikely to be fatal to good deci sion making it is nevertheless likely to be handicap if events continue on their present c ourse future economic historians may conclude that the terrorist attacks pr imarily demonstrated the us economys resilience in spite of dramatic attack at the nations financial center during an economic recession the economy quickly rebounded in part that is because virtually any attack matter how large or dramatic will be small relative to 10 trillion economy any effects an ttack would have on the overall economy depends on indirect effects the course of events following 911 suggests that policymakers are already adept at responding to crises on the macro economic level in preparing for future crises the lesson policymakers may take is that 911 is more aptly viewed as human tragedy than an economic tragedy terrorism and national productivity13 the setting one direct result of 911 is that the cost of domestic security has risen that increased cost is in the form of increased outlays on the military as well as increases in spending for domestic law enforcemen t public safety and private security services some industries such as the ai rlines are more affected than others but there will be nationwide effects because do mestic security is public good ie it must by its nature be provided to everyone and much of the increased cost will be borne by taxpayers in light of the current international political environment it seems likely that many of the factors motivating the demand for increased domestic security will persist for some time given that there is going to be substantial increase inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31617crs13 14 there are also costs that are not reflected in the economic accounts because of increased security screening passengers are standing in line longer before boarding flights and the value of that time is not counted as an increased cost of flyingspending on public safety and security what if any are the macroeconomic consequences and in partic ular the effects on productivity growth likely to be assessing the effects of higher costs for domestic security on the overall economy illustrates some of the limitations of existing measures of economic activity the standard measure of overall economic activity is gross domestic product gdp gdp measures the market value of goods and services produced in the united states it measures only the value of current production although gdp may be the most comp rehensive measure of our national standard of living it necessarily falls short as measure of national wellbeing many items are left out because they are difficult to measure or because there is market in which values are establishe d one example of that would be our diminished sense of security after 911 there is simple way of measuring the level of security itself moreover an important goal of spending on security is the sense people have that they are safe as they go about their lives there is not even unit of measure that allows for an accounting of that sense of security the only straightforward way to measure security is to add up the expenditures for labor and capital that are devoted to the provision of security the effort to regain whatever sense of security the nation enjoyed prior to the attacks is likely to require considerable increase in expenditures the effect of those expenditures on gdp and also on measured productivity growth will depend on where they are spent it seems likely that both government and the private sector will be spending more for increased security the effect on most measures of economic performance will also depend on who spends the money the value of goods and services that ar included in gdp is based on the price paid by the final user in the case of ai rline security the product being consumed is trip if the cost of that trip rises because of the need for more spending by the airlines for airport security that raises th price of the trip without changing any of its characteristics14 because of increased spending on secur ity the nominal value of the production of air travel will rise but other things being equal the increase is attributable to increased production costs the real valu of the production of air travel would be expected to fall as consumers re spond to the rise in price there may also be onceandforall drop in productivity in the airline industry productivity is ratio of the value of produc tion to the value of the inputs labor and capital required to produce it because of the increased demand for security each trip produced by the air line industry will re quire more labor and capital and so productivity will fallhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31617crs14 the effect on other industries w ill be s imilar certainly there will be other instances where the costs of producing give n quantity of goods or services will rise solely because of increased security require ments that will mean an increase in the labor and capital to produce the same level of output as pre911 in each case that means onetime reduction in the leve l of productivity for those industries firms that are likely to face increased security costs are those that by their nature may be vulnerable to attack that would include much of the transportation system as well as transport for those goods that ar inherently dangerous such as fuel and chemicals many utilities such as power stations and water supply may also be affected by increased security requireme nts all goods and services produced by affected firms will experience onetime price increase and those firms will also experience onetime drop in productivity to the extent that the increased bur den of security is provided by the government that may not be reflected in most measures of productivity which account for the private sector nonetheless it will have an effect on productivity in that the cost of maintaining security has increased and resources must be diverted from other uses actions undertaken in november 2001 president bush sign ed the aviation and transportation security act atsa into law atsa among other things created the transportation security agency tsa atsa also provided for federal oversight of airport security and required that s ecurity personnel in ai rports be federal employees and strengthened the air marshal program in order to provide for some of the increased spending atsa authorized increased airline passenger fees as well as fees to be imposed on air carriers for fy2003 the bush administration requested 48 billion to fund the tsa in the case of air travel when security rvices are paid for by the airlines they are an intermediate good that is they are an input to the production of air travel rather than output and are not counted parately in gdp as explained above money spent on security is cost of produc tion and so would be reflected mainly in the price index for air travel and in overall price indexes to the extent that air travel contributes to total production the same is true for security expenditures by any firm engaged in the production of other goods and services in contrast when the government pays for security services it is as final consumer and those expenditures are count ed explicitly as part of gdp any increase in those expenditures will thus appear as both nominal and real contributions to gdp that is not to say that the net effect would necessarily lead to permanent increase in gdp any increase in spending on security by the government must either be at the expense of other spending higher taxes or increased government borrowing similarly individuals may increase their demand for personal security services these expenditures will be reflected in total gdp but they would be at the expensehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31617crs15 15 it is also possible that there could be occasional market disruptions because of the continuing threat of additional terrorism 16 prepared by bernard gelb and lawrence c kumins resources science and industry division and marc labonte gove rnment and finance divisionof purchases of other goods and services or be paid for by reducing household saving individuals will also bear part of the cost of increased security in way that will not be captured by conve ntional economic statistics for example if security screening in airports takes longer than it used to the additional time it takes for airline passengers to complete their trips reduces the quality of the service and thus raises its real price unless and until conditions change the increase in the cost of security is likely to persist that increased cost will either be reflected in higher prices for affected goods and services which would re duce real incomes or in increased public sector spending if increases in public sect or spending are financed by higher taxes that reduces disposable income if they re sult in cuts in other categories of spending that would reduce the incomes those outla ys supported if they are financed by borrowing then other things being equal interest rates will rise thus dampening those sectors of the economy that are sensitiv to interest rate fluctuations in the end the net result is likely to be small mporary reduction in productivity growth due to the increased labor and capital required to increase security and as the increase in the cost of those goods and services which require higher security expenditures to produce f ilter through the economy the increase in labor and capital required to pr oduce safe air travel is likely to be onceandforall change thus any significant effect on productiv ity is likely to be short lived in the long run other factors will determine the rate of growth of productivity in the production of air travel th only enduring effect will be shift in the share of employment and of expenditures devoted to security if productivity growth in those firms providing security services is much slower or much faster than productivity growth in the rest of the economy the incr eased share of spending on security could alter the longrun trend rate of growth of productivity but any effect is likely to be very small relative to the size of th overall economy any longrun costs are likely to be fairly small15 oil supply and prices16 the attacks of september 11th might have had serious impacts on oil markets and consequently upon the economy but they did not thus the realities of post 911 appear to have provided reason fo r government measures to enhance the stability of energy markets effects of the attacks among the immediate effects of the attack on the world trade center was the closing of the new york mercantile exchange nymex and the possibility that oilhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31617crs16 market participants producers refiners marketers and traders would not have one of their bases for setting prices in their contracts and other transactions the nymex is major oil trading market that serves as mechanism for the important function of price discovery the determin ation of current and future prices oil industry entities use as reference points public ly visible and instantly available prices established in markets such as nymex where market and political developments are reflected almost instantaneously in prices embodying the collective judgement of the market participants however other commodity and futures markets filled in for nymex and to some extent the price disc overy function shifted to the spot market it does not appear that the oil industry was materially affected by the closing of the nymex which in any event resume d all operations in about one week while the immediate effect of the attacks on petroleum markets was to drive prices up market forces reflecting little change in supply and demand acted quickly and crude oil prices eased within little more than week average crude oil prices paid by us refiners actually declined for the month of september 2001 falling to 2373 per barrel from 2444 in the previous month the remainder of 2001 saw continuation of price drops due to weakening demand caused by lower jet fuel consumption and warm winter in north america and europe crude oil prices bottomed in december at level onethird below those existing before the attacks events in 2002 action by the organization of petroleum exporting countries and iraqs supply policy promin ent among them have resulted in crude

gallon above augusts 143 but pump prices dropped sharply by yearend reachin g 113 per gallon before rising in spring 2002 they remained stable in the 140 per gallon range between then and september 2002 for the economy as whole shocks to oil prices can have serious negative effects on the growth of gdp and on in flation as experienced in 197374 and 1989 90 but as noted bove the price spike following 911 was brief and it was too shortlived to feed through to the ove rall economy by october 2001 the economy was having more effect on the price of oil in terms of weakening oil demand reducing oil prices than the price of oil was having on the economy for the independent effect of the attacks themse lves on the economy see the section titled economywide implications lessons learned in nutshell the 911 events appear to have had only transitory impact on petroleum markets once fears of supply disruption faded what oil price increases took place dissipated very shortly and significant declines followed during the remainder of 2001 economic developments following 911 monstrated that crises that do not adversely affect the fundame ntals of supply or demand in energy

size and stre ngth to provide the economic stimulus to world economies necessary to help pull them out of the global recession japan and western europe remained coupled to the us business cy cle and have remained dependent on exports for economic recovery rather than re lying upon domestic fiscal and monetary policies the limited recovery in their domestic sectors has been too weak and unsteady to counter the global downturn fo r us policymakers therefore actions to restore health to the american economy also may dete rmine global economic conditions in this sense foreign nd domestic economic in terests coincide us policy options include the usual array of stimulative monetary and fiscal policies the united states may coordinate monetary and fiscal policies with other nations or use its influence to induce foreign economic policymakers to pursue politically unpopular but necessary economic policies or reforms foreign economic policymakers also share us interests in strong domestic economies at times however national politi cal economic or other c onsiderations arise that hamper the ability of country to pursue n eeded economic reforms or policies this has been the case with japan where vested interests have thwarted plans to rid the banks of large accumulation of nonperformin g loans or with european monetary authorities who seem overly reluctant to lower interest rate s at times because of their fear of rekindling inflationa ry pressures while other countries may respond positively to us pressures such activity also can generate resentment among allies for what can be seen as american interference in domestic affairs the effect of terrorism could be significant in raising the costs of international trade because of heightened security m easures while businesses are adjusting easing these bottlenecks while maintaining security is requiring large capital outlays and more paperwork alt hough certain domestic indus tries would applaud what amounts to increased costs for imports am erican exporters also face heightened costs to ship their products to foreign market s as tariffs and other barriers to trade are being reduced or eliminated through multilateral trade negotiations and freetrade agreements the possibility exists that nonta riff barriers imposed to assure security whether warranted or not may take their place the weights given to competing interests of the united states also have shifted because of the antiterror campaign this has altered the calculus for the use of sanctions to achieve nonpro liferation human rights or

attacks on new york and washington raised concerns that foreigners would curtail their purchases of us financial assets thereby weakening the value of the dollar responding to these concerns the federal reserve moved aggressively on its own and in tandem with other central banks to supply liquidity and take other actions in order to avert potential crisis in financial markets these efforts were largely successful by yeare nd us equity markets slowly recovered their preattack values and the exchange rate value of the dollar returned to its pre attack rate after fluctuating within fairly narrow range although data also indicate that capital outflows were higher than normal for the month of september 2001 panic selling of us assets did not occur background the 911 attacks on new york and washington struck at the heart of the us financial center disabling some stock and equity markets for short time these attacks raised concerns about the ability of the markets to absorb the shock

currency in volatile market conditions44 options and implications for us policy the september 11 attacks dealt major challenge to the us economy and to policymakers around the world financial and foreign exchange market activities were slightly out of the norm the first few weeks following the attacks but actions by the federal reserve and by other central banks helped head off financial panic and loss of confidence by ensuring that the financial system was supplied with liquidity through coordinated actions central bank coordination in times of crises is not uncommon but the speed with whic h the coordination was reached and the aggressiveness of the banks to stem any loss of confidence in the financial system are unusual the high level of coordination among central ba nks likely demonstrates the lessons they learned and the techniques they developed by addre ssing other financial crises over the last two decades it likely also demonstrates the recogn ition that national economies have beco highly interconnected and that shock to one creates spillover effects onto other economies and markets the highly developed and broadbased nature of th us financial system proved that it could weather one of the worst blows in decades not even the aggressive actions by the fe deral reserve however could anticipate or forestall all of the potential repercussions the federa l reserve for instance performs number of functions that although not readily appa rent to most market participants are essential to the smooth operating of the system by providing for the timely settlement of market transactions and for sufficient fi nancial resources or liquidity disruptions to this process can create additional and potentially serious problems in other financial markets that are not apparent at first glance the crisis also demonstrates that the financial markets are highly efficient at processing information phenomenon which aids in spreading both g ood and bad news quickly as result the markets absorbed the impact of 911 quickly and likely moved on in short time to assess the economic effect s of other economic events and other economic news this means that the overall course of the us economy rather than 911 likely determined the flows of capital into and out of the united states through the remainder of 2001 the fiscal stimulus provided to the ec onomy by additional federal government spending combined with the measures taken by the federal reserve to lower interest rates are the most important us policy factors affecting the flows of capital into and

credit cards and other payments slowed to almost halt upon the shutdown of air traffic which carries much of the paperwork for these currency substitutes delays in the payments system caused very large balance sheet imbalances at several major banks but quick regulatory action preserved confidence in the banking system the federal reserve declared that it would provide liquidity for banks while the federal deposit insurance corporation reaffirmed that it would insure the safety of their deposits these agencies with the office of the comptroller of the currency nd the office of thrift supervision asked banks to work with customers affected by the terrorism not only in the affected locations but nationwide in light of elect ronic and physical mail disruptions to flows of payments and receipts banks borrowed extensively from the federal reserves lending facility the discount window to carry uncleared payments although prominent banks are in the affected areas nearly all these banks keep assets and liabilities in other locations and have backup record keeping some foreign banks found their us activities suspended but do not appear to have ffered large losses normal

of the financial systems electronic infrastructure with the world trade center attack both these threats emerged simultaneously but the resulting disruptions were less severe and prolonged than most observers would have predicted under such unimaginable conditions the re sponse to the attack demonstrated that the financial sectors ability to recover from catastrophe is robust while government agencies notably the federal reserve used their existing tools effectively to prevent panic in the markets in the fina ncial sphere the priv ate and public responses to 911 do not suggest that either

this fall among major airlines only southwest wa s profitable in 2001 and southwest was the only major carrier still showing pr ofit halfway through 2002 industry losses were at record levels in 2001 and these sses are continuing into 2002 there is therefore considerable concern that the airline industry as we have known it over the last few years is likely to go through period of major structural change in september 2001 congress and the bu sh administration moved swiftly to provide the airline industry with federal financial support the air transportation safety and system stabiliza tion act stabilization actp l 10742 signed into law on september 22 2001 gave the airlines access to up to 15 billion in shortterm assistance the first 5 billion provided direct aid to pay for industry losses associated with the results of the world trade center and pentagon attacks access to the remaining 10 billion in the form of guaranteed loans is subject to stringent requirements promulgated by the office of management and budget thus far of this 10 billion 545 million in loans has been approved and another 900 million has received tentative approval current situation year after the attack significant numbers of airline employees remain laidoff or may yet be subject to layoffs few airlines have started to recall employees and increase flights but only minimally so far as many as 1000 aircraft operated prior to 911 remain parked in the arizona desert and are in storage for at least the near future the actions of the airlines are obviously affecting related indus tries boeing and its subcontr actors have laidoff significant numbers of employees and production of ne w aircraft has been reduced airline service providers such as cater ers and airports as well as th travel industry also are experiencing revenue losses according to the air transport association ata the airlines lost approximately 14 billion in revenue during the fourday shutdown of the national aviation system in the immediate aftermat h of 911 since service resumed they have continued to lose mone as significant numbers of travelers avoid flying opting instead to use other means of tran sportation or to just stay home the airline industry was in financial trouble before the attacks most wall street analysts were projecting an overall financial loss for the industry in the range of 1 2 billion for 2001 industry losses for the full year were instead over 7 billion were it not for the assistance provided by the stabilization act the losses could havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31617crs31 been in the range of 11 billion althoug h the magnitude of losses has eased as we go further into 2002 most majo r airlines remain unprofitable the policy response the federal government does not typically provide any financial assistance as result of an airline accident the events of 911 however were extraordinary the coordina ted actions of terrorists leading to the destruction and loss of life on four aircraft and widesp read destruction and loss of life on the ground had precedent in aviation history these actions were clearly beyond the scope of any polic consideration ever envisi oned by the united states as result new thinking about the expos ure of the airline industry and other industries to terrorism was require d leading to the stabilization act as mentioned earlier the stabilization act provides the airline industry with several different forms of assistance most important among these was immediate access to cash assistance the act provided 5 billion in direct aid to the airlines 500 million of which was reserved for car go airlines the funds were made available on the basis of each airlines share of industry traffic measured by available seat miles prior to september 11 payments from this program could not exceed the direct and incremental losses suffered by an airline since 911 as of july 2002 43 billion of these funds had been di stributed to eligible airlines the act also provides the aforementioned 10 billion in guaranteed loans for the industry this program is designed to provide longer term stability to the industry and make it more credit worthy in private markets the distribution of these loans is controlled by an air transportation stabilization board atsb consisting of the secretaries of transportation and treasury the chairman of the federal reserve and the comptroller general nonvoting ap plication and other operating procedures for this program were in accordance with guidance provided by the office of management and budget the board appear s to have considerab discretion as to how funds from this program will be distri buted all loan applications for this program were require d by june 28 2002 thirteen airlines applied for the loan program at the time of this writing one airline america west has received 380 milli on in loan funds an additional loan of 900 million for us airways has been ntatively approved pending the airlines finalization of business plan compatible with atsb conditions and with the bankruptcy court the loan applications of several airlines including vanguard frontier flying service this is not frontie r airlines which also applied for loan national and spirit have been denied by the atsb vangua rd partially as result of this decision has filed for bankruptcy and ceased operating another important element of the stabilization act was provision extending war risk insurance to the industry for 180 days which has since been extended several times most airlines were about to lose their ex isting private market war risk coverage which would have fo rced them to stop flying by stepping in the federal government essentially provi ded gap insurance with the hopes that the regular private insurance market will become available in the months ahead lessons learned there was consensus afte r 911 that the industry needed immediate help in the short term and that this could best be handled by directhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31617crs32 47 prepared by the banking insurance securities and macroeconomic policy section government and finance divisionassistance even with legislation in place the issue of how this aid is being distributed remains an issue year later this is because of clear desire amongst policymakers to limit aid to level needed to stabilize the industry but not to pay for losses incurred by the industry before ptember 11 which could mean subsidizing some uncompetitive companies further th ere is concern that the industry remain competitive after its financia l stabilization this means that any aid distribution scheme should ensure that sufficient numbe r of airlines survive the current turmoil airline industry financial results in the first and second quarter of 2002 have been dismal with few notable exceptions southwest airtran jet blue the us airways bankruptcy filing in august 2002 and united airlin announcement that it might file for bankruptcy this fall are seen by many industry observers as only precursors of additional future bad news it now appears that the events of september 11 changed the airline industry in some fundamental ways that are not yet fully understood business travel the most profitable part of the industrys customer base seems to be greatly reduced there are numerous explanations for this absent so far however is market based soluti on for the industrys longer term profitability issues we have long since learned that there is fine line between providing assistance to an industry and intervening in its busin ess activities the ai rline industry was once highly regulated there are concerns that too much federal in tervention could be start down the path to new forms of governme nt regulation this w ould be true if the government were to involve itself in i ndustry business practices there is real concern that the loans being provided by the atsb could distort the industry by keeping otherwise incapable competitors in the marketplace for an extended period of time in the process it is quite possible that these airlines actions eg fare sales will have negative implications for airlines that did not receive federal loans the question still to be answered therefore is whether the federal response to 911 will contribute to healthy competitive air line industry or whether it will instead contribute to several dditional years of indus try financial turmoil the insurance industry47 the insurance industry was pr ofoundly affect ed by 911 b ecause of both the cost and the unanticipated nature of the ev ent the industry has long been able to cope with natural disasters long history of such di sasters provides experience for insurance companies in setting rates thus insurance rates and the reserves held by companies have been based on and provisions made for such disasters even natural disasters can prove to be much larger than anticipated and strain the financial resources of insurance companies hurri cane andrew in 1992 for example resulted in some 19 billion in claims threatened th financial solvency of several insurance companies and resulted in major increase in insurance rates in areas affected by hurricanes while this sum was large it is dwarfed by the events of 911 total insured losses for life property and bus iness interruption are not yet known with precision but current estimates are that pay outs will be at least 40 billion and couldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31617crs33 be substantially higher moreover there is historical precedent for these attacks leaving the industry vulnerable in setting insurance premiums and making provisions for reserves that would be needed to pay ff claims in the event of any future attacks terrorism and the industry terrorism on the scale of 911 raises major issue for the insurance industry it is not so much whether insurers have the financial flexibility and capital strength to pay claims arising specifically from 911 but whether there exist sufficient data cost and risk models to underwrite and price insurance against future attacks beyond some scale terrorist attacks take on the characteristics of war an uninsurable risk because of its size scope and unpredictability the current unwillingne ss of the industry to provide unlimited terrorism coverage has led so observers to suggest possible need for some form of federal backstop thus far the indus try has balked at providing the same undifferentiated coverage as was available prior to 911 because of the difficulty of spreading the risk the traditional method of spreading risk in the industry is for primary insurers to be unde rwritten by reinsurance fi rms but after 911 major reinsurers announced that they would l onger cover acts of terrorism in their reinsurance contracts with primary insurers reinsurance is generally written on oneyear basis and approximately 70 of commercial reinsurance policies in effect on 911 expired december 31 2001 without re insurance or facing stiff premiums for reinsurance primary insurers cut back on their coverage the unavailability of terrorism risk insurance could impede nders in financing commercial property acquisitions and new constr uction with potentially adve rse consequences for the economy what began as bleak picture of the industrys financial health brightened as 2002 progressed an increase in reinsura nce rates and an increased demand for insurance in light of 911 have impr oved nearterm earnings for the industry reinsurers have raised approximately 30 billion in new capital since 911 moreover the rise in reinsurance premiums could also cause primary insurance companies to consider alternatives for spreading risk including such innovative capital market alternatives developed following hurricane andrew as catastrophe bonds which allow insurance ri sks to be spread over much deeper market of bond holders this could of cour change dramatically were the us to experience another round of costly terrorist attacks the dire picture also painted for commerc ial properties and i ndustries that could not acquire terrorism insurance has brig htened while some primary coverage insurers have dropped their terrorism coverage and othe rs have increased premiums considerably for commercial clients nd home and auto owners not all of the increases are due to terrorism risks but rather to the normal market cycle that is related in part to alternative investment earnings for the most part banks have not stopped financing projects for clients who lack terrorism insurance but have increased fees in areas or fo r projects where the risk of terrorism is thought to have increased other lenders appear not to have tightened credit for the vast majority of projects nevertheless there are areas nd certain high profile projects eg trophy properties theme parks key infrastructure sports stadiums etc for which terrorism insurance apparently cannot be acquired at any price as with the financial health of the industry should the united states expe rience additional costly terrorist attacks it might be impossible to acquire insurance against terrorismhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31617crs34 faced with reinsurance renewals in january 2002 that excluded terrorism and with federal backstop for future losses primary insurers petitioned their respective state regulators to exclude terrorism coverage from the policies they sold such exclusion would allow the insurers to separately price and sell or decline to sell insurance riders specifically for major terro rism attacks the most common approach taken by the regulators excludes terrorism as covered event only if total losses from an event exceeded 25 million if at least 50 pe rsons were killed or seriously injured or if the event involved nuclear biological or chemical materials in addition multiple but related incidents occurring w ithin 72hour period are considered to be single event for purposes of the exclusi on most states the major exceptions being new york and california approved this exclusion in making the decision to exclude terrorism from regular coverage state regulators had to balance the interests of businesses in need of insurance simply to operate and primary insurers whose solvency position could be jeopardized if forced to cover losses from future terrorist acts financial position of the industry the insured losses of 911 raise two key issues for the industry solvency and liquidity there is general consensus that the industry as whole can absorb the u ltimate costs of 911 ie that it will not reduce the industry as whole to insolven cy and that is will not create liquidity problems for the vast majority of insurers solvency the us insurance system at this time is strongly capitalized and can fulfill its obligations without threat to the stability of the overall system this also appears to be true of individual firms in the us industry at this time in 2000 the property and casualty industry had 3187 billion in surplus most insurance analysts would agree that insured losses from catastrophe would have to exceed 50 billion before they would challenge substantial number of insurer claimspaying ability nonetheless terrorist attacks in the future on this scale could severely compromise the solvency of the industry even despite rising capital in 2002 liquidity insurers had 921 billion in tota l assets in 2000 of this amount some 484 billion 5 was held in cash and shortterm investme nts that companies could quickly liquidate to pay claims while 769 billion consisted of longterm bonds 63 and stocks 19 despite declining stock market the heavy weighting toward bonds which have b een increasing in value provides some assurance that any need to sell longer term assets to gain further liquidity would be possible without realiz ing financial losses remaining issues historically insurers have always excluded certain kinds of risk from insurance coverage either because not enough is known about the risk to quantify it and price it or because the ri sk involves such scale that insurer could presume to charge enough to afford payout war is considered to be the classic case of these problems occurring together terrorism beyond some point in size or repetition would likewise be considered an uninsurable risk thus there have been calls for the government to assist the industr first to cover risk that the private sector cannot and second to assist the economy including the insurance industry question related to the possibility of federal intervention to provide terrorism backstop or outright disaster assistance rema ins at what point is terrorism longer an insurable

immediate improvements in food protecti on as well as safety seve ral policymakers maintained that poor communication not organizational structure was the biggest obstacle to better coordination they

actually increase particularly in the period immediately following the attack the unexp ected loss of revenue coupled with the increased financial burden of responding to terrorist act or natural disaster often leads local governments to request assist ance from both the state government and the federal government based on estimates detailed below new york city experienced drop in gross city

attacks is 828948 billion of that total loss 273 b illion is for the last 3 months of 2001 and all of 2002 in all likelihood the longr economic impact of the terrorist attack on new york will be determined by the size and distribution of the government subsidies intended to encourage development in the new york metropolitan area the provisions offered by the federal gove rnment can be divided into two broad categories 1 financial aid to reimburse local expenditures on emergency response and 2 economic redevelopment assistance fo r rebuilding the first would alleviate the shortrun strain on the local government budget generated by the attacks and the second is more focused on minimizing the longrun local economic effects tax revenue loss according to the estimates of variety of budget analysts tax revenue in new york city dropped considerably after 911 however the exact amount of the revenue loss is still uncertain soon after the attacks in an october 4 2001 press release the new york city comptroller william c thompson jr estimated that tax revenue s in fy2002 would be 738 million less than currently projected as result of the attacks65 since that announcement there has been

estimates of the tax revenue loss from the respective budget offices are significantly larger than earlier estimates on september 4 2002 the new york city comptroller released revised estimate of the tax revenue ss in fy2002 that could be attributed to 1 the terrorist attacks and 2 the economic slowdown70 the comptroller estimates that in fy2002 new york city lost 2015 billion of tax revenue because of the attacks and 519 million because of the economic slowdown for fy2003 the comptroller estimated that the revenue loss resulting from 911 w ould be 928 million in both fiscal years the loss in personal income tax revenue represents the largest contributor to the tax revenue loss the estimates for fy2002 seem to rely on the assumption that the city was rising out of recession in the firs t quarter of fy2002 which began july 1 2001 before 911 thus by that assumption most of the decline in tax revenue after 911 could be attributed to the terro rist attacks not the recession actions undertaken the following section provi des brief overview of the federal response to 911 the focus is on the new york city government because the two other local governments affected by the events of

generally federa l expenditures have been dedicated to reimburse the new york city government for response and cleanup expenditures and to revitalize lower manhattan in some cases the economic

as shifting investment and growth from one area to another without an overall improvement in the broader national economy while fe deral expenditures and lost federal tax revenue do not create new

commitment to the transit hub is unusual as noted in the agencys press release announcing the commitment typically femas public assistance program reimburses disasterrelated losses and damages on individual projects recognizing the interdependence of lower manhattans bus subway rail ferry and walkways fema broadly interpreted its guidelines to allow maximum flexibility to support lower

attacks and 2 to reinvigorate the new york city econom with economic development incentives in the first case the federal government assists the local government directly in the second the local government is helped indi rectly through federa l funds that may have otherwise been the responsibility of the st ate and local governments also any additional economic velopment spurred by federal expenditures may generate tax revenues in the future for new york city there has not been direct federal transfer dedicated to reimbursing new rk city for lost tax revenue looking to the future in the

separated from payrolls as result of largescale layoffs that actually occurred also climbed markedly in the months leading up to september77 however the industries that most often laid off workers due to the recession eg comput er and other manufacturers as well as telecommunications and other internetrela ted enterprises were not those most adversely affected by the rrorist attacks similarly the impact of the recession and terrorist attack were concentrated in different geographic areas employers reported that between september 15 2001 and march 30 2002 they called 462 extended mass layoffs78 that were directly or indirectly attributable to the attacks79 almost 130000 employees lost their jobs in these actions with 9 out of 10 let go within 2 months of the attacks80 the air transportation industry laid off 38 of these employees and the accommodati ons hotel and motel industry 23 although employers in 33 states called terroristrelated layoffs the majority of events and worker

ovide financial cushion for jobless workers historically while the uc program has been s upplemented from time to time by other programs that provide payments to those out of work the precipitating event for congressional action related to worker displacement typically has been broadbased recession this on ce again proved to be the case immediately after 911 congress intr oduced legislation that would have provided additional assistance only to those workers displaced from jobs in certain industries as result of the terrorist ttacks and subsequent security measures81 however the recession focused congressiona l attention on legislation that would temporarily extend benefits for all individuals who exhausted their 26week limit of regular uc benefits the temporar extended unemployment

the c ongress might turn once again to the uc and dua systems such factors as how wi despread the problem is across industries or geographic areas how many employ ees are affected and how long the

policymakers in th united states were confronted with the issue of financing unanticipated expenditures for recovery and terrorism response activities86 because of apparent similar ities with past extraordinary expenditure needs such as the military buildup for world war ii several proposals emerged for similar financing mechanis m war bonds as with war bonds issued in the 1940s new version of war bonds w ould be one of many debt instruments available to the us treasury that coul d be used to finance deficit spending actions undertaken in response to the terrori st attack several lawmakers introduced legislation that would have au thorized the treasury to offer an updated version of war bonds before any of the proposals could become law the treasury recognized bipartisan cong ressional interest in creatin g new version of war bonds and responded by introducing patriot bonds based on the existing series ee savings bond program on december 11 2001 the united states treasury began offering patriot bonds httpwwwpublic debttreasgovsav savpatriotbondhtm these bonds are series ee sa vings bonds with patriot bond and profile of thomas jefferson featured on the saving certificate brief history of savings bonds on march 1 1935 the first savings bonds series were issued to pr ovide savings instrument fo r small savers and to lower interest costs to the treasury by expa nding the potential market for treasury securities it was scheduled to expire in april 1941 but president roosevelt and congress agreed that month to extend the program and rename th current series bonds defense savings bonds after th attack on pearl harbor in december 1941 defense savings bonds were renamed war b onds the treasury sold 54 billion in war savings bonds from may 1941 through december 1945 period when defense expenditures totaled 261 billion series ee bonds were introduced in janua ry 1980 while there have been some changes over time in their interest rate form ula the current bonds pay interest at the time of redemption at rate based on 90 of the average yields on treasury securities maturing in 5 years over the preceding 6month period taxes owed may be deferred until redemption or paid as interest accrues proceeds from the sale of war bonds series ee bonds or patriot bonds have always been included in general revenues and not earmarked explicitly for designated category of expenditures policy analysis some proponents of patriot bonds claimed that the new bonds would allow citizens to invest in recovery and terrori sm response activities and perhaps allow the treasury to issue debt at lower interest rates than would otherwise be possible proponents suggested that the goal of the new bonds would be to develop way for patriotic am ericans to contribute directly to the efforthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31617crs52 87 sen mitch mcconnell remarks in the senate congressional record daily edition vol 147 september 19 2001 p s9485to rebuild the broken and to retaliate against international terrorism87 those who thought patriot bonds were unnecessary argue th at new savings bonds would not likely produce any interest savings would not be earmarked for defense spending and would not add anything th at is not already available the debt and net fiscal position of the fe deral government w ould be roughly the same whether the debt for additional fense spending were patriot bonds or treasury bonds however mainstream macr oeconomics suggests that debt finance would stimulate aggregate demand in the short run and reduce economic growth in the long run by crowdingout private inves tment through higher interest rates or larger international trade deficit the mainstream analysis assumes private saving would remain unchanged an alterna tive option would be to finance these unanticipated expenditures with higher taxe s this option would have negligible effect on the economy because greater g overnment spendingand thus aggregate demandwould likely largely offset the contrac tionary effects that higher taxes would have on private spending looking to the future the policy question is in the future should the federal government intr oduce new saving instruments to finance unexpected increases in defense expenditures if the patriot bond designation induced more us savings bond purchases then some may consider the program success if the additional patriot sa vings bond purchases came from existing planned saving and substituted for other treasury securities the cost of issuing federal debt may have actually decreased slightly after the intr oduction of patriot bonds in addition if patriot bond purchases were financed w ith lower private consumption then the bonds reduced the cost of issuing federa l debt further because the savings rate increased higher savings rate all else equal exerts downward pressure on interest rates as of this writing it is difficult to ev aluate the impact of the patriot bond on savings rates although the treasury does track the mont hly sales of savings bonds in the 3 months after the terrorist act s in september 2001 series ee savings bonds sales fluctuated dramatically in october of 2001 before the patriot bond designation was introduced sales of series ee bonds spiked to 973 million almost three times the october 2000 sales level of 334 million in november 2001 sales dropped to 194 million only to rise to 489 million in december 2001 the month patriot bonds were first available for the first 6 months of 2002 monthly patriot bond sales averaged 444 million total sale s for january through june in 2002 were higher than the same period in 2000 and 2001 though less than sales in 1999 the terrorist acts and other macroeconomic factors likely caused the fluctuations as many inve stors were initially uncertain about how the united states economy would respond to the attacks ho wever the introducti on of the patriot bond designation though perhaps providing sense of participation in the war effort for those who purchased them did not seem to have significant effect on the net fiscal position of the us in add ition the relatively small volume of savingshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31617crs53 bond debt relative to total treasury debt as of marc h 2002 savings bonds comprised about 32 of total debt outstanding weak ens any effect the patriot bond program could have had on fe deral interest costs and borrowing conclusions it is by means possible to put together an exhaustive list of conclusions from the discussion above those that follow are at best selective and tentative in nature as the full implications of 9 11 have yet to be drawn among the major conclusions is that 911 is more appropriately viewed as human tragedy than as an economic calamity notwithstanding their dire costs in human life the direct effects of the ttacks were too small and too geographically concentrated to make significant dent in the nations economic output september 11 did not trip fragile economy into r ecession the economy was already in its third consecutive quarter of contraction ev though the data showing this were not available until later time moreover the contraction in the us was coincident with the slowdown in economic growth of the major economies the first time this had occurred in 25 years thus many of the factors associated with the world slowdown such as rising unemployment and falling confidence may have been wrongly attributed to 911 in the final an alysis it may be diffi cult to separate the effects of the terrorist attacks from the then ongoing recession individuals may continue to assert that va rious economic events were caused by 911 when in fact they were not there is of course the possibility that but for the timely and decisive action by the federal reserve in concert with other major central banks the effects of 911 on both the us and world economies would have b een quite different in this context it should not be overlooked that markets have powerful mechanisms and incentives to overcome negative shocks this was typi fied by the action of individuals in the financial sector to restore their institutions to normal state of function as quickly as possible for many observers this has re validated the wisdom of having central bank capable of exercising large amount of discretion although the attacks were unique in american history several existing government programs and agencies were successfully modified in short time to cope with the economic ramifications ccessfully modified programs or agencies include fema unemployment programs m onetary policy and programs to help small businesses although not to the total satisfaction of the latter in the case of the financial industry pr eparations for y2k left the indus try well prepared to cope with the loss of data and infrastructure in wholly unintended ways undoubtedly much was learned by the affected agencies that will be useful if similar tragedies were to occur in the future fiscal policy also responded but far more slowly than monetary policy initiatives in the case of the airlines new legislation was quickly implemented to cope with their special problem fiscal response to the threat posed to the insurance industry by terrorism remains in debate there also remains largely state issue that has federal consequences in the face of terrorism many states operate under balanced budget require ments expenditures to remediate thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31617crs54 adverse effects of terrorism as well as the destruction of part of states tax base can throw state budgets into deficit and inflict additional hardships on states taxpayers as legislatures comply with constitutional requirement s to balance budgets as result of 911 the budget of the stat of new york was pushed into deficit forcing some difficult choices on the legi slature and arguably constraining the ability of the state to address the special needs of new york city this experience may well lead to future congressional consideration of the appropriate federal role in assisting states regions and cities adversely affected by terrorism in an important sense 911 does mark the end of an era for it reveals that the united states is vulnerable to attacks on its home soil one of the major modes of transportation became vehicle for attacking symbols of america the attackers were able to board these planes with w eapons that were not then deemed to be contraband but the net effect has been vastating for the passenger airline industry even with the government aid that has been forthcoming it is now doubtful that the industry will survive in its present state in addition to the airline industry 911 had led to the recognition that the nations food supply may be vulnerable to biol ogical attack our c ities to bio terrorism and that american ports could serve as entry points for weapons of mass destruction this vulnerability has had veral effects first it has led to reallocation of nationa l resources toward the production of greater security this will temporarily affect the grow th of productivity adversely the major factor providing the growth of per capita income sec ond it has and will likely continue to change the business structure of the united states nd to some degree the structure of other economies as well over the longer run ho w americans spend their leisure time has been changed by 911 this may be temporary or longer lasting this change affects their spending and with it the structure of the industry supplying goods and services for leisure third the vulnerability of the us to rrorism raises new questions about risk and the role of government in protecting against risk in capitalist economy the risk posed by terrorism is unlike the risk faced by typical business firm or household unlike natural disaster the l ack of historical ex amples makes future risks largely unpredictable therefore businesses cannot fully plan ahead to safeguard against its effects unlike natu ral disaster it is ri sk addressed by the security that government provides for its citizens when this security fails or is breached it can have devastating conse quences for selected business firms geographical areas and elements in the popul ation 911 had vere effect on new york city the airlines industry and esp ecially the insurance industry while the latter appears to be able to withstand the claims due to 911 it is doubtful if it could withstand several attacks w ith the consequences of 9 11 traditionally there has been an understanding that certain risks ch as war could not be handled by market mechanisms and required government invol vement the government is now trying to determine the point when terrorism stops being an insurable risk and begins to look more like war at present the situa tion is ambiguous private insurers are still willing to insure most firms and project s against terrorism but some trophy projects that make likely targets have not been able to acquire insurance that is apparently because insurers do not know how to price such risks and insureds may prefer to self insure rather than pay very high premiums this effect would behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31617crs55 stronger if firms should th ink that the federal government is implicitly willing to compensate them in the event of catas trophe in this context the terrorism insurance bills before congress would seek to make explicit what is now implicit by defining the point past which the government would provide insurance because the private market longer can in the absen ce of such legislation large or ostentatious projects may continue to have difficulty getting coverage and as result fewer such projects may be built in the future convers ely legislation could increase the moral hazard problem present in the terrorism insurance market if the federal government steps in to protect against calamitous losses more trophy projects that make attractive targets will be built for safety reasons it can be argued government may have to assume role in pricing such that the cost to the private owners of building these types of properties reflect s the costs to society
