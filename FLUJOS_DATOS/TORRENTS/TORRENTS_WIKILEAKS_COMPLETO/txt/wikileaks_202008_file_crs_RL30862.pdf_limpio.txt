which congress implements budget resoluti on policies affecting mainly permanent spending and revenue programs the principal focus in the reconciliation process has been deficit reduction but in some

senates byrd rule introduction reconciliation is proce ss established under secti on 310 of the congressional budget act of 1974 pl 93344 as amended1 the purpose of reconciliation is to change substantive law so that revenue and mandatory spending levels are brought into line with budget resolution policies reconciliation generally has been used to reduce the deficit through spe nding reductions or revenue increases or combination of the two in recent years however the reconciliation process so has encompassed revenue reduction gene rally and spending increases in selected program areas reconciliation is twostep process under the first step reconciliation instructions are included in the budget resolution directing one or more committees in each house to develop legislation that changes spending or revenues or both by the amounts specified in the budget resolu tion if more than one committee in each house is given instructions each in structed committee submits reconciliation legislation to its respective budget committee which incorporates all submissions without any substantive revision into single omnibus budget reconciliation measure reconciliation procedures during session usually have applied to multiple committees and involved omnibus legislation under the second step th omnibus b udget r econc iliation measure is considered in the house and senate under expedited procedures for ex ample debate time in the senate on reconcilia tion measure is limited to 20 hours and amendments must be germane the process culminates with enactment of the measure thus putting the policies of the budget resolution into effect reconciliation which was first used by the house and senate in 1980 is an optional procedure but it has been used in most years over the period covering from 1980 to the present 19 reconciliation bills have been enacted into law and three have been vetoed during the first several years experi ence with reconciliation the legislation contained many provisions that were ex traneous to the purpose of reducing the deficit the rec onciliation sub missions of committees included such things as provisions that had budgetary

consideration of and vote on the amendment occurred on pp s14032s14038 of the congressional record daily ed of october 24 1985in 1985 and 1986 the senate adopted the by rd rule named after its principal sponsor senator robert c byrd as mean s of curbing these practices initially the rule consisted of two components involvi ng provision in reconciliation act and senate resolution the byrd rule has been modified several times over the years the purpose of this report is to briefly r ecount the legislative history of the byrd rule summarize its current features and describe its implementation from its inception through the present legislative history of the byrd rule during the first five years that the by rd rule was in effect from late 1985 until late 1990 it consisted of tw separate components 1 provision in statute applying to initial senate consideration of reconciliation measures and 2 senate resolution extending applica tion of portions of the stat utory provision to conference reports and amendments between the two h ouses several modi fications were made to the byrd rule in 1986 and 1987 including extending its expiration date from january 2 1987 to january 2 1988 and then to september 30 1992 but the two separate components of the rule were preserved in 1990 these components were merged together and made permanent when they were incorporated into the congressional budget act cba of 1974 as section 313 there have been further changes in the byrd rule since 1990 the byrd rule originated on october 24 1985 when senator robert c byrd on behalf of himself and others offere d amendment 878 as modified to s 1730 the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act cobra of 19852 the senate adopted the amendment by vote of 9603 in this form the byrd rule applied to initial senate consideration of reconciliation measures senator byrd explained that the basic purposes of the amendment were to protect the effectiveness of the reconciliation process by excluding extraneous matter that often provoke d controversy without aiding deficit reduction efforts and to preserve the deliberative character of the senate by excluding from consideration under expedited procedures gislative matters not central to deficit reduction that should be debated under regula r procedures he opene d his remarks by stating we are in the process now of eing the pandoras box which has been opened to the abuse of the reconciliation process that process was never meant to be used as it is being used there are 122 items in the reconciliation bill that are extraneous henceforth if the majority on committee should wish to include in reconciliation recommendations to the budget committee any measure matter how controversial it can be brought to the senate

plus time on amendments and motions to more than 20 hours it was never foreseen that the budget re form act would be used in that way so if the budget reform process is going to be preserved and more importantly if we are going to preserve the deliberative process in this us senate which is the outstanding unique element with respect to the us senate action must be taken now to stop this abuse of the budget process4 the byrd amendment was included in m odified form in cobra of 1985 pl 99272 which was not enacted into w until april 7 1986 as section 20001 100 stat 390391 the byrd rule in this

enacting the budget enforcement act bea of 1990 title xiii of the omnibus budget reconciliation ac t of 1990 section 13214 of the law made significant revisions to the byrd rule and incorporated it as

thus far have originated pursuant to section 310 of the cba of 1974 7 in the senate many points of order under th cba of 1974 require threefifths vote of the membership to waive or to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the chair most of these threefifths waiver requirements are temporary but in the case of the byrd rule it is permanent section 503 of the fy 2004 budget resolution hconres 95 108th cong adopted on april 11 2003 extended the expirati on date for the temporary requirements to september 30 2008 8 for an example of such list see the rema rks of senator pete domenici regarding

senate but had not yet been enrolled and sent to the president the practice of the house and senate has been to consider only reconciliation bills in general point of order authorized unde r the byrd rule may be raised in order to strike extraneous matter already in the bill as reported or discharged or in the conference report or to prevent the incor poration of extraneous matter through the adoption of amendments or motions point of order may be raised against single provision or two or more provisions as designated by title or section number or by page and line number and may be raised ag ainst single amendment or two or more amendments the chair may sustain point of order as to all of the provisions or amendments or only some of them once material has been stricken from reconciliation legisl ation under the byrd rule it may not be offered again as an amendment motion to waive the byrd rule or to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the chair on point of order raised

congressional budget act 2 involve mu ltiple as well as single provisions or amendments 3 extend for specified nguage through consideration of the conference report as well as initial consideration of the measure or amendment and 4 be made prior to the raising of point of order thus making the point of order moot when reconciliation measure or conf erence report thereon is considered the senate budget committee must submit for the record list of potentially extraneous matter included therein8 this list is advisory however and does not bind the chair in ruling on points of order determinations of budgetary levels for purposes of enforcing the byrd rule are made by the senate budget committee definitions of ex traneous matter subsection b1 of the byrd rule provides definitions of what constitutes extraneous matter for purposes of the rulehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30862crs6 9 see the report of the senate budget committee to accompany sconres 18 concurrent resolution on the budget fy1994 srept 10319 march 12 1993 p 49 10 the budget window refers to the period covered by the budget resolution and to any reconciliation directives included therein and the resultant reconc iliation legislation beginning in the late 1980s the budget resolution is required to cover at minimum the budget year the fiscal year beginni ng on october 1 in the session that the budget resolution is adopted and the four following fiscal years the outyears in add ition budget resolutions sometimes cover the current year the fiscal year preceding the budget year and up to five additional outyears ccordingly the longest budget window that has applied to budget resolution and associated reconciliation legislation covered 11 years including the current yearthe senate budget committee in its report on the budget resolution for fy1994 noted extraneous is term of art broadly speaking the rule prohibits inclusion in reconciliation of matter unrelated to the deficit reduction goals of the reconciliation process9 provision is considered to be extraneous if it falls under one or more of the following six definitions it does not produce change in outlays or revenues it produces an outlay increase or revenue decrease when the instructed committee is not in compliance with its instructions it is outside of the jurisdiction of the committee that submitted the title or provision for inclusion in the reconciliation measure it produces change in outlays or revenues wh ich is merely incidental to the nonbudgetar components of the provision it would increase the deficit for fiscal year beyond the budget window covered by the reconciliation measure10 and it recommends changes in social security the last definition complements ban in section 310g of the cba of 1974 against considering any reconciliation legislation that contains recommendations pertaining to the social security for purposes of these provi sions social security is considered to include the oldage survivors and disability insurance oasdi program established under title ii of the social security act it does not include medicare or other programs blished as part of that act exceptions to the definition of extraneous matter subsection b2 of the byrd rule provides that senate originated provision that does not produce change in outlays or revenues shall not be considered extraneous if the chairman and ranking minority members of the budget committee and the committee reporting the provision certify that httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30862crs7 11 the senate also considered two measures linked to the reconciliation process on december 15 1975 the senate considered amended and passed hr 5559 the revenue adjustment act of 1975 which reduced revenues by about 64 billion pursuant to budget resolution instruction the measure was not regarded as reconciliation bill when it was considered by the house but it was considered under reconciliation procedures in the senate the president vetoed the measure later in the year and the house sustained his veto see the remarks of senator russell long and the presiding officer on p 40540 and the remarks of senator edmund muskie and others on pp 4054440550 in the congressional record of december 15 1975 regarding the status of hr 5559 as reconciliation bill the deficit reduction act of 1984 pl 98369 was regarded as reconciliation bill when it was considered in the house but wa s stripped of that cla ssification when it was considered in the senate in april and ma of 1984 the house also has considered reconciliation measures that

this reporton the whole the points of order and wa iver motions were disposed of in manner that favored by large margin t hose who opposed the inclusion of extraneous matter in reconcilia tion legislation as discu ssed in more detail below13 five of the six definitions of extraneousness the exception being recommending changes in social security have been cited as bases for points of order under the byrd rule the most comm on basis that the provision or amendment did not change outlays or re venues was cited as the sole basis in 32 instances and as one of two bases in three other instances none of the other base s were cited in more than six instances in some instances the basis for the point of order was not cited the byrd rule has been used primarily during initial consideration of reconciliation measure it was invoked only five time s twice in 1993 once in 1995 once in 1997 and once in 2005 during c onsideration of conference report in 1993 two points of order against matte r characterized as extraneous in conference report were rejected by the chair in both instances the chairs ruling was upheld upon appeal the two motions to app eal the chairs rulings were defeated by identical votes 4357 in 1995 two sections were struck from conference report and the two chambers had to resolve the fi nal differences with further amendment between them in 1997 section in the c onference report was retained following successful vote 7822 to waive point of order finally in 2005 three provisions were struck from conference report anot her provision was reta ined necessitating action on further amendment between the two chambers as shown in table 2 points of order and waiver motions under the byrd rule have occurred more frequently in the 1990s 81 compared to the 1980s 5 or the 2000s 9 so far the middle years of the decade of the 1990s covering calendar years 1993 through 1997 was especially activ in this regard accounting for 65 of the total 81 points of order and waiver motions during that decade points of order in total 53 points of orde r were raised and disposed of under the byrd rule points of order generally were raised successfully 43 were sustained in whole or in part enabling nators to strike extraneous matter from the legislation in 19 cases and to bar the cons ideration of extraneous amendments in 24 cases ten of the points

omnibus b udget reconciliation act of 1985 which began on december 19 1985 as previously ntioned this was the first instance in which the byrd rule applied in 1989 actions involving the byrd rule occurred in large part because the senate leadership chose to use an amendmen t rather than the byrd rule to deal with extraneous matter in the bill on oc tober 13 1989 during consideration of the omnibus budget reconciliation of 1989 th senate adopted mitchell amendment 1004 by voice vote the amendment struck extraneous matter from the bill its stated purpose was to strike all matter from the

consideration of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993and tax relief rec onciliation act of 2001 and the j obs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of 2003 the potential pplication of the byrd rule to the measures was averted by the inclusion of sunset provisions that limited the duration of the tax cuts thereby preventin g deficit increases beyond the applicable budget windows finally the senate considered tw reconciliation bills in 2005 during consideration of the conference report on the spending reconciliation bill the deficit reduction act of 2005 in late 2005 point of order under the byrd rule was raised successfully the revenue reconciliation bill the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act of 2005 was initially considered in late 2005 but action on the conference report carried over into 2006 th potential application of the byrd rule in 2006 to the conference report was avoide d because the tax cuts extending beyond the budget window were offset so that deficit increases occurred in that period15 byrd rule controversies although the byrd rule has advocates in the house and senate its use sometimes has engendered much controversy especially between the two houses impact on housesenate relations in 1993 and 1994 in 1993 and 1994 during the 103rd congress the stringent application of the byrd rule by the senate significantly influenced the final shape of the reconciliation act and later affected the deliberations of the joint committee on the organization of congress the house considered its version of the omnibus budget reconciliation

well over week in going over this bill to try to clarify and remove items that might be subject to the byrd rule as the distinguished ranking member indicated i think over 150 items were removed from the reconciliation instrume nt here because it was felt that they would be subject to the byrd rule i might say some of our house colleagues could not understand and i do not blame them because there were number of things that were pulled out of this budget reconciliation that had been voted on and passed by large majorities in both houses but simply because they violated the byrd rule we had to go to the chairmen of the appropriate house committees and tell them they had to come out they simply did not understand it i think it made them perhaps have little less high esteem for some of us here in the senatein the final analysis their leadership had to demand that some of th provisions subject to the byrd rule come out18 during house consideration of the conference report several democratic members criticized the byrd rule and disc ussed its impact on th legisla tion for example representative dan rostenkowsk i chairman of the house ways and means committee stated i also have to express my grave concerns regarding the other bodys socalled byrd rule as result of this procedural rule policies that would have significantly improved the medicare pr ogram could not even be considered over 80 pages of statutory language were stripped out of the medicare title staff wasted countless hours scrutinizin g every line to ensure that there is nothing that would ups et our friends at the other end of the capitol even more absurd is the fact that most of th items stripped were minor and technical provisions that received bipartisan s upport when they passed both the house and the senate last year i hope that members on both sides of th aisle share my grave concerns about how this rule has been used and its impact on reconciliation i sincerely

joint committee on the organization of congress cochaired by representative lee hamilton and senator david boren was slated to make recommendations on congressional reform including changes in the budget process in december of 1993 representative martin olav sabo chairman of the house budget committee wrote to cochair hamilton in october telling him that widespread use of the byrd rule this year was extremely destructive and bodes ill for the reconcilia tion process in the future further he stated that the use of mechanisms like the byrd rule greatly distorts the balance of power between the two bodies and that st rict enforcement of the byrd rule requires that too much pow er be delegated to unelected employees of the congress20 chairman sabo attached two budget committee staff

econciliation instructions directing the house ways and means and senate finance committees to develop legislation implementing substantial reductions in revenue24 the reconciliation instructions in the two budget resolutions called for tota l revenue reduction ove r five years of 142 billion and 150 billion respectively25 neither budget resolution included any instructions regarding spending this marked the first time that the house and senate had recommended substantial reductions in revenue through the reconciliation process without offsetting savings to be achieved in spending programs any resultant reconciliati on legislation was expected unde r these budget resolutions to reduce large surpluses not to incur or worsen deficits in each of these two years there was controversy in the senate regarding the appropriateness of using reconciliation procedures under circumstances that worsened the federal government s fiscal posture some senators argued that the use of reconciliation with its procedural restrictions that sharply curtail debate time and limit the offering of amendments in comparison to the usual senate procedures could be justified only when it was necessary to reduce or eliminate deficit or to preserve or increase surplus other senators maintained that reconciliation is neutral in its orientation the language in section 310 of the cba of 1974 refers to changes in spending and revenue amounts not incr eases or decreases and is intended to expedite the consideration of impor tant and potentially complex budgetary legislationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30862crs18 26 proceedings under this aspect of the byrd rule in the case of the taxpayer refund and relief act of 1999 occurred on july 28 1999 see the remarks of

10871 april 10 2003against the backdrop of the larger issue of the appropriate use of reconciliation under these circumstances senato rs also debated in partic ular the impact of the byrd rule on the scope of the resultant taxcut legislation one of the determinants of extraneousness under the byrd rule is wh ether the legislation reduces revenues or increases spending in the net beyond the budget window ie the period to which the reconciliation instructions apply changes in tax law however often are made on permanent basis as consequence reconciliation legislation recommending permanent tax cuts may run afoul of the byrd rule during consideration of the taxpayer refund and relief act of 1999 and the marriage tax relief reconcilia tion act of 2000 the byrd rule was used successfully to ensure the inclusion of sunset provisions in the bills limiting the effectiveness of the tax cuts to the period covered by the reconciliation instructions26 during the first session of the 107th congress the senate again addressed these issues as it considered hr 1836 largel embodying president bushs proposal for 16 trillion tax cut27 in addition to debating th appropriateness of using the reconciliation process to exped ite taxcut legisla tion senators argued for and against the inclusion of the 10year sunset provision necessary to achieve compliance with the byrd rule some senators maintained that permanent changes in tax law should be allowed under reconc iliation procedures just as th ey often are customarily made in freestanding tax legislati on other senators praised the value of being able to reexamine such significant modifications in budgetary policy in future years when economic circumstances may have changed materially the sunset provision was retained in th final version of the legislation as section 901 115 stat 150 of pl 107 16 the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 in 2003 during the first session of the 108th congress the byrd rule influenced the form of revenue rec onciliation directives in the fy2004 budget resolution hconres 9528 initially house and senate leaders indicated that they would settle on conference agreement instructing the house ways and means committee to reduce revenues through reconciliation by 550 billion or more for the period covering fy2003fy2013 and th senate finance committ ee to reduce revenues by 350 billion for the same period major ity of senators had indicated their opposition to revenue reductions greater than 350 billionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30862crs19 29 the reconciliation directives are set fort h in section 201 of hconres 95 the senate point of order is set forth in section 202 portion of the reconciled amounts is set forth as outlay increases in order to accommodate changes in tax programs eg refundable tax credits that are scored as outlays conse quently the aggregate instruction of 550 billion is actually 535 billion in revenue reductions and 15 billion in outlay increases in the house and 522524 billion in revenue reductions and 27476 billion in outlay increases in the senate 30 for further discussion of this matter see crs report rl31902 revenue

budget resolution would enable the leadership to secure passage of th budget resolution while leaving open the possibility that subsequent conference on the differing versions of the revenue reconciliation measure passed by the tw houses might reach an acceptable compromise between these two amounts however it soon became apparent that if the senate initia lly passed revenue reconciliation measure consistent with the directive in the budget resolution ie reducing revenues by 350 billion the later consideration of conference agreement reflecting compromise leve l of revenue reductions gr eater than 350 billion could violate the byrd rule in particular s ection 313b1b defines as extraneous any provision reported by committee that reduces revenues or increases outlays if the net effect of all of the committees provisions is that it fails to achieve its reconciliation instructions proposing revenue reductions greater than the level of reductions set in the reconciliation instructions would be considered failure to achieve the instructions in order to resolve the problem the conference agreement on the fy2004 budget resolution instructed both the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee to reduce revenues by 550 billion over fy2003fy2013 but point of order barred the initial consideration in the senate of reconciliation measure as distinct from conference re port containing re venue reductions in excess of 350 billion for this period29 the fy2004 budget resolution further provided that the senate point of order could be waived only by the affirmative vote of threefifths of the members duly chosen and sworn ie 60 senators if seats are vacant this procedural formulati on strengthened the position of those who favored initial senate passage of reconciliation measure limited to 350 billion in revenue reductions but remove d the potential byrd rule hurdle should majority of senators later choose to s upport

some instances points of order or waiver motions are made under the act by general reference only such as senator raising poin t of order under title iii of the act rather than by specific reference to the provisions involved when only general references are made it usually is impossible to determi ne by reference to debate in the congressional record alone which provision of the act is involved consequently this table reflects only those instances when specific reference was made to section 313 of the act or to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30862 crs39 byrd rule the object of point of order under the byrd rule may be to strike one or more provisions as designated by title or section number or by page and line number in reconciliation measure or conference report thereon or to bar consideration of one or more amendments thereto b provision is regarded as extraneous under the byrd rule if it 1 does not produce change in outlays or revenues 2 produces an outlay increase or revenue decrease when the inst ructed committee is not in compliance with its instructions 3 is outside of the jurisdiction of the committee that submitted the title or provision for inclusion in the reconciliation asure 4 produces change in outlays or revenues which is merely incidental to the nonbudgetary components of the provision 5 would increase the deficit for fiscal year beyond those covered by the reconciliation measure or 6 recommends changes in social security the byrd rule sets forth specific exceptions to the criteria to determine extraneousness c under the byrd rule

to the consolidated omnibus budge t reconciliation act cobra of 1985 which the senate adopted in this form the byrd rule applied to initial senate consideration of r econciliation measures on decemb er 19 1985 the senate adopted sres 286 which extended the application of portions of the provision in cobra of 1985 to conference reports and amendments between the two hou ses because the enactment of cobra of 1985 was delayed until early 1986 the portion of the byrd rule dealing with conference reports became effective first sen ate consideration of the conference report on cobra of 1985 and
