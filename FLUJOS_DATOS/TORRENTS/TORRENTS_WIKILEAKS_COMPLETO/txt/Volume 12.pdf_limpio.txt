sussex remimeo hco bulletin of 8 june 1961r tech revised 22 february 1979 qual revisions in this type style emeter watching are you waiting for the meter to play dixie i have been bit surprised by the length of time it is taking people to do assessments on the prehav on security checks and goals query into this which may reveal more has discovered that students wait patiently for the meter to react which mary sue has noticed it dawns on that auditors believe they are doing an analytical assessment on the prehav etc this is wrong the prehav scale is not picture of analytical thought it is in the order it is in because it is picture of reactive thought it is how the reactive mind is stacked up see dianetics the modern science of mental health for the chapter on the reactive mind now an emeter reacts only on the reactive mind clear doesnt react because he is able to be conscious an aberree reacts because he cant think without thought exciting the reactivity of the reactive mind this being composed of mass energy space time and thought responds to tiny electrical impulses if your auditing was not aimed at reactivity it would not register on meter thus you run what reacts because it reacts and is therefore part of the reactive mind the reactive mind responds instantly on data billion years ago how is this time in the reactive mind is out of order so is space so is matter so is energy pin sign on the reactive mind out of order it connects wrong connections hence the emeter what is wrong with the pc is not known to the pc therefore if pc knows all about it it isnt wrong with him thats why you never run what the pc says you run only what the meter says example pc is sure his current general prehav level that should be run now is order or command order rapidly vanishes command follows suit conquer stays in this is an actual example i just assessed it few minutes ago on pc who is in pretty good shape he didnt like conquer he said order and command were long track somebody running q and on his assessment would have said perhaps the pc knows best so well run order even if it doesnt fall but when i said it was conquer that we were going to run as only it now fell the pc sighed and gave in finding the conquer level questions produced very responsive meter needle it was wrong with the pc because he didnt know about it it was part of his reactive mind order and command were analytical responses prompted by an entirely different thing conquer if order or command had been run the pc would have had lot of auditing time wasted on him now why are assessments wrong sometimes because the auditor is persuaded by the pc not the meter if the pc and the meter agree so what you can still run it but only if the meter says so for only then is it reactive 1now what about slow assessments well the auditor thinks the pc must consider things before he answers waits for the pc to answer and waits for the question to sink in so the meter will react this is entirely wrong based on misunderstanding of assessment the meter and the reactive mind 1 the pc does not have to be given chance to think before the needle re sponds 2 the pc does not have to answer or say one word to make the needle respond 3 all needle response is reactive 4 there is time in the reactive mind 5 if the pc knew what was wrong with him it wouldnt be wrong 6 only the meter knows 7 the auditor has more control over the pcs reactive mind than the pc since the pc is influenced by the reactive mind responses and the auditor is not so influenced the meter responds instantly the reaction you will get on the needle starts to occur on the needle instantly after you utter it there is need to sit there afterwards waiting for the needle to respond again for it wont until you push that button again the only wait is caused by letting the needle come back at the end of fall this may take one second therefore to wait more than one second before uttering the next word on the list is complete waste of auditing time all the response you want will begin to occur instantly after you utter goal terminal level or security question thus the maximum time between questions on the prehav level is at most threesecond interval of silence while you digest the data further on an assessment for prehav run on the general scale as in routine 2 hcob 5 june 1961 you do not now say do you or any other dunnage you just say the level itself note response put pencil point down on the level if it responds say the next word etc etc takes about 5 minutes to run the primary scale up and down to find its level you start at the bottom you just say the word if it responds you dot the sheet using different symbols to tell them apart like dots xs lines then go back down the scale touching only those you marked going up add another dot if they still fall or react then play off those left one against the other saying level only once each time the remaining level is now the only one that reacts so you assemble your 5way bracket and carry on with auditing the pc doesnt have to say word throughout the whole assessment you can even ask him politely not to as breath going in and out in speech can vibrate the needle when you assess over into the secondary scale of the level you found you do exactly the same as above you read them all off once then only those that reacted eliminate them and youve got it and by the way if you go over the secondary scale you then dont only run levels on that secondary forever in each new assess ment you use the primary scale again to find new secondary level to assess 2this is also true of joburg if youre going to get reaction on the needle it will come fast waiting if you get reaction you clear that reaction not the pcs whole life the moment the needle is null you go on to the next question of course in joburg the pc talks he better all auditing actions except the cchs are now done in model session and all auditing actions and questions are done effectively neither frantically rushed nor slowly so it boils down to this weeks can be added to joburgs and assessments if you think you have to wait for needle response what are you waiting for the whole action only requires second dont wait for the emeter to play dixie it was made in the nawth l ron hubbard founder lrhimjrdjk copyright 1961 1979 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 3hubbard

hats tech recovery ref hcob 7 feb 79r emeter drill 5racan squeeze my study of nov 1965 plummeting hgc completion statistic indicates certain policies are necessary in all hgcs and qual divisions the following errors were found 1 the hgc ceased to look for former release grades to rehabilitate and ignored opportunities to do so on the basis that outer orgs have rehabbed them already this came out in the comm ev held on d of p of that period of course if the hgc failed to rehab earlier grades or earlier life overruns it could achieve later grades or grade v this alone would have ended completions promptly on all grades and wiped out the graph 2 invalidation of the appearance of free needle and invalidating any auditor who thought he saw one this wiped out all release attainments and made for total overrun of all pcs of all grades this error existed for 15 years so it is not surprising that it got back in again 3 whenever an overrun occurred rehabilitation of it was done by running different new processes instead of standard rehab routine as in hcobs ie doing arc break pps rudiments anything but real rehab of that process that was overrun 4 abandonment of standard tech in favor of unusual solutions this is always present when collapse of tech occurs 5 one sp was found in the middle of all this but after his departure the statistic did not recover so one can assume another sp was in the middle of it still or that the hgc remained pts and didnt separate from the sp found because he was so convincing so reasonable and so persuasive as to why tech statistic must remain down it is interesting that 1 aboveceasing to rehab lower gradeswould be abso lutely fatal to any upper grades therefore this becomes policy upper grade of release may be begun newly on pc until all lower grades are fully rehabbed to free needle this applies to all grades 0 to vii regarding 2invalidation of what free needle isand thus running past all free needless let it be noted that this is an auditors code breakcontinuing process that has ceased to produce changeand is therefore crime this was wrong too long to be allowed to go wrong again thus we get the policy an auditor who has been found to have overrun free needle on percale must be given an ethics chit and if the action is several times repeated ethics must order full review of the auditors case including an eyesight test and conduct thorough ethics investigation and hearing 5note that meter run with too high sensitivity setting does not give marked change when the needle floats meter cranked up to 128 sensitivity looks like floating needle all of the time at casual glance on most pcs on the other hand if the sensitivity is set too low then the free needle may not be seen thus the sensitivity must be set for 13 of dial drop on the can squeeze for each session then free needle will be plainly visible also meters go out of 5000 ohm calibration and dont read on the m and f clear reads and change of electrodes can change m and f clear reads free needle if process is overrun vanishes with just one extra command so an auditor must be alert please also note that this has been part of the auditors code for agesrunning past flat point of process has been forbidden since the first formulations of the auditors code regarding 3rehabilitation by using other processesthe hcobs on rehabs are very explicit to run another process would clobber the pc thus we get the policy rehabilitations must be done by rehabilitating the pc only on the process overrun and only by standard hcobs on rehab procedure re 4unusual solutionswe get the policy any auditor accepting an unusual solution without filing job endangerment chit or found using an unusual solution must be charged with crime and given an ethics hearing failing to report an unusual solution advised or used is also so handled an unusual solution is one evolved to remedy an abuse of existing technology on 5statistic failing to recover after an sp is spotted in department gives us the 2 policies whenever an sp is discovered and declared in an organization all his associates in that portion of the org must be checked out for or given an s d and when an sp is discovered in an organization is dismissed or removed and the statistic does not recover another sp must be looked for it is noted that the general condition of the completion statistic of dec 65 to jan 66 could be attributed to the above gross errors it is now certain that l rehabilitation of earlier grades 2 free needle and 3 rehabilitation by standard practice are primary targets in our technology for anyone seeking to mess it up and that unwitting tampering with these three things and lack of hco enforcement on them will reduce hgc statistics and prevent their recovery of course one could also go mad in the opposite direction1 rehabilitate earlier grades endlessly on pc regardless of how many times free needle had been obtained 2 call any loosening up of needle free needle and 3 refuse to even 2way comm with pc under repair for overrun for fear it violates standard procedure for rehab the middle course is the correct course in this case relax and just be very sure the pc has been properly rehabbed to free needle on each grade up to the one one is going to start by demanding the awards of release that were granted and if these 6werent ever awarded then do the rehabs necessary grade by grade the only sticky point in this is that if pc had ever been run on higher grade without rehab of lower one must rehab from the top down at times tackling the highest overrun first but nevertheless doing all of them that were bypassed eventually the way to recognize free needle is watch for one when it happens you will see one then you will never afterwards wonder the free needles available on case can all be swallowed up by failure to rehab all grades ever bypassed or overrun if free needles show up on case at all then partially rehab any grade available for rehab back and forth until one has one of them go free needle and then get free needle on the remainder life can also be an overrun and pc never audited will respond to rehab of something overdone this doesnt mean the pc went release before scientologyit means that purpose overrun then jamsrehab of life situations of overrun consists of hitting the purpose that was overrun and when this is hit the pc goes release in pt and was not release in the past an example is an overrun located in 20 ad when the person alert to christianity decided to be good made it and then overran it for 1945 years when the purpose was found to be good and dated and the overrun spotted the needle went free rough auditing bad trs letting the pc itsa etc can swallow up free needles also totally arc broke meter that wont read at all with bad indicators all over the place wont record read looks sometimes like floating needle the difference being the pc has total bad indicatorssour mean sad etc free needle occurs most often after big cognition and the unskilled auditor looks at the pc who is being bright and interesting and just doesnt see the needle float asks more questions and overruns and the free needle vanisheswhen pc is cogniting look at the meter not the pc and the instant the ta starts up and the needle goes sticky suspect an overrun and check as for doing something else rather than standard procedure for rehab plain ignorance can cause it the auditors desire to help the pc if unaccompanied by solid tech background leads to wild efforts new processes and anything but cool standard procedure when the person checking out pcs is also the case supervisor unusual solutions creep in the most errors ive seen made by case supervisor were made after he had seen the pc or talked with the auditor cases have to be run by report only and auditors have to be supervised and their sessions listened to by somebody else besides the case supervisor tech is tech there is such thing as standard tech pc wild tales and hollow eyes and auditor hobbyhorses have to be kept off case supervisor lines so there must be person who checks out pcs and supervises auditors and their auditing performance but who never opens his or her face to suggest instructions about the pc and only writes down that the auditor is rough or the process is flat or the process is overrun the case supervisor lives in an ivory tower sounds strange but unless its done that way wild departures from standard rehab procedure and from standard tech in general will occur hell all psychiatry went down that drain the desperate patient the desperate measures squirreling stems from the case supervisor being the auditor supervisor and the pc interviewer oil water being in two divisions commies and fascists dogs and cats wont mix neither will the personal contacter of auditors and pcs and the case supervisor ever successfully stay crossed the individual practitioner breaks down only because he does both auditing and case supervision auditing is an organization action which is why today we have field staff members and hgcs additional notes of things discovered in the investigation of the plummeted statis tic on completions were 1 auditors rabbiting out of uncertainty and so stumbling past end phenomena and floating needles 2 case supervisor getting auditors to ask leading questions on pr pr 2 ask the pc if he is interested in medical practices 3 d of p find out what the needle is floating on 74 case supervisor told auditor that floating needle was not the end phe nomenon of process in which the ta had to be run out 5 lack of knowledge and understanding of the technology and not knowing the difference between such things as anaten secondaries and engrams by case supervisor d of p and so confusing auditors of course the one thing one cant technically overcome is an sp keeping an area messed up his case doesnt improve because of his intentions and overts and fear of people getting better or being bigger than he when an sp dominates an area only ethics actions can handle the primary indicator of the presence of an sp in an org is plummeting statistic immediately after he starts handling portion of it indifferent leadership even inaction cant drive statistic down only active suppression can so watch the statistics and dont get reasonable when they fall either outside the org suppression has been brought down on that portion of the org making it pts or there is an sp there the final answer is what happened just before the statistic fell if new appointment was made and it fell unappoint it fast if nothing cures the down statistic find the sp or handle the pts situation because one or the other is there completions stayed down for 15 years then we found auditors never noticed free needles now for heavens sakes 15 years was enough dont repeat the error it does work you know l ron hubbard founder lrh mlrdjhjk copyright 1966 1979 by l ron hubbard all rights

definition of rock slam free needles can be obscured only by overruns and auditor goofs in the rehab session and arc breaks in past auditing when ta goes up or is up it means an overrun in life or on process or grade of release the only place you cant get an overrun is at grade vii all grades below that are subject to overrun life subjects are subject to overrun before scientology the mechanism is this one conceived purpose he or she succeeded in it then kept on and overran it in auditing one hits the purpose and the overrun of it and gets free needle on it that doesnt mean the person was release then it means that the spotting of the purpose and the overrun by auditing produces free needle today it may be necessary to find whole track overruns on some pcs in rehabilitation of grades if lot of levels have been run past free needle it may be necessary to take apart the mess like bundle of yarn to get the first free needle in such case one rehabs any grade the pc has been run on that the pc can remember one handles this briefly until the pc is happy but not necessarily to free needle one then finds another overrun does the same one goes on and on looking for moments the pc felt good about processing at one or another time if you keep this up suddenly you will see free needle on the pc establish what grade it is free on then quickly get the needle free on the remaining overrun grades but not grades pc was never run on it may be necessary to take into account whole track overrun of purpose or even the purpose to get release clear or ot it is all very quick deft auditing very much on procedure using standard rehab techbut repetitive grind if you set the sensitivity too low you wont see the free needle floating needle and if you set the sensitivity too high it will obscure every free needle as the needle is too loose already for the auditor to see any change so you always set the sensitivity for each session for 13 of dial drop when the pc squeezes the cans and you will be able to easily recognize free needles when they appear pcs are most apt to go free needle after big cog so dont be so engrossed in looking at the pc during cognitions keep an eye on that needle and if it goes free dont ask anything else just gently give the pc thats it and without chop of comm ease the pc off to declare in qual or if field auditor start the next grade gently gently smooth trs get you free needles 9a dirty needle is caused by one of three things 1 the auditors trs are bad 2 the auditor is breaking the auditors code 3 the pc has withholds he does not wish known if needle goes dirty in rehab session do an l1c right now and quickly find why rehabs are not substitute for processes if grade hasnt been run you cant rehab it of course in rehab never use new process to cure an overrun rehab the process that was overrun not new ruds and see hco pol ltr 10 feb 1966 on this subject you can get free needles on pcs it just requires standard trs standard tech

as an hcob as well as existing in hco pl form admin knowhow the responsibilities of leaders few comments on power being or working close to or under power which is to say leader or one who exerts wide primary influence on the affairs of men i have written it this way using two actual people to give an example of magni tude enough to interest and to furnish some pleasant reading and i used military sphere so it could be seen clearly without restimulation of admin problems the book referenced is fantastically able book by the way the mistakes of simon bolivar and manuela saenz reference the book entitled the four seasons of manuela by victor w von hagen biography mayflower dell paperback oct 1966 6 simon bolivar was the liberator of south america from the yoke of spain manuela saenz was the liberatress and consort their acts and fates are well recorded in this moving biography but aside from any purely dramatic value the book lays bare and motivates vari ous actions of great interest to those who lead who support or are near leaders simon bolivar was very strong character he was one of the richest men in south america he had real personal ability given to only handful on the planet he was military commander without peer in history why he would fail and die an exile to be later deified is thus of great interest what mistakes did he make manuela saenz was brilliant beautiful and able woman she was loyal devoted quite comparable to bolivar far above the cut of average humanoids why then did she live vilified outcast receive such violent social rejection and die of poverty and remain unknown to history what mistakes did she make bolivars errors the freeing of things is the reverse unstated dramatization the opposite side of the coin to the slavery enjoined by the mechanisms of the mind 11unless there is something to free men into the act of freeing is simply protest of slavery and as humanoid is free while aberrated in the body cycle it is of course gesture to free him politically as it frees him only into the anarchy of dramatizing his aberrations with control whatever and without something to fight exterior and with exteriorization of his interest he simply goes mad noisily or quietly once as great wrong as depraving beings has been done there is of course freedom short of freeing one from the depravity itself or at least from its most obvious influences in the society in short one would have to deaberrate man before his whole social structure could be deaberrated if one lacked the whole ability to free man wholly from his reactive patterns then one could free man from their restimulators in the society at least if one had the whole of the data but lacked the scientology tech one would simply use reactive patterns to blow the old society apart and then pick up the pieces neatly in new pattern if one had inkling of how reactive one can get and bolivar of course had knowledge whatever in that field there yet remained workable formula used instinctively by most successful practical political leaders if you free society from those things you see wrong with it and use force to demand it do what is right and if you carry forward with decision and thoroughness and without continual temporizing you can in the applications of your charm and gifts bring about great political reform or improve failing country so bolivars first error most consistent it was too was contained in the vital words you see in the above paragraph he didnt look and he didnt even listen to sound intelligence reports he was so sure he could glow things right or fight things right or charm things right that he never looked for anything wrong to correct until it was too late this is the neplusultra of personal confidence amounting to supreme vanity when he appeared it would all come right was not only his belief but his basic philosophy so the first time it didnt work he collapsed all his skills and charm were channeled into this one test only that could he observe not to compare with boliver but to show my understanding of this i once had similar one i would keep going as long as i could and when i was stopped i would then die this was solution mild enough to state and really hard to understand until you had an inkling of what i meant by keeping going meteors keep goingvery very fast and so did i then one day ages back i finally was stopped after countless little stoppings by social contacts and family to prepare culminating in navy more devoted to braid than dead enemies and literally i quit for while i couldnt get clue of what was wrong with life went completely unlivable until i found new solution so i know the frailty of these single solutions not to compare myself but just to show it happens to us all not just bolivars bolivar had personal insight at all he could only outsight and even then he did not look or listen he glowed things right pitifully it was his undoing that he could until he longer could when he couldnt glow he roared and when he couldnt roar he fought battle then civic enemies were not military enemies so he had solution left at all it never occurred to him to do more than personally magnetize things into being right and victorious his downfall was that he made far too heavy use of skill simply because it was easy he was too good at this one thing so he never looked to any other skill and he never even dreamed there was any other way he had view of any situation and idea of the organizational or preparatory steps necessary to political and personal victory he only knew military organization which is where his organizational insight ceased 12he was taught on the high wine of french revolt notorious in its organizational inability to form cultures and that fatally by childhood teacher who was intensely impractical in his own private life simon rodriguez an unfrocked priest turned tutor bolivar had personal financial skill he started wealthy and wound up pauper statistic descending from one of the if not the richest man in south america down to borrowed nightshirt to be buried in as an exile and this while the property of royalists was wide open the greatest land and mine valuables of south america wide open to his hand and thats not believable but true he never collected his own debt of loans to governments even when the head of those governments so it is wonder we find two more very real errors leading to his downfall he did not get his troops or officers rewarded and he did not aim for any solvency of the states he controlled it was all right if there were long years of battle ahead for them to be unpaid as real riches were yet won but not to reward them when the whole place was at his disposal well the limit of his ability consisted of demanding bit of cash for current pay from churcheswhich were not actively against him at first but which annoyed them endand few household expenses he could have and should have set aside all royalist property and estates for division amongst all officers their men and his supporters it had owners now and this failure cost the economy of the country the tax loss of all those productive estates the whole wealth of the land so it is wonder his government its taxable estates now inoperative or at best lorded by profiteer or looted by indians was insolvent also by failing to do such an obvious act he delivered property into the hands of more provident enemies and left his officers and men penniless to finance any support for their own stability in the new society and so for his own as for state finance the great mines of south america suddenly ownerless were overlooked and were then grabbed and worked by foreign adventurers who simply came in and took them without payment spain had run the country on the finance of mine tithes and general taxes bolivar not only didnt collect the tithes he let the land become so worthless as to be untaxable he should have gotten the estates going by any shifts and should have state operated all royalist mines once he had them to not do these things was complete but typically humanoid folly in doing this property division he should have left it all up to officers committees operating as courts of claim without staining his own hands in the natural corruption he was left doubly open as he not only did not attend to it he also got the name of corruption when anybody did grab something he failed as well to recognize the distant widespread nature of his countries despite all his riding and fighting over them and so sought tightly centralized govern ment not only centralizing states but also centralizing the various nations into federal state and this over huge land mass full of insurmountable ranges impassable jungles and deserts and without mail telegraph relay stages roads railroads river vessels or even foot bridges repaired after war of attrition step echelon from pueblo village to state from state to country and country to federal state was only possible in such huge spaces of country where candidates could never be known personally over any wide area and whose opinions could not even be circulated more than few miles of burro trail where only the pueblo was democratic and the rest all appointive from pueblo on up himself the ratifier of titles if he even needed that with his own officers and armies controlling the land as owners of all wrested from royalists and the crown of spain he would have had revolts there would have been little civil wars of course but court to settle their final claims could have existed at federal level and kept them traveling so much over those vast distances it would have crippled their enthusiasm for litigation on the one hand and 13on the other by dog eat dog settlements would have given him the strongest rulersif he took neither side he did not step out and abdicate dictatorial position he mistook military acclaim and ability for the tool of peace war only brings anarchy so he had anarchy peace is more than command for unity his favorite phrase productive peace is getting men busy and giving them something to make something of that they want to make something of and telling them to get on with it he never began to recognize suppressive and never considered anyone needed killing except on battlefield there it was glorious but somebody destroying his very name and soul and the security of every supporter and friend the sp santander his vicepresident who could have been arrested and executed by corporals guard on one onehundredth of available evidence could suborn the whole treasury and popu lation against him without bolivar continually warned loaded with evidence ever even reprimanding him and this brought about his loss of popularity and his eventual exile he also failed in the same way to protect his military family or manuela saenz from other enemies so he weakened his friends and ignored his enemies just by over sight his greatest error lay in that while dismissing spain he did not dismiss that nations most powerful minion the church and did not even localize it or reward south american separate branch to loyalty or do anything at all except extort money from it to an organization which continually worked for spain as only it could work on every person in the land in direct antibolivar reign of terror behind the scenes you either suborn such group or you take them out when they cease to be universal and become or are an enemys partner as the church held huge properties and as bolivars troops and supporters went unpaid even of the penny soldiers pay if one was going to overlook the royalist estates one could at least have seized the church property and given it to the soldiers general vallejo did this in 1835 in california nearly contemporary act with catastrophe from rome or the penniless countries could have taken them over you dont leave an enemy financed and solvent while you let your friends starve in game like south american politics oh he wasted his enemies he exported the godos or defeated royalist soldiers they mostly had homes but south america he issued amnesties they could count on they were shipped off or left to die in the ditchthe best artisan in the country among them when one general rodil would not surrender calloa fortress after peru was won bolivar after great gestures of amnesty failed to obtain surrender and then fought the fort four thousand political refugees and four thousand royalist troops died over many months in full sight of lima fought heavily by bolivar only because the fort was fighting but bolivar had to straighten up peru urgently not fight defeated enemy the right answer to such foolish commander as rodil as bolivar did have the troops to do it was to cover the roads with cannon enfilade potential to discourage any sortie from the fort put large number of his own troops in distant position of offense but ease and comfort and say were not going to fight the wars over silly man look at the silly fellows in there living on rats when they can just walk out and sleep home nights or go to spain or enlist with or just go camping and let anybody walk in and out who pleased making the fort commander rodil the prey of every pleading wife and mother without and wouldbe deserter or mutineer within until he did indeed sheepishly give up the pretensea man cannot fight alone but battle was glory to bolivar and he became intensely disliked because the incessant cannonade which got nowhere was annoying honors meant great deal to bolivar to be liked was his life and it probably meant more to him than to see things really right he never compromised his principles 14but he lived on admiration rather sickening diet since it demands in turn continuous theatre one is what one is not what one is admired or hated for to judge oneself by ones successes is simply to observe that ones postulates worked and breeds confidence in ones ability to have to be told it worked only criticizes ones own eyesight and hands spear to the enemy to make his wound of vanity at his will applause is nice its great to be thanked and admired but to work only for that and his craving for that his addiction to the most unstable drug in historyfame killed bolivar that self offered spear he told the world continually how to kill him reduce its esteem so as money and land can buy any quantity of cabals he could be killed by curdling the esteem the easiest thing you can get mob to do he had all the power he did not use it for good or evil one cannot hold power and not use it it violates the power formula for it then prevents others from doing things if they had some of the power so they then see as their only solution the struction of the holder of the power as he not using power or delegating it is the witting block to all their plans so even many of his friends and armies finally agreed he had to go they were not able men they were in mess but bad or good they had to do something things were desperate broken down and starving after 14 years of civil war therefore they either had to have some of that absolute power or else nothing could be done at all they were not great minds he did not need any great minds he thought even though he invited them verbally he saw their petty often murderous solutions and he rebuked them and so held the power and didnt use it he could not stand another personality threat the trouble in peru came when he bested its real conqueror from the argentine mar in petty triumph over adding guayaquil to columbia bolivar wished to look triumphant again and didnt notice it really cost him the support and peru the support of marwho understandably resigned and went home leaving bolivar peru to conquer unfortunately it had already been in his hands mar needed some troops to clean up small royalist army that was all mar didnt need perus loss of guayaquilwhich never did anybody any real good anyway bolivar would become inactive when faced with two areas worth of problems he did not know which way to go so he did nothing brave beyond any general in history on the battlefield the andes or in torrential rivers he did not really have the bravery needed to trust inferior minds and stand by their often shocking blunders he feared their blunders so he did not dare unleash his many willing hounds he could lead men make men feel wonderful make men fight and lay down their lives after hardships army elsewhere in the world has ever faced before or since but he could not use men even when they were begging to be used it is frightening level of bravery to use men you know can be cruel vicious and incompetent he had fear of their turning on him ever when they finally did only then he was shocked but he protected the people from authority given to question ably competent men so he really never used but three or four generals of mild dispo sition and enormously outstanding ability and to the rest he denied power very thoughtful of the nebulous people but very bad indeed for the general good and it really caused his death bolivar was theatre it was all theatre one cannot make such errors and still pretend that one thinks of life as life redblooded and factual real men and real life are full of dangerous violent live situations and wounds hurt and starvation is desperation itself especially when you see it in one you love this mighty actor backed up with fantastic personal potential made the mistake of thinking the theme of liberty and his own great role upon the stage was enough to interest all the working suffering hours of men buy their bread pay their whores 15shoot their wives lovers and bind their wounds or even put enough drama into very hard pressed lives to make them want to live it bolivar was unfortunately the only actor on the stage and other man in the world was real to him and so he died they loved him but they were also on the stage too where they were dying in his script or rousseaus script for liberty but script for living their very real lives he was the greatest military general in any history measured against his obstacles the people and the land across which he fought and he was complete failure to himself and his friends while being one of the greatest men alive at that so we see how truly shabby others in leaders boots amongst men must be manuela saenz the tragedy of manuela saenz as bolivars mistress was that she was never used never really had share and was neither protected nor honored by bolivar here was clever spectacular woman of fantastic fidelity and skill with an enormous flaire capable of giving great satisfaction and service and only her satis faction ability was taken and that not consistently nor even honestly in the first place bolivar never married her he never married anybody this opened up fantastic breach in any defense she could ever make against her or his enemies who were legion so her first mistake was in not in some way contriving marriage that she had an estranged husband she had been more or less sold to was per mitted by her to wreck her life obliquely she was too selfless to be real in all her very able plotting for this marriage problem she could have engineered any number of actions she had the solid friendship of all his trusted advisers even his old tutor yet she arranged nothing for herself she was utterly devoted completely brilliant and utterly incapable of really bring ing off an action of any final kind she violated the power formula in not realizing that she had power manuela was up against hard man to handle but she did not know enough to make her own court effective she organized one she did not know what to do with it her most fatal mistake was in not bringing down santander bolivars chief enemy that cost her everything she had before the end and after bolivar died she knew for years santander had to be killed she said it or wrote it every few days yet never did she promise some young officer nice night or handful of gold to do it in day when dueling was in fashion its like standing around discussing how the plainly visible wolf in the garden thats eating the chickens must be shot even holding gun and never even lifting it while all ones chickens vanish for years in land overridden with priests she never got herself tame priest to bring about her ends 16she was fantastic intelligence officer but she fed her data to man who could not act to protect himself or friends who could only fight armies dramatically she did not see this and also quietly take on the portfolio of secret police chief her mistake was waiting to be askedto be asked to come to him to act she volun tarily was his best political intelligence agent therefore she should have also assumed further roles she guarded his correspondence was intimate with his secretaries and yet she never collected or forged or stole any document to bring down enemies either through representations to bolivar or court circle of her own and in an area with that low an ethic thats fatal she openly pamphleteered and fought violently as in battle against her rabble she had great deal of money at her disposal in land of forsale indians she never used penny to buy quick knife or even solid piece of evidence when merely opening her lips she could have had any sequestrated royalist estate she went to litigation for legitimate legacy never won and another won but never paid they lived on the edge of quicksand she never bought plank or rope carried away by the glory of it all devoted completely potentially able and for midable enemy she did not act she waited to be told to come to him even when he lay dying and exiled his command over her who never obeyed any other was too absolute for his own or her survival her assigned mistakes pointed out at the time as her caprice and play acting were not her errors they only made her interesting they were far from fatal she was not ruthless enough to make up for his lack of ruthlessness and not provident enough to make up for his lack of providence the ways open to her for finance for action were completely doorless the avenue stretched out to the horizon she fought bravely but she just didnt take action she was an actress for the theatre alone and she died of it and she let bolivar die because of it never once did manuela look about and say see here things mustnt go this wrong my lover holds half continent and even i hold the loyalty of battalions yet that woman threw fish never did manuela tell bolivars doctor rumoured lover tell that man he will not live without my becoming constant part of his entourage and tell him until he believes it or well have new physician around here the world was open where theodosius the wife of emperor justinian ii of constantinople mere circus girl and whore ruled harder than her husband but for her husband behind his backand made him marry her as well manuela never had any bushel basket of gold brought in to give bolivar for his unpaid troops with just found it dear to his where on earth after the royalist captives had been carefully ransomed for gaol escapes by her enterprising own entourage and officer friends she never handed over any daughter of family clamoring against her to negro troops and then said which oververbal family is next 17she even held colonels rank but only used it because she wore mans clothing afternoons it was brutal violent ruthless land not game of musical chairs and so manuela penniless improvident died badly and in poverty exiled by enemies and deserted by her friends but why not deserted by her friends they had all been povertystricken to point quite incapable of helping her even though they wanted tofor she once had the power to make them solvent and didnt use it they were in poverty before they won but they did eventually control the land after that why make it bad habit and so we see two pathetic truly dear but tinsel figures both on stage both far removed from the reality of it all and one can say but if they had not been such idealists they never would have fought so hard and freed half continent or if she had stooped to such intrigue or he had been known for violent political actions they would never have had the strength and never would have been loved all very idealistic itself they died in the ditch unloved hated and despised two decent brave people almost too good for this world true hero true heroine but on stage and not in life impractical and improvident and with faintest gift either one to use the power they could assemble this story of bolivar and manuela is tragedy of the most piteous kind they fought hidden enemy the church they were killed by their friends but dont overlook how impractical it is not to give your friends power enough when you have it to give you can always give some of it to another if the first one collapses through inability and one can always be brought down like hare at hunt who seeks to use the delegated power to kill youif you have the other friends life is not stage for posturing and look at look at look at if one is to lead life of command or life near to command one must handle it as life life bleeds it suffers it hungers and it has to have the right to shoot its enemies until such time as comes golden age aberrated man is not capable of supporting in his present state golden declared age for three minutes given all the tools and wealth of the world if one would live life of command or one near to command one must then accumulate power as fast as possible and delegate it as quickly as feasible and use every humanoid in long reach to the best and beyond his talents if one is to live at all if one does not choose to live such life then go on the stage and be real actor dont kill men while pretending it isnt real or one can become recluse or student or clerk or study butterflies or take up tennis for one is committed to certain irrevocable natural laws the moment one starts out upon conquest either as the man in charge or person near to him or on his staff or in his army and the foremost law if ones ambition is to win is of course to win but also to keep on providing things to win and enemies to conquer bolivar let his cycle run to freedom and end there he never had another plan beyond that point he ran out of territory to free then he didnt know what to do with it and didnt know enough either to find somewhere else to free but of course all limited games come to end and when they do their players fall over on the field and become rag dolls unless somebody at least tells them the game has ended and they have more game nor any dressing room or houses but just that field 18and they lie upon the field not noticing there can be more game since the other team has fled and after bit they have to do something and if the leader and his consort are sitting over on the grass being rag dolls too of course there isnt any game and so the players start fighting amongst themselves just to have game and if the leader then says and his consort doesnt say honey you better phone the baltimore orioles for saturday then of course the poor players bored stiff say hes out shes out now were going to split the team in half and have game and thats what happened to bolivar and manuela they had to be gotten rid of for there was game and they didnt develop one to play while forbidding the only available gameminor civil wars whole continent containing the then major mines of the world whole popula tions were left sitting there freed but none owned any of it though the former owners had left they werent given it nor were they made to manage it game and if bolivar had not been smart enough for that he could at least have said well you monkeys are going to have quite time getting the wheels going but thats not my job you decide on your type of government and what its to be soldiers are my line now im taking over those old estates of mine and the royalist ones near by and the emerald mines just as souvenirs and and manuela were going home and he should have said that 5 minutes after the last royalist army was defeated in peru and his official family with him and thousand troops to which he was giving land would have moved right off smartly with him and the people after few screams of horror at being deserted would have fallen on each other sabered state together here and town there and gotten busy out of sheer self protection in vital new game whos going to be bolivar now then when home he should have said say those nice woods look awfully royalist to and also those 1000000 hectares of grazing land manuela its owner once threw royalist fish remember so thats yours and the rest of the country would have done the same and gotten on with the new game of you was royalist and bolivar and manuela would have had statues built to them by the ton at once as soon as agents could get to paris with orders from an adoring populace bolivar come rule us should have gotten an i dont see any unfree south america when you see french or spanish army coming come back and tell that would have worked and this poor couple would have died suitably adored in the sanctity of glory and perhaps more importantly in their own beds not in ditch and if they had had to go on ruling they could have declared new game of pay the soldiers and officers with royalist land and when that was gone game oust the church and give its land to the poor friendly indians you cant stand bowing back of the footlights forever with show even if you are quite an actor somebody else can make better use of any stage than even the hand somest actor who will not use it man is too aberrated to understand at least 7 things about power 1 life is lived by lots of people and if you lead you must either let them get on with it or lead them on with it actively 2 when the game or the show is over there must be new game or new show and if there isnt somebody else is jolly well going to start one and if you wont let anyone do it the game will become getting you 193 if you have power use it or delegate it or you sure wont have it long 4 when you have people use them or they will soon become most unhappy and you wont have them any more 5 when you move off point of power pay all your obligations on the nail empower all your friends completely and move off with your pockets full of artillery potential blackmail on every erstwhile rival unlimited funds in your private account and the addresses of experienced assassins and go live in bulgravia and bribe the police and even then you may not live long if you have retained one scrap of domination in any camp you do not now control or if you even say i favour politician jiggs abandoning power utterly is dangerous indeed but we cant all be leaders or figures strutting in the limelight and so theres more to know about this 6 when youre close to power get some delegated to you enough to do your job and protect yourself and your interests for you can be shot fellow shot as the position near power is delicious but dangerous dangerous always open to the taunts of any enemy of the power who dare not really boot the power but can boot you so to live at all in the shadow or employ of power you must yourself gather and use enough power to hold your ownwithout just nattering to the power to kill pete in straightforward or more suppressive veiled ways to him as these wreck the power that supports yours he doesnt have to know all the bad news and if hes power really he wont ask all the time what are all those dead bodies doing at the door and if you are clever you never let it be thought he killed themthat weakens you and also hurts the power source well boss about all those dead bodies nobody at all will suppose you did it she over there those pink legs sticking out didnt like well hell say if he really is power why are you bothering with it if its done and you did it wheres my blue ink or skipper three shore patrolmen will be along soon with your cook dober and theyll want to tell you he beat up simson whos simson hes clerk in the enemy office downtown good when theyve done it take dober down to the dispensary for any treatment he needs oh yes raise his pay or sir could i have the power to sign divisional orders sure 7 and lastly and most important for we all arent on the stage with our names in lights always push power in the direction of anyone on whose power you depend it may be more money for the power or more ease or snarling defense of the power to critic or even the dull thud of one of his enemies in the dark or the glorious blaze of the whole enemy camp as birthday surprise if you work like that and the power you are near or depend upon is power that has at least some inkling about how to be one and if you make others work like that then the powerfactor expands and expands and expands and you too acquire sphere of power bigger than you would have if you worked alone real powers are developed by tight conspiracies of this kind pushing someone up in whose leadership they have faith and if they are right and also manage their man and keep him from collapsing through overwork bad temper or bad data kind of juggernaut builds up dont ever feel weaker because you work for somebody stronger the only failure lies in taxing or pulling down the strength on which you depend all failures to remain powers power are failures to contribute to the strength and longevity of the work health and power of that power devotion requires active contribution outwards from the power as well as in if bolivar and manuela had known these things they would have lived an epic not tragedy they would not have died in the ditch he bereft of really earned praise for his real accomplishments even to this day and manuela would not be unknown even in the archives of her country as the heroine she was 20brave brave figures but if this can happen to such stellar personalities gifted with ability tenfold over the greatest of other mortals to people who could take rabble in vast impossible land and defeat one of earths then foremost powers with money or arms on personality alone what then must be the ignorance and confusion of human leaders in general much less little men stumbling through their lives of boredom and suffering let us wise them up huh you cant live in world where even the great leaders cant lead l ron hubbard founder

medicine and alcohol sometimes suffer from somatic shutoff they appear anaesthetized unfeeling and sometimes have nothing troubling them whereas they are on drugs drink or medicine and are in reality in suppressed physical condition and cannot cease to take drugs or drink or medicine one can find in such case very high ta which doesnt seem to reduce the ta can be brought down by auditing the drug and alcohol engrams as chain any such case took up drugs alcohol or medicine because of unwanted pain or sensation or misemotion you can use that as stable datum which resolves the situation all it requires is special assessment called prior assessment for the person looked on drugs alcohol or medicine as cure for unwanted feelings one has to assess what was wrong before or prior to the cure note prior assessment is done after narrative running and preassessment with r3ra running of the drug medicine or alcohol using the drug list obtained on the original assessment take up the largest reading this lifetime drug medicine or alcohol and ask the pc the following preassess ment question prior to taking the drug medicine or alcohol were there preassessment item take the largest reading item from the preassessment and ask the pc what item did you have prior to taking the drug medicine or alcohol continue with full handling of the preassessment per hcob 18 jun 78r new era dianetics series 4r assessment and how to get the item and hcob 15 jul 71rb new era dianetics series 9ra drug handling in doing this assessment you must grab the read and mark it plainly as it occurs if you just list and then go over the list the person may be back in present time and as these are now cut off by the masses of drug or alcohol engrams on top of them they wont read again so you must catch the read as the person first mentions it you choose the longest read and find and run the chain by r3ra as in any other new era dianetics auditing the only difference is the assessment time period you are listing for time before they went on drugs alcohol or medicine 22the above prior assessment steps are done on each drug medicine or alcohol that has read they are handled in order of largest read ref hcob 15 jun 78r ned series 9ra drug handling the running out of the chain of unwanted feelings they had before going on drugs or alcohol or medicine removes the reason they started taking drugs or medicine smoking marijuana or drinking the compulsion to still use drugs or drink is lessened and they can come off it this can also be used as working rule to get earlier than any curative activity almost anything which comes later is cure for something earlier it could be said that the present time being is compound of past cures to handle the action would be the same as for drugs alcohol or medicine preassess the unwanted pains or feelings before the cure and run the longest reads by r3ra as there will be more than one chain involved you of course take your next longest read and run that next just as in any assessment the general term for this type of assessment is prior assessing not because it is done before auditing but to determine what the pc was suffering from before he used

the sort of thing that happens the list is who or what would fly kites the cs has said to list this to bd fn item so the auditor does list it without checking the read at all the list can go on 99 pages with the pc protesting getting upset this is called dead horse list because it gave item the reason it didnt was that the list question itself didnt read one does an l4bra on the pc to correct the situation and gets unnecessary action on list that is getting item you dont extend you correctly use l4bra or any subsequent issue of it if you extend dead horse list you just make things worse use an l4bra and it will set it right this weird thing can also happen cs says to list who or what would kill buffaloes the auditor does gets bd fn item hunter the cs also says to list as second action who or what would feel tough the auditor fails to test the question for read and lists it had he tested it the list would not have read but the list comes up with an item mean hunter it has stirred up charge from the first question and the item mean hunter is wrong item as it is misworded variation of the first lists item now we have an unnecessary action and wrong item we do an l4bra and the pc is still upset as maybe only one or the other of the two errors read in dianetic list one is not doing listing action one is only trying to find somatic or sensation etc that will run the item must read well or it wont produce chain to run in actual fact the dn list q does usually read but one doesnt bother to test it but an item or flow that doesnt read will produce chain basic and the pc will jump around the track trying but just jamming up his bank the moral of this story is always test listing question before letting the pc list always mark the read it gave sf f lf lfbd on the worksheet 36always test an item for read before prepchecking nd always check an item and flow before running recalls or engrams always mark the read an item gave sf f lf lfbd on the worksheet

pc has possible reality on it pc can have broken leg yet it might not read on meter it would be charged but below the pcs reality so it wont read things that dont read wont run the case supervisor always counts on the auditor to test questions and items and flows for read before running them the auditor when question or item or flow doesnt read can and should always put in suppress and invalidate on this question item flow has anything been suppressed on this question item flow has anything been invalidated if either one read the question or item or flow will also read the case

when only went in and go in were assessed on the int rundown the rule was that the entire rundown was to be given in one session the reason for this was that there is frequent chance of ruds going out between sessions and of course they cannot be put in until the int rundown is complete as its auditing pc past exterior this is still true however with the full array of int buttons now to be assessed and any reading button run on quad or triple flows and with reassessment of the int buttons the one session rule may not be workable without quickieing the rundown which must not be done thus allowance must be made for sufficient time to get the rundown done fully while still completing it as rapidly as possible to safeguard against outruds situations cropping up before it is complete the safest way to accomplish this is to ensure that the int rundown 401 is completed in as few sessions as possible 2 after the first session each succeeding session is given on the next consecutive day 3 plenty of time 2 to 5 hours must be allowed for each daily session 4 the auditor must make sure the pc does have the necessary time for this before starting the rundown 5 any one flow on any reading int button must be completed in one session you do not end session with chain only half or partially run 6 there are session breaks taken unless pc has physical ptp in which case he can be given minimal break to handle it and return right back to session flubless auditors who have occasional flubsdn failures to flatten chains or run them to chopped ep instead of correct fn postulate off and

rundown not less than day nor more than week an int rundown must be followed by twoway comm session the reason for this is that there is cognition delay on almost all cases the 2way comm blows off locks etc and the pc usually gets big cog and never afterwards worries about exteriorization if the int rundown is not done in daily sessions flubbed not followed by 2way comm in later session the pc

that if you audit person after he or she has exteriorized you often get high tone arm somatics and an upset case the answer has been to cease to audit person after exteriorization has occurred this is so much fact that five out of five in trouble cases i recently examined had every one of them been audited for some time after they exteriorized the ta had or had not gone high but the cases were bogged they revived at once when the fact of exteriorization was located fn vgis and when rehabbed by counting number of times somatics ceased the rule has beendont audit after pc has exteriorized 43this is one of those very fundamental things that seems to defy research and yet if not solved will keep things messed up persons who exteriorize on lower grades need their upper grades and yet if audited further may mess up this places limit on auditing and yet the person may still have aberrations and somatics but the fact of having exteriorized bars the road so i got to work and made breakthrough on it hurrah it has now been fully vindicated by long tests and is now released for general use exteriorization exteriorization is defined as the act of moving out of the body with or without full perception it is the fact of this act which proves that the individual is not body but an individual this discovery in 1952 proved beyond any question the existence of thetan that the individual was thetan not body and disproved that man was an animal and that he was spiritual being timeless and deathless techniques have existed since 1952 that exteriorize person these are not now used because the person still being aberrated and not clear soon returns to his body and b when audited thereafter has trouble this is major problem thetan sometimes has at death how to exteriorize he makes it eventually of course but he should be able to do so at once but in my research i found it unreasonable that person would be hard to audit just because he had exteriorized and had reinteriorized for he has obviously done just that at every death and birth and must have done so hundreds of billions of times so why should recent exteriorization then make him hard to audit yet it did my asking of that question was the first breakthrough the rest soon followed engram behavior we know in dianetics that if you continue to run the last part of an engram which has in fact an earlier beginning which isnt being run and is ignored the ta will go up the reason for this is that the first of chain or the first part of an experience or first experience basic on chain of incidents has to be run for the chain or incident to erase if you only ran the end of incidents you would get high ta and erasure if you only ran incidents late on the chain you would get high ta pcs are uncomfortable feel under pressure when their ta is high above 35 or up if you dont erase incidents or chains of incidents when auditing or key them out as in release you get perpetually high ta high ta cases have been overrun on something that however is very over simplified explanation the truth is that they have been run on something that didnt erase the something has an earlier beginning than was detected or an earlier incident in life one having engrams about it adds new incidents in living until something is overrun or done too often the ta is therefore high ta records mass mental mass has higher electrical resistance and so mea sures more ohms of resistance an electrical term for the trouble electricity has in 44passing through something the more resistance the more units of resistance are recorded on the meter the ta actually measures resistance thus the end of an incident can be restimulated if the beginning of it is never touched then one will just accumulate more and more mass the missed beginning what has happened here as regards exteriorization is that we have concentrated on exteriorization if one is in something he must have gotten into it therefore the beginning of an exteriorization is the interiorization the being went into something before he went out of it exteriorization occurs at death thats an engram interiorization occurs at birth thats an engram so when somebody goes exterior he is actually liable to keyin having gone in terior in the first place get it so when you exteriorize somebody or he exteriorizes during auditing he gets keyedin bit and without having audited earlier interiorizations he has been put in the last part exteriorization of an incident which began with interiorization not only are you touching on something exteriorization late on chain which has hundreds of billions of like incidents ahead of it you are also touching something which is late in the incident which began with interiorization on both counts then the ta may go high the remedy the remedy is to audit out interiorizations ie times the person went in using the correctly assessed int button if this is done then the pc can be audited all you want after exteriorization auditing the interiorizations with r3ra quad or triple flows restores the possibility of auditing pc after an exteriorization has occurred in auditing int rundown revised by steps based on recent researches the original int rundown has been newly revised and simplified full array of int buttons has been added the recall and secondary steps have been deleted so the pc gets to the basic of any int trouble on faster route int chains are run using simpler r3ra command for int and each chain taken to full new era dianetics ep the revised rundown follows 45the process the interiorization rundown revised the case supervision directions for an interiorization rd are to be done by scientology auditor who is also hubbard new era dianetics auditor he must have an excellent command of metering trs r3ra the theory of int and the int rd commands and he must know and be able to recognize an fn postulate and full dianetic ep when these occur 1 omit ruds of any kind and do not attempt rapid l1c the ta will just go up out the roof on any type of ruds or list simply start the session and go right onto the following steps 2 with the pc on the meter have him read pages 13 of this bulletin hcob 4 jan fir through the section entitled the remedy cear up any confusion handle any misunderstood words help the pc do simple demo of the theory that in is the earlier beginning or the earlier similar incident of out this is not to be clay demo nor complex keep it simple just ensure the pc gets it 3 clear exteriorization with the pc as the act of moving out of the body with or without full perception make certain hes got it demo it if necessary 4 check for having been audited after exteriorization ta should come down and fn cog vgis 5 rehab rehabilitate this condition by getting or counting the number of times exteriorized you should get fn cog vgis 6 assess the following list of int buttons do not clear the buttons first int buttons go in went in put in interiorized into something want to go in cant get in kicked out of spaces cant go in being trapped forced in pulled in if none of the int buttons read on this assessment get in suppress invalidate and misunderstood on the int button list do not omit this basic rule of assessment ref hcob 15 oct 73ra cs series 87ra nulling and fning prepared lists 7 then clear and demo only the button that reads if the pc seems disinterested or unhappy with the button that reads check false 46caution the pc may have an mu which caused particular button to read thus ensure the button is not reading on an mu and if button has read on an mu then clear it and reassess it dont give the pc wrong item or even monkey around with wrong item the above actions help you ensure getting the correct int button it is important in clearing the reading buttons that the pc understands you will be auditing times he went in or was being trapped etc and not was in or was already trapped or was stuck in etc you will be auditing the actual times the action of moving in occurred the above clearing steps are vital as the pc will not be able to do the int rd over misunderstoods or on misassessed int button to audit him over mus constitutes breach of the auditors code on the other hand do not overdo these clearing actions as you already have pc on your hands who is in trouble note if none of the int buttons read even when suppress invalidate and misunderstood are applied do not clear them and do not continue the int rundown steps 8 when the largest reading button has been cleared per step 7 take that button and run it r3ra quad triple if pc is only triple each flow is taken to full dianetic ep using the command locate time when you int button example int button with largest read forced in run fl 1 locate time when you were forced in to full dn ep fl 2 locate time when you forced another in to full dn ep fl 3 locate time when others forced others in to full dn ep fl 0 locate time when you forced yourself in to full dn ep notethe quad command wordings for each of the int buttons are listed on hcob 25 sep 781 int rd series 5 quad commands for int buttons do not ever run pc on flow zero for the first time on int triple pc can be quaded up after int handling is complete but it is never done on int handling or int repair 9 when all four flows on the reading button have each been run to full ep reassess the int button list per step 6 if another button now reads repeat steps 7 and 8 should you have persistent fn after the four flows on the first button have been run reassess the next day per step 6 and if any button then reads repeat steps 7 and 8 if on the other hand you now have an fning int button list it is safe to end off the int rundown 10 otherwise you continue to assess the int button list per step 6 and to run any reading item r3ra quad or triple per steps 7 and 8 until the entire int button list is fning on assessment 47do not overrun the int rundown see section below on vital data on int rd end phenomena caution any flow on any reading button must be run to ep in one session and the int rundown must be completed in as few sessions as possible 11 the final step which is done after the final session preferably on another later day is 2way comm session on intext ref hcob 30 may 70r int rd series 3 interiorization intensive 2way comm running int with r3ra the r3ra steps and procedure are standard except that they address the subject of interiorization expressed as any one of the buttons on the int button list note that new era dianetics preassessment is not included in the revised int rundown nor is the running of aesps see hcob 24 sep 78 ii int rd series 13 preassessment aesps and int in running the int chain or chains it is important to run the actual going in action which would be near or at the beginning of the incident thus if the pc is running an incident where he is already in ensure you check for an earlier beginning to the incident to pick up the going in type of action the questions to find an earlier beginning when running r3ra are is there an earlier beginning to this incident or does the one were running start earlier or does there seem to be an earlier starting point to this incident the earlier similar command when running r3ra is is there an earlier incident when you int button each flow must be taken to basic and the full dianetic ep of fn postulate postulate off erasure and vgis the auditor must have an excellent command of new era dianetics tech reference for new era dianetics r3ra commands and procedure is hcob 26 jun 78ra 11 ned series 6ra urgent important routine 3ra engram running b cha ins vital data on int rd end phenomena exteriorization is not the ep of the int rundown if it happens that the pc goes exterior during the rd you end off gently as in any other auditing but that is not the ep and you may have to pick him up again later and complete the int rd or handle it with the end of endless int repair rundown the ep of the int rundown is more concern or trouble with exteriorization or interiorization this is generally accomplished by auditing the pc to an fning int button list but there is another phenomenon that can occur while running int it is vital that an auditor does not miss this should it happen 48it goes like this youre auditing along and suddenly some mass discharges down comes the ta you suddenly have floating ta and thats it the pc has hit the ep if you proceed past that point youre in trouble you dont then reassess the int button list and you dont continue running quad flows even if all the flows have not yet been run on one reading button you do nothing but take your paws off the meter and gently end the session if you do otherwise you can mess up case it isnt exteriorization exteriorization could occur at the same time however we could not care less because exteriorization is not the ep of the process but at any point at which the above phenomenon occurs on the int rdmass moves off the ta comes crashing down and you cant keep the needle on the dial because the ta itself is floatingyou end off the rundown because you have the ep what has happened here is that youve blown the stuck flow of going in int sends the ta up because the person has plowed deeper into more and more mass and come out of less and less mass you have been auditing the pc on what has been for eons stuck flow of obsessively going in at any point in the auditing that stuck flow can suddenly give way it heaves in the opposite direction and the stuck flow of going in vanishes when that happens its the end of the process as that is all you want to accomplish with the int rundown if you were then to check the int button list which you do not do at this point you would find the int buttons all fning future auditing when the pc has attained the ep of int either on the above phenomenon or by reassessing the int buttons and running them on the flows to an fning int button list one should now be able to audit the pc even after exteriorization however hcob 7 mar 75 ext and ending session would still be applied warning the int rundown is major case action and should only be run when the pc is rested and in good physical shape the end of endless int repair the end of endless int repair rundown hcob 24 sep 781 int rd series 4 urgent important the end of endless int repair rundown is the superbly workable new process just developed to handle any needed int repair it resolves any int troubles that might persist even after pc has had an int rundown done totally standardly it does not replace the int rundown rather it complements it when necessary as it runs int by recalls we audit out the int engrams on the int rundown then if repair is needed the end of endless int repair rd can be used to clean it up smoothly with recalls it is the answer to overrepair of int on any pc additionally it can be used for handling int repair on clears ots and dianetic clears 49the above hcob 24 sep 78 i fully covers the purpose and use of this valuable new repair rundown summary if pc goes exterior on dianetics or any scientology auditing you must as his next session check the int buttons for read and if any read clear them and do the new vastly simplified and revised int rundown using the above cs with this done the pc can go on being audited and if repair is needed the end of endless int repair rundown is the answer these new developments and refinements give us simpler more thorough tech for resolving int than we have ever had before the way is open to more

past year i found many cases had been flubbed on researching this i found the following 1 the remedy was being used as an effort to exteriorize people people exteriorize in any normal auditing what was needed was remedy to be able to audit them thereafter without driving their tas up 2 auditors evidently skimped their hdc courses and did not know why one went to an earlier beginning or earlier

dianetic skilla dianetic auditor who cant run flubless dianetic session and get all flows down to fn studied in doubt audits in doubt and ought to be in condition of doubt until he retreads and actually reads the text and does the drills dianetics is just too easy to be flubbed after patching up many of these done in the field i became very alert to the state of training new course supervisor course has been done and is being issued obviously auditors are longer required to be starrated on new materials before they audit them this omission must be remedied at once auditor may audit materials or apply hcobs on which he has not been starrated hgc or cs may order an auditor to run process if that auditor has not been starrated on its theory and practical first as for

dianetics ep is covered in hcob 16 sep 78 postulate off equals erasure for people to goof up using these clean positive tools is inexcusable the results are there to be obtained we obtain spectacular positive results with these same materials daily wherever they are actually studied and applied please correct flubby auditing wherever you find it auditors must be checked out and drilled on new materials courses must be precisely taught people who flub must be crammed until they dont and those who still flub must be retreaded the materials when applied produce great results when they are not

use of quadruple dianetics with the introduction of quadruple dianetics the problems of how to cs it arise this rule is followed the fourth flow0must be run on all items forward from the first dianetic item ever run on the case if the pc is quad and the flow 0 reads where case has already had flows 2 and 3 run on singles one goes back and runs flow 0 on those items if it reads where case has only been run on single flow dianetics flow 1 one goes back to the first dianetic item ever run of which record can be found and does f2 f3 f0 in that order checking the command for read before running it and then verifying the f1 if you fail to quad up pc and start with the first item never run on that flow and if you suddenly begin to run quad on pc who is single or triple without picking up and running the original items which were single or triple into quad form you will stir up and bypass all the charge that was on that flow originally to suddenly begin quad without catching the pc up is to invite catastrophe as the charge bypassed will kick the pc in the teeth and hard example joe was run on single flow for six months his auditor finds new item and suddenly decides to run it quad six months worth of flow 2 flow 3 and flow 0 will now restim because it is bypassing that charge the auditors proper correction action is to indicate to the pc what has happened and catch up the missing flows on all the earlier items run that now read to cs case for quad dianetics it is best to first lay out scientology repair making sure the case is flying then list out the items already run on single and triple then get them run so that all four flows are complete on each item in sequence from first to last this includes any lx items former practice drugs or any other engram running these like dianetic items are listed in their correct sequence of former running then the missing flows are run if they read rehab step of the flows already run is not necessary this rehab of flow already run to ep is usually used only when there is question about its having gone to postulate off fn and vgis erasure 53in csing for quadruple one completes any flow of an item found that did not erase this is indicated on the item list doing the list the item list is done by the auditor in his admin time for well done time credits all former dianetic items ever run are listed and what flows

the pc is having int troubles int is handled before any other action is done the fourth flow is never suddenly introduced on int if the pc has been run on triples the fourth flow on int is then

commands are used it is never shorted because the pc did it 54thus any new era dianetics auditor to quad pcs run flows must have record of good flubless new era dianetic auditing or b must have retread under competent supervisor and c must have completed the hubbard new era dianetics graduate case supervisor course or have checked out fully on the quad issues csing quad dianetics with the above otherwise cses the same as new era dia netics it should be realized dianetics is its own field of csing this remains the same in quad dianetics promotion quad dianetics should be promoted only when you have dianetic auditors the auditors checked out and okayed to audit as above and when you can deliver ivs or vis should be available to do the progress pgms and steps upper levels when the ivs vis viis viiis or ixs are checked out as above they should use quad dianetics to handle any and all engram steps called for in general auditing that they are upper level auditors does not make it less necessary to do the above results quad dianetics including the rerun actions produces some very startling new gains well done dianetics always has produced fine results quad dianetics almost doubles the gain remedies any and all dianetic remedies and general technology remain in full use they are not changed at all only the zero flow is added in each case good luck l ron hubbard founder

ep when they were originally run if they did include them if they didnt run exclude them this does not mean you omit everything that didnt run repair while auditing this full flow dianetics you will find various chains that did not go to ep when originally run these are included and should be concluded to ep this means one has to find out if they bypassed the fn went too early jumped the chain etc usually an l3rf assessed on that faulty action will give the answer it is easy to take these old flubbed chains to ep unless you work at it too hard usually the reason they didnt is visible on the old worksheet the auditor forgot to ask for earlier beginning or jumped the chain or tried to run it twice forgetting hed run it before corny errors 58result the result of doing full flow dianetic action on case is quite spectacular the shadowy remains of somatics blow mass blows and the pc comes up shining offering ffd offering the public full flow dianetics must include the cost of fesing ff table making and cs work since it is sometimes lengthy the auditing can be remarkably brief the greatest amount of time is usually spent on the csing and the table making ffd is offered to the public in intensives as per hcob 31 may 1971r cs series 39r standard 122 hour intensive programs admin time spent on csing fesing and ff table making should be deducted from the intensive hours purchased by the pc this must be made known to the public when purchasing the service when offering ffd it should be called quadruple dianetics4 times more powerful than previous auditing cs must liaise with the dissem sec and treasury sec on selling it or hell find the org is losing money doing the csing and tables warning when doing quadruple dianetics on some cases it may be found that many chains are now

to the right keep record on your worksheet mark the pcs name and date on it mark what list it is on the ws with time it remains in the folder stapled to the ws read the question on the list note if it reads do not read it while looking at the pc do not read it to yourself and then say it while looking at the pc these are the l10 actions and are called method 6 not method 3 it is more important to see the pcs cans than his face as can fiddle can fake or upset reads tr 1 must be good so the pc clearly hears it you are looking for an instant read that occurs at the end of the exact last syllable of the question if it does not read mark the list x if the list is being done through an fn and the fn just continues mark the question fn 70if the question reads do not say that reads mark the read at once tick sf f lf lfbd rs transfer the number of the q to the ws and look expectantly at the pc you can repeat the q by just saying it again if pc doesnt begin to talk he has probably already begun to answer as the q was live in his bank as noted by the meter take down the pcs remarks in shortened form on the ws note any ta changes on the ws if the pcs answer results in an fn cog vgis sometimes follow gis always accompany real fn mark it rapidly on the ws and say thank you i would like to indicate your needle is floating do not wait endlessly for the pc to say more if you do he will go into doubt and find more also do not chop what he is saying both are tr errors that are very bad if there is fn at the first pause that looks like the pc thinks he has said it ask for an earlier similar whatever the question concerned do not change the q do not fail to repeat what the question is was there an earlier similar restimulation of rejected affinity this is the part of it you do not leave such question merely clean it does not matter now if you look at the pc when you say it or not but you can look at the pc when you say it the pc will answer if he comes to looks like he thinks he said it and fn you ask the same q as above you ask this q was there an earlier similar until you finally get an fn and gis you indicate the fn that is the last of that particular question you mark fn on the list and call the next question on the list you call this and other questions without looking at the pc those that do not read you x as out the next question that reads you mark it on the list transfer the question number to the ws take the pcs answer follow the above procedure as needed until you get an fn and gis for the question ack indicate and return to the mimeoed list you keep this up until you have done the whole list in this fashion if you got read on the list question but the pc volunteers some answer to an unreading question do not take it up just ack and carry on with your mimeoed list believe your meter do not take up things that dont read dont get hunches dont let the pc run his own case by answering nonreading items and then the auditor taking them up also dont let pc fiddle the cans to get false read or to obscure real one very rare but these two actions have happened big win if halfway down prepared list the last part not yet done the pc on some question gets wide fn big cog vgis the auditor is justified in calling the list complete and going to the next cs action or ending the session except in the case 71where an fning list is csed for eg cs 53rl the auditor does not violate cs series 20 persistent fn if he is intending to fn the list and the pc is on big win the auditor would end off let the pc have his win and then in another later session continue with the list there are two reasons for thisone the fn will usually just persist and cant be read through and further action will tend to invalidate the win the auditor can also carry on to the end of the prepared list if he thinks there may be something else on it if it does not violate cs series 20 persistent fn gf and method 3 when gf is taken up method 3 item by item one at time one ends it at the first fn reference hcob 8 dec 78 ii green form and expanded green form 40rd use of if the auditor were to continue it can occur that the ta will go suddenly high the pc feels he is being repaired that the clearing up of the first item on the gf handled it and protests it is the protest that sends the ta up thus gf is best done by method 5 once through for reads then the reads handled l1c l3rf l7 and other such lists are best done method 3 the above steps and actions are exactly how you do auditing by list today any earlier data contrary to this is canceled only 2 points changewe fn everything that reads by or process to handle l3rf requires processes not to get an fn or else check for false read if the pc shows manifestations of this and we never tell the pc that it read or didnt read thus putting his attention on the meter we still indicate fns to the pc as form of completion l1c and method 3 are not used on high or very low tas to get them down or up the purpose of these lists is to clean up bypassed charge an auditor also indicates when he has finished with the list an auditor should dummy drill this action both on doll and bullbait the action is

medicines seldom runs on any other type of engram seldom goes backtrack well and is subject to somatic emotional and perceptic shutoffs making any other type of dianetic running vain activity drugs since 1962 have been in very widespread use before then they were rare worldwide spread of drugs occurred large percentage of people became and are drug takers 73by drugs to mention few are meanttranquilizers opium cocaine mari juana peyote amphetamine and the psychiatrists gifts to man lsd and angel dust which are the worst any medical drugs are included drugs are drugs there are thousands of trade names and slang terms for these drugs alcohol is included as drug and receives the same treatment in auditing by alcohol to mention few is meant whiskey beer wine vodka rum gin etc in other words any fermented or distilled liquor or drink of any kind or fumes of such with some percentage of alcohol content drugs are supposed to do wonderful things but all they really do is ruin the person even someone off drugs for years still has blank periods the abilities to concentrate or to balance are injured the moral part of it has nothing to do with auditing the facts are that people who have been on drugs can be liability until the condition is handled in auditing b former drug user is resistive case that does not make stable gains until the condition is handled c auditing is the only successful means ever developed for handling drug damage drug engrams people who have been on drugs are sometimes afraid of running engrams in fact it is almost way to detect druggie the drugs particularly lsd and even sometimes antibiotics or other medicines to which the person has an allergy can turn on whole track pictures violently these tend to overwhelm the person and make him feel crazy some of these people are afraid to confront the bank again if person doesnt like dianetics and doesnt want to be run on engrams it is necessary to put him through the hard trs course and objectives if dianetics has been run but poorly it should of course be repaired fully with an l3rf list used to correct dianetic errors but if the person still flinches the hard trs course and objectives successfully completed will handle those on drugs objective processes are numerous it may be necessary to run these on person still on drugs and even put the person through hard trs course to get the person off drugs doing this usually avoids the painful withdrawal symptoms particularly present in coming off heroin or psychiatric treatment drugs note some persons have been put on some therapeutic drug by an mdsuch as insulin and possibly should remain on it until well advanced into auditing but these are not the usual drug it is up to the pc the auditor and the doctor what should be done in such cases tranquilizers are not acceptable however done first drugs are done first 74why because drugs make resistive case other dianetic actions and scien tology as well will get loses if drugs are not handled first any current dianetic case failures are from flubby dianetic auditing or the person has been on drugs or alcohol which were not handled by dianetics it hasnt harmed anyone to omit drug handling but it made it hard or impossible to get stable case gain thus any dianetic pc who has had drug handling omitted must be run on drugs as soon as possible before more audit ing is given i repeat drugs or alcohol in most instances make resistive case so the point must be handled before the case will attain and hold case gain any pc who is not making it in auditing should be checked for drug or alcohol history discovery in investigating series of cases who were not making it i found in each one that the person had been on drugs or alcohol and that drugs or the alcohol had not been run out drug data was not covered fully enough in the dianetics pack only prior assess ment to drugs was given thus i have found several dianetic pcs were only run on the prior assessment to drugs this is not good enough as it is only partial handling full drug rundown here is the full new era dianetics drug rundown 0 the original assessment sheet ask the pc each question on the original

have been listed on the original assessment sheet at this point choose the best reading drug alcohol or medicine from the original assessment sheet and run it out r3ra quad narrative for example return to the time you took whiskey and tell when you are there you do not check interest on drug items run out each reading drug alcohol or medicine on the drug list in order of read by r3ra quad narrative first otherwise you can end up spinning the pc way down the track in running narrative on this lifetime drug medicine or alcohol individual items you will find that it is easier to do if you run earlier beginning and earlier incident rather than attempt to limit him to the first this lifetime incident he comes up with as there will usually be more than one incident when he took whiskey for example so you always ask earlier beginning but if it is necessary you ask earlier incident with the question is there an earlier incident when you took whiskey pcs commonly tend to wind up way back down the whole track at this stage of their auditing and that is not what youre aiming for here either what youre interested in is this lifetime this body but this doesnt mean you dont run track on the drug rundown just dont push it and never insist the pc run any type of chain when he says theres nothing there when all reading drugs medicines alcohols on the list have been run to ep by r3ra narrative quad go on to the next step 7 preassessment on each reading drug medicine or alcohol taken in this lifetime choose the best reading drug alcohol or medicine from the original assessment sheet and do preassessment on it are preassessment item connected with taking the drug medicine or alcohol is the preassessment question b take the best reading preassessment item off the preassessment and ask the pc what best reading preassessment item are connected with taking the drug medicine or alcohol this is the running item list question for that particular drug you write this question at the top of the page and write down exactly what the pc said noting any read that occurred when he said it 76c take up the best reading running item make sure you noted reads as the pc gave you the items and run it r3ra quad do not check interest on drug items d handle all reading running items found in step b in order of read with r3ra quad using that same original drug item repeat step

reading but there are some unrun original items on the list null with suppress and invalidate buttons h run any now reading items with steps to fb i use up the whole list of drugs in this way doing the preassessment and steps b to h on all reading drugs reassess the drug list handle per above instructions any drug which now reads this is done until the entire drug list fns when called note if during the rundown the pc thinks of other drugs he has taken in this lifetime add them to the original list with their reads noted and handle them in turn according to size of read ensuring you run them r3ra quad narrative first 8 the prior assessment using the drug list obtained on the original assessment take up the largest reading drug medicine or alcohol ask the pc the following preassessment question prior to taking the best reading drug medicine or alcohol were there preassessment item b take the best reading preassessment item and ask what preassessment item did you have prior to taking the drug medicine or alcohol c use full preassessment steps and run out all reading running items r3ra quad d reassess any remaining unrun items found in step b to see if they now read if they do run them also check for any more items the pc has to add to the list and mark down their reads as the pc gives them repeat above steps on any items that now read f when there are more items to add and more items reading but there are some unrun items on the list null with suppress and invalidate buttons g run any now reading items r3ra quad 77h reassess the preassessment list using the drug medicine or alcohol in step follow remaining steps until all reading items are taken to ep and there are further reads on reassessment of the preassessment list i take up the next best reading drug medicine or alcohol from step repeat steps b to i the above prior assessment steps are done on each drug medicine or alcohol that has read they are handled in order of largest read 9 more objectives the final step of the drug rundown when all above steps are fully complete is to run another set of objectives on the pc these are sop 8c b op pro by dup run in that order each to its complete ep this is done to bring the pc fully into present time and it will be present time which he is now far better able to confront _______ this completes the drug rundown the sweat out program

false have been applied to the int button list one does not do an int rundown on the pc as it is unnecessary and classifies as running an unreading item when this test is omitted you get an unnecessary int rd being done on pc this will eventually have to be repaired flubbed r3ra when the auditor does not do flubless auditing errors occur in the auditing itself these will hang up an int rd overrun it usually happens that an int rd is overrun the ep is reached on flow 2 let us say the auditor keeps on going past the win this will hang up the rundown 79one of the ways an overrun occurs is the pc goes exterior during it yet the auditor keeps on another way is pc has big cog big win auditor keeps going on with the rd reason for errors the int rd is simple and precise remedy which stabilizes pc after exter iorizing and permits him to be further audited when pc exteriorizes in session it is the end phenomena for that process or action one gently ends off in any case if the pc has not had an interiorization run down it is vital in his next session to check int as above as the first action all manner of physical and emotional upsets can result including high ta if this step is omitted int must be checked as the next action after the fact of the pcs first exteriorization other auditing is to be done before int is handled fully or proves to be uncharged upon checking one reason unnecessary int rds get done is that the registrar sells one that makes the reg cs so the cs and auditor run it maybe it wasnt needed so if it wasnt needed it will eventually have to be repaired headaches headaches are symptom not every headache is of needed or an incorrect int rd correction drill the following is the correction drill for an int rd ninety percent of the pcs run on

auditors code 5 must have completed the starrate checkouts per int rd series 14 6 must do this drill on doll until he is flawless then he can be trusted to do an int rd correction this is the drill written by class xii auditor for use on flag 80drillintext repair 1 failed intext rd repair date to blowlocate to blow 1 by cs or prepared list read int appears overrun 2 auditor were going to take look at the subject of going into things and your int rd 3 auditor what was the first time in your auditing that you were willing to go into things 4 auditor establishes by pc answer to above and any further 2wc if flat point exists in or as result of auditing or training b the pc feels the int rd is unflat c the pc has misunderstoods on the rd or d the pc never had any trouble with going in and out of things or being audited after exterior the pc and auditor are satisfied with what they establish above 5 if flat point auditor establishes what the point was if b unflat the auditor does an int rd correction list or l3rf if needed if it does turn out that the int rd was overrun or unnecessary the auditor proceeds per this drill if c understoods the auditor clears them up with the pc and then finds out if it was overrun unflat or unnecessary and handles per this drill if d unnecessary the auditor indicates it was an unnecessary action and gets an fn 6 the int rd was overrun and the flat point has been established per step 5 the auditor tells the pc were going to date that point in years months etc ago until something blows offsome mass or energy etc i want you to tell as soon as that happens alright 7 if the pc is confused about blow the auditor can do demo by putting his hand on the pcs arm and taking it away suddenly 8 when the pc understands whats expected of him the auditor establishes the order of magnitude by asking the pc was it years or months ago 9 the auditor gets the years months days hours minutes seconds and fractions of seconds ago to point when something blows and fns if the pc gives up on this only then does the auditor meter date the flat point to blowfn 10 if big bd occurs and the auditor suspects blow but the pc will not originate it the auditor can ask the pc if it blew 11 if blow occurs the auditor verifies each part of the date and corrects where necessary to blowfn if still blowfn the auditor then checks for an earlier flat point if there is one the auditor dates that point to blowfn if still blowfn the auditor does an l3rf on your int rd and handles fully 12 when the date has gone to blowfn and the fn has been indicated the auditor tells the pc now were going to spot the exact location where that flat point occurred until something blows off i want you to tell when that happens alright the auditor is getting the past physical universe location 13 the auditor clears the words stars planet galaxy location point if this is the first time datelocate is being done on the pc 14 when the pc understands whats expected of him the auditor begins the locate steps 8115 the auditor says point to that location the pc points with his finger until he is satisfied he has the exact direction then the auditor goes down the rest of the steps to blowfn distance exact what galaxy what star what planet what country what city what street what house position on street what room distance from front of house where in the room how far from each wall how far off the floor how far from the ceiling note this step is not rote use the questions that apply for example if it occurred next door you wouldnt ask what galaxy etc 16 if while locating the pc starts running the incident or gives too much scene the auditor has the pc point again then continues from where he left off on the locate steps 17 if at some point on these steps the location turns out to be in the middle of the ocean or in field etc the auditor uses available landmarks or reference points to get the location ie distance from nearest point of land or distance from the big rock down to blowfn 18 if blowfn the auditor verifies each part of the locate step and corrects any necessary to blowfn 19 if the auditor suspects blow but the pc doesnt originate it the auditor asks did something blow if the auditor suspects hes gone past blow he can check did it blow previously if so and fn the auditor rehabs by asking the pc how long ago that happened and gets the fn 20 if blow after verifying the location or after checking for an earlier location blow the auditor then has to do an l3rf on your int rd and handle fully note blow is definite manifestation and the pc must say something blew or it disappeared or its gone or it vanished not i feel lighter 82important the datelocate steps must not be done robotically one has to understand the mechanics of how its done and why if the pc says two years ago on dating one doesnt then ask what galaxy on the locate step as of course its this one or what star etc either if you start asking what galaxy on an incident on earth the pc is thrown back track if it happened outside town in the open you wouldnt ask what city house or street or room either on dating its ago or it is an actual date when the pc has it the auditor doesnt then alteris it in sequence found by yearsmonthsdayshours minutes seconds and fractions one doesnt then call it by day year month as it tangles the pc its called back in the same order and in dating one calls the date found back to the pc if there was instant blow while it was being found it usually blows on the call of it after its known and in locating the same thing occurs if blow and it seems correct then the location is called back to the pc the essence of the drill is to bring pc to pt by erasing the date by spotting and the location by spotting as the pc is out of pt fixed by both date and location if the theory is not understood nobody could do it rotely this is highly precise action to be done smoothly with good trs its results are phenomenal l ron hubbard founder lrhnt jhk jm

someone is suppressed he becomes potential trouble source there are numerous hcobs and pls on this subject all of them are true obser vations and predictions the cause of rollercoaster is pts rollercoaster means slump after gain pcs who do not hold their gains are pts s and ds for search and discovery was the earlier approach these are still valid and 3 sds as rundown is used in the pts rundown without change now with the pts rundown this common and all too frequent case condition can be handled who does it there are actually three pts handlings 1 this is essentially an ethics action done by the ethics officer its substance is contained in board policy letter 5 apr 72rc issue i pts type handling it is usually the first step at any sign of trouble it is not an audited action it is an interview the pts person is given program in order to handle the scene 902 this is the pts rundown audited as covered in this hcob in hcob 20 jan 72r pts rd addition and in hcob 3 jun 72ra it is done by an auditor in regular session as described in these hcobs it can be done by class iv grads who are also hnedas hgc okay to audits for an auditor who is not hneda class iv grad okay to audit hgc by com petent interneship to attempt pts rundown would be very risky for the pc as it needs exact listing exact trs exact metering exact code keeping and very honest auditing and competent csing 3 the third handling is the suppressed person rundown hcob 29 dec 78 and hcob 30 dec 78rthe suppressed person rd problems processes it is done by qualified auditor in regular session essentially it handles the other person connected to the pc therefore what you have here is three stages of handling ptsness the first above the interview cools off the scene and in many cases that is that but when the pc is further affected by the connection and rollercoasters he is given the audited rundown as in 2 above this usually handles the case of ptsness as case but there sometimes remains another person the sp person or group and its relationship in the real universe to the pc and this is handled with 3 above clears ots and dianetic clears the dianetic steps of the pts rundown audited are not run on clears ots or dianetic clears ref hcob 12 sep 78 dianetics forbidden on clears and ots clears ots and dianetic clears can of course be given the interview step 1 above and can be given the suppressed person rundown as in 3 above as neither contains any handling of engrams development early discovery and development of the pts theory is extensively covered the recent wrapup came about through my ot research in november 1971 the principle breakthrough was realizing one should not invalidate having known certain people before this is similar to the past life discovery in 1950 some people thinking this was unpopular frowned on it some others were only famous characters so flagrantly that past lives were easily invalidated but people who dont go past track in dianetics dont recover even running them as imaginary as in science of survival advices suddenly breaks through for stalled dianetic case in this same way with young men and girls using i knew you when you were for 2d advantage tended to invalidate having known certain individuals before this life but now it turns out that the only pts situation that is serious and lasting and can cause rollercoaster comes from having known the person before this life possibly in the last life or earlier lives one knew persons before that life too this however shows up in the 3 sds 91breakdown there are only four points of breakdown of the pts rundown 1 improperly audited auditor not able to always do correct list trs out meter ing out poor r3ra just plain untrained or not totally familiar with this rundown 2 pc not completely set up like has ta trouble but cs 53 done is change case but exgf 40rd done old auditing not repaired by proper programing or pc too tired or too ill for the r3ra 3 the rundown not fully and completely done but chopped or left incomplete pc will still rollercoaster 4 people who cant run engramswhich means druggie who hasnt had full drug rundown there is nothing especially tricky about the auditing of the pts rundown except that all auditing should be of flubless quality and when the pts rd is flubbed by bad lists or poor r3ra or outtrs or poor metering it really is mess the rd is so powerful that errors in csing and auditing it are especially rough currently sick pcs should not be run on the pts rundown as standard practice it is what they need but you can easily overwhelm sick pc with engram running the time to run pts rd is when the pc is set up and when it is noted the pc rollercoasters not when he collapses with temperature rollercoaster can also be caused by bad interiorization rd or int repair outlists bypassed charge of other descriptions these should be gotten rid of before pts rd is attempted the prerequisites for pts rd are covered in 2 and 4 above it is not restricted to ex dn but is separate rd developed before ex dn behavior of rd valence shifts occur rapidly and frequently in pts rds and should be noted on the worksheet the r3ra can sometimes be bit of long haul on basic incident be sure with an l3rf but get the postulate off the basic matter how hard you have to work at it in the pts rd incidents can develop missing pieces can appear whole new slant can occur on the subject when one goes to f2 after finishing f1 chronic somatics are likely to appear and be handled on this rundown and case conditions not previously remedied by other means can be remedied by this rundown end phenomena there is point where the pc is absolutely sure he knew the person before this life this is not the ep pc can exteriorize on this rd that is not the ep but can require an int rd if none has been done before the ep is pc who is getting and keeping case gains and never again rollercoasters 92flows you cannot use flow 1 as any old direction to or from pc to do this fouls it up flow 1 is to the pc flow 2 is pc to the person or place flow 3 is the person or place to others flow 0 is the pc to himself because of the person or place if you did f1 r3ra as locate time you knew you might get to the pc pc to the person or the person to others you would not get clean motivator f1 this would leave the pts chain partially run this is also true of the ruds redos if the pc does not recover then reasons for failure 1 to 4 above should be checked into then the lists and r3ra should be handled with l4bra and l3rf then an overlooked item or person or place should be scouted for and handled there is question of the validity of the rundown it might have missed true love might have been passed over as unlikely but such obsessive attraction is always based on having known and probably done in the other person then the true ep will be attained where it only appeared to be before summary of references here are the issues that directly cover the

preassessment aesps and int almost all the errors in an interiorization rundown are dianetic errors most are very ordinary even corny it is vital to correct an int rd error as first action there is one int rd error that is not purely dianetic error and that is the error of doing anything else at all before an int rd is done properly or an int rd error is fully corrected the int rd error may be that the int button run did not read on the meter or read only because of an mu on the word yet was run hcob 4 jan 71r this classifies as running an unreading item common int error is that the pc is not cleared on the concept of interiorization and the words and commands so he is being audited over misunderstoods or the int rd could have been overrun the ep is reached on f2 let us say the auditor keeps on going past the win this will hang up the rundown one of the ways an overrun occurs is the pc goes exterior during it yet the auditor keeps on another way is pc has big cog big win auditor keeps going on with the rd when pc is exteriorized by auditing and is then audited further without being given an interiorization rundown his ta will go high or low and he may be very upset heavy masses may come in and he may also get ill int rd errors also may go back to earlier dianetic errors number of unflat incidents invite the overrun of these if they also occur on dianetic chain to clean up balledup int rd chain or incident one may have to find and clean up the dianetic error it is sitting on during the cleanup of the int rd error int rd errors goofs etc are handled by using an int rd correction list re vised hcob 29 oct 71ra 98this must be excellently metered so that the original error is not further com pounded by misassessment of the correction list and falsely reading item taken up auditors who cant run ordinary r3ra with great success should not be let near an interiorization rd as their lack of smoothness in handling dianetics will wreck the int rd auditors who

been run twice 7 cs has hopefully kept on getting the pc audited without detecting the real reason as flubbed int rd and without getting the int rd and any repair fully fesed percentages the percent of misrun int rds is high many being unnecessary or overrun the liability of leaving them unrepaired is high reasons for high ta are averaging out close to 100 as an unrun or flubbed and unrepaired

he orders the end of endless int repair rd hcob 24 sep 781 int rd series 4 this should totally handle int or if the cs is in doubt about how to handle and gets into mess trying to repair chains he can cut directly onto the end of endless int repair rundown and he will get someplace there is real trick to either running correct int rd or repairing flubbed one the whole clue is whether or not the auditor can audit plain ordinary garden variety r3ra and is able to read meter so when any auditor audits pc past exterior and the pcs ta goes high he should be checked out fully on the int rd checksheet so he wont continue to commit the error and when anyone is going to run an int rd he must be an expert new era dianetics auditor and class iv graduate b be starrated on all the int rd series c be able to read meter flublessly and when any cs is confronted with high tas or low tas and doesnt handle at once by getting an int rd properly run or properly repaired he must be rechecked on the new era dianetics pack and the int rd pack dn cs 1 very careful dianetic cs 1 must be done on previously unindoctrinated pc before he is run on an int rd otherwise its all too new cs 1 isnt auditing the pc who cant do what the auditor says or cant correct an erroneous action is lost 100a fully safe pc would be one who when he goes ext in auditing is made to do the hubbard new era dianetics course at once before he even gets any ruds put in and not audited again until he is hubbard new era dianetics auditor hed be pc who was relatively safe pc who does what an inexpert auditor says without question can really get fouled up uneducated pcs require really flawless topnotch auditors the auditor who can audit an uneducated pc is jewel he really has to know his business because the pc does whatever he says and if he says wrongly then there goes the session ever notice pc corrections in worksheet i think you bypassed an fn this feels overrun i had grade 1 last year such auditors are not fully enough trained to handle wholly green pcs simplicity honest fellows its as easy to run an int rd as it is to run an ear pain it isnt even mysterious or tough it is only very

endless int repair rd the int rundown is not to be sold or passed off as method of exteriorizing pc nor is the end of endless int repair rundown this is very important it is general auditing on usual dianetics and scientology actions that brings about exteriorization when the pc goes or is found to be exterior and int proves to be charged on checking one then orders the interiorization rundown otherwise the ta will behave the rundown is remedy used after exteriorization has oc curred by reason of general auditing anxiety to get exterior will prompt pc to buy and registrar to sell an interiori zation rundown it is in effect just more auditing as far as the registrar is concerned when pc has gone exterior the registrar can insist on his buying enough hours for the remedy the int rundown stabilizes the exteriorization and makes it possible to audit the pc further 105disability if an auditor cant smoothly audit rundown as simple as an int rundown then he is exposed as being unable to run standard dianetics and should be cleared of his misunderstoods and overts and retrained the only real trouble one gets into on an int rundown stems from the inability of the auditor to run smooth good tred r3ra session pcs are not hard to run on it cs wins cs cannot win at all if he is continually having to make up for flubby auditing by the auditor therefore the cs must be very sure his auditors are fully checked out on things they are to run before running them if there is qual staff training officer or cramming cs can fully afford to do the training and cramming himself

79 word clearing series 59ra clearing words word clearing series 46rb was the first hcob which gave the full and correct use and handling of m9 it has been revised here to include developments on how one goes about clearing word this revision is on page 133 section 7 clear the word there are five other changes all minor earlier writeups on this subject not by myself stated that the persons misu was that word on which he stumbled this is not the case it is only occasionally the word on which he stumbles that is misunderstood usually as was covered long since in study tech it is the earlier word or symbol which has caused the stumble or twitch or blink or omit or mispronunciation or what have you historical method 9 word clearing was first developed in pilot project which sought to teach people to read who were not reading in their native tongue the first versions of m9 were not correctly written up but the technology nevertheless began to spread in use it was found that not only nonenglish students didnt know what they were reading but as the educational standards of the culture deteriorated it was found that people reading in their native tongue could benefit with the use of m9 it was then found that college students could not get through m9 and the latest survey has demonstrated that 31 school teachers taken at random throughout the school systems flunked m9 on their common reading materials what has apparently happened here is that we have drifted down in literacy to point where the culture cant read or hear in technical culture such as this one should not ask further why it is failing because there are not enough supervisors to personally m9 all the people on the planet much less medium size class it has to be done on turnabout basis by the students themselves this caused difficulty with m9 because one was asking students who couldnt read to understand how to do the method 9 which would find the things which prevented them from reading here again we have the chicken and egg problem therefore the procedure has been demonstrated in picture book which will be issued in due time as part of special course this picture book shows the student how to m9 another student and he can after being drilled by the supervisor on the picture book so this has also been solved m9 is probably the top key method of word clearing today you would be utterly amazed to find somebody who habitually reads western stories cannot pass an m9 on them he sees he mounted his roan type of horse and he understands from this 128he roamed around the mountains he has become so accustomed to notising his inability to understand what he is reading that he thinks it is ordinary isnt that the way everybody reads m9 brings it home forcefully to him that he really doesnt understand what he is reading this is not why one uses it one uses it to produce somebody who can read but like one of the english teachers who was m9ed on his own text although he may begin with hostile protest that of course he knows what he is reading he soon gets into the real reality of it and sees where he is at his willingness to continue then has already been secured it will be found that the simple things are the main things on which he stumbles thus m9ing is usually preceded by m8 as covered in the new basic comprehensive reading course this shows him by picture book how to use dictionary and gets him to define the simple words of the language commas semicolons even capital letters will be found to be commonly misunderstood the usefulness of m9 has gone then from way of spotting the points where foreign language student is falling down to detecting and handling the professors and the rest of the culture it is an extremely important method of word clearing and should be learned very well how to learn method 9 method 9 word clearing is way of finding the words person doesnt under stand in book or other written material by having him read it aloud to the word clearer it is very simple and precise and it can be done by students on one another with great success as well as by professional word clearer method 9 does not require expertise and it does not require meter as many other methods of word clearing do method 2 word clearing is very similar to method 9 but it requires the use of meter to pick up the misunderstoods the virtue of method 9 is that while it is very thorough and effective it is not restricted in use to those who can operate meter and who have other expertise needed for method 2 it can therefore be learned very easily and used very broadly to teach m9 the supervisor gets the student through the picture book version of m9 which will be issued in due time as part of special course and drills him so that he can do method 9 word clearing and he can m9 other students one can also learn how to do it all by himself by going through this picture book and this hcob misunderstood words student when reading by himself often does not know he has gone past understood words but whenever he does go by misunderstood words he will have trouble with what he is reading misunderstood word keeps person from duplicating what the written materials actually say it causes the communication formula to go out word can be misunderstood in many different ways and it is important that these different types of misunderstoods are known to the person doing method 9 word can be misunderstood because of false totally wrong definition an incorrect definition an incomplete definition an unsuitable definition homonymic one word which has two or more distinctly separate meanings definition substitute synonyma word which has similar but not the same meaning definition omitted definition rejected by the person himself usually due to false datum definition or an invented by the person himself usually due to false datum defini tion this is covered more fully on hcob 17 jut 79 issue i the misunderstood word defined 129if person has habitually gone past many many misunderstood words in his reading or his education which most everybody in this present culture has not only will his ability to read be lowered but also his intelligence what he himself writes and says wont be understood what he reads and hears he wont understand and he will be out of communication the probability is that he will have sunk back to the first dynamic the world will look like very peculiar place to him he will feel that he is not understood how true and life will look bit miserable to him he can even appear to others to be criminal at best he will become sort of robot or zombie so you see it is very important to clear misunderstood words lack of the ability to communicate probably underlies the causes for the current drug culture you will be amazed that somebody who appears to be criminal idiot all of sudden begins to look comparatively like genius after he has been m9ed why method 9 works student who understands all the words on the page he is reading will be able to read the page aloud perfectly he will feel bright and alert and will fully understand what he reads but when student passes word or symbol he doesnt understand the misunderstood causes an interruption of his voice or physical beingness his voice may change or he may stumble on word or make face or squint his eyes or react in some other way this is easy to understand if you remember that person can go blank after he passes word or symbol he doesnt understand he may make mistake in his reading right there at the point of the misunderstood or he may continue reading past the misunderstood and make mistake on later word or symbol he will feel duller and he will try to make up for the dull feeling by reading with more effort this will always be expressed by nonoptimum action of some kind which must be noted and handled at once by the word clearer nonoptimum reaction is anything the student does besides read the page easily naturally and perfectly examples of some of the nonoptimum reactions that may show up are 1 student adding word or leaving out word or changing word in the sentence he is reading 2 student stumbling on word or saying it incorrectly 3 student pausing or reading more slowly 4 student frowning or looking uncertain 5 student going stiff or tensing body part such as squinting his eyes or tightening the grip of his hands or biting his lip or some other physical reaction 6 student reading with effort 7 student reading with glib robotic attitude which is how he gets after he has been forced to read correctly by someone who doesnt know anything about misus other manifestations can occur note that the above is not complete list of reactions but is intended to give an idea of what to look for in all fairness one can stumble when reading if he is trying to read in dim light or he is having eye trouble or the print or handwriting or pencilled corrections in the text are very hard to make out thus it is necessary to do m9 word clearing only in bright light and if the fellow is supposed to be wearing glasses he should be wearing glasses and the material being m9ed must not contain smudges and 130deletions itself all possible reasons why he cannot see the text and unclear text must be removed otherwise the student will simply say he couldnt see it or the light was bad or some other wrong why anytime the person makes an error in his reading or reacts in some nonoptimum way misunderstood will always be found just before that point or sometimes at that point itself example the student is reading the page aloud he reads raymond walked home slowly and thoughtfully then he frowns the other student who is m9ing him says thats it is there some word or symbol there that you didnt understand if the student wonders why he was stopped the word clearer tells him what reaction he noticed the student looks over what he has read he feels uncertain about the word slowly he tells this to the word clearer and the word slowly is looked up in the dictionary and used in sentences until the student fully understands it when the word that was misunderstood is located and cleared the student will brighten up and will begin reading clearly and correctly once again the glib student glibness is often trained into students by the current educational methods used in schools the student is drilled to suppress or go by misunderstood words and to robotically answer back with what the book says if he can do this he is said to be good student and good reader with this method students understanding of what he has read is actually considered to be separate from the act of reading if the educators bother with com prehension at all it is only to measure memorization not understanding in todays schools students are actually instructed to go right on past words they dont understand to figure out how to say them and to continue reading whether they understand the text or not one textbook even advises if you find hard word read it as best you can and continue to read students are expressly drilled to suppress reactions such as mispronouncing words substituting one word for another inserting extra words repeating words and omitting words these reactions indicate misunder stoods have been bypassed but under heavy drilling student can learn to become robotic enough to suppress even these reactions and read on leaving misunderstoods piled up behind him in all fairness his teachers were not just trying to victimize him the discovery of the effects of misunderstood word and the reasons for such stumbles had not been discovered teachers did not know about them thus they invented various drills to force the student not to make these comprehension errors they did not have the tech or even know what caused these manifestations you have the reasons for them in method 9 and in study tech you can spot glib student on method 9 because he sounds and looks robotic when he reads one step to take on such glib student is to ask him if he has ever been taught to suppress reactions on words which when he read them he did not understand one is asking him to take the suppress off he will tell you immediately that he has been when this is true and some emotional reaction can occur one simply lets him talk about it until the charge seems to be off of it and then gets him to start his m9ing again some of it may be left of course but he will gradually get into it and become more honest and more there he thinks of course when youre m9ing him that you simply want him to utter certain sounds this is what he has been trained to expect if he is supposed to read aloud he is supposed to utter certain sounds these sounds of course are meaningless to him but that doesnt matter previously his whole purpose and training pattern in reading aloud was narrowed into getting passed so it may be necessary for the supervisor to take up why he is being m9ed but even though he is reading like robot and suppressing everything you will be able to see the 131suppression deepen when he hits the really big misus he reads them even more robotically than he does the other parts of the text so these too can be detected as soon as he has found few of these things out and found out what you are trying to do he will begin to respond much more readily with m9 method 9 on common reading materials will show up students lack of reading comprehension and show up his misunderstoods so that he can really see it for himself it may be an entirely new idea to him that written pages and sound waves communicate something another method an extreme one of handling the extensively mistrained glib student is to get him to read paragraph and then employing method known as clay table get him to demonstrate it he wont be able to do so furthermore he will realize he isnt able to do so it was just sounds method 9 on common reading materials to do method 9 on common reading materials the student chooses paperback book or something that he reads for his own pleasure and he reads it aloud to the word clearer if he cannot read it perfectly it is because he has gone by misunderstood words at first it may not be real to the student that he has misunderstood words but after he has found and cleared number of them using method 9 the student will realize that he does have misunderstood words and that his misunderstoods are getting in the way of his ability to read when the student reaches the point of realizing that he does actually have misunderstood words on the materials he commonly reads for his own pleasure he becomes very willing to find his own misunderstood words and he can usually do so easily method 9 of common reading materials can be ended at this point the student is now much more aware of and able to find and handle his own misunderstoods and he is on his way toward reading naturally correctly and with understanding how to do method 9 1 student and word clearer sit across from each other the student and the word clearer sit across from each other at table or desk each person has his own copy of the text to be word cleared the word clearer must be able to see the student and the page in front of him at the same time 2 dictionaries are available good simple english language dictionary and any other dictionaries the student may need are available above all things do not use what is called dinky dictionary this is different than simple wellexpressed dictionary dinky diction ary is what you commonly get off the paperback racks in drug stores it quite often defines word as word b and then defines word b as word it also omits all the alternative definitions and all the technical definitions always have to hand at least in the classroom the most extensive and voluminous set of dictionaries anybody ever heard of on all the subjects ever heard of under the sun plus any encyclopedias that you can round up 3 student recognition of misunderstoods before the student starts reading he should be told that if he sees word he doesnt know the meaning of he should stop and look the word up and clear it instead of going on past it and the student should be encouraged to find and clear misunder stood words himself m9 brings about the ability to do this so that the student will find and clear his own misunderstoods in future the word clearer on m9 would never prevent the student from clearing word that the student recognizes as misunderstood 132correctly done m9 will bring about the ability of the student to find and clear his own misunderstoods if you dont want to spend ten years m9ing one page it is best to get him through method 8 on simple english words this will be part of special course which will greatly improve someones level of literacy 4 student reads the text aloud to the word clearer the student reads the text aloud to the word clearer he is not on the meter while the student reads the word clearer follows his own copy of the same text watches the student and listens to him the word clearer must be very alert and see or hear any nonoptimum reactions of the student while he is reading 5 nonoptimum reaction equals misunderstood word nonoptimum reaction by the student to what he is reading is the clue to the word clearer that the student has encountered misunderstood word the word clearer and student must now locate the exact misunderstood word or symbol it will be found just before or sometimes at the point the nonoptimum reaction occurred 6 find the misunderstood if it is not obvious to the student that he has reacted and he just continues reading the word clearer says thats it is there some word or symbol there that you didnt understand it is the duty of the word clearer to steer the student to the misunderstood it is either at the point of the nonoptimum reaction or before it the point is that the student must be steered onto it and it then is looked up the student may be able to spot his misunderstood word right away and tell the word clearer what it is or he may have difficulty finding it and the word clearer will have to help him find it the word clearer helps the student by getting him to look earlier and earlier in the text from the point where he reacted until the misunderstood word is found the word clearer can also spotcheck the student spotchecking means choosing words from the text the student has already read and checking with him to see if he knows the definitions of those words if the student is uncertain about any word or gives wrong definition then that word is taken up and cleared in the dictionary 7 clear the word once the misunderstood is found it must be fully cleared in the dictionary the person will be hung up on the definition of the word as it is used in the context of what is being word cleared which will not necessarily be the first definition given in the dictionary to try and clear any other definition before clearing the one he is stuck in would cause him to try and clear word over misunderstood therefore he would rapidly go over the definitions to find the one that fits the context and clear that first then the remaining definitions would be cleared this is how word is cleared the first step is to look rapidly over the definitions to find the one which applies to the context in which the word was misunderstood one reads the definition and uses it in sentences until one has clear concept of that meaning of the word this could require ten or more sentences then one clears each of the other definitions of that word using each in sentences until one has conceptual understanding of each definition 133the next thing to do is to clear the derivationwhich is the explanation of where the word came from originally this will help gain basic understanding of the word dont clear the technical or specialized definitions math biology etc or obsolete longer used or archaic ancient and longer in general use definitions unless the word is being used that way in the context where it was misunderstood most dictionaries give the idioms of word an idiom is phrase or expression whose meaning cannot be understood from the ordinary meanings of the words for example give in is an english idiom meaning yield quite few words in english have idiomatic uses and these are usually given in dictionary after the definitions of the word itself these idioms have to be cleared one must also clear any other information given about the word such as notes on its usage synonyms etc so as to have full understanding of the word if one encounters misunderstood word or symbol in the definition of word being cleared one must clear it right away using this same procedure and then return to the definition one was clearing dictionary symbols and abbreviations are usually given in the front of the dictionary 8 read the sentence again the word clearer then asks the student to read once again the sentence in the text in which the misunderstood word or symbol was found the student does so and if he reads it correctly with understanding he continues reading the text any further nonoptimum reactions are handled by finding the next misunderstood word and clear ing it as above 9 method 9 is continued until the text has been completed method 9 is continued until the text to be word cleared is completed 10 student goes to examiner at the end of method 9 word clearing the student is always sent to the pc examiner at the end of method 9 session and thats all there is to doing method 9 method 9 caution when the word clearer has misunderstoods of his own on the material being word cleared he tends to go wooden and just sits and does nothing to handle the student the word clearer must always clear his own misunderstood words or else when the student stumbles on word the word clearer wont even see it or hear it because of his own misunderstoods he can miss the students stumble and never get the students misunderstood word the word clearer can also miss students reactions when he has so much attention on the page that he becomes unaware of the student or doesnt even look at the student when students are m9ing each other on the same study materials they do not first just read the materials as this will only give them misunderstoods they take the materials being word cleared one paragraph or section at time and m9 each other on it this is done by student first m9ing his twin on one section and then getting m9ed on what he just word cleared his twin on plus the next section it then turns around again the twin gets m9ed on what he just word cleared the other student on and on the next section in this way one person is not constantly leading unless the m9ing reversals are done in this fashion misunderstoods could be missed the whole text would be covered in this way 134examples of student reactions and their correct handling there are many many different kinds of reactions that can occur when student passes word he doesnt understand there are also many different ways student will respond to method 9 all that is needed for success with method 9 is for the word clearer to understand method 9 and to apply it exactly according to this bulletin given here are some examples of student reactions and correct handlings by the word clearer the student changes word in the sentence example the page says the boy then reached down and patted his dog the student says the boy than reached down and patted his dog the word clearer says thats it is there some word or symbol there that you didnt understand the student looks at the words then boy and the he knows those words so he looks in the sentence before that one in that sentence he sees the word collie hes not sure what that is he tells the word clearer and they clear the word collie b the student adds an extra word example the page says the child went to school the student says the child went to the school the word clearer says thats it is there some word or symbol there that you didnt understand the student looks over the sentence he says he understands all the words but thinks the sentence should say child went to school rather than the child went to school the word clearer says okay lets spotcheck some words what does the mean in this sentence the student looks blank for moment and doesnt say anything the word clearer says all right were going to look up the definition of the the is then looked up and cleared c the student leaves out word example the page says robert then visited the city the student says robert visited the city the word clearer says thats it is there some word or symbol there that you didnt understand 135the student reads over the sentence he cant find anything he doesnt under stand the word clearer asks him to look over the next earlier sentence for misunderstood word the student cant find any there either the word clearer has the student keep looking earlier and earlier in the text and finally the student spots the misunderstood word in the first sentence of the page the word found is then cleared d the student leaves off part of word such as an s or an ed at the end example the page says there was huge pile of assorted tools in the woodshed the student says there was huge pile of assorted tool in the woodshed the word clearer says thats it you left the s off tools have look over that sentence or page and tell what word or symbol was misunderstood the student says i dont have any misunderstood words on this page the word clearer acknowledges him and asks him once again to have look for the misunderstood word or symbol the student looks over the entire page but still says he has misunderstoods so the word clearer starts spotchecking the student on the definitions of the words on the page the word clearer asks whats the definition of tools the student says it means implements of work the word clearer says thats fine whats the defini tion of assorted the student gives it to him correctly so the word clearer simply backs up the sentence words one by one getting the definition of each one until he hits the word was student says its something you saw with the word clearer says lets have look at was in the dictionary each definition of was is then cleared and it is suddenly discovered that the person has never understood that it had anything to do with the conjugation of the verb to be the student stumbles on word or says it incorrectly example the page says i think ill go shopping the student says i ththink the student stops after he stumbles the word clearer says is there some word or symbol there that you dont understand the student says well it just doesnt make sense the word clearer asks what doesnt make sense the student says i dont see why it says think here the word clearer says all right lets have look at think in the dictionary think is then looked up in the dictionary but the student cant seem to get it even though he understands all the words in the definition 136the word clearer asks tell what part of speech is think in that sentence the student says uh i dont know the word clearer says okay well right here in the dictionary it says verb what does that mean to you student mm long pause the word clearer says all right he gets grammar book and says have look at this definition of verb verb is then cleared but while clearing it the student says hey i always thought you could only have one verb in one sentence and that sentence has two verbs in it somebody threw curve and as he has cognited and has now got it straight m9ing continues he uses it in sentences until hes really got it then they go on to the next definition of think in the dictionary f the student hesitates or pauses while he is reading or begins reading more slowly example the page says the sun was shining on the flowers the student says the sunwas shining on the flowers the word clearer says thats it what word or symbol was misunderstood just before that point the student very carefully looks back over the page but he cant find any words he doesnt understand the word clearer says okay ill spotcheck you he gives the student thorough spotcheck but misunderstood words are found the word clearer then asks show where you were last doing really well on this text the student shows him its three paragraphs back the word clearer says good were going to check from this point back for any misunderstood words he extensively spotchecks the student in that area and the students misunder stood word is finally found and cleared g the student frowns looks uncertain goes stiff or in some way shows lack of comprehension example the page says the family ate dinner together every night the student says the family ate dinner together every night while the student is reading there is slight look of uncertainty on his face the word clearer says thats it look over this section youve just read and tell what word or symbol has been misunderstood the student says but why did you stop 137the word clearer says you were looking uncertain as you read that last sentence the student says well actually i did have some attention back on the sentence before last the word clearer says okay was there any misunderstood word or symbol there the student says i have some attention on the word for but ive looked that up before the word clearer says well lets have another look at it for is then cleared and the student realizes that he hadnt fully cleared all of the definitions when he had previously looked it up h the student tenses his body in some way this could be tightening his grip squinting tensing his jaw jerking his body stiffening any body part etc 1the page says the girls were delighted to see one another the student says the girls tightens the muscles in his jaw were delighted to see one another the word clearer says thats it look back over this section you have just read was there misunderstood word or symbol there the student looks at the page long time the word clearer can see he is looking earlier and earlier on the page finally the student says i cant see any words i dont understand but this line seems bit strange to it was christmas eve alice was listening to silent night when carol came into the room the word clearer says all right lets do spotcheck in that area what does carol mean the student says thats girls name the word clearer says good what do the quotation marks show in that sentence the student says hm well someone said silent night to alice the word clearer says all right i want you to read this section in the grammar book on quotation marks the student reads the section aloud and says oh i see silent night is song and you use quotation marks around the names of songs ive got it now the word clearer says great and has the student give some examples of the use of quotation marks they then return to the text 2the page says the men walked quietly through the dockyard the student says the men walked quietly through the dockyard student leans forward and looks at the page more intently the word clearer says thats it is there some word or symbol there that you didnt understand 138the student looks over the sentence well ive never seen dockyard used like that before it doesnt make sense the word clearer acknowledges him and has him look it up the student reads the definition and starts brightening up he turns to the word clearer and says and all this time i thought dockyard was place where you built docks i never could understand why 3the page says the car drove off leaving trail of dust in the air the student says the car drove off leaving trail student squints his eyes at the page of dust in the air the word clearer says is there some misunderstood word or symbol in that area student looks bewildered the sentence just doesnt make sense word clearer says all right what is the definition of trail oh thats the impression of horse hoof where horse has been the word clearer says okay look up the word trail the word is cleared and the student sees that he had totally wrong definition i the student yawns suppresses yawn gets watery eyes etc the page says bright red apple was on the table the student says bright red apple was yawn the word clearer says okay lets find the word or symbol that was misunderstood in this section the student says im not sure i have the right definition for bright could we look it up the word clearer says sure and they look up the word bright j the student begins reading with more effort this includes reading very carefully or unnaturally or robotically or reading in such way as to show that the words have meaning to him or that he doesnt under stand what he is reading the page says the families were having picnic on the beach the student says the families were having picnic on the beach x the student reads the page correctly but he is being very careful not to make any mistakes the word clearer says thats it lets find the misunderstood word or symbol that you didnt understand before this sentence the student says yes i started feeling uncomfortable while i was reading the sentence before last the word clearer says good lets look just before that for the misunderstood word 139the student finds his misunderstood and it is cleared the important point for the word clearer to remember is that where there is student reaction misunderstood word will be found usually just before the point he reacted the misunderstood word can always always be located with good communica tion persistence and totally standard application of method 9 tech as given in this hcob if the student cant easily achieve this he must go to the supervisor for help trs and m9 to be very successful m9 word clearer ones trs must be in one has to be able to tr 3 the question and get the actual misunderstood yet at the same time one should never go robotic or rote on the method 9 procedure for example it may happen that halfway through sentence the student stops smiles and then continues on upon questioning you find that bulletin he has read many many times before is now finally making sense you wouldnt then ask him for his misunderstood just acknowledge his win and carry on with your word clearing with your trs in and your application of this bulletin 100 standard the wins and gains of those you word clear will by means be slight quarrels or upsets it occasionally happens that the students doing the word clearing get into quarrel or upset if this happens you know that one of two things has happened either 1 misunderstoods that were really understood were forced off on the student or 2 actual misunderstoods were not detected and were passed by 1 if this happens you can clean up any falsely lookedup words by asking him if he was made to look up words he understood if this is the case the student will brighten up and tell you the word or words he was wrongly made to clear this done the m9ing can be resumed 2 if the above doesnt handle it then one knows that misunderstoods have been missed have the twin who is doing the word clearing take him back to when he was last doing well and then come forward in the text m9ing as he goes picking up the missed misunderstoods it will usually be found that several misunderstoods have been missed not just one worksheets worksheets are written record of the word clearing session they contain the students name the word clearers name the date and the name or title of what is being word cleared the word clearer keeps worksheets during the word clearing session and writes down which words have been looked up and cleared and any other important information concerning the word clearing worksheets are stapled to the students exam form when word clearing is complete they are filed in his pc folder teaching the student to do method 9 this is done using this hcob or the m9 picture book which will be issued in due time as part of special course this is simple picture book which is handed to the student he goes through the book and then does some m9 drilling as contained in 140the back of it the supervisor checks him out and corrects him if needed using only the data in the m9 picture book and this hcob verbal tech or opinions are thrown in the end result of well done method 9 is student who is certain he has misunderstoods on that material so that he can easily study the material and apply it method 9 is great civilization saver it is easy to do its fun and it gives tremendous gains it is vital that method 9 is done correctly exactly by the book otherwise people will be denied the enormous wins that can be attained with it l ron hubbard founder lrhdrnc copyright 1973 1974 1979 by l ron hubbard

enters into it that is improper trs are done to improve persons handling of the cycle of communication when he sticks somewhere on tr instead of cycling through them each one to win minor or major over and over again you dont accomplish the purpose of trs here is the way you do the trs youll find it very valuable you do ot tr 0 to win or cognition or an improved ability to simply be there you go on to tr 0 the student hasnt gotten full pass on ot tr 0 he just got accustomed to it and had win you do tr 0 to win for the student that he recognizes as win you do tr 0 bullbait to win for the student that he recognizes as win you do tr 1 to win for the student that he recognizes as win you dont try to cure or even necessarily mention faults when you do flunk the student you handle every flunk with an hcob but you concentrate on the student acquiring skills rather than eradicating faults you cant eradicate fault from something person knows little about in the first place you do tr 2 to win for the student that he recognizes as win you do tr 3 to win for the student that he recognizes as win you do tr 4 to win for the student that he recognizes as win now you come back to ot tr 0 get the student better at ot tr 0 then go through all the trs again its kind of like running cchsthey get little bit of win at it and you go on to the next one each time the student cycles through the trs he is coached in the direction of increasing the skills he hasnever in the direction of lose or flunk it is very 142simple you ensure that the student 1 knows the trs hcobs 2 duplicates the drill 3 does the drill and then you always always coach him to win there is reason or use in making the student wrong he usually is about as wrong as you can get unreasonable as it may seem to some the job of the coach and supervisor is to make the student right if you do that you shorten considerably the time it takes to learn the trs in other words you approach this with gradient scale we did learn about gradient scales many years ago and we should continue to apply that knowledge eventually when you use this approach to trs the student will eventually be able to do faultless 2hour ot tr 0 faultless 2hour tr 0 perfect tr 1 an incredibly good tr 2 an errorfree tr 3 and an easy satisfying flawless tr 4 without q and or arc breaking the pc which just makes the session flow and once his trs are in they will stay in for life and he will be able to handle communication cycle so smoothly and so effortlessly that nobody including himself even recognizes that he is doing it this is the way to

communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 15 october 1973rb rerevised 4 december 1978 remimeo revisions in this type style cs series 87rb nulling and fning prepared lists ref hcob 4 december 1978 how to read through an fn prepared list is one which is issued in an hcob and is used to correct cases there are many of these notable amongst them is cs 53 and its corrections it is customary for the auditor to be required to fn such list this means on calling it that the whole list item by item is to fn to fn list you do it method 3 somebodys got the wrong idea that it is done method 5going over and over and over something recent cs of mine on the subject stated the reason youre having trouble fning list is because you dont do m3 handle each read to the end and then reassess m3 and handle each read to the end it is obvious from your list markings that you were doing m5 over and over which of course gets into protest usually m3 at some point will begin to fn and that is the reason you do m3 also when you miss on prepared list the fn stops so there were few minor misses on these lists but mostly because you were doing it m5 also it takes an rfactor that youre going to clean up everything on the list you handle list method 3 by calling the line and handling the line prepared list should be used to get optimum results on pc if prepared list reveals that more needs to be handled ie engram in restimulation then it would be handled note in this case the handling would be to assess the l3rf and handle the reads warning you would not run dianetics on clear dianetic clear or ot for cears and ots you would assess the l3rf and then simply indicate the read if more major action was found to be needed it would be programmed for handling per list instructions if something hot leaps into view on prepared list then handle it it is the wrong think that one has to quickie prepared list and get it to fn in hurry rather than to use it to get optimum results on pc all the list must be called final time nonreading nonfning lists now and then you get the extreme oddity of list selected to exactly remedy the case not reading but not fning of course this might happen if the list did not apply to the case such as an ot prepared list being used on grade iv heaven forbid in the case of lists to correct listing and in particular the cs 53 series it is nearly impossible for this situation to occur 144a cs will very often see that the auditor has assessed the list on the pc has gotten reads and the list did not fn reasonable cs heaven forbid lets this go by yet he has before him first class evidence that the auditor 1 has outtrs in general 2 has impingement whatever with tr 1 3 is placing his meter in the wrong position in the auditing session so that he cannot see it the pc and his worksheet 4 that the auditors eyesight is bad one or more of these conditions certainly exist to do nothing about it is to ask for catastrophe after catastrophe with pcs and to have ones confidence in ones own csing deteriorate badly an amazing number of auditors cannot make prepared list read for one of the above reasons putting in suppress invalidation or misunderstood words on the list will either get read or the list will fn if list does not fn then the subject of the list is still charged or there is something wrong with the list the moral of this is that prepared lists that do not read fn when prepared lists that do not read do not fn or when the auditor cannot get prepared list to fn serious auditing errors are present which will defeat cs in the interest of obtaining results and being merciful on pcs the wise cs never lets this situation go by without finding what it is all about reading through an fn there is skill that any auditor who is handling lists should master and that is reading through an fn when taking list to fning assessment an auditor must know how to read through an fn when going down list that is fning youll sometimes see the fn check briefly and then continue the swinging weight of the fning needle has momentum and it will tend to obscure read but sharp auditor will see this check or slow in an fn know he has hot item and take it up and handle it an auditor who cant read through an fn will miss it and go right on by and the fn then kills within the next couple of items now hes got suppressed read and hes going to have trouble fning the list when this happens even if you cant read through an fn you should go back up the list an item or two and find it but one should be able to read through an fn it is the secret of being able to take list accurately to an honestly fning assessment with wasted time or effort ref hcob 4 december 78 how to read through an fn the rabbit buttons to rabbit means to run away from the bank the term derives from the fact that rabbit is timid and runs away from just about everything 145some auditors have been known to rabbit from auditing sessions or from certain session actions this is wholly due to outtrs or shaky metering and the auditor not knowing how to use his tools rabbiting shows up in various waysnot getting the pc through the engram and not taking dianetic chain to full ep or calling an fn when its an arc break needle or simply ending off when the going gets rough etc its running away from the action rather than completing it one of the ways some auditors rabbit from fning list is by using what have come to be known as the rabbit buttons given cs 53 or other list to take to fning assessment the auditor begins assessing and handling the list items but on the slightest provocation such as minor protest from the pc introduces such questions as is the cs 53 being overrun is this list unnecessary do you feel overrepaired or something similar these questions are valid enough when they occur as they do at the end of some prepared lists but used out of sequence they serve to get the auditor out of taking the cs 53 or other assigned list to fning assessment auditor throws in the rabbit buttons pc immediately agrees its overrun or unnecessary and the auditor ends off with the majority of the list items unchecked for charge this is by means true of all auditors but it has happened frequently enough for these questions used out of sequence to be dubbed the rabbit buttons and each time an auditor has rabbited in this way from fning list something has been found later that should have been handled thus when the cs calls for fning list it must be taken to completion and not quit before the entire list is fning item by item on assessment any pc protest or upset or apprehension over extensive repair actions or list having to be fned stems mainly from auditor outtrs and mismetering missing reads and calling false reads when doing repair lists any auditor backoff or protest on fning list stems from these same points plus having to handle pc upset or protest the solution is for the auditor to polish his trs and sharpen up his metering and learn to read through an fn given good trs and standard metering the auditor who can then also read through an fn will have difficulty taking list to fning assessment l ron hubbard

missed as well as fns on almost any pc convulsive or incorrect can squeeze can shoot the needle across the dial and cause the auditor to reduce his sensitivity down and down and down until he finally sets it at point where long falls become ticks and fns dont exist emeter drill 5ra tells one how to do proper can squeeze too high when auditing flying pc or clear or ot the auditor who sets the sensitivity too high gets weird impressions of the case latent reads on such case are common they arent latent at all what happens is that the fn is more than dial wide at high sensitivity and started fn looks like read as its sweep is stopped by the pin on the right of the dial also the pc can delicately press the cans improperly with his thumbs and fore fingers when doing can squeeze and cause the auditor to push the sensitivity up and up and up and then with the sensitivity set too high be unable to keep the needle on the dial and so miss or imagine reads emeter drill 5ra now teaches how to do this properly in this way uncharged items are taken up the case is slowed overrun and general upsets requiring repairs occur on onehand electrode an ot vii sometimes has 13 dial wide fn at sens

is very important matter as the auditor will miss fns think beginning fns are reads and as the preot is off the dial miss reads thus uncharged areas are run and charged ones are missed the result is very chaotic to repair many lower level pcs also have need for lower sensitivity settings summary sometimes an easy pc looks very difficult just because of wrong sensitivity settings brought about by

not intended to prescribe or otherwise treat an individual all prescriptions and treatments should be done in due accordance with the medical laws of any country in which person seeks treatment there are several antibiotics these are moulds or chemical compounds which cause bacteria germs to be unable to reproduce themselves hits their 2d while not destroying the cells of the body at least that is one of the leading theories of why they work antibiotic means anti against biotic living beings such as bacteria so its against bugs disease is said to be caused by germs or virus germs are microscopic cells which breed and have bad effect on body cells and fluids virus is germ that is too small to be seen in microscope thus there are germ infections and virus infections usually one type of germ equals one disease ie typhoid fever however an illness can be compound of several types of germs but this is not usual virus diseases respond very badly to most antibiotics in fact in the presence of penicillin virus sort of suspends action without any real temperature change while the penicillin is present and gets busy again when the penicillin is gone the effect of most antibiotics on virus is zero some claims are made that anti biotics work against virus measles is virus illness so antibiotics are mainly effective against germs venereal disease pneumonia wound infections and long parade of diseases can be cured by antibiotics when illness is accompanied by temperature antibiotics is usually the first thought antibiotics can however be grossly misadministered and in fact usually are even in hospitals the trick is to get the temperature subnormal with antibiotics within the blood leveling period blood leveling means when the antibiotic has gotten into the blood and is actually holding the infection stopping the bacterias 2d from continuing more of the same antibiotic is given approx 2 hours prior to blood leveling time this then brings the temperature right on down to subnormal continue the antibiotic so that it keeps the temperature subnormal until it just cant keep it subnormal any more and it comes up to normal it will be found that the patient is now well and not likely to relapse if blood leveling time is reached the time is always stated on the instructions and contraindications writeup and the temperature continues to rise you have not used the correct antibiotic and must at this point change to another kind of antibiotic 156each antibiotic has its own blood leveling time penicillin is 24 hours gephalori dine is 8 hours streptomycin is 6 hours etc before administering antibiotics you must ensure that you know exactly what toxicity it is toxic or poisonous quality the antibiotic has to the patient for example streptomycin can cause pregnant mothers to give birth to children who have impaired hearing renal kidneys having to do with them damage can be caused by certain antibiotics if the person has too much of certain kind of antibiotic therefore prior to administering any kind of antibiotic ensure that you know the patients full medical history as well as knowing exactly what the toxicity of the antibiotic is so that you do not damage the patient if not enough antibiotic is given or if it is the wrong kind for that disease the temperature will not be heavily affected or at best sinks to normal without going subnormal this condition can go on and on and on and the patient relapses also if antibiotics are given too briefly the temperature goes to subnormal the antibiotic ceases to be given the patient feels better then probably relapsesgets ill all over again the above important three error situations are not enough wrong kind stopped too soon to these can be added given too irregularly this last is almost always present when you give the patient the bottle this is common medical error the patients arent doctors seldom take the medicine correctly and often not at all antibiotics should be handed out and seen taken where there is large number ill the times can be standardized for the group for instance all get it at 300 to 330 900 to 930 etc or even 3 hourly can be done this way one takes the temperature before giving the pill glass of water or cigarette before temperature taking gives false report also in this way one can increase or decrease the dose depending on what the temperature was in very sick cases one has to watch the temperature more closely in this way every time the temperature starts to rise from the subnormal where you are holding it you immediately dose the patient an antibiotic all by itself cannot depress temperature its the reaction of the disease and body thats doing that temperature 986f or 37c is normal thermometer can be bit off 1 or 2 high or low and temperature can vary bit for normal one person to the next rising temperature above normal is reaction to disease lowered temperature below normal is reaction to disease being handled by the body or the antibiotic plus the body 100f or 378c is well above normal and is sick temperature 104f or 405c is dangerously possible death high 15797f or 362c is very satisfactorily subnormal temperature rise is probably body mechanism to burn up disease possibly not but slight temperature few tenths high can make person feel really bad then when it gets up higher they feel drifty and with it very high go delirious subnormal temperature doesnt much affect how one feels chills come with high temperature administering doses the general rule when administering antibiotics is 1 one gives antibiotics until the temperature comes down past normal to subnormal and comes up to normal again with antibiotics after blood leveling time of the first antibiotic the temperature should break go normal or below the person going into sweat if it doesnt then its either not enough antibiotic or the wrong kind 2 after dosage if the temperature just came down bit from where it was that type of antibiotic probably will handle the illness but enough has not been given increase the amount being given if after blood leveling time from the first antibiotic the temperature did not go lower or even rose its the wrong antibiotic you change off to another and start all over again taking effect the blood leveling period of an antibiotic is always stated on the writeup of the antibiotic in the box accompanying the antibiotic the second administration is usually given 2 hours prior to the blood leveling period thus if the blood leveling period is 8 hours the second dose is given 6 hours after the first dose take the temperature before the dose and within the next 2 hours take the temperature again and you will know whether the antibiotic is working as the temperature should now be leveling andor falling if the temperature has not leveled or dropped at this period change the antibiotic when giving antibiotics fo 2187 medical charts must be followed if you dont have medical chart you dont know and cant see how the antibiotic is working past maladministration if person in the past has been treated wrongly with antibiotics ie got taken off as soon as temperature reached normal and was not continued as by rule i or 2 the germ remains dormant and the area may reinfect at later date if more antibiotics are then administered the temperature will go subnormal and then to normal with the antibiotic in other words the cycle will complete at this point the germ has been killed sessions before any session heavy dose of vitamins should be given if the person is on antibiotics key procedure 158when the temperature goes subnormal keep it subnormal until it just wont stay down with the person still taking the antibiotic the patient will then be well the faster you can get the temperature subnormal the better side effects antibiotics have side effects often very bad patient can be allergic to certain antibiotic meaning he goes red gets hives has bad reactions in varying degrees of severity if so get him on another antibiotic now you can test for allergy by scratching the skin and putting dab of antibiotic on it not the sugar or protective covering on bandaid after while if the person is allergic to it the area will get red and puffy this is not usually done unless you are being super cautious the chloro and aureo families can affect the sense of balance and early preparations destroyed the sense of balance forever all oral antibiotics sooner or later give the patient stomach ache and indiges ion so they should be taken with milk or after meal never with just water the longer you keep them on an antibiotic the harder it is on the patients system the operating rule is give enough of the right kind to get fast cure if you started on the wrong kind get them on the right kind the moment you detect the error disease cycles diseases have their own cycles of action and time periods if not given antibiotics some run for days some for weeks some for lifetime gonorrhea for instance lasts year in man five years in woman syphilis has its own cure not an antibiotic which is ehrlichs magic bullet neoarsphenamine and preparation 606 which is oneshot cure if done right and only kills i out of 10000 syphilis untreated is lifetime cycle and drives one crazy the condition being known as paresis perhaps modern antibiotics will include it as curative pneumonia runs about 6 weeks on its own if the patient lives these disease cycles do not hold true when antibiotics are used they take as long to cure as it takes to slam the temperature to subnormal and hold it there until it cant be held any longer 24 to 36 hours is the new cycle for lighter illnesses treated with properly dosed correct antibiotics more serious diseases require longer but mostly because the areas they infect have poorer blood circulation such as bone infections sulfa drugs the oldest antibiotics are the sulfa drugs these are white tablets usually entero vioform for stomach illness is sulfa drug they have very heavy side effect of dizziness and sometimes delusion spiders on the wall 159sulfathiazole is usually now used as powder to pour in open wounds and it and its brother sulfas are the only ones that can be used topically which means as surface treatment as different from internal they follow when taken internally all the rules of antibiotic administration gerontal trade name for watersoluble sulfa is excellent in kidney infec tions if the rules of antibiotics are followed it needs large quantities you can fall back on sulfa when all else fails sulfas are chemical compounds penicillin penicillin is the first of the antibiotics made from mould as in mouldy bread etc it is the usual antibiotic it is growing less effective due to diseases getting used to it and medical misad ministration of it disease treated with an antibiotic which is not cured when communicated to another body becomes able in the new body to resist treatment thus new antibiotics are continually searched for however penicillin is the basic usual antibiotic to use new penicillin vk can be taken orally or injected it would always need to be prescribed by physician and the actual dosage would need to be prescribed by physician but it could then be taken under the care of an mo medical officer the oral penicillin vk does work when administered orally by mouth penicillin vk is potassium salt of penicillin that is stable in stomach acids it does not have to be shot with needle the type of penicillin that does not work when taken by mouth is penicillin g stomach acids kill it penicillin g has to be shot with needle procaine penicillin in 1cc or 2cc amounts shot into the buttocks with the person lying down on his stomach muscles relaxed lasts for 24 hours when 2nd shot is given other types of penicillin can also work this way ordinary penicillin however penicillin g has to be shot every 3 hours read the literature carefully if shot of 24 or 36 hour penicillin hasnt worked in 8 hours to reduce the temperature at least somewhat use some other antibiotic at once penicillin is good even when shot for stomach or bowel complaints like dysentery it is excellent for other types of bacterial infection it is usually good for virus infections oral versus injections of penicillin depends upon the type of and seriousness of the infection the injectable penicillin cuts the blood leveling time to about half as compared to the oral penicillin so the injectable penicillin is faster if person is allergic to penicillin some other antibiotic must be used 160other antibiotics chloro _____aureo_____ strepto_____ compounds are offered under variety of trade names the blank fills mycin or mycetin kemacetin or some such spelling is company trade name for chloro_____ chlorofin is almost the same thing read the literature for the strength of each tablet or shot and what it is good for you can puzzle this out even in foreign language follow the literature if one doesnt work another will chloro or aureo handles dysentery stomach and bowel upsets some viruses and lot of other things vitamins b1 should be given when giving antibiotics or the patient gets depressed as all the b1 gets eaten up by antibiotics just as alcohol or sleeping pills eat up b1 100 mg of bl day is an absolute minimum for person taking antibiotics b2 is vital to give anyone with stomach and bowel complaints whether he is on antibiotics or not vitamin c is excellent for helping colds and infections 250 mg is the usual dose couple times day its much like fruit in that fruit contains lot of it if anyones teeth or gums get sore push in lots of vitamin c so b1 and c are usual along with antibiotics b1 c and b2 are vital to help clear up stomach and bowel complaints along with antibiotics intestinal bacteria natural intestinal bacteria are vital to digest and handle food these all get killed off by oral antibiotics and must be replaced yoghurt is the usual remedy and one should eat it for several days portion day after getting well with antibiotics the clever french put these exact bacteria in glass vials for daily dosage this does the same thing even better than yoghurt it is called biolactyl note under medical supervision lrh has been handling antibiotics as ship captain for long time and has done as well independent biological research some of the data the use of subnormal temperatures is not known to the medical profession but was discovered by ron in 1952 when he had to discover it to save an important persons life after two relapses from doctors using older methods it has since been proven out by many quick successes using antibiotics on ships person treating someone on antibiotics must go over this hcob very carefully as it is very condensed very precise and means exactly what it says when this data is not known some get into long illnesses which are needless person treating another with antibiotics has to know many other things but the above is very vital all div 5 personnel and anyone who will administer antibiotics must starrate m9 m4 in qual on this hcob medical charts see fo 2187 medical charts must be made up so that in case of any fever the person will be treated

been revised to incorporate data from recent research into the pro gress of cases in view of the current environmental and drug scene and to give the full steps of the new purification rundown the purification rundown does not supplant technology developed and in use especially in narconon for persons currently on drugs and apt to experience with drawal symptoms when taken off of them the rundown would be begun only after such technology was applied while it is being published now as holding action until the purification rundown is issued as an individual package this issue does contain the rundown as it has been piloted we are not concerned with handling bodies with the purification rundown our concern is freeing the individual up spiritually the only dosages recommended are those classified as food there are medical recommendations or claims for it the only claim is future spiritual improvement this data is released as record of researches and results noted it cannot be construed as recommendation of medical treatment or medication and it is under taken or delivered by anyone on his own responsibility i receive percentage of fees for administering this rundown and my development of it is contribution and gift to my friends glossary any words you find in this hcob which you do not understand can be found in normal dictionary or in the dianetics and scientology technical dictionary or are explained in the following text the planet has hit barrier that prevents widespread clearingdrugs and bio chemical substances these can put beings in condition that can prevent case gain thats the situation today what would you give for rundown that undercut every case on the planet and could be administered by technicians who did not require long periods of training sweeping breakthroughs have been made recently through my 29 year study of the progress of cases against the environmental factors and biochemical aspect of our current society 163one immediate result of this is the purification rundown the purification rundown is simply program to clean out and purify ones system based on the original sweat out program it is new much more thorough and much faster version of that program streamlined by the introduction of the sauna bath for sweating and with much broader use it should be clearly understood at the outset that the purification rundown is not substitute for any kind of processing rather because of the biochemical problem that besets society today it is the undercut that has become necessary to prepare the majority of pcs for making optimum case gain from their processing in point of fact the purification rundown is for anyone biochemical factors by biochemical is meant the interaction of life forms and chemical substances bio means life of living things from the greek bios life or way of life chemical of or having to do with chemicals chemicals are substances simple or complex which are the building blocks of matter we live in chemical oriented society one would be hard put to find someone in the presentday civilization who is not affected by this fact the vast majority of the public is subjected every day to the intake of food preservatives and other chemical poisons including atmospheric poisons pesti cides and the like added to this are the pain pills tranquilizers and other medical drugs used and prescribed by doctors and we have as well the widespread use of marijuana lsd angel dust and other street drugs which contribute heavily to the scene i have even found that there is such thing as the drug personality drugs can apparently change the attitude of person from his original personality to one secretly harboring hostilities and hatreds he does not permit to show on the surface while this possibly is not always the case it does establish linkage between drugs and increasing difficulties with crime production program execution and the modern breakdown of the social and industrial culture these factors are all part of the biochemical problem why purification we have known since 1968 that it is mistake to try to do mental and spiritual handling on somebody who has been on drugs people who have been on drugs do not make case gain until the drugs are handled in the early 70s the drug rundown was developed and put into broad use and it included the auditing out of drugs medicines and alcohol in 1977 i issued hcob 1 may 77 in which i stated that lsd apparently stays in the system lodging in the tissues and mainly the fatty tissues of the body and is liable to go into action again giving the person unpredictable trips the restimulation experienced by people who had been on lsd appeared to act as if they had just taken more lsd 164as it has been stated that it only takes 1millionth of an ounce of lsd to produce drugged condition and because it is basically wheat rust which simply cuts off circu lation my original thinking on this over the years was that lsd sticks around in the body that basically is the idea underlying the original sweat program the remedy given was to sweat it out from the most recent research developments it now appears that not only lsd but other chemical poisons and toxins preservatives pesticides etc as well as medical drugs and the long list of heavy street drugs angel dust heroin marijuana etc can lodge in the tissues and remain in the body for years even medicinal drugs such as diet pills codeine novocaine and others have gone into restim years after they were taken and had supposedly been eliminated from the body thus it seems that any or all of these hostile biochemical substances can get caught up in the tissues and their accumulation probably disarranges the biochemistry and fluid balance of the body these substances must be eliminated if the person is to get the most possible gains from mental and spiritual processing the operating rule is that mental actions and even biophysical processes objec tives etc do not work in the presence of drugs drug residues can stop any mental help they also stop persons life the only reason we are handling drugs and drug deposits in the body is so that the individual can then get case gain apparent gain occurs by cleaning up the body and can be seen as an end all in itself this is not the case drugs and biochemical substances can prevent case gain from occurring only when we have accomplished the biochemical handling can we then go onto the next step the biophysical handling the relationship of the being to the body the environment or universe and then onto mental and spiritual processing when you try to move these around and put them out of sequence you get losses examples actual tests have demonstrated that person who has been on heavy drugs requires up to ten times the time to obtain result which nondrug person attained in only 6 to 8 hours of processing early tests are also showing that the learning rate of person who has been on drugs is much lower than nondrug person the memory of person who has been on drugs is such as to remove him from fear of consequences rate of case gain is enormously retarded by toxic substances such as drugs the reason we can make breakthrough with this is because of the thetamest theory covered in the text science of survival older scientific thought believed all life came from matter belief which goes back to the ancient egyptian priests and remains today the dominant belief of chemists psychologists and psychiatrists life form is combination of life itself and the physical universe certain elements in the physical universe are highly antipathetic to life and when introduced into life forms inhibit proper functioning and even destroy the being thetan of course has potential pictures of these toxic substances and states and as long as they are in the body these actual substances can restimulate 165being when they are gone from the body the constant restimulation can cease so it is actually spiritual action that is being done case supervisor should be aware of the fact that he is wasting his time if he ignores the above the removal of these lifehostile chemical substances from the body of any person apparently speeds and in some cases even makes possible case gain it is even worth doing for its own sake the purification rundown therefore is for anyone there is probably not pc today who is outside this requirement the purification rundown the rundown is tightly supervised regimen which includes exercise sauna sweat out nutrition including vitamins minerals etc as well as oil intake properly ordered personal schedule an oca and iq test are given the person before starting the rundown and upon its completion with each of these points kept in and the introduction of the sauna bath for sweat ing out it is refined and streamlined version of the original sweat out and can be completed in fraction of the time sweat outs have taken in the past properly scheduled with exercise and sauna sweat out done 5 hours day the program can be completed by many in two weeks time some pcs may require more than that some less when the purification rundown is done the purification rundown could be considered mandatory to any person who has been on lsd or heavy drugs or who has heavy medical drug history such pc is not likely to get very fast case gain without it there are many pcs who have had hundreds of hours of auditing including drug rundowns who have never done sweat out of any kind while tremendous gains have been made by such pcs which are not to be invalidated there is doubt but what large majority of them would benefit by the purification rundown and benefit even further from future auditing as result additionally there are those who have done sweat out programs in the past who have not experienced all the gain from it possible or who have skimped or are incom plete on sweat outs in all cases such as those above it is matter for cs adjudication as to whether or not the person would now do the program one would not interrupt case that was running smoothly and making excellent gains progressively one would not interrupt an ongoing auditing action to throw in such program randomly on the other hand where pc is consistently not making the expected gains from his processing or is not continuing up the bridge on his grades cs might suspect the need for this program and it now becomes part of the tech of csing to take this into consideration in the case of pc who has started and is continuing up the grades it would require the correct programming 166as the purification rundown is always done under cs supervision it becomes matter for the cs to decide the purification rundown and auditing originally sweat outs were used to debar people from processing so they were then permitted to be done during processing which was not the most optimum solution today as the purification rundown via sauna can take as little as two weeks it is not done concurrently with auditing the program is done by itself intensively to completion under the daily supervision of the cs warning this program can be strenuous and should not be undertaken by anyone who has weak heart or who is anemic it is therefore absolutely essential that the following rules are strictly adhered to 1 any person before being put on the purification rundown must first have written okay from the medical officer or medical doctor the cs and the mo must ensure this prerequisite is kept in 2 the mo must ensure that one who has weak heart or who is anemic is allowed onto the program these points must be checked before the person starts the program where the medical officer is trained in testing blood pressure and anemia the tests can be done by him or her where there is trained medical officer to do these tests they must be done by reliable medical doctor people with known heart conditions or high blood pressure or who are anemic and even those with certain kidney conditions must do program which is of much lower gradient an exercise program and nutrition must be worked out for them with medical doctor 3 the medical officer tests are continued periodically as the person goes through the program and if any signs of weak heart or anemia should appear the person is taken off the rundown and handled medically exercise and sauna in order to flush the poisons and chemical substances out of the body the following actions are done 1 outside running the first action is outside running the purpose of this is not to generate sweat but to get the blood circulating and the system functioning so that impurities held in the system can be released and are pumped out running increases the circulation throughout the whole body thus it carries out cell waste more rapidly and b causes the circulation to go deeper into the muscles and tissues so those areas which have been stagnant can now get rid of the accumula tion of biochemical deposits and in the case of lsd the residual crystals which have been stored running is done on daily basis once the person has been assigned to this program it is done in rubberized or vinyltype sweat suit the running should be done on gradient if you are so breathless that you cant talk to another while you are running then you are straining too much so cut the gradient 2 sweating in the sauna the second action following the running is sweating person goes into the sauna to sweat the impurities can now be dispelled from the body and leave the system through the pores 167a sweat suit is never worn in the sauna as this acts as insulation much the same as when diver wears wet suit to insulate against the cold of the sea wearing sweat suit in the sauna would insulate against the heat and so inhibit and curtail sweating thus far the use of dry sauna has proved to be the most successful in inducing profuse sweating on most people it is possible that some people may sweat more in wet sauna it may be that it is an individual matter and it has not yet been fully tested there is regulation on the rundown that outlaws the use of wet sauna whichever type of sauna is employed the whole idea is to use the system which permits the person to sweat the most sweating in the sauna is done at temperatures ranging anywhere from 140 degrees to 180 degrees it is matter of what temperature the person can take usually but not always person beginning the rundown will start at lower temperature and work up then as he progresses he will find he can take increasing degrees of heat on the purification rundown five hours day are spent on combination of running and sweating there are arbitraries set as to exact time limits for each but the bulk of the period would probably be best spent in the sauna after the person had gotten his circulation up with running one would not stint on the running however as the most benefit is obtained from the sweating when the circulation has been worked up so that the impurities are ready to be flushed out running and sauna sweat out should be done with another person as restimula tion of past drugs medicines even anesthetics etc can and often does occur as the toxins get sweated out this can include the restimulation of fullblown trip from lsd or other drugs one may have taken it is safeguard therefore to be accompanied by partner or twin salt and potassium salt sodium chloride is not mandatory for every individual on the program it is only necessary as treatment if the symptoms of salt depletion heat exhaustion occur these are clammy skin tiredness weakness headache sometimes cramps nausea dizziness sometimes vomiting or fainting as potassium is lost in sweating some of the above symptoms can be from potassium depletion so if salt does not handle the above symptoms then one would switch to either potassium gluconate tablets or salt substitute which is mainly potassium salt and potassium must be available to anyone who is on the purification run down ideally they would be located very near the sauna clearly labeled liquids while on this program it is important that one drink plenty of water which greatly assists in flushing and cleansing the system out additionally with all the sweating done in the sauna it would be dangerous not to replenish body fluids personal schedule it is important that person on the purification rundown maintains properly ordered personal schedule this means that once one has started on the program he must stick to it sensibly and not skip days or do it in random fashion it also means that one should get enough sleep if one proceeds through the program in an orderly fashion it will be faster and more effective nutrition when we speak of nutrition we are not talking about food as such we are talking about vitamins and minerals as well as these are vital to proper nutrition and 168vital to the effectiveness of this rundown we are not however talking about diet in the overused sense of the word diet and food fads there are diets required on this rundown the person simply eats what he normally eats and he should make sure he gets some vegetables and that the vegetables arent cooked to death vegetables contain lot of minerals and fiber as well as some vitamins necessary to his recovery we are not food faddists however there is plenty of food faddism going on in society and you can easily start such fad so this must be watched on the purification rundown if we dont watch it on all this well have people eating banana fronds split into diamonds and star shapes and blessed by some deity or other or fad of three lettuce leaves crisscrossed with two slabs of peanut butter an absolute must 18 times day as the only food person can have food is subject to becoming very faddist and frankly people know very little about it i wrote an essay on this subject hcob 25 mar 75 diet theory of na tural diet to the effect that nobody has ever isolated the proper diet for homo sapiens it gives the formula of how one would go about finding the exact and proper diet it tells you that all this diet faddism is based on data so there is thought here of putting the person on any kind of special diet at all there are restrictions on what one may eat we are not even trying to preach against toxic foods or campaign against diet abuses or junk foods or anything of that sort we are only trying to handle the accumulation of impurities built up in the body if you wanted to defend your body against all future impurities then that is another program and not part of this one what is part of this scene is that person will need certain nutrition in the form of vitamin intake and minerals one follows his normal eating habits there are however some additions to the normal eating habits which consist of taking quantity of all blend oil each day secondly drinking lots of water to help flush out the system and thirdly ensuring that the vitamin and mineral intake is adequate to put person on diet different than that to which he is accustomed is to intro duce sudden change in the midst of these other changes change of diet might be just one too many changes and is an additive to this rundown oil there is an oil called all blend which has the four essential oils in it soy walnut peanut and safflower oil which is available in the us in health food stores if this type of oil is not obtainable elsewhere one could blend it from these four oils in the proper amounts or find an adequate substitute all blend oil would be best but any oil used must be coldpressed and polyunsaturated the oil must be kept refrigerated so that it does not go rancid toxic substances tend to lock up mainly but not exclusively in the fat tissue of the body there is such thing as fat cell the theory then is that one could replace the fat tissues that hold these accumulations the body will actually tend to hold onto something it is short of thus if you try to get rid of something it is short of it wont give it up so in the matter of oil if the person takes some oil the body might possibly exchange the good oil for the bad fat in the body that is the basic theory 169it is theory of exchange it is based on the havewaste formulas and processes which were extant in scientology in the late 50s that whole body of data applies to this oils scene refpab 123 the reality scale

ca early may vol 1 page 330 associate newsletter 7 1953 ca late july vol 1 page 412 if one wants somebody to clean up the fat tissue in the body he had better give the body some fat in order to make up for the fat tissues the body is now releasing or changing the effort is to get the body to take good oil or fat in exchange for the bad fat it is holding onto in this way we have some chance of getting the body to release fatty tissue which is impregnated with toxic substances how much oil the exact quantity of oil needed by the person on the rundown has not been defi nitely established but it is very likely somewhere between two tablespoonsful and half cup one tablespoonful of oil is not going to accomplish much too little oil wont let the body substitute the fat tissue if too much is given it can cause diarrhea one way to test for the right amount of oil for the person would be to put him on scale and keep close check on his weight this should be done routinely in any event when person is on the purification rundown if the fat is being replaced in the body despite the intake of oil then the weight will not go up if the body is simply assimilating the oil with exchange in fat tissue the weight will go up change in weight would tend to indicate whether or not the body was exchanging old fat tissue for new fat tissue or simply adding new fat tissue all people be they fat or thin have some fatty tissue some of course have more fat stored in their bodies than others on this program we simply want to get rid of the fat that contains the toxic substances we are not even trying to make people lose weight worth mentioning here is also the fact particularly in regard to thin people that while toxic substances lock up mainly in fat tissue it does not mean that the person cannot have drug deposits inside cells one could not expect the results that can be achieved on the purification rundown without sufficient oil intake nutritional deficiencies having been an early discoverer and instigator of vitamin therapy over the past 29 years i know whereof i speak on the subject of nutritional deficiencies my work covering vitamins and deficiencies stimulants and depressants and the field of biochemistry goes back to the spring of 1950 though i have been interested in vitamins primarily only as they might aid speed or assist auditing my research along this line has been extensive this is not to devalue the work and contributions of others in the nutritional fields it takes mere skimming of the surface of this subject however to recognize that the purification rundown will not be effective in the face of vitamin or mineral defi ciency in the person one of the things that toxins and drugs do is create nutritional deficiencies in the body in the form of vitamin and mineral deficiencies obviously c deficiency b 170complex deficiency and niacin deficiency are brought about by drugs there may be other deficiencies that we are not aware of at this time but that list is certain also alcohol for example depends for its effects on person being able to burn up b1 when it burns up all the b1 in the system the person goes into dts delirium tremens and nightmares in the case of other toxic substances the probability exists that other vitamins besides b1 are burned up what we seem to have hit on here is that the lsd and street drugs burn up not only b1 and b complex which we assume they do but also create deficiency in niacin in the body and that they possibly depend on niacin one of the b complex vitamins for their effect it is easily seen that there is wide range of toxic substances which create nutri tional deficiencies it is quite vital that any vitamin or mineral deficiency is being handled while the person is on this rundown in the piloting and development of the purification rundown the most effective handling for this was found to be starting the person on the following vitamin approximately 5000 iu per day vitamin b complex approximately 2 caps per day ensure the vitamin b2 and b6 are balanced approximately the same amount of each vitamin by special additional amounts of b1 are required 250500 mg or greater daily depending on the amount of niacin given vitamin c 2501000 mg daily depending upon the persons tolerance as vitamin c can cause stomach problems or diarrhea each persons tolerance must be worked out vitamin c has to be increased in proportion to the niacin given records exist wherein vitamin c has become so deficient in drug user that he used up tens of thousands of milligrams per day before he began to eliminate any vitamin c defi ciencies result in scurvy live c from raw onions or raw potatoes is sometimes necessary in addition to synthetic c and were the traditional remedies for scurvy vitamin d approximately 400 iu daily vitamin approximately 800 iu daily niacin100 mg daily to begin it is then increased gradiently to as high as 5000 mg particularly b1 and c have to keep pace with it as it is increased in dosage calmag one glass daily at least multimineralsa balanced combination of minerals these would then be increased proportionately according to need andor niacin increase as the person progressed on the rundown person may have certain vitamin deficiencies which are not handled by the above when he routes onto the purification rundown he should be sent to the medical officer or medical doctor who would determine what if any additional vitamin defi ciencies he might have any such not covered in the above list would then be handled with specific supplements for those deficiencies 171vitamins would be taken after meals or with yoghurt if taken on an empty stomach they could cause stomach burn niacin niacin as one of the b complex vitamins is essential to nutrition it is so vital to the effectiveness of the purification rundown that it requires some extensive mention here it can produce some startling and in the end very beneficial results when taken properly on the rundown along with the other necessary vitamins and minerals in sufficient and proportionate quantities and along with proper running and sweat out its effects can be quite dramatic so one should understand what niacin is and does and have good rfactor on it when starting the rundown taken in sufficient quan tities it appears to break up and unleash lsd marijuana and other drugs and poisons from the tissues and cells it can rapidly release lsd crystals into the system and send person who has taken lsd on trip one fellow who had done the earlier sweat out for period of months and who believed he had more lsd in his system took 100 mg of niacin and promptly turned on restimulation of full blown lsd trip running and sweating must be done in conjunction with taking niacin to ensure the toxic substances it releases actually do get flushed out of the body niacin background history niacins biochemical reaction is my own private personal discovery in the middle of the 1950s i was doing work on radiation and i worked out that it must be niacin that operated on radiation i was recently told by doctor that the dianazene formula of that time is remarkably workable today niacin runs out radiation it will often cause very hot flush and prickly itchy skin which can last up to an hour or longer it may also bring on chills or make person feel tired the outpoint in medical thinking has been that they thought the niacin itself turned on flush so they invented something called niacinamide to keep from turning on this flush niacin all by its lonesome does not turn on any flush what it starts to do is immediately run out sunburn or radiation so the niacinamide they invented is worthless and it should be mentioned that it is in 1973 someone got nobel prize for curing insanity with niacin but it was fairly marked that he didnt know the facts of what was actually happening because it was then promptly abandoned as people found that prolonged quantities of niacin gave very bad side effects the truth of the matter is that if one continues niacin always along with the other necessary vitamins in proper amounts the bad effects will vanish in other words the work i did on this was picked up and misapplied and then abandoned this is the background history of niacin now more recently doctors in megavitamin research have been administering niacin to get people through withdrawal symptoms or get them over bad drug kicks and they have been using enormous doses of for example 5000 mg i have personal knowledge that such enormous doses are necessary for handling drugs it is very possible that given the combination of all the points on the purification rundown many people would be able to handle drugs with lesser amounts of niacin something under 5000 mgs niacin theory in theory niacin apparently does not do anything by itself it is simply interacting with niacin deficiencies which already exist in the cellular structure it doesnt turn on 172allergies it runs out allergies evidently anything that niacin does is the result of running out and running through past deficiencies caution the manifestations niacin produces can be quite horrifying some of the somatics and manifestations the person may turn on are not just somatics in lots of cases in my experience i have seen full blown case of skin cancer turn on and run out so person can turn on skin cancer with this and if that should happen if niacin is continued the skin cancer has run out completely other things that may turn on are hives flu symptoms gastroenteritis inflamma tion of the mucous membrane of the stomach and intestine aching bones upset stomach or fearful or terrified condition there seems to be limit to the variety of phenomena that may occur with niacin if it is there to turn on by niacin it apparently will do so with niacin the two vital and proven facts here are 1 when the niacin was carried on until these things discharged they did run out as they will do sometimes people chicken out on it and dont finish the course and it leaves them hung up this should not be allowed to happen it is matter of record that what turns it on will turn it off where niacin is concerned 2 when the niacin dosage was increased and the whole lot of the rest of the vitamins being taken was also increased proportionately the niacin itself taken in large amounts did not create vitamin deficiency increasing niacin and other vitamin quantities most persons who have done the purification rundown started niacin at 100 mgs day some took lesser amounts depending upon tolerance and increased the dosage as they progressed the best results were obtained when niacin was taken all at one time not split up during the day taken with water on an empty stomach it can be very upsetting it is found to be best taken after meal or with yoghurt or milk to increase the dosage specific quantity of niacin was administered each day until the effect that dosage produced diminished one would then next day up the dosage on gradient say in amounts of 100 mg in this way you get an overlap of the old dosage becoming useless and the new dosage being needed this tended to speed up the action considerably when continued each time the effect of the dosage diminished the other vitamins would have to be increased proportionately to niacin at the same time the niacin is increased as they are interacting in the deficiencies and more are needed it was found essential that c b1 and other b vitamins need to be given in ratio to the niacin being fed in other words as you up the niacin you would up the b1 and the b complex and also as the niacin is upped the vitamin c would be upped these things would have to be kept in ratio the theory here is that one by overdosing one vitamin can create deficiency artificially of another vitamin this is principle i hit upon as early as 1950 and proved it you can actually create deficiency in c by administering b and calcium all you have to do is pump those things to the guy in very very heavy dosages and he will develop the deficiency characteristics of c his teeth begin to hurt then when you give 173him c the manifestations go away in other words an overdose of x and can apparently create deficiency in vitamin z the reason for all this is that vitamin is making certain changes in the body and these changes to occur fully also require the additional vitamin but that additional vita min isnt there so it gives the manifestation of being in deficiency all of this is my own private theory it isnt anywhere else and it hasnt been subjected to tremendous and intensive research but i sure can turn on vitamin c deficiency in anybody by overadministering b and calcium in other words vitamin rations would have to be in proportion to one another minerals between 1945 and 1973 i studied the endocrine system in 1973 it seemed that minerals and trace minerals operating in the blood stream and circulated by other body fluids were key to glandular interactions the theory is every gland in the body specializes in one or more minerals and actually that is how they make themselves interact one with another the endocrine system of the body monitors the endocrine system of the body apparently through minerals as various drugs upset the whole endocrine system of the body you can see that the moment you start administering vitamins and sweat out and things like that youre going to get mineral demand in the body therefore there would need to be certain mineral dosages right along with the rest of this package the principle here is that by giving one or two vitamins in excess amount you can create nutritional deficiency of another vitamin which isnt being given or isnt being given in enough quantity thus what could slow down the purification rundown and make it appear unflat would be nutritional failurea failure to flank the niacin on either side by sufficient amounts of the other needed vitamins and minerals in proportion and food intake which includes vegetables and oil in such case one would be looking at created nutritional deficienciesnot conditions which were there to begin with to be run out not knowing these things is probably what made the medics earlier believe that niacin had side effects the side effects were probably somatics and manifestations half run out and deficiencies created by not flanking niacin with the other vitamins and minerals and oils necessary to cause rebuild calmag calcium is must where any healing or exchange process is involved as it is basic building block but more important it is calcium which affects the nervous system i do not know the total relationship between calcium and toxic substances and neither does anyone else but it actually exists the rationale back of this is that calcium in deficiency sets person up for spasms nerve spasms occur in the absence of calcium person who thinks he is in high tension or something of the sort may simply have calcium deficiency calcium would be administered in company with magnesium magnesium itself has been proven necessary to keep the nerves smoothed out the proven ratio is one half the quantity of magnesium to the quantity of calcium something else odd about calcium is that it has to have an acidic base to operate in if the system is too alkaline the calcium will not release the positive ion which makes it possible for the calcium to operate in the cellular structure and go through the vein walls and the intestinal walls and so forth in other words in an alkaline system 174calcium is ineffective and inactive so this brings us up to vinegar which would add the acidic base with calcium magnesium and vinegar in their correct quantities in water exactly per the recipe we have calmag that is what calmag is and what it does i developed and worked this out in 1973 against the very best biochemical background and references and tests calcium and magnesium can be taken in order to prevent sore muscles calmag has been found to have the added benefit of balancing out the vitamin b1 taken as vitamin b1 taken without calcium can cause serious teeth problems due to causing an imbalance of vitamins and minerals the calmag formula as given in hcob 5 nov 74 drugs more about is repeated here 1 put one level tablespoon of calcium gluconate in normal sized glass 2 add 12 level teaspoon of magnesium carbonate 3 add 1 tablespoon of cider vinegar at least 5 acidity 4 stir it well 5 add 12 glass of boiling water and stir until all the powder is dissolved and the liquid is clear if this doesnt occur it could be from poor grade or old magnesium carbonate 6 fill the remainder of glass with lukewarm or cold water and cover it will stay good for 2 days note there is warning about calmag variations from the above can produce an unsuccessful mess that can taste pretty horrible it can be made incorrectly so that it doesnt dissolve and become the most unpalatable ghastly stuff anybody ever fed anybody possibly made incorrectly it is even unworkable made correctly it is very clear liquid quite pleasant to take and palatable so the directions should be followed very explicitly to produce proper calmag pleasant to take and very beneficial manifestations various manifestations turn up on the purification program and these can vary widely from person to person anything from insect bites to full blown restimulation of an lsd trip may turn on and these all simply run themselves out and blow as the program is continued if there are heavy drugs to be flushed out it is not uncommon for the person to experience restim of whatever the effects of the drug or medicine were when he first took it old injuries or old somatics may turn on flare up for brief spell and vanish it is important to note that given manifestation which turns on may turn on and vanish wholly or partly in any given day then it may turn on again the following day but less if one increases the vitamin and mineral dosage at this time the manifestation will turn on again but it will be less these things dont become more and more violent day by day they become less and less day by day providing the whole purification rundown is continued properly at length the vitamins minerals etc longer turn the manifestation on and it is gone there is evidence that amount of vitamins and mineral dosage above certain final level for the given individual will turn the manifestation on again the trick is to take proper gradient with the vitamins and minerals when you go out gradient they can turn on awfully hard so dont get in rush and dont chicken out either emotions that have been shut off may start to reappear the person can blow through stupidity and become more aware he may find he can do actions more easily and consequences start to take on new meaning to him memory can return 175at first some individuals may feel otherdeterminism about doing this program but that will gradually change and he or she will want to do it on his own determinism and for his or her own welfare most individuals embrace it with enthusiasm as long as the precautions listed earlier are well taken and the procedure followed exactly as given the solution to any manifestation is to continue the program until the phenomenon blows the manifestations become less and less frequent until finally they cease altogether trips if person is having trips during the program he should take lot of extra vitamin b complex and vitamin c in correct ratio to other vitamins as these aid the body especially the liver in getting rid of the drugs in the system normally the vitamins and minerals in the program are sufficient for the body to handle the residual drugs which come out administration the advices on the administration of the purification rundown are taken from the practical experience of large pilot projects they should not be lightly disregarded one may find that people administering the program tend to enter their own fads and hobbies into it or needing it themselves avoid delivering it the purification rundown runs best when purely delivered any org or person administering it should get signed release or quit claim from the person as is usual b see that the person understands that the action is being undertaken to help free him as spirit and is not medical treatment c medication of medical nature vitamins minerals and oils are food d brief the person as to what he can expect and why making promises getting his promise to follow orders and complete the rundown and not blow it because its uncomfortable or because he is lazy or has other appointments testing battery of tests should be done on the individual and should be done before and after the purification rundown these would include oca iq any learning rate tests that may exist and any other tests which would give before and after picture of the person these of course include weight blood pressure etc the purification program must be tightly supervised to be successful the program is done under the close supervision of the medical officer the purification program in charge and the case supervisor purification program in charge the in charge will be the d of p for org public or the dpe or other appointed person for org staff the program ic must closely supervise each persons progress on the program and must ensure the program is done faithfully and with all points of the program in when supervising large group the program ic is assisted by one or more deputies and purification program admin who maintains the progress board handles filing in pc folders and transports folders to and from the cs the persons daily schedule must be set up so that he is always running or sweating in the sauna with at least one other person it is important especially when group of people are doing the purification program at the same time that musters and 176roll calls are held by the program ic or his deputy where individuals are not doing the program in group they should twin up and each twin assumes responsibility for the other and sees that he does the program fully anyone not keeping to his schedule or the program as written is handled by the program ic with warnings cramming chits or ethics as needed the program ic is responsible for seeing that everyone participating in the program gets through it correctly and completely and attests to it upon completion medical officer before beginning the purification program person must first get written medical officer okay the medical officer gives person okay to go onto the program only after ensuring that the persons blood pressure is normal and that he is not anemic the mo does these checks himself where he is trained to do so he also checks for any vitamin and mineral deficiencies the person may have and gets him onto program of vitamin and mineral supplements to correct this thorough medical examination by doctor may in some cases be required before person is given medical okay to begin the purification program while on the program the person daily reports in to the medical officer who issues him his vitamins minerals niacin and oil and sees how he is doing blood pressure and anemia checks are redone as needed he also writes up any needed medical reports on the person and these are immediately filed in his pc folder for the cs to inspect case supervisor cs okay to begin the program is required the cs then continues to supervise the progress of each person on the program on daily basis it must be noted that this is fully csed action daily reports each program participant writes daily report which includes 1 how long he jogged 2 how long he sweated in the sauna 3 vitamins taken and in what amount 4 minerals taken and in what amount 5 niacin taken and in what amount 6 calmag taken and in what amount 7 salt taken and in what amount 8 weight include any gain or loss 9 any occurrences somatics restimulations 10 wins the daily reports are given to the program ic or his deputy or are placed in his basket they are read by the ic to ensure the person is doing the program and then filed in his pc folder which goes in to the cs the cs verifies each persons daily progress initialling the daily report and any medical reports to show he has inspected them and writes orders to correct any outtech found such as not taking the right vitamins etc the folder is returned to the program ic who checks the written cs and executes any cs orders such as getting the person back onto the correct vitamins getting the person to attest and so on the program is run in this fashion until it is completed 177end phenomena the purpose of this program is very simply to clean out and purify ones system of all the accumulated impurities such as drugs insecticides and pesticides food preservatives etc etc for someone who has taken lsd or angel dust this would include getting rid of any residual crystals from the body when this has been accomplished the program is complete as the person goes through the purification program one should be able to see an improvement in his physical wellbeing as he rids the system of its accumulated impurities obviously if the person is still feeling the effects of past drugs or chemicals going into restimulation the program cannot be considered complete and must be continued until all these manifestations have turned off completely the product of this program is purified body free from the impurities drugs etc that had accumulated in it it is up to the cs to send the person to attest when the above product has been achieved continuation of the vitamins minerals oil vegetables and calmag at least at the rate of recommended daily requirements in balanced amounts is wise after the rundown is completed sudden cessation of such heavy vitamin dosage can itself produce letdown it is possible the person should come off them on steep gradient rather than abruptly particularly where drug damage to the brain or nerves has occurred the body needs these things to rebuild itself if one doesnt do the above there can be brief apparency of letdown remember that the person has probably been leading an unhealthy life without proper nutrition sleep and exercise so it would be good idea to recommend moderate daily dietetic and exercise disciplines so he will stay healthy having nothing to do with therapy if such letdown occurs the cs should take the above into account otherwise he may be puzzled he will find certain number skimped the rundown are unflat but the majority of such simply went back to an exerciseless five packs of cigs day vitamin and mineral deprived life such regimen recommendations are up to people who specialize in them fads please the cs must remember that the person should now be restored to any interrupted program or csed for his next level or if he is also pts should be deptsed for most the next cs would be objective processing the person has not finished his processing with the purification rundown he has just cleared the way to get real case gains length of program one should be able to get through the whole program in two weeks at five hours day some will take more and some will take less if the procedure in this hcob is exactly followed this will not become long drawnout action summary with the purification program we now have the means to get rapid recovery from the effects of the accumulation of the environmental chemical poisons as well as the medical drugs and street drugs which inhibit the progress of cases by reducing the time required for sweat out and increasing its efficiency we are able to make the purification program single easily completed step 178with the inclusion of vitamins minerals and oils we are able to work toward restoring the biochemical balance of the body and make it possible for the body to reconstruct itself from the damage done by drugs and other biochemical substances we have brought the person up to the level where he is now ready for processing and can truly achieve biophysical and then mental and spiritual gain from this step alone one will see some sparkling results the purification rundown should be ideally followed by auditing the type of auditing most beneficial for the next step is objective processing an enormous body of work exists for this next level none of which is changed by the purification rundown the purification rundown only undercuts it as the world sinks we get below it to prop it up lets give this program total push and take major step toward drugfree society and planet l ron hubbard founder lrhgal copyright 19781979 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved the purification rundown has as its sole purpose the handling of the restimulative effects of drugs and toxic residuals on spiritual being the purification rundown is spiritual activity based on and administered according to the doctrine and practices of the religion of scientology as set forth in the writings of l ron hubbard and adopted by the church part of the rundown is intended as the diagnosis prescription for or treatment of any bodily or physical condition or ill the church is not responsible for the handling of any bodily or physical condition or ill it being the responsibility of the individual to seek the competent medical advice

1978ra 1 addition of 20 december 1979 remimeo the purification rundown errata and additions amendment to hcob 6 feb 78ra the purification rundown replaces the sweat program errata in hcob 6 feb 78ra the purification rundown replaces the sweat program under exercise and sauna page 167 in the twelfth paragraph from the top of the page clarification was omitted at the end of the last sentence this paragraph with the full clarification added is amended to read running is done on daily basis once the person has been assigned to this program it is done in rubberized or vinyltype sweat suit when persons are not also being given sauna or steam bath treatment when the purification rundown is being delivered with the sauna the rubberized or vinyltype sweat suit is omitted in running but the running is still done and is necessary part of the rundown in other words when the person is doing the purification rundown standardly and using the sauna he must also run to work up his circulation prior to going into the sauna but he does not wear rubberized or vinyltype sweat suit when he runs when sauna is not available some but much slower results are obtained by running in rubberized sweat suit as in the original sweat out program which has now been supplemented by my later discoveries additions exercise and sauna as stated in hcob 6 feb 78ra the bulk of the 5 hours daily period of running and sauna sweat out is best spent in the sauna after the circulation has been worked up by running it should be reemphasized here that the 5hour period is not 50 exercising and 50 sauna the rundown gives best results and works like bomb with much lower percentage of time exercising and much higher percentage in the sauna sauna when people get too warm or feeling faint or when the body temperature gets too high in the sauna it is permissible for one to go out and take shower and then go back into the sauna one could get overheated to the point of simply keeling over due to the heat and the handling for this is to take cold shower people who are having hard time spending consecutive hours in the sauna are permitted to do so similar manifestation can be caused by lack of salt or potassium so one must watch for any symptoms of salt or potassium depletion and handle such manifestations with extra salt intake or potassium gluconate tablets as covered on page 168 of hcob 6 feb 78ra 180it is advisable not to fall asleep in the sauna as overheating or salt or potassium depletion could occur while one was asleep steam baths steam baths at similar temperatures to the sauna can be used by themselves when available they serve much the same purpose as the dry sauna and it has been suggested that steam bath may even work faster but this has not been tested or confirmed the steam bath is not preferable to sauna but produces similar effect either can be used the same tips and precautions apply to the use of steam bath as to the sauna eucalyptus oil small quantity of eucalyptus oil is sometimes added to the steam in steam bath or similarly used in some saunas in modern sauna or steam bath the procedure is to simply put one or two capfuls of eucalyptus oil in bucket of water in the room as it then evaporates the oil will evaporate before the water does more can be added as needed some people dont like the smell of eucalyptus at all while others find it pleasant if the solution is too strong it can cause watering of the eyes or nausea in some cases thus one would survey before using it and if used it should be in appropriate small quantities used correctly eucalyptus has been reported to be beneficial in clearing up the lungs and clearing the sinuses one person has reported his voice smoothing out as result of using eucalyptus oil in the sauna it is not mandatory step on the purification rundown but as an optional step the data given here on the use of eucalyptus oil in the sauna or steam bath should be known whether or not eucalyptus is used it goes without saying that sauna or steam bath should be kept hygienic and free of odors by scrubbing the room at least once or oftener daily l ron hubbard founder lrhnc copyright 1 9781979 by l

word hcob 17 jul 79 i word clearing series 64 the misunderstood word defined in research concerning word clearing study and training done with various groups over the recent past months it has become all too obvious that misunderstood word remains misunderstood and will later hang person up unless he clears the meaning of the word in the context of the materials being read or studied and also clears it in all of its various uses in general communication when word has several different definitions one cannot limit his understanding of the word to one definition only and call the word understood one must be able to understand the word when at later date it is used in different way how to clear word to clear word one looks it up in good dictionary dictionaries recommended are the oxford english dictionary or the shorter oxford dictionary and funk and wagnalls standard english dictionary the first step is to look rapidly over the definitions to find the one which applies to the context in which the word was misunderstood one reads the definition and uses it in sentences until one has clear concept of that meaning of the word this could require ten or more sentences then one clears each of the other definitions of that word using each in sentences until one has conceptual understanding of each definition the next thing to do is to clear the derivationwhich is the explanation of where the word came from originally this will help gain basic understanding of the word dont clear the technical or specialized definitions math biology etc or obsolete longer used or archaic ancient and longer in general use definitions unless the word is being used that way in the context where it was misunderstood most dictionaries give the idioms of word an idiom is phrase or expression whose meaning cannot be understood from the ordinary meanings of the words for example give in is an english idiom meaning yield quite few words in english have idiomatic uses and these are usually given in dictionary after the definitions of the word itself these idioms have to be cleared one must also clear any other information given about the word such as notes on its usage synonyms etc so as to have full understanding of the word 182if one encounters misunderstood word or symbol in the definition of word being cleared one must clear it right away using this same procedure and then return to the definition one was clearing dictionary symbols and abbreviations are usually given in the front of the dictionary example you are reading the sentence he used to clean chimneys for living and youre not sure what chimneys means you find it in the dictionary and look through the definitions for the one that applies it says flue for the smoke or gases from fire youre not sure what flue means so you look that up it says channel or passage for smoke air or gasses of combustion that fits and makes sense so you use it in some sentences until you have clear concept of it flue in this dictionary has other definitions each of which you would clear and use in sentences look up the derivation of the word flue now go back to chimney the definition flue for the smoke or gases from fire now makes sense so you use it in sentences until you have concept of it you then clear the other definitions one dictionary has an obsolete definition and geological definition you would skip both of these as they arent in common usage now clear up the derivation of the word one finds in the derivation that it origin ally came from the greek word kaminos which means furnace if the word had any synonym studies usage notes or idioms they would all be cleared too that would be the end of clearing chimney context unknown if you dont know the context of the word as in word clearing methods 1 5 when done from list 6 or 8 you should start with the first definition and clear all definitions derivation idioms etc as covered above word chains if you find yourself spending lot of time clearing words within definitions of words you should get simpler dictionary good dictionary will enable you to clear word without having to look up lot of other ones in the process cleared words cleared word is one which has been cleared to the point of full conceptual understanding by clearing each of the common meanings of that word plus any technical or specialized meanings of that word that pertain to the subject being handled 183thats what cleared word is it is word that is understood in metered word clearing this would be accompanied by floating needle and very good indicators there can be more than one fn per word clearing word must end in an fn and vgis off the meter this would be accompanied by very good indicators the above is the way word should be cleared when words are understood

rundown get the auditor m9ed and m4ed and starrated on the rd also make sure that he can operate meter and do trs if he has trouble with it in the future these changes in this rd are considerable and are for immediate use and the earlier rendition of it is not to be used outint as case condition along with r3ra audited over and beyond dianetic clear are primary reasons for case bogs the percentage of outint may be as much as 75 in any given area therefore the int rd run with ned on nonclears and the end of endless int repair rundown are the most important single auditing actions an auditor can do and will produce the most surprising results when the condition is present and is expertly audited interiorization rundown series 4ra urgentimportant the end of endless int repair rundown we needed rundown that would handle what for some pcs has been an endless trail of repair of repair of repair of int i have now fully researched and developed the process to handle this and can release it for broad use the end of endless int repair rundown is just that it is the answer to int troubles the rundown consists of running int by recall by very precise and simple method at first glance it would not seem possible that such process would handle the more resistiveappearing int repair problems which keep coming up on some pcs this appearance is deceptive however as the process is very very effective it runs lightly and easily on pcs but with farreaching results skillfully handled it quite miraculously smooths out and resolves int on both new pcs and those pcs on whom int repeatedly kicks in of course an int rundown has to be run per hcob 4 jan 71r but when it is later found that the int rundown must be repaired then this rundown is used it does not replace the original int rundown which has been newly revised with several more buttons and new era dianetics commands added hcob 4 jan 71r rather it complements it the end of endless int repair rd can be run on dianetic clears as it addresses int with recalls 189note it can not be run on any pc or preot in the noninterference zone those between r6 solo and ot 111 attest as the end of endless int repair rd is major action not repair action it is forbidden to be run on anyone in the noninterference zone where person in the noninterference zone has been run on end of endless int he should finish up his current solo level as feasible and get onto his next solo level anyone who has been run on end of endless int while on ot iii should be finished up as feasible on solo ot iii and gotten onto ned for ots in certain isolated cases this process could be used as preliminary method for handling int on pcs who are weak or ill and not immediately up to running engrams or secondaries or it could be used to cool down outint on new pc who exteriorizes on objectives and has not yet had dn cs1 or any ned auditing but it is not substitute for the revised int rundown and in the above instances you may find the pc may eventually need the revised int rundown itself the prime purpose and use of the end of endless int repair rundown is exactly as its name implies to handle an endless repair of repair of repair of int if regular int rundown has been done and int continues to kick in after fully standard int correction the end of endless int repair rundown is the answer it effectively resolves persistent int problems when to run an end of endless int rundown when an auditor or cs encounters outint on case there is choice of what ac tion to take to handle it the choice depends on what actions have been taken previously on the case on the subject of int the first thing to determine is whether or not int is actually out you cannot audit person on anything else besides int if int is out you also cannot run anything which is not charged reading as to do so hangs the pc with wronguncharged item an auditor getting read on the int section of the cs 53 must be careful to verify that this is valid read and not false read or protest read this is very important as you must not audit pc on int if it is not charged and you must not audit pc on anything else if int is out you determine whether the pc has already had an int rundown and whether it was correctly done or flubbed if it was flubbed were dianetic errors repaired with an l3rf on the dianetic chains has the pc had an int rundown correction list these must be determined because the end of endless int rundown is not substitute for the int rundown and it does not substitute for an int rundown correction list dianetic errors must be repaired with an l3rf these must be determined by folder study and fes of the int rundown and any repairs of int rundown if the pc has had an int rundown and it has been flubbed you would do an int rundown correction list and handle all of the various actions necessary providing this is within the normal time span of the rundown dont try this months or years later the end of endless int rundown will not repair flagrant dianetic errors if the pc is having or was recently given an int rundown which has bogged or failed then an int rundown correction list including repair of any dianetic errors is to be done if the pc still has outint despite having had the int rundown and it has been repaired and all that is usual and ordinary has been done then you would do the end of endless int rundown you must determine whether the pc is dianetic clear or whether he has become one somewhere along the line if the pc has had dianetic clear rehabbed since the original int rd check the dates to determine whether the pc was run on the int rd by r3r or r3ra when he was dianetic clear if so this can be repaired by indicating to 190the pc that he was run on the int rd on r3r or r3ra after dianetic cear if these int dianetic chains are now reading repair them by assessing an l3rf and indicating do not get into running or continuing any r3r or r3ra on dianetic clear if the person is dianetic clear and int is still out for some peculiar reason best known to man or beast the only choice we have is the end of endless int rundown the way to determine whether int is out is normally by assessment of the cs 53 buttons and it is on this prepared list that outint is most often detected you dont flatten the button or try to handle the button that was found on the cs 53 this is the one exception on the cs 53 whereby you do not just fn it on the cs 53 and go on we have to examine the condition of the person on the subject of int as above to determine which way to go therefore you stop right there with cs 53 being careful to verify the fact that you actually have read on int and not false read or protest read and remember that some pcs especially when int has been run or repaired when it wasnt charged can get so protesty on the subject that int will now give false read whenever it is mentioned due to protest an auditors trs metering and obnosis of the pc and whether the pc is in session or not have to be bad for this to occur or for the auditor to now fail to determine whether it is valid or false read on int having determined that you do have valid read on int you would not proceed with the cs 53 but end off the session int rundown table the following table tells the auditor and cs which way to go when handling out int once filled out this table should be kept with the pc folder summary in front inside of the pc folder beneath the pgm and the table should be updated yes ais the read on int valid read ____ ____ is there any evidence of the pc having been run on int due to false or protest read ____ ____ any evidence of the read being caused by misu word ____ ____ if yes on above get false read and protest cleaned up or the misu cleared and recheck the buttons on section of cs 53 to find out if int is charged b has the pc had full int rundown ____ ____ if or incomplete it would have to be repaired and completed note the int rd would not be run on dianetic clear clear or ot as they are not to be run on dianetics in any form c has the pc had an int rundown correction list ____ ____ if not and there is any evidence of errors or lack of expected result this should be done before continuing the int rd or doing end of endless int rundown and if the pc has had several int rundown correction lists realize that either the auditor cant make list read or is only getting false reads d have any r3r or r3ra dianetic errors on the int rundown been corrected with an l3rf ____ ____ if not get these repaired as continuing the rd or doing end of endless int rundown wont solve r3r or r3ra errors 191eis the pc dianetic clear or above ____ ____ was the pc dianetic clear when the int rd was run on him by r3r or r3ra ____ ____ if yes to either above you must not run any dianetics but if int is still out after repairing any errors the end of endless int rundown can be done on dianetic clear it can not be done between r6 solo and ot iii attest if the pc was run on dianetics on the int rd after dn cear the first action is to indicate the error of running dianetics after clear and then repair any reading dianetic int chain with an l3rf taking care to handle the reading lines by indication only and not get into any running of dianetics this action alone will often cure any int trouble on dn clear but if int is still reading you can now handle it with the end of endless int rundown the end of endless int rundown procedure having determined that you are going to do the end of endless int rundown from the table above you proceed as follows 1 the auditor has the pc demonstrate the various flows remember that this must not be arduous because it is actually almost auditing to do this and the persons int is out if the pc is triple pc have him demonstrate flows 1 2 3 if the pc is quad pc have him demonstrate flows 1 2 3 0 do not engage in flying ruds word clearing touch assists havingness or any other auditing over outint 2 assess the end of endless int rundown buttons take the largest read 3 you then proceed to run this button with the end of endless int rundown this is done by assessing the flows take the flow that reads the largest and using the recall process that applies to that flow run it until an fn is achieved 4 then reassess all flows youll find the one you ran will be fning another flow will be reading run the best reading flow by the recall process until it fns you repeat this procedure until all flows fn if during the period you are running these flows on that button the pc has large cog fn gis remember that you may have blown all flows at that moment without interrupting the pcs cognition you realize that you are finished with assessing the flows of this button for cautions sake you check the button to see if it now reads of course it will fn 5 you now reassess the whole end of endless int rundown button list the whole list might fn at this point on the other hand it might not if you get read on this assessment you treat it exactly the same as you did priorly steps 3 4 5 you keep this up until you get an fning assessment of the int buttons 6 you then wait week and reassess the int buttons list again if you get read check for false read check for protest make sure it is valid read that you have and if it is you treat that button exactly the same as above and proceed per steps 3 4 5 when you get an fning assessment of the int buttons after the one week wait the end of endless int rundown is complete and the pc is sent to declare 192the int buttons go in went in put in interiorized into something want to go in cant get in kicked out of spaces cant go in being trapped forced in pulled in pushed in example int button assessed put in assess the four flows with the wordings for that button but without using the word recall f1 you were put in something x f2 you put another in something f3 others put others in something x f0 you put yourself in something sf flow 2 reads best so run flow 2 to fn using the entire recall command ie recall time when you put another in something reassess all four flows as above using the same int button examples of the running commands for put in would be if f1 reads recall time when you were put in something to fn if f2 reads recall time when you put another in something to fn if f3 reads recall time when others put others in something to fn if f0 reads recall time when you put yourself in something to fn 193cautions and cs tips the only time you check the button again while assessing flows is when the pc has had cog fn gis at which time you must suspect that the whole button has blown this by the way happens in int rundowns and is the commonest cause of overrun int there is another way of addressing this if the pc isnt getting cognitions to amount to anything when you get all flows on button fning you can end off the session and check the next day to see if the flows are still fning it some times happens where you have not very responsive pc that it takes several days of assessment of the flows which fned yesterday to carry the fn through whole day these flows often read again the next day this is because you are running recall processes and recall processes are simply keyouts therefore you are getting something keying in and keying out and keying in and keying out this is eventually overcome where you are doing this daytoday handling of the same button it would be vital to check the button for read before you assessed the flows on it the next day the oneweek wait is compromise for the 3 to 10 day keyout period you cant say wait for 3 to 10 days so it is set at one week during the rundown there may have been momentary stirup of some kind such as tiny ripple on an auditors trs rendition or badly mishandled origin that could cause an arc break needle or something like this could happen so if you wait week such trouble will key out before you assess the buttons list again or you may have been riding win persistent fn on one button when the whole subject of int is not handled and you will get environmental restimulation remember you are only handling recalls and little more recalls run will probably blow it for good so you are waiting week to see if the environment keys him in again you reassess week later and if the buttons are all clean fine but if something reads on the week later assessment that must mean an engram or something is pretty close to the surface still you then handle it again and this time the little point that was missed will turn up and that will be the end of that you handle the buttons to fning assessment and then that is the end of that the end of endless int repair there is second wait for another week now of course if during the oneweek wait the pc gets keyedin again or orig inates or by reason of bis or manifestation that int is still out you would not robotically wait out the whole week before giving the next session as you now know he is not on persistent fn and you know there is more to handle and on the reassessment of the buttons after the week wait the auditor must again be sure that it is valid read on int and not false or protest read before he launches off into running anything again false reads on the assessment protest reads or the pc suffering from something else entirely besides outint can cause false read on assessment of the int buttons hence the necessity to be sure you have valid read before you proceed and if the pc is caved in or bis about it there is little checklist that tells cs what to do about that too the things that could go wrong are rather simple and are few in number these are int wasnt out in the first place b the pc has been run on false reads c the pc was suffering from something else entirely other than outint d the auditors trs are bad or broke the auditors code the auditors metering was bad giving wrong assessments f the auditor overran fns or reran flow that just fned invalidating the fn just gotten 194g pc had misu on the word recall and was trying to run through engrams on the recall process h the pc had major cog on the subject of int blowing the whole thing and the auditor went on overrunning the int rundown or end of endless int rundown i pc was audited on some other action other than int while int was outsuch as rudiments touch assists word clearing or any other auditing or assist action including illegal 2way comms about his case or auditing coffee shop or eval or inval by his friends or others between sessions j errors on the original int rd werent repaired before starting the end of endless int rundown if cs cant tell by folder inspection which of these it is he can have the pc interviewed by d of p to find out or even get the above assessed to find out which it is vital data on int rd end phenomena exteriorization is not the ep of the int rundown if it happens that the pc goes exterior during the rd you end off gently as in any other auditing but that is not the ep and you may have to pick him up again later and complete the int rd or handle it with the end of endless int repair rundown the ep of the int rundown is more concern or trouble with exteriorization or interiorization this is generally accomplished by auditing the pc to an fning int button list but there is another phenomenon that can occur while running int it is vital that an auditor does not miss this should it happen it goes like this youre auditing along and suddenly some mass discharges down comes the ta you suddenly have floating ta and thats it the pc has hit the ep if you proceed past that point youre in trouble you dont then reassess the int button list and you dont continue running quad flows even if all the flows have not yet been run on one reading button you do nothing but take your paws off the meter and gently end the session if you do otherwise you can mess up case it isnt exteriorization exteriorization could occur at the same time however we could not care less because exteriorization is not the ep of the process but at any point at which the above phenomenon occurs on the int rdmass moves off the ta comes crashing down and you cant keep the needle on the dial because the ta itself is floatingyou end off the rundown because you have the ep what has happened here is that youve blown the stuck flow of going in int sends the ta up because the person has plowed deeper into more and more mass and come out of less and less mass you have been auditing the pc on what has been for eons stuck flow of obsessively going in at any point in the auditing that stuck flow can suddenly give way it heaves in the opposite direction and the stuck flow of going in vanishes when that happens its the end of the process as that is all you want to ac complish with the int rundown 195if you were then to check the int button list which you do not do at this point you would find the int buttons all fning repairing repair over the years int auditing has tended to be flubby int repair has been far too frequent and even repetitive on some pcs some auditors and cses have decided int rds were delicate or difficult or very special well int is special and sometimes delicate but its not difficult if an auditor is going to audit the int rundown successfully he must be skilled at metering he must be flubless on r3ra and the commands of the process and understand the theory of int he must know what an fn is and what dianetic ep is and be able to recognize these when they occur much of the int repair needed stems from errors made by auditors or cses running int when it was not needed running it with the idea it would exteriorize the pc auditing the rd over misunderstoods overrunning the rd these are all violations of the auditors code many of them then further complicated by dianetic errors in running or repairing int there is another factor regarding the original int rundown which must not be overlooked although it comes under the heading of overrunning the int rundown it is sometimes neither seen nor understood in doing the original int rundown it can occur that it completes before all flows are run example the auditor runs flow i on engrams on the revised int rd then flow 2 and suddenly gets wide persistent fn and dramatic resurge of the pc the ta goes into lower range and the pc is bright and smiling then the auditor if hes an idiot proceeds to robotically run flow 3 and flow 0 the ta goes back up the pcs chronic headache turns back on and the pc is set up for an endless repair of int i have seen this happen several times the int rundown finished itself and body noticed except the pc this is probably the most flagrant cause of int repair and is peculiar to this rundown the way to handle this is to rehab the point of completion as best you can and then run the recall version as given above and you will find that it usually comes out straight the best way to handle of course is to do it right in the first place but if added to any or all of the above you get an int correction list misassessed so that whats really wrong is missed and falsely reading item taken up you wind up with mess there is excuse for overrunning the rundown for auditors code breaks poor metering or flubby dianetic auditing on the other hand interiorization like any other condition connected with grams may have many chains connected with it thus the process of daytoday living can restimulate those chains and throw int out cs faced with the possibility of any or all of the above being wrong could find himself staring into maze and he could err and order correction list after correction list ad infinitum the rule is the correct action to take first if someone is having trouble with int is to always get thorough fes done on the original int rd itself and any int repairs that have been donebefore another correction list is ordered 196very often the answer to the puzzle then leaps out get the errors corrected correctly any misassessed lists misrun dianetic chains code breaksget it all cleaned up by an auditor who can read meter and run and repair dianetics flublessly dont let any auditor who isnt flubless on these points near an int pc with the errors truly and standardly handled and out of the way if int then continues to kick in its not another int rd or another int correction list its the end of endless int repair rundown you use run it to its ep and that will be the end of the trail of endless int repair if the cs is in doubt about all this and gets into mess trying to repair chains he can cut directly onto this repair rundown as above with simply the recall processes and he will get someplace after an int rd or end of endless int rundown has been completed on case and declared the next action must be cs 53 assessed and handled to fning list this must be done as the next action and may not be left not done the reason for this is that there are other things that can be wrong with case all of which are covered on the cs 53 and these too must be handled there is reason now for any pc or cs to continue to be plagued with int troubles we have here rundown which is easily and simply done which can be run on dianetic cear or preot who is not on ot iii or anywhere between r6 solo and ot iii attest on fragile pcs or weak or ill pcs and is rescue from overrepair l ron hubbard

dianetics r3ra com mands with the assessed int button as the running item the rundown and its repair do not include the use of new era dianetics preassessment nor any form of aesps in int you can only address int preassessment addresses something else wins are sometimes reported on the use of preassessment on int but it is dangerous and dicey procedure it isnt really directly addressing int that actually violates the law that when handling int you run only int nothing else using preassessment whereas you might have one win youll have five failures along with it sure somebody got some wins on it but the next five guys will cave right in and go over the cliff the apparency of the win is this int flattened and this went unnoticed and then they were running an original item having to do with headaches or some other symp tom this was then preassessed and the person was on the line with r3ra which of course can be run after youve done an int rundown so the apparency here is that the use of preassessment handled int whereas int probably had actually flattened first and then the person was able to get gains from the preassessment and auditing that was done this could go in the opposite direction for example with int still unflat you go into preassessment and youre not now addressing the subject of int itself you are now into chains that are not int chains with the int chains themselves restimulated but not yet run or not fully run so it is actually violation of basic tech and it would very swiftly get into tangled mess the rule is when handling int you address only int nothing else and you do not run preassessment or aesps on int we have new simplified int rundown with which to handle it and an extremely workable process in the end of endless int repair rundown

question the existence of thetan that the individual was thetan not body and disproved that man was an animal and proved that he was spiritual being timeless and deathless _________ the issues on exteriorization and interiorization and the handling of outint have now been collected into the interiorization rundown series we have had the remedy for outint the interiorization rundown for some years now but we have also had pcs who ran into the need for excessive repair of the remedy itself much of this need for repair has stemmed from auditor errors in running or repairing int and these have been enumerated on other bulletins whatever the reasons for repair simple effective method of repairing int was needed this need has now been filled with the release of the new end of endless int repair rundown with the research that was done to develop this repair rundown which uses re calls i have also had the opportunity to reevaluate the original int rundown itself the result is newly revised int rundown so we have two very effective new tools for handling int 1 simplified interiorization rundown 2 the end of endless int repair rundown which handles int repair smoothly and terminatedly by special method of assessment and running it on recall flows the full steps of both of these rundowns are included in issues in the interioriza tion rundown series 211note per hcob 12

repair rd hcob 24 sep 78 i int rd series 4 as it runs int on recalls additionally the basics on exteriorization and interiorization are covered quite fully in the int rd series particularly in hcob 4 jan 71r exteriorization and high ta the interiorization rundown revised any auditor who is going to go near an int rundown or an int repair action must know those fundamentals cold he must understand that it is the first of chain or the first part of an experience or first experience basic on the chain of incidents that has to be run for the chain or incident to erase in other words he must understand the principle of getting the earlier beginning to an incident or an earlier incident in order to erase chains as in r3ra he must understand that if one is in something he must have gotten into it and that therefore the beginning of an exteriorization is an interiorization the full theory on this also is covered in the above hcob 4 jan 71r which the auditor should be fully familiar with there is some further data which you should have on the subject of int and flows basically int is compound of stuck flows and prior incidents there is stuck flow of obsessively going in in most of the pcs int engrams youve got an operating trigger that puts him into them the earlier beginning is always in these must be audited out blown before youre through with int the way this trigger works is for example pc may blow out of his head with fn vgis on tuesday but he has not erased the basic on int he went out on reaction flow on tuesday on friday he comes in with his ta at 5 what has hap pened is the flow has retriggered hes now blown back in on rereaction flow any regular auditing and he will plow in deeper so youve got to handle his int terminatedly prior to now an int rundown has been done by clearing and then assessing the int buttons went in and go in if one of them read the int button was first run on recall triple or quad flows next on secondaries triple or quad flows and then on engrams triple or quad flows this handled int for many many pcs but it is probable that one reason we also got so many int repairs was that in many of these repair cases the pc never ran any basic beginning the int rundown with recalls with the stuck flow of going in still in operation you could get keyout keyin keyout keyin repeatedly and not get to the basic we had an exteriorization command in the early years which was try not to be three feet back of your head and it exteriorized people but all that did was unstick the flow and trigger the person out of his head youre likely to get the same result if you run int by recall first crack you give the command recall time and boom hes out but he hasnt run the basic on int so if you entered an int rundown on recall basis you could get some of that mechanism cutting in and you could get repetitive int with the engrams he didnt run out keying in there is another phenomenon that can occur time itself can be stuck flow you get certain number of pcs who cant move back on the time track more than minutes they get stuck on the stuck flow of time on recall commands such pc may fn very quickly or even on an r3ra command locate time when you went in 212he may run shallow he may run only locks and fn quickly then suddenly he hits the skids and goes hurtling backtrack the flow is reversed and he doesnt fire out of his head he fires backwards on the time track on restim and youll have outint repeating itself all over again thats the rest of the mechanism addressed in r3ra engram auditing properly done always getting the earlier beginning andor the earlier incident these chains of incidents on the stuck flow of going in can be audited out in an orderly fashion on the majority of pcs you erase the engrams and you dissolve the obsessive stuck flow of going in and you have the ep of int or at some point in the engram auditing the flow gets unstuck enough to heave into reverse it heaves in the opposite direction and it erases itself and the whole package blows that too is an ep for int which must not be ignored by the auditor see hcob 4 jan 71r thereafter the pc will usually have more trouble or concern with int so we are safer entering the int rundown by running engrams to begin with and running only engrams on that rundown and that is how the revised int rundown has now been set up we had better run the engram chains and their basics out first and then if repair is needed repair them with recalls using the end of endless int repair rundown more on recalls entering int with recalls has its liabilities as described above but there are also definite advantages in having recalls as tool to use as necessary in running int on some cases you are going to encounter some few isolated instances where the pc cant run engrams for one reason or another such pcs can then be audited by the recall method as given in the end of endless int repair rundown using the rundown not as repair but as process dianetic clears scn clears and ots can be handled on outint with this method it can also be used to relieve outint on weak or ill pcs until they are up to running engrams it is not fast method using the recall system per end of endless int repair rd to run outint can go on and on in time though by taking the pc up on gradient you can eventually get him to point where he is actually asising engrams blowing them by inspection the revised int rundown is by far the swifter route for handling pc initially on outint however the use of recalls is ideal in the handling of repair of int when it is necessary after an int rundown has been done the end of endless int repair run down gives the exact method for assessment of the int buttons and flows and running these on recalls as repair action and here we get smooth run on the recall flows and the resolving of any int troubles thus from this research we get new simplified version of the int rundown and an invaluable process for any int repair further issues in

occur most frequently on int handling which cs must be on the alert for 1 doing or running anything else before an int rundown when one is needed 2 overrunning the int rundown by far the commonest error is number one above it happens most often at the very beginning of session on int itself by the auditor engaging in twoway comm or ruds or belabored and overcomplicated clearing of commands or some other action than getting right onto the running of int this is flagrant when i was csing it is what i kept running intothe auditor doing all kinds of preliminary steps before starting int it boils down to auditing over outint and it cant be done youll get the auditor who says but all i did was ask him how he was feeling thats enough thats twoway comm and you cant run anything else but int when int is out and that includes twoway comm you dont ask the pc how he feels about anything you just start the int rundown so thats the first major error to watch for somebody trying to run something else before the int rundown itself the second is overrun pc has big cognition big win ta blowdown and the auditor misses it goes right on past it and continues auditing or the pc exteriorizes and the auditor continues past exterior there is vital data on the end phenomena of int on hcob 4 jan 71r int rd series 2 and both cs and auditor must have this data and know and be able to recognize the ep of int when it occurs otherwise it will really mess up case those are the two major violations cs and an auditor must not permit in the running of int if it is to be successful because they are the most major errors they have been included first on the checklist below cs checklist for detecting errors on int the following is checklist to be used in the csing of int the cs checks bogged session or any session on int against this list to detect the exact cause of the trouble or an error that could be the source of future trouble in ensuing sessions 2171 doing or running anything else before an int rundown when one is needed includes ruds 2way comm l1c anything 2 auditing over outint 3 overrunning the int rundown 4 auditing past exterior 5 overdoing the clearing steps preceding the actual rundown 6 running an int button that only read on an mu or false read failure to clear an int button before running it 7 clearing all of the int buttons before assessment instead of clearing only the button with the largest valid read 8 failure to use suppress invalidate and misunderstood on an unreading int button list 9 misassessment of the int button list 10 doing an int rundown when none of the buttons have read constitutes running an unreading item 11 auditor cant get reads or make list read 12 not taking the int rundown to its full ep 13 not understanding the theory of int and r3ra and why one goes earlier or asks for an earlier beginning to the incident 14 running the concept of was in or stuck in instead of the concept of moving in or going in on whatever the reading int button is 15 not repeating the actual button for the chain when asking for an earlier incident not knowing r3ra commands 16 not completing chain to full dianetic ep 17 not completing any one flow on an int button in one session thus ending session on an unflat flow 18 introducing flow 0 to pc for the first time on int rundown or int repair ie running triple pc on quad flows 19 auditing over an earlier dianetic error 20 auditing the rundown to exteriorize the pc 21 using preassessment or aesps on int 22 misassessing or incorrectly handling the int correction list 23 overcorrecting the int rundown 24 running dianetics on dianetic clear scn clear or ot 25 and on the part of the cs attempting to correct botched int rundown without full fes of the int rd or any int repair being done first ___________ 218the above points are all covered fully in the int rundown series cases that are not running well on int will be found to have had one or more of these errors com mitted on them using the above list to spot and prevent int errors will make the css job lighter and give both auditor and pc smoother run on int l ron hubbard founder lrh jk copyright 1978 by l ron

above auditors cs series 53 use of the cs series 53 short form is the basic prepared list used by auditors to get ta up or down into normal range or to correct case outnesses it contains every element that could be wrong with the mind it is written the way it is because we just want to know if subject reads in the pcs mind and if so you handle it to fn the cs series 53 long form is exactly the same as the short form except that it puts the items into full questions so that less educated pc can understand what is being asked the questions actually limit its use bit but are needed with uneducated pcs the limit comes about through making the questions bit too specific whereas the general questions of the short form dont say to what they apply so are less limited both the short form and the long form are assessed method 5 this means going down the list calling off the items or questions to the pc watching the meter and marking any tick small fall fall long fall long fall blowdown to what ta do not take up instant fns you can program instant fns but not off cs 53 the order the reads must be taken up is built into the list itself you cant audit case on anything if int is out auditing must be very limited if list is out if you audit over an arc break very long the pc will go into sad effect if you audit over problem the pc wont make case gain if you audit over withhold the pc will get mad at you if you look at this and compare it to the cs 53 you will see that the list itself is built on declining order of urgency it is true of the remaining items on the list there are two ways of using cs 53 the first is to simply assess it and indicate the largest read this is sort of brushoff but is very useful in handling blown students or pcs will get off charge and get them back into the org or more comfortable the other way is its proper use in session you simply start at the first read and handle it go to the next read and handle it etc note that this is at variance with the general handling of prepared lists where you simply take the largest read and next largest read and so forth that an item reads with the exception of int does not mean you have to do full rundown at that point you just have to fn it if further actions are needed to take an item to full handling get it onto the pcs advance program this includes drug handling etc but not as ive said int if int reads you handle it fully because auditing can take place over outint if he has already had full int rd you would run the end of endless int repair rundown if he or she is already clear or ot and has not had an int rd you would run the end of endless int repair rundown as the primary action the object of the cs 53 is to key out things that are bothering the pc and get anything you found on the list to an fn that something read except int does not mean the auditor doing the cs 53 must at once run up 110 hours of auditing before he can finish the cs 53 to an fning list auditors who dont realize this can get stuck in on cs 53 mostly because they misconceive cs 53 to be wholly case analysis list 220its primary purpose is to get the case rolling so you can do something else that is scheduled on the pcs program because it can be made to serve as case analysis and is sometimes called for by cs to help him do repair or advance program or to confirm it sometimes misleads the auditor into believing he is not supposed to fn the list i have even used cs 53 in d of p interview when the pc wasnt speaking up then by getting the reads i could program the pc and unless it was int reading i would conclude the interview simply by indicating the largest read which would get my fn and let the pc go away happy while we really got to work on him in the cs department so the cs 53 is child of many uses as it does after all contain all the elements known to us that bring about case foulups clears and ots sections d and of the cs 53 can be assessed on clears and ots and dianetic clears however do not engage in any activity that brings about further engram running the correct way to handle clears and ots if you get read in section d is indicate and let him tell you about it if he wishes to get an fn on section you can do an l3rf but you must not do more than indicate the item you must not engage in engram running ref hcob 12 sep 78 dianetics forbidden on clears and ots you realize of course that lsd and some other drugs can apparently stay in the physiological body and release themselves now and then if clear ot or dianetic clear got read on section d drugs etc and it didnt clear up easily you would program the person for sweat program and even objectives you would not however do any engram running on the drugs even recalls might be bit dicey the sweat program and objectives would however handle if you got into the goofy situation of heavy or persistent section d reads on clear ot or dianetic clear it would not be very usual but you better know about it on section engrams and masses etc if you got reads on clear ot or dianetic clear you could indicate them and if they didnt clear to fn you could do an l3rf remembering that the instructions on the l3rf handlings do not apply your actions as an auditor would simply be to indicate the read and you would probably get your fn providing of course your read wasnt false the way to program persistent read on this would be to get the person up to ot i ii and iii fast and then program ned for ots but whatever you do dont try to run these reads out with dianetics the rest of the cs 53 except d and as above is quite valid on clears ots and dianetic clears as it is mostly concerned with think environment and practices fning cs 53 unless you run into the necessity to do an int handling or you goof or get false reads you can fn whole cs 53 rather rapidly cs 53 to fning list getting cs 53 to an fning list is done by method 5ing it handling any int rd necessary and handling the rest of the items each to fn you then method 5 the whole cs 53 again you may pick up an additional read or two you fn these hopefully if int is now handled properly if it did read in the first place it wont read again but if it does you have the end of endless int repair 221rd which if done already may not have been carried to ep so you simply get it carried to ep which is an fning int button list you then method 5 the cs 53 again you will probably get an fning assess ment throughout if you dont you simply method 5 it again the eventual ep of getting prepared list to fn will occur unless the meter the auditors metering or trs or use of the list are badly out the thing to do in that event is to get another auditor or get liberally crammed or retreaded as frankly fning cs 53 is piece of cake fning cs 53 to fning list is relatively easy to do and can produce re markable resurgence of case its an easy and simple way to do setup for major rundown bug some pcs particularly those who have false ta have gotten so bugged by cs 53s being done on them that when they see an auditor reach for one they react adversely the way to handle this is 2wc the cs 53 itself taking the fns and ignore ing the ta position and then do full false ta handling on the pc per hcob 21 jan 77ra false ta checklist in essence what you have discovered is the biggest reading item of all without even looking at your meter further repair is needed than the above as cs 53 will now work like clock and can be done smoothly and correctly it will even pick up the latent charge of endless cs 53s if you do the above the cs 53 series is wonderful tool and like any tool can be well handled or mishandled part of its proper use is understanding exactly what it is and handling it with good meter good metering and good trs there is other document in history that has rounded up so completely the fac tors which can be wrong with the mind and also put it in its short form on one sheet of paper l ron hubbard founder lrhdr copyright 1978 by l ron hubbard all

and join in theres inbetween point course or any activity for that matter cannot be run semistandardly or with pretty much inethics it must be run with totally standard tech and inethics if this is not the case youll get gradually lowered ethics level admin will go out and standard tech slips down to some of the tech being applied when we can when student or supervisor goes into course room and

has been duly trained and certified in the confessional procedure of the church of scientology and is in good standing with the church with his certificates in force is invested with the power to forgive the admitted sins of an individual to whom he has administered full confessional procedure confessionals have been part and parcel of religion nearly as long as religion has existed it has been broadly recognized down through the ages that only when person has owned up to his sins can he experience relief from the burden of guilt he carries because of them in scientology we have had since the early years procedures whereby an indi vidual is able to confess his withholds and the overt acts underlying them we have long known that confessing ones overt acts is the first step toward taking responsi bility for them and seeking to make things right again the acknowledgement that follows each confession in scientology procedure is an assurance to the person that his confession has been heard such assurance helps him to end cycle on the bad things he has done and unsticks him from preoccupation with his guilt over them to where he can then put his attention on constructive activities that is the purpose of any confessional there is another element that further helps the individual to accomplish this and that is forgiveness thus at the end of confessional when it has been fully completed the scien tology auditor who has administered the confessional must inform the person that he is forgiven for the sins he has just confessed and that he is cleared of these sins and free of them the statement that is used is by the power invested in any overts and withholds you have fully and truthfully told are forgiven by scientologists special certificate is to be issued to each scientology minister who has been trained and certified on the level ii course or the confessional course to administer confessional procedure and who is in good standing with the church with his certifi cates in force investing him with the power to forgive the sins confessed to him by an individual in confessional session 225any auditor who is trained to deliver the ethics repair list has priority in the issuance of such certificate l ron hubbard founder lrhjknc copyright 1978 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 226hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead

usual response is instant relief and vgis rarely the person may react adversely such as not being able to accept forgiveness or still feeling bad this is because something has been missed the person is still stuck in the shame blame and regret of the unconfessed overt or withhold and will not feel better until all is told the scientology minister encountering this in session must get the rest of the withhold or repair the withhold session should the person show this reaction later outside of session the folder must be turned in to the cs to handle immediately an incomplete confession can be due to the following errors did not tell all b thought of one overt but told different overt c told part of withhold but not the rest d an overt or withhold was not taken earlier similar to basic during the session an overt or withhold was restimulated but not asked for or gotten off f there have been errors in the confessional such as withholds gotten off more than once false reads outtrs

generated the exact time and the exact conditions and the exact person who did it he would then get disappearance of the thing dating is the action the auditor takes to help the pc spot the exact time something happened locating is the action the auditor takes to help the pc spot the exact place some thing happened by dating and locating getting the exact time and place specific thing happened the pc is able to blow the mass and energy connected with the occurrence which has hung him up at that point datelocate as called for in the various prepared correction lists is very effec tive tool for the handling of certain items found to be out on such list these could be points of overrun wins that have been bypassed or invalidated in some way moments of loss trauma painful emotion or any of various stuck points of this nature it is also used in the correction of wrong dates or wrong locations given the pc in previous auditing in any of these cases the pc will be somewhat stuck at these points or at the very least will have some attention units hung up at these points and getting the exact when and where will unstick him that which is viewed in its own time place form and event can be asised why you date and locate person can have wrong date for an incident or he might have date totally occluded he might have confusion on two incidents thinking one happened before the other when it is actually vice versa he could have two incidents collapsed into one timewise or more severely he can be stuck in the time of an incident which acts as present time for him in other words that time is still in existence for him in pt he is seeing things from that point in time 228by dating it exactly you blow the stuck viewpoint in time you see it as blow down on the meter and the pc will feel the sudden dissipation of mass the question might then arise if you have dated an incident to blow what is there left to blow on the locate step the answer is that in addition to stuck view point in time person can have stuck viewpoint of location since he had the wrong time he could as well have the wrong location or an occluded location or confusion between two or more locations he could be quite stuck in past location that past location is still in existence for him the point of view from that location is still there for him so you date and locate finding when it was and where it was blows both the time of the incident and the place of the incident if hes still hung up in either of these hes out of present time and out of present location getting the precise date and location blows him out of these into present time sometimes during dating the pc spots the correct past location simultaneously with getting the correct date and it the location then blows at the same time the auditor must know that this can occur and recognize when it does as he would not then rotely try to put the pc through the locate steps datelocate not rote procedure while datelocate is precise action it is by means rote procedure the auditor must know the theory of the action if he is to datelocate successfully he must understand that he takes the pcs data and he works with the pc robotic application of the steps will not only not produce the desired result but can result in messing up case badly blow definition of blow the sudden dissipation of mass in the mind with an accom panying feeling of relief technical dictionary this definition must be understood by both auditor and pc it is cleared with the pc before beginning the datelocate steps have the pc demo it using demo kit if necessary so he has confusion on it blow is definite manifestation vital data for the auditor is that the pc must say something blew or it disappeared or its gone or it vanished not simply i feel lighter metering during datinglocating the pc is on the meter but the auditor is consulting the pc and getting the pcs answers while also keeping an eye on the meter he does not resort to meter dating or meter locating unless the pc himself gives up on one or the other of these steps pc can be made more dependent on the meter or can be made more independent of the meter depending upon the way the meter is used by the auditor if the pcs case is improving he becomes more independent of the meter that is the direction you want to go rule use the meter to date and verify date correctness by all means but only after the pc has been unable to come up with the date hcob 4 aug 63 all routines emeter errors comm cycle error the same rule would apply to using the meter on the locate steps 229time when dating anything you are using system of measurement of time there are various systems for measuring time and as time is basically postulate or consideration there is absolute system for measuring time time can be measured in terms of years ago it can be measured by year month and day 1918 ad january 1st these two systems are applicable to this planet as the term year is the time it takes this planet to complete an orbit around the sun in larger whole track dates different systems were used the whole point is to use the system the pc is using because the whole point of dating is to blow past time that the pc is stuck in and the pc will very often use the dating system of the time period he is stuck in it doesnt matter what system of time measurement the pc uses it is important that the auditor accepts and uses the system the pc is using and doesnt try to change it youre first going to ask the pc when was it he may tell you in terms of years ago or weeks ago or he may say it was 1890 or it was the 24th of august 1672 or he may use an earlier track system of dating either way you take it and if he has said high noon on may 2nd 1912 you dont then ask how many years ago as he has just told you and your question would be altering the dating system the pc is using you can use any system of time measurement in dating the important thing is that you use the system the pc is using it is remarkable that pc can date something that happened earlier than this planet in terms of years ago he can by some sort of mental computer but the auditor mustnt require that the pc convert date to some other system and when the pc has it the auditor doesnt then alteris it in sequence found by yearsmonthsweeksdayshoursminutesseconds and fractions of second one doesnt then call it back by day year month as it tangles the pc it is called back in the same order when calling back date as an indication always call it back in the same sequence that the date was found or given implant datesactual dates implant dates usually only give small reads whereas actual dates read well if you suspect that you are getting false dates out of an implant you meter check implant date and youll get read on that question and the false implant date will longer read the actual date will read well meter check if it is false date from an implant b an actual date and the meter read will tell dating the purpose of dating is to get blow of the past time the pc is stuck in whether the pc gives the date or whether the auditor has to meter date it you must remember that all you are going for is blow 230sometimes you will get blow as easily as the pc saying it was long time ago blow is accompanied by bd and fn so be alert when dating for sudden or bd and fn and if the pc doesnt originate that it blew ask him so you wont go on trying to date to blow something that has already blown very often date has to be dated precisely down to the fraction of second in order to get blow if there is blow on pc giving the date or on auditor meter dating it you then call the date back as an indication and it will blow if it doesnt it is because there is an error in the date or the auditor altered the date or its sequence in calling it back or there already was blow on dating that wasnt noticed and was overrun usually pc will need help from the auditor to start with and the auditor might need to do the whole dating drill on the meter establishing the order of magnitude and every part of the date on the meter then the pcs ability improves and the pc starts to become more able to find dates himself the auditor must be alert for this and accept the pcs data and never challenge meter check or invalidate the pcs data sometimes the pc will blurt the whole date out at once and the auditor must be ready to write this down accurately and call it back accurately locations and distance when locating something you are using direction and system of measurement of distance just as time is basically consideration so is distance and there are many systems of measuring distance both on this planet and earlier on the track distance can be measured in miles kilometers lightyears to name few in one whole track space opera civilization intergalactic distances were measured in terms of how long it took particular spaceship called hylan and intergalactic distances were measured by the number of days of hylan spaceflight you will probably find that the pc will tend to use the system of measurement of distance that was used at the time of the past location that he is stuck in just as pc can use sort of mental computer to convert whole track dates into years ago he can also mentally convert some distances into miles but the auditor never expects him to do so and never asks him to you can use any system of measurement of distance in locating the important thing is that you use the system the pc is using and when you have the distance you must call it back accurately and not alteris it in sequence either when calling back distance as an indication always call it back accurately and in the same sequence that it was given or found locating the purpose of locating is to get blow of the past loca tion the pc is stuck in as in dating the auditor may have to help the pc with the meter but usually the pc will be able to find and give the data and the auditor never resorts to the meter if the pc can get it and you may get blow on direction step alone or on the pc realizing it happened somewhere else or not here or greece or whatever the auditor must be alert for the or bd and fn and ask the pc if it blew so as not to go on trying to get blow of location that has already blown 231usually if you dont get blow on finding the direction and distance you will get blow on calling the location back to the pc as an indication if not there is an error in the direction or distance or the auditor altered it in calling it back in locating the auditor is getting the past physical location eg the auditor gets the direction distance what galaxy star planet country etc pinpointing it down to the exact location in space where it happened but these items are not taken up rotely one uses the questions that apply for example if it occurred next door one would not ask what planet or if the pc has said its two years ago when dating in locating one doesnt then ask what galaxy as of course its this one or what star either if you start asking what galaxy on an incident on earth the pc is thrown backtrack and if it happened outside town in the open you wouldnt ask what city house or street or room either you must use the questions that apply the pc is of course in the auditing room one doesnt ask where he is and its never who else was there or what else is there as these things put the pc down the track one does not try to run engrams at the same time one is doing the locate step it is simply location where what how far location and in locating if there is instant blow when the location is fully spotted and it seems correct the location is called back to the pc it usually blows when it is called back to the pc after it is known two separate drills there are two separate drills for dating and locating and which is used depends upon pc ability to find and give the data the first drill given is where the pc volunteers or gives the data the second drill is where the auditor establishes all the data by metering as with all processing the pcs ability increases as you go along and the auditor must be alert for this and change from meter dating and meter locating to accepting and taking the pcs data it can also happen that pc who was able to find and give the data may run into something particularly heavy and now need assistance from the auditor the rule is never resort to the meter if the pc can find and give the data and never let pc struggle if he cant find the data and never never use the meter to challenge correct or invalidate the pcs data preliminary step before dating and locating on pc for the first time you must clear what you will be doing and the words and terms used so that he understands these and knows what is expected of him 1 give the pc an rfactor that you will be dating the past time of the incident ie when it happened until that blows 2 clear the word blow with the pc per the tech dictionary definitions 1 and 2 3 clear any misunderstoods the pc has on dates and dating or words used in measurement of time or numbers eg billions etc 2324 give the pc an rfactor that you will be establishing the direction and distance in order to find the past location of the incident ie where it happened until that blows 5 clear the term direction and the concept of pointing clear the term distance and any misunderstoods the pc has on measurement of distance eg miles light years etc 6 let the pc know you will be getting answers from him not the meter unless it is necessary to help him with the meter and that if the pc should suddenly get the date or location he should tell you also let the pc know that you are dating and locating to get blow and that when blow occurs to tell you as the purpose of this procedure is to get the mass to blow dating to blowlocating to blow procedure by steps procedure one pc giving the data dating drill 1 1rfactor were going to date the past time when that ________ happened precisely until the mass blows 2 ask the pc when it happened if the pc doesnt know go to meter dating per dating drill 2 3write down the pcs answer 4 if not already given have the pc give the rest of the date right on down to the fraction of second 5 call the date back to the pc accurately and in the same sequence in which it was given and it will blow caution the blow may occur earlier in the dating steps and the auditor must not go on past blow if you suspect blow and pc hasnt volunteered this ask him if it blew locating drill 1 1 rfactor were going to find the past location where happened precisely until the mass blows 2 get the pc to point to where it happened points with finger in the direction to the past location 3 ask the pc the distance to that location this is the distance from where the pc is now to that past location 4 if not already given have the pc give the rest of the distance right on down to frac tions until you have precise distance 5 call the distance back to the pc accurately and in the same sequence in which it was given and it will blow nbif the pc starts giving you the location in some other terms such as on the corner of times square new york you would of course accept the pcs data and not ask him to convert that into miles away or anything else 233caution the blow may occur earlier in the locating steps and the auditor must not go on past the blow sometimes the blow will occur on asking the pc to point sometimes the pc while dating will also get the location and blow it too if you suspect blow due to bd and fn and the pc hasnt volunteered this ask him if it blew procedure two auditor finding the data by metering dating drill 2 if the pc didnt know when it happened on step 2 of dating drill 1 you go to meter dating 1 establish what system of dating or time measurement this date is measured in such as years ago or by year ie 1918 ad or some entirely different system do not do this if you already know it is this lifetime date or this planet date as that would be robotic 2 establish the order of magnitude 3 meter date the date right on down precisely even to fractions of second until you get blowfn 4 if blowfn when the full date is found call it back to the pc accurately and in the same order it was found and you should get blow 5 if you havent got blow there is either an error in the date or some part of the date or it is not precise enough or it blew earlier and wasnt noticed meter check wrong date incompletely dated implant date some part of the date was incorrect already blown and handle what reads and you will get blowfn locating drill 2 it is rare that pc cant get the direction and distance or otherwise pinpoint the exact past location should you encounter this do the same drill as given in locating drill 1 with the auditor establishing each step by metering 1 get pc to point to the location to get direction 2 establish what system of measurement of distance ie miles or lightyears or whatever 3 get the distance 4 get any remaining increments of distance on down to fractions or decimal points 5 call back the distance or location as an indication and you should get blow fn 6 if blow there has been an error and you should meter check is some part of the location wrong 234wrong direction wrong distance incompletely located already blown and handle what comes up and you will get blowfn caution in datelocate if it bogs and the auditor cant easily correct the error in dating or in locating do not continue messing up the pc with wrong dates or wrong locations as these can be very upsetting to case indicate to the pc that there is an error in dating or locating and end off for cs instructions drill that can be used in locating when applicable is given below this must not however be done rotely when it doesnt apply if you knew the incident occurred in the recent past or this lifetime you would not ask what galaxy as the question wouldnt make sense and would throw the pc backtrack point pc points with finger distance including increments of distance to get the exact distance what galaxy what star what planet what country what city what street what house position on street what room distance from front of house where in the room how far from each wall how far off the floor how far from the ceiling continuing with questions which will narrow it down to the precise location to blowfn note the above steps particularly cannot be rote listen to the pc and work with him realistically to get the location spotted exactly but do not evaluate for him in any way if at some point on these steps the location turns out to be in the middle of the ocean or in field etc the auditor uses available landmarks or reference points to get the location ie distance from the nearest point of land or distance from the big rock down to blowfn if while locating the pc starts running the incident or gives too much scene the auditor has the pc point again then continues from where he left off on the locate steps 235liability in dating and locating there is possible source of bpc peculiar to dating and locating correct date for one incident or mass can act as wrong date for another inci dent or mass as it is wrong date for it correct location for one incident or mass can act as wrong location for other incidents or masses as it is wrong for the others it is peculiar to dating and locating that right date or right location can cause bpc by also being wrong date or wrong location for other incidents or masses this does not always occur but is noted here should an auditor or cs encounter it manifestations of this are pc getting upset inexplicably b getting read on both correct date and wrong date c ta going up d increase of mass or pressure it will relieve on the indication that the date found is wrong date for other inci dents or masses and on the indication that the location found is wrong location for other incidents or masses summary correct date especially if taken down to seconds and fractions of second will blow correct location especially if taken down to minute increments of distance will blow datelocate when done correctly quickly and smoothly works well and is suc cessful the longer it takes the more it will restimulate all sorts of other things which have nothing to do with the course of action the datelocate steps must not be done robotically one has to understand the mechanics of how its done and why the essence of datelocate is to bring the pc to pt by erasing the date by spotting and the location by spotting as the pc is out of pt fixed by both date and location if the theory is understood nobody would do it rotely this is highly precise action to be done smoothly with good trs its results are phenomenal l ron hubbard founder lrhpmdmjk

28 nov 78 auditors who miss withholds penalty as one of the most destructive things an auditor can do is miss withhold on pc and as missing withhold stems exactly from being inexpert outmetering outtrs or mutual outruds and as pcs and staff can blow and cause great deal of trouble when withholds have been missed in sec checking or confessionals the penalty for missing withhold on pc is as follows comm ev and if found guilty suspension of certificates until retrained this penalty has been issued in the past but was omitted in modern compilations it is light thing to mess up sec checking on pc pcs who blow their auditing in orgs staff who want to leave outethics mush rooming up in an org can usually be traced to one or more auditors who miss withholds either by their own outtech or mutual ruds it is highly possible that the reason husbandwife teams often fail is that they have mutual outruds or that they miss withholds on each other this is light thing if this order is not

and that funny behavior of the needle and tone arm might have been floating ta when he went clear note for cses i have found some very interesting case phenomena being resolved since past dianetic clears are attesting to the state some of the manifestations of some of the cases who were audited past dianetic clear unrecognized and unattested to are manifesting ptsness and illnesses until the state was acknowledged and attested to b appearing to be case gain outethics cases c not moving up the bridge but remaining parked at some point they have many reasons for this d becoming inactive as scientologist cs should look for these cases and recognize them when he sees them this in way means that every pts or outethics case has an unacknowledged state of clear underlying it but this fact certainly needs to be included in any css case debug lineup in the cases mentioned above you will almost always find that the condition started at certain point in the pcs auditing or in his last life as pc if you do thorough folder study and interview the pc you will find that he went dianetic clear just prior to the case going awry or by interview you might find he went dianetic clear in his last life note one percent have track dates when they went clear advance scheduling registrars and those working in the central files of an org can go through cf folders and ask the org cs to check the folders of those who have drifted off lines or stopped going up the processing side of the bridge as an unac knowledged dianetic clear state may just be the cause clear in last life some people didnt believe one had lived before this life also some people wondered what happened to old dianeticists and scientologists who had died but 243others used to have the phrase well well pick them up in the next lifetime or the next time around well it seems like the former shouldnt have wondered and the latter were right we are coming up with quite few pcs who had gone clear in their last lifetime during book one auditing goals processing etc this is something that the pc originates or something he has been wondering about but invalidated invaleval the state of clear having been truly attained yet not acknowledged and attested to can cause an extraordinary amount of invalidation evaluation also occurs on this subject and comes from others and even the pc himself because of the amount of inval and eval which may exist pc will often have to have these buttons put in before he can acknowledge the state he has attained in this case this would have to be done before the point he went clear is datelocated in some cases you may have to assess dianetic clear repair list to handle the pcs bypassed charge ethics warning it is commevable offense to coach the pc with data about clear in any way you also do not evaluate for any pc and try to convince him he has gone dianetic clear when he hasnt you do not turn to the pc must have gone dianetic clear when you cant easily solve pcs case you use the cs series in full only cs who is clear and who knows the full ep of dianetic clear can send pc through to attest to this state to send pc through to attest to dianetic clear when he hasnt truly made it is suppressive act as that preclear will not make it on the ot levels if the cs is not clear he should send the person or the persons folders to class iv org cs who is clear or to an ao the power of auditing the power of modern auditing shouldnt be underestimated it was pretty hot in 1950 but realize there were 28 years of research and development this has been enormously stepped up for 28 years apparently the power of auditing has been underestimated with better trained auditors than ever and with their trs and metering really in the cs who is keeping tech in on his lines can expect lot more of this sort of thing so he must be alert to it without at the same time going delusory or failing to handle cases that really are bogged for quite some other reason given standard

completed grades 0iv he can go directly onto the solo audit course and ot 1 4 if dianetic clear is an oldtimer who has had lot of pregrades scientology processes run before formal grades existed you

unreading anything ever for any reason auditing is aimed at reactivity you run what reacts on the meter because it reacts and is therefore part of the reactive mind read means there is charge present and available to run running reading items flows and questions is the only way to make pc better this is our purpose in auditing to run unreading flows etc requires the pc to run analytical answers or to run things that arent there or to put something there to run the most trouble you can get pc into is running him on uncharged items or flows for an auditor to sit in session watching meter that didnt read looking expectantly at the pc for an answer to an uncharged question flow or item is gae and will wreck cases faster than anything you can do so you must check questions flows or items before running anything if it doesnt read you just say thank you and go on to the next one you would of course use the buttons to ensure nothing was suppressed invalidated or misunderstood before leaving an unreading item flow or question this is probably one of the reasons that it has been observed that i can audit pc for 22 hours and get the same result that another auditor might get in 25 hours theres nothing mysterious about it i never run pc on things that arent charged and i dont miss reads i expect less from you l ron hubbard founder lrh jk copyright 1978 by l ron hubbard all

ref hcob 15 oct 73rb cs series 87rb officers nulling and fning prepared lists when taking list to fning assessment an auditor must know how to read through an fn this is skill that up to this point has been used routinely only by highly trained auditors or few very sharp class iiis or ivs or above but with the difficulty auditors have had in fning prepared lists it becomes obvious that from class iii on up all auditors should be trained to read the meter through an fn it is the answer to almost any difficulty an auditor has had in taking list to fning assessment an fn speeds up or slows down or does different things while still remaining an fn and one can read through it it is done like this the swinging weight of the needle fning from an earlier item has momentum and it will tend to obscure the read on another item it will almost obscure it but not quite youll see the fn check or slow up briefly and then continue and this means you have hot item any item that would cause an fn to check will be hot the auditor who can read through an fn will spot this and handle the item then and there then he continues on down the list missing nothing handling what is there to be handled and with this skilled metering takes it to genuinely fning list on assessment and it doesnt take days or even several sessions necessarily to do it if an auditor cant read through an fn hell miss this hes going down the list the fn checks or slows and he doesnt see it so he goes right on by it then within the next couple of items the fn kills hes going to have hard time fning that list because hes now got suppressed read example auditor in assessing starts with an fn which continues as he goes on down the list calling the items on say item 5 the fn checks or slows briefly auditor cant read through an fn so he misses this and goes on by on about the 6th or 7th item the fn packs up and the auditor is in quandary because the fn has turned off but he didnt get read on items 6 or 7 either or he may duplicate the killed fn as read on items 6 or 7 and attempt to take up one or the other of them either way hes in for trouble because hes missed the actual item and he may even try to handle wrong item hes going to find it difficult to take that list to an fning assessment the correct action when an fn packs up this way is to go back up the list and reassess the last several items to find the missed read but one should be able to read through an fn probably the main reason for pc upset or protest against overrepair and being handled again and again with repair lists lies in this factor alonethe auditor cant read through an fn thus he misses the charged items and takes up items that are 254uncharged and the repair goes on interminably as the charged lines are not found and handled this is also probably the reason that auditors have been known to back off from having to fn list they know from experience that it is laborious business the truth is its not necessary for an auditor to labor over taking list to fning assessment it simply requires good trs and skilled metering including the ability to read through fns an auditor can be trained to see read through an fn the drill would be to sit him down in front of meter with an fning student on the cans and assess the prepared lists in the book of emeter drills spotting each time he gets check or slow or any change in an otherwise continuing fn hell find that he can read through an fn and become very adept at this and from then on he wont miss youll have an auditor who is confident of his ability to fn list accurately and thoroughly in onehalf the time and trauma it would take otherwise and far fewer overrepaired pcs overrepaired pcs are usually pcs with actual reads missed and false reads taken up so overrepair is really misrepaired or not repaired this is metering at its best and most accurate we now expect the best and most accurate metering from the auditor who is in the business of fning prepared lists l

all the gains available to him unacknowledged dianetic clears person who has reached the state of dianetic clear without it being acknowl edged can run into difficulties afterwards you may find that hes been in ethics trouble or had low oca or poor case gain since that point its not only lack of acknowledgement but also invalidation by running certain processes that clear wouldnt respond to such as engrams or continuing to run the grades or continuing goals processing etc also with clears and ots who went clear before they did the clearing course and never knew it or spotted it bypassed charge results because they are running something which is trying to achieve what they have already achieved it serves as an overrun in the case where pc has this unacknowledged invalidated dianetic clear state you would most likely find point in his auditing where it looks as if he had made it and slump occurred afterwards this point could have occurred many years back if you dont see resurgence of the state in an interview or session when the pc mentions when he went dianetic clear the cs would be to datelocate it ref hcob 15 nov 78 dating and locating ethics the fact that person may currently be in ethics trouble is basis on which to adjudicate whether or not he has achieved the state of clear it is not criterion to be used to refuse to allow the person to attest clear is clear when clear is audited on r3ra when the state is invalidated or goes unacknowledged he can get into trouble so apply this to your understanding and analysis of cases the maa interview and to j check on the dianetic clear routing form is not to imply hes outethics but will furnish the cs with data on the case which may or may not come up in d of p interview it will also detect the rare case where the person is attempting to attest in order to save money or for status reasons in one instance it was discovered that the person routing through was actually plant these last examples are very very small percentage of the cases 256meter phenomena when the state of dianetic clear has been acknowledged and any inval cleaned off the line youll see very floppy needle at low sensitivity an fn that nothing

the meter now reads on the pcs postulatesie clears postulates read as surge read therefore does not mean invariably yes or that the question is charged can read if the pc says it or thinks it to himself as an answer to question ref hcob 18 april 68 needle reactions above grade iv bear in mind that you might not get the above meter phenomena immediately on dianetic clear where the state has

dianetic clear or keyedout clear in past years would not necessarily qualify as dianetic clear now though the chances are good he did make it any pc who has attested to dianetic clear or keyedout clear in the past should be called in for an interview and any necessary csing to ascertain the state this must be adjudicated by an ao cs or by an org cs who is clear you will find that many of those who attested to dianetic clear earlier on actually did make it and after confirmation of this they will need to be issued clear certs and clear numbers and be properly programmed to move on up the bridge see hcob 1 dec 78 programming the dianetic clear for his next step additionally where the cs knows of case where it looks very likely from folder study that the pc went dianetic clear but it was unsuspected at the time and never originated he should have such pcs also called in for confirmation the person who hasnt made it where it is obvious that person who has already been allowed to attest hasnt attained dianetic clear give the pc good rfactor that the person handling the attest cycle didnt have all the data he must also be given the rfactor that he is being programmed so as not to be denied any of the gains on the grade chart and so that he will be adequately prepared to do the ot levels the cs then programs the case so that this can occur and the pc is informed he should continue with his auditing program in the case where the person wanting to attest clearly hasnt made it you tell him so there may be some state he did achieve that he may wish to attest to and he should be allowed to do so 257in both the above cases the person very likely has made some big gain or achieved new ability so validate that and give him an appropriate acknowledgement on his win next step for dianetic clears use hcob 1 dec 78 programming the dianetic clear for his next step as guide when programming the dianetic clear for his next action summary keep in mind that good percentage of the cases you see who by origination want to attest to dianetic clear will have achieved the state if you follow these guidelines and apply the hcobs on the subject both those who have attained

it is an excellent cs tool for getting an estimate of case and getting it untangled you can assess it method 3 and handle not going beyond the first fn when ruds wont fly at the start of session but its real use is to assess method 5 and then send to the cs for programming if the case appears to be resistive or hasnt sorted out after full handling of all reading items has been done on the green form then the 40 question called the resistive cases assessment is assessed method 5 resistive cases each item on the resistive cases assessment has corresponding section on the expanded green form 40rd when an item reads on the resistive cases assessment you go to the section of the expanded green form 40rd which corresponds by letter and assess method 5 that section you assess one section of the expanded green form 40rd for each resistive cases assessment item that reads for example on the resistive cases assessment item c audited with ruds out and item 12 has taken drugs read the auditor will now go to the expanded green form 40rd assess all of section c audited with ruds out and all of section i has taken drugs then depending on cs instructions the auditor will l return the folder to

interned by requiring that these must not audit pcs who have not first had cs 53 to fning list but every major action does not require cs 53 to fning list as setup therefore this clarification is issued pa must be set up before major action what this setup consists of is covered in cs series 1 10 it does not have to include cs 53 to fning list cs 53 to fning list is the most thorough way to set up case or to repair case who has had rough auditing this is because the cs 53 is masterpiece in that it contains everything that could be wrong with the mind pc who has had much auditing especially if any of the auditing was not skillfully delivered will get remarkable case resurgence from cs 53 done to fning list but pa who is already flying or who has not had much auditing does not require cs 53 to fning list and possibly would not even understand many of the cs 53 lines it does not have to be done before every major action to do so would violate the rules of csing and programming of cases and is an arbitrary it is very poor show to enter or use arbitraries as these prevent getting any tech done at all and not requiring cs 53 to fning list does not mean that you can

areas is in view 1978 was indeed the year of tech breakthroughs if processing had to get more expensive due to inflation why then it had to be made much quicker and better actually processing costs today per result are much cheaper than ever before and will continue to be as the improvements have been so great it all began with new era dianetics when i look back and remember the hun dreds and even thousands of hours some people spent on book one dianetics its like an old story halfremembered if one of those 1950 auditors had the tools of ned they would have been bugeyed at its fast results even the 1968 dianetic auditor would have been incredulous if his preclears had responded with the speed that ned pcs are achieving its probably about 100 to 1 but the 19501968 auditors as auditors might even have objected little bit to ned as it would have run them out of pcs the overall cost of 19501977 processing despite being cheaper per hour was much more expensive take drug rundown these used to go on for hundreds of hours and some body said they would have cost many thousands of dollars to complete but with ned drug rundowns they go off zip zip zip in one or two intensives ned is so fast that even an incomplete old drd can be finished up and repaired and ended utterly in less than one intensive you would be amazed how fast and thorough it is so it isnt the cost by hour or by intensive its how much the whole rundown costs that counts and if it can be given in far fewer hours it is cheaper matter the cost per hour ned is cleaning up anything and everything book one ever mentioned with light ning speed of course when somebody goes dianetic clear he cant be run on more engrams right right so its forbidden now to run ned on dianetic clears 265the main problem of good auditors today is hitting such tremendous wins on pcs that they have to wait 2 or 3 days for the fn to die downif it does auditors are getting sore legs from just walking in and out of sessions its awful we are making clears these days in many cases so fast that clearing course bracelet numbers are jumping up by the thousands per month we are also finding that some old dianetic pcs had gone clear and the auditors didnt notice incredibly enough sometimes on next life basis we are running into dianetic clears from 1949 and 50 so even those auditors were better than they thought they were so were not only making new ones were finding old onessuch is the power of ned there have been technical improvements and discoveries and advances in 78 that are reaching into every level of tech and speeding it up the following is just partial list key means the action can be done on nonclear or on dianetic clear means the action is for ot iii and above only means it is new rundownaction discoveries and advancements in tech in 1978 1 ned new era dianetics refinement of all previous dianetic techniques from 1950 up to present time as well as the development of new technique giving much faster results and far higher gain per hour of auditing and speedy resolution of dianetic cases included in ned are twelve brand new developments they are all contained in far more detail in the ned hcobs and packs due to the extensive changes and improvements in dianetics old dianetic auditors are also training on the ned course as it only takes 3 weeks for the able student preassessment with the new preassessment tech developed for ned each illness or condition the pc needs and wants handled gets handled with new technique b new drug rundown this is the answer to druggys dreams without withdrawal symptoms and in pain strain rocket ride he comes right back up to life and living where the old drd took hundreds of hours and sometimes had to be repeated the ned drd requires only few intensives that are joy all the way according to the avalanches of success stories which poured in on from over the world during the pilots with good ned trained auditor the cost of final finished completed drug rundown has shrunk way below what it did and far below the habit the mafia drug enforcement agency and other criminals hate it as its doing them out of job enlightened foreign governments liked narconon but boy theyll love it now indeed the dead will walk again c end of endless drug rundowns repair list lot of people who have had drug rundowns old style and have had to have them repeated will be over joyed to know that they can be finished with rapidity in fact with new developments repair list can be finished off so fast that the rundown has to be sold on the basis of one intensive this applies only to getting cs 53 and the repair list and is done only on those people who have completed an old drug rundown and does not apply to the 266ned new rundown in section b above if it takes more thats too bad for the org if one wants to get his old drug rundown handled terminatedly he should ask for the end of endless drd repair list demand cs 53 to begin it and then get the repair d objective arc this brand new process introduces the pc to the wide bright world sweat program some of these new drugs like the intelligence drug lsd developed to poison and paralyze

on the grade chart but is for those who didnt go clear on dianetics super power will be delivered at saint hills within the next 6 weeks as we are right now super grooming the super power auditors in special international course it will be delivered in almost all languages the new world corps is being formed and trained this very minute candidates for which must be class iv ot iiis orgs were once promised power for their staffs if org staff are very very good and get on policy and everything they will one day look up and see new world corps team move in on them and then new world corps mean just that 2673 end of endless int repair pcs in the past have often had to have their interiorization rundown repaired and sometimes more than once this repair found while researching upper levels finalizes any seemingly endless redo of interiorization repairs pcs on the pilot actions of this have been ecstatic with relief 4 new interiorization rundown when pc exteriorizes during processing he can thereafter find it difficult to exteriorize againto put it mildly the new interiorization rundown in good hands puts final finish to any such trouble and the pc ceases to have any trouble because of exteriorization or in exteriorizing 5 dianetic clears undoubtedly the big news that resounded around the world in 78 was the huge numbers of people who were discovered to have made dianetic clear in 1950 and on people used to ask where are all the clears well they were right there in 1978 i discovered that it was deadly to go on running dianetics on dianetic clear such gave the semblance of case gain naturally so when i announced that running dianetics on dianetic clear was forbidden people began to look around and and behold they had been making clears with dianetics and had been going right on by it the pc who had made it wasnt declared clear and further dianetics didnt work on him naturally so in 1978 after my announcement auditors began to check and listen to the pc and found they had real clears all over the place now ned produces far faster gains and many not all ned pcs began to go clear and the clear numbers have been running up like one of those computers rehabbed and allowed to declare these dianetic clears abruptly attained the full results of clear excited avalanches of success stories have been pouring in on for months in the thousands and from all over the world and its interesting that amongst those found there are few who went clear on dianetics in their last lifein the 50s its quite scramble locating their last life folder and records so they can go on to full ot where are the clears there they were 6 redefinition of instant read making it easier for auditors to learn metering and giving pcs vastly increased speed of gains due to higher accuracy of metering 7 clarification of confessional procedure resulting in faster gain in shorter period of time 8 service facsimiles revisited the early 60s handling of service facs was revised and overhauled and became the new grade iv of scientology processing 9 power to forgive making it possible for the pc to fully end cycle on any shame blame regret or guilt of the past 10 ned for ots the discovery and development of techniques by which the second wall of fire can be overcome this consists of 29 fantastic new confidential rundowns delivered by specially trained ot auditor the auditors are in training right now from aos to give ned for ots to all those who are ot iii and auditors already trained on it are delivering it at flag in flags new advanced org division 4a 268some of the miracles of life have been exposed to full view for the first time ever in ned for ots the rave success stories coming from this are the talk of the auditing world 11 ot viii this rundown was developed and will be available to ot viis who have completed their ned for ots which is prerequisite for ot viii 12 upper levels there are other ot levels above viii but these will be released from time to time when people are ready for them were already higher than man has ever been and it can get quite stratospheric training in 1978 giant training strides were made for i was very busy on that as well the ned course was brought down to 3 weeks class 04 checksheets were carefully shortened back to the 1968 level when auditors were being made at speed but without losing tech which is quite trick when you come to think of it when you realize that large portion of training costs goes into living expenses while taking the course reducing the length of time of course gives an enormous reduction in course costs regardless of whats being charged training is also being helped by scholarships class iv auditing actions that can be run class iv orgsthose orgs which are in major cities on 5 continentshave large variety of public services which they can give many of these are very economical and are there for the raw public as well as to keep their fields getting service amongst them are the following 1 group processing after an intro lecture successful gradient for raw public is being part of group who are audited simultaneously group processing can be pretty effective and on large number of releases attained you will find the public reporting great gains made in group auditing it is an economical way to keep one going even after hes had professional processing 2 coaudit cooperative auditing public person is instructed in the rudi ments of auditing and under the supervision of trained auditor groups of teams audit each other attaining good gains 3 livingness repair this is often the first action taken on person by professional auditor and can bring great deal of brightness back into his life 4 ned new era dianetics this was the bombshell of 78 and ned auditors as well as courses are available in every org ned consists of at least 12 separate rundowns as noted in the new discovery section above it occasionally makes dianetic clear although this must not be prom ised the only trouble with ned compared to earlier dianetics is that it produces results very fast one can achieve more result per hour of auditing time by about 100 to 1 over old dianetics and when you realize that old dianetics was the first and remains the only fast and effective processing known to man you get some idea of where ned is at it is interesting that when somebody has been skillfully mucking himself up for trillions and trillions of years that ned auditor can salvage him in under 100 hours 5 xdn expanded dianetics in 78 improvements on this were undertaken and the full new expanded dianetics is being released in 79 it comprises very specialized applications of dianetics for the more difficult case 269 6 quad grades and expanded grades 0iv these are more fully covered in the book what is scientology they are the wonder workers which put ability to live back into life they handle the basics of relationships amongst people and improve ones ability to handle himself and others for dianetic clears this is usually their first auditing less the engram running r3ra part of new grade iv after attain ing clear and permits them to expand beyond their previously barriered existence these grades are very far from limited to clears 7 new grade iv grade iv has been improved enormously by including and refining formerly class vi materials the engram running part cannot be run on clears but the listing processes can it is guaranteed to make the preclear fully and completely right 8 revised cs 53 it is quite technical achievement to put on one side of one sheet of paper everything that can be wrong with mind the cs stands for case supervisor who is the one unseen in some ivory tower who tells the auditor exactly what to do between sessions when youre getting audited this is primary tool he uses in analysis in 78 it was polished up and made as bright as the morning star to detect and handle things you didnt even know were wrong but which might have you totally caved in 9 green form this tool of case analysis has been improved 10 new green form 4 expanded this detects and handles any reason why case might be resistive to processing thus handling any tendency towards slow gain and making it possible for such cases to make faster gains in future processing 11 study green form this is rundown which isolates and handles anything that could be wrong with any student or pupil 12 student correction list this handles difficulties that student or pupil may have encountered in his studies and frees him up from these so that he can now study easily 13 new method one word clearing this is far more reaching in clearing up past misunderstoods which stuck the person in previously failed subjects he studied 14 conditions and exchange by dynamics this is an auditing action which increases the awareness of exchange and flows on the various dynamics enabling person to be at cause over them 15 the marriage intensive this is where husbands and wives handle marital difficulties enabling them to lead happily married lives it can restore the bloom of spring romance 16 auditor rundown this is an intensive which fully handles any case reasons why an auditor might have difficulty and enables him to move forward without any losses or failures from past efforts to help people stopping him 17 teacher or supervisor intensive this is for any person involved in teaching or supervising or education and enables him to become vastly better teacher or supervisor 18 executive or businessmans intensive this enables an executive or businessman to face situations of stress with calmness and frees him from past business stresses 19 money processing intensive this handles the inability to have money resulting in the ability to increase income 270 20 profession intensive this enables person to overcome difficulties that he may encounter in his profession or in any given subject 21 fixated person rundown this enables person to overcome the condition of having his attention fixated on one person 22 suppressed person rundown this is magical rundown just now being released to class iv and other orgs it utilizes principle found in an early acc but never fully developed and released till 78 that one could bring the suppressive in persons life to communicate to him and seek peace without ever contacting him when expertly done on person who has been the target of suppression by antagonistic people it brings him back to freedom and handles his environment as well when one realizes that most illness is precipitated by suppression one can understand the need and use of such miraculous rundown its unbelievable until one experiences it the way to get processing cheaply is of course to take the training route and get trained and make your grades at the same time training is very fast these days due to the new checksheets class iv orgs teach the coaudit auditors course the fast new era dianetics course the ned validated auditor internship the ned case supervisor course the validated ned case supervisor internship now have all the shorter checksheets for and teach class 0iv the permanent class iv auditor internship the class iv graduate auditor and case supervisor course the permanent class iv graduate case supervisor internship and will teach expanded dianetics auditor and case supervisor courses and internships they also teach considerable number of public courses lists of which will shortly be available from class iv orgs as in 1978 department 17 was ordered to get busy handling and training the public as the prewave of the new world class vi orgs saint hills the original class vi org was located in beautiful english estate saint hill manor east grinstead sussex when class vi org was formed in copenhagen to service europe in all languages it was staffed by people from saint hill who named it of course saint hill and when the american class vi organization was formed it was staffed by people taken from saint hill and of course they called it the american saint hill organization the services remain the same in each of the organizations the following services are given at saint hill orgs 1 all class iv org auditing actions and courses they cost bit more but the saint hills are essentially training orgs and the auditing delivered there is usually quickly available and very well done 2 power processing grades v and va are still available and being delivered at saint hills for persons who did not make dianetic clear delivered only by class vii auditors who are specialized on it power continues to produce its startling results 3 super power there is reason dianetic clear should be denied the powerful gains which research made available in 78 see above for the public who have gone dianetic clear and those who havent saint hills will become mecca where they obtain the most excellent results obtainable in super power the saint hill special briefing course still roars on this is the place where the auditor gets all the tech that has ever been issued below that level this is where his sessions are videod and polished this is where he gets all his auditing to catch him up on his grades these are the dukes of the auditor elite the saint hillers one joins the clique only by hard work and great results 271class viii course this is the course originated on flag and still taught in its original successful form at saint hills it is standard tech course and class viiis pride themselves on keeping tech standard over the world class ix course this is the graduate course which contains the materials issued since the flag class viii advanced orgs advanced orgs are located in angeles england and copenhagen the advanced orgs are the ot operating thetan orgs of the world because of the nature of ot auditing the person has to learn to audit himself as most ot levels are too fast to be audited by another only ot vii ot iv and ned for ots are audited on the preot by professional 1 setups it often happens that one needs to have case difficulties handled before he goes on up the grade chart to the stellar realms of the advanced orgs sometimes drug rundown isnt complete or one is bit suppressed or too intro verted it saves time to get set up before starting the rocket ride up the top end of the grade chart the aos handle this sort of thing routinely when it is needed they have checklist of prerequisites for ao levels and this is what theyre most interested in getting completed to not complete it means stall somewhere along the way it usually doesnt take much time and saves time later 2 solo auditors course the aos are the place where the preclear or dianetic clear learns to solo audit so he can go on up the grade chart some people wanting the best auditing they can get for this solo flight also take lower level pro fessional auditor courses and even class vi at the saint hills at one time dianetic auditors course was prerequisite to ao services prior to the solo auditors course and while this is not now demanded and while the solo auditors course is very good smart preclears and smart dianetic clears take other courses before they get to an ao and then theyre sure to make ot even more easily ive heard solo auditors say that they only wanted professional on their case and thats why they were making themselves into one before they went to an ao even class iv orgs have professional courses 3 r6ew this is the tech designation of the step nondianetic clear must take before going onto the clearing course in advanced orgs it is grade vi it returns powers to act on ones own determinism it incidentally tells one why the human race often reacts so oddly to life 4 dianetic clear rehab the state of dianetic clear is checked and rehabilitated which is very fast action in most cases it has to be verified because if the person didnt make it he has to go onto the clearing course and if he did really make dianetic clear to do the clearing course would be disastrous because of course hes already clear this is why aos are now engaged on project of recovering folder libraries particularly of the few pcs who have died in the last few decades always bring your own folder or get it sent to the ao if you are going 5 the clearing course this was one of the most famous breakthroughs of all time requiring years of research those who did not make dianetic clear solo audit themselves to the full bursting glory of clear 6 operating thetan i for the dianetic clear who has had his solo course setup and verification as clear this is the first solo auditing step these ot grades have their own end phenomena but they are confidential 7 ot ii 8 ot iii this is the big step and one has to allow time for it 272 9 ot iii expanded 10 ot vii this is an auditing step by professional ot auditor it can be given in any sequence after ot iii and before ot viii 11 ned for ots this is the big news of the ot world ao auditors were spe cially trained at flag and are just now on their way back to aos to deliver it i he new division 4a flag is an ao now and had its gala opening and its first avalanche of preots on december 16 there is very wild excitement on the results of ned for ots as of course theyve never been seen before on this or any other planet ned for ots can be given any time after ot iii and before ot viii and is prerequisite for ot viii 12 ot iv 13 ot v 14 ot vi 15 ot viii although several upper ot grades have been researched preots were not ready for them and so they were not released the needed link which makes it possible is ned for ots which is its prerequisite the upper levels above viii will probably be released from time to time into the future ot viiis release is real cap for the tech breakthroughs of 78 flag ship org the fso is beginning its third year at the flag land base in clearwater florida the fso was several years afloat and has long tradition as the top training and processing org of the world its quarters in the posh fort harrison resort hotel still carry its distinctly nautical flavor flag is the top tech org of the world and if they cant do it nobody can what you pay for at flag is the most expert csing for the best rundowns by the best auditors in the world its services are 1 all levels and rundowns ned class iv class vi class vial and all ao services in its new division 4a as listed above are delivered at flag super power will be delivered to the staff first and eventually to the public flag lower org services cost more mainly because they are even more expert and faster than they are in lower orgs and because the service is highly personalized 2 full case resolution it is always the fate of the top level org of the world to inherit the rough and unsolvable cases flag runs on the basis of results or else so far as their tech stuff is concerned the words failed case do not exist on flag therefore they have rundowns and handlings to untangle the most tangled and get it going again flag gets easy cases too in fact they get some of the easiest and fastest cases in the world because such people have way of making it through to the top 3 integrity processing these are series of processes which result in vastly improved performance in the area addressed 4 student booster rundown this is specialty on flag which also trains the executives of orgs and has to have fast study remedy it is also given to business executives so that they can absorb effortlessly and with greater speed the vast quantities of data that pass across an executives desk 5 dianetic debug and repair those who couldnt handle and run grams or have trouble in dianetics find this successful way to start winning with dianetics or ned 2736 ot level debug and repair this is the full repair and resolution of any difficulties preot may have encountered due to solo auditing errors on any solo level 7 new vitality rundown nvrd this was also called the special rundown when it was being developed in 75 and i trained group of auditors on it at flag it has never been exported from flag it handled cases that had not progressed well due to suppression or other factors 8 power repair and completion to full ep given in those rare cases where pc has not made it on power 9 l10 this is the first of the famous ls l is just the technical designation the ls are at flag only they are not grades in themselves but incredible boosters that can be delivered at any point after completed drd and expanded grades the ls are audited by class x xi and xii auditors who are the most highly trained on the planet 10 l11 the next step from l10 11 l12 when i was csing the ls i would never let preot leave the ship unless hed gone exterior with full perceptions and was able to maintain it 12 ned for ots flag was the place where all the ned for ot auditors were trained when its new ao division 4a was opened just before christmas even other hotels in town had to be booked to take care of the ots arriving for their ned for ots the sensation caused over the world rivalled the original landing at flag in florida they considered it christmas present and it was 13 all ao

after by top executives in busi nesses and other walks of life it is mark of considerable distinction to be known as graduate of flag executive briefing course in all flag teaches 69 courses which are fitted for the special requirements of the flag clientele the international training org for org personnel only is also located at flag and org staffs who are lucky enough to be selected to it are trained for executive positions in orgs it received new expansion at the end of 78 and was put under the command of one of the sea orgs most veteran officers ________ 1978 man is complex being far more complex than he ever conceived and he possesses abilities and potentials that neither he nor any of the wise men of the ages ever dreamed of in 1978 great many new insights and revelations about life were disclosed many of them discovered in my research at very upper levels these then were used to speed up the lower and more fundamental grades without discarding any of the tech we already had all of which remains very valid the time and cost for given result was greatly reduced 274and as demand for auditors far exceeded supply new training skills were also developed and the checksheets which govern the time in training were also reduced so that good auditors could be made fast lot of 1978 time was spent on doing this but there was one discovery in 78 that i havent said very much about and am really not likely to since it is sad thing it is what really happens to thetan who is not salvaged or processed and goes on down the route man when i saw that and knew it to be true i actually felt sorry for these guys that try to hit at us poor devils some religions talk about hell its an understatement of what really happens i got real close look at what we were salvaging people from well we can do it better than ever today especially with these newest discoveries all this developmental work was done in 78 despite the fact that i also spent several months of that year directing photographing lightingyou name itnine bright sparkling training films they are now in the process of being edited and youll be hearing much more about them when they begin to be released later on in 79 in case you are under the mistaken impression that scientology was bruised in 1978 you should know that raw public bought and are buying scientology texts in wave of best selling that is making history in the retail and publishing world there has never before been such boom in any specialized organizations books book publishers use us as an astonishing example of what can happen hordes of new public are sweeping these books out of the stores and in the better run orgs are crowding the public division to the rafters for service truth doesnt bruise very easily new books also got attention in 78 have you lived before this life was introduced at the atlanta book fair and in the hands of retail distributors began its own boom it has gone 5x the normal best seller and is still going after all we discovered past lives and bright new and in your bookstore is big impressive hard cover book what is scientology released at christmas it contains all kinds of data really huge handbook just the thing to use to inform and overawe your friends 347 information packed pages plus over hundred big full color illustrations contain the answers to just about every question ever asked about scientology although staff wrote it i had to keep it rounded up and to the printer and many day was spent in tropic heat getting its photographs shot there is data in it that hardly any scientologist knows its reference and reading total must for every scientologists library and incidentally its about half the price despite its quality of regular bookstore books of the same sizea triumph in itself in these inflationary times in 78 lot of time was spent in developing the new mark vi emeter it was needed as ots were going off the top of the mark v the new world corps is equipped with the specially built mark vi this beautiful and far more sensitive meter will be available to general auditors around february 79 from pubs orgs the mark v will continue to be valid and sold as its good meter and less expensive the mark vi is just rolls royce needless to say i was very busy this year it sure is lot of work to dig out planet well there it is all yoursfor 79 love ron l ron hubbard founder lrhdr 275hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 29 december 1978 remimeo cl iv grad checksheet class vi checksheet css class iv grad auditors ethics officers the suppressed person rundown magical new rundown at times the results of ordinary scientology tech are extremely impressive even to i am by this time quite accustomed to miracles as usual but magic is not quite so commonplace an occurrence even these days and is worthy of special note many times the suppressive person to whom the pc is pts exists in present time and is still capable of causing trouble or upset for the pc it is to this situation that the suppressed person rundown is addressed this new rundown the suppressed person rundown produces the wondrous result of changing the disposition of an antagonistic terminal at distance by auditing the pts preclear where this terminal was antagonistic invalidative hostile or down right suppressive he will suddenly have change of heart and seek to make peace with the pts pc this rundown is not considered complete until the magic occurs that is on this rundown we take pts pc and we audit this pc and audit him and audit him on problems processes until major change occurs in the antagonistic persons universe which prompts him to make friendly overture to or concerning the pc this friendly and unprompted origination or attempt at origination from the antagonistic terminal to or concerning the pc will occur in all cases if problems pro cesses are run and are fully flattened this happens matter how out of comm the two terminals have been or what length of time has intervened between their last communication the rundown is continued until the ep occurs each problem process is run to its own ep when the pts rundown engram running has to be omitted because of clear or ot this suppressed person rundown can be substituted for the engram part of the pts rundown but if so it is still run to the full ep of the suppressed person rundown this is how it works the pc due to some act or acts previously committed has gone the effect of the antagonistic terminal the terminal then attempts to suppress the pc the pc already the effect of the terminal becomes the effect of the suppression so the pcs own postulate to improve himself and his conditions is countered by the suppressive terminals counterpostulate and he is thus given present time problem of sufficient magnitude to prevent case gain as only present time problem will halt the progress of case to the present time problem are added arc breaks with the antagonistic terminal and as only arc breaks will worsen case the result is gain or deterioration of case by reason of the suppressive connection in the environment possible simple explanation for what occurs is the pc on running problems processes comes up to cause on his problems with the terminal and when he is 276tinued on problems he will break through and actually run out the antagonistic terminals problems which he has given to him when this occurs the formerly antagonistic terminal will get into communication with the pc or by communicating in friendly way to others about the pc he will write letter to make peace or he will make phone call to say all is well or he will tell aunt sally he feels much better about the pc and has decided to let bygones be bygones it sometimes occurs that the antago person does not know where the pc is but he will still try to communicate this friendly origination by the antagonistic terminal is the ep of the rundown if the terminal hasnt yet originated you havent run enough problems processes the only time this doesnt work is when you havent run all possible problems processes or have run them with outtech such as broken meter when the rundown is done the suppressed person rundown is done after the education step laid out in hcob 31 dec 78 iii educating the potential trouble source the first step toward handling pts cs1 and after pts interview or 10 august interview or an sd has located the antagonistic terminal and handlings on that terminal have been done and after the pts rundown has been done this procedure is run on the antagonistic terminal in all instances even when the pts scene has apparently been relieved for the pc on earlier pts handling always run this problems procedure matter how successful earlier handlings were this rd is to repair the relationship the pc is given the rfactor to let the auditor know of any communication he receives from or about the antagonistic terminal he should not however be told what the ep of the rundown is how the rundown is done the problems processes used in the suppressed person rundown are given in hcob 30 dec 78 suppressed person rundownproblems processes and are run triple or quad flow in the order they are given each flow is checked for read before running and each charged flow is taken to the ep of fn cog vgis the ep of the rundown has been reached when the antagonistic terminal origi nates in friendly way to the preclear or seeks to communicate to the pc in friendly manner its not just cessation of hostilities its more than that even if the antago nistic terminal doesnt know the pcs address he will find out or he will put word out and the pc will hear from or about the antagonistic terminal and it will be friendly message even if the antagonistic terminal doesnt know the pcs address news will reach the pc that the antagonistic terminal wishes bygones to be bygones that is the ep you are aiming for and you continue to audit problems processes on the pc on the antagonistic terminal until that occurs it is very important not to underrun the rundown some auditors will be tempted to end off the rundown because the pc has had major win or ability regained or some such when the pc has had major win you would of course let him have his win and would leave him off auditing until the persistent fn dies down but you do not accept as the ep of the rundown anything other than the formerly antagonistic terminal originating with coaxing in friendly way to or about the pc you keep running problems until the ep is attained you do want to see the magic dont you and the only way this rundown can fail is by not continuing to run problems processes until this ep is attained who the rundown can be done on 277the suppressed person rundown can be done on any pts person of any case level it is run with good success on clears ots and dianetic clears as well as pcs just beginning their auditing the only requirement is that any pc who receives the rundown must first have received the pts cs1 per hcob 31 dec 78 iii and must if previously unindoctrinated have been educated into the procedures of scientology auditing by scientology cs1 per hcob 15 jul 78 scientology auditing cs1 and of course like any other auditing it is done with the pcs rudiments in auditor and cs note one of the many advantages of the suppressed person rundown is its simplicity there are very few places where it can go off the rails this rundown does however require expert metering and very standard handling and the cs should be alert to the following 1 the auditor must realize that the target of this rundown is not just the pc the target is the antagonistic terminal the pc is connected to and the ep is not just change in the pc but change in the antagonistic terminal of positive friendly communication to the pc the auditor and cs must realize that the above is the target and ep for this rundown 2 all problems processes must be run on the antagonistic terminal and fail ure to run enough problems processes is the only thing that will prevent this rundown from working 3 metering the auditor who does this rundown must be skilled at meter ing so he doesnt miss reads and fail to run reading flows or attempt to run unreading flows imprecise metering can undermine the results of the run down as the running of all charged flows on problems is vital the auditor must be able to read meter and must take instant reads which occur inst antly on calling the command reference hcob 5 aug 78 instant reads 4 eps each reading flow of each problems process must be taken to its full ep which is cog fn and vgis the cs should ensure that the processes are indeed taken to ep and should suspect if there is trouble attaining the rundown ep that one or more problems processes have been left underrun unflat or unrun some auditors may say theyve done the rundown and the pcs in beautiful shape and hes had tremendous gains and now the suppressed person rundown is complete your answer to this is finish the rundown continue until the terminal gets in touch with the pc to make peace and sure enough day or two or three later the pc in utter amazement will report that her sister who hasnt spoken to her for 10 years has just sent her an affectionate letter or that his father who disowned him when he got into scientology has just called to say hello and that they had great chat just like old times it always happens when problems processes are fully run so there you have it the suppressed person rundown quite an amazing magical feat and very easily achieved with good standard auditing use it well and fully and youll get smashing oneforone successes on pts pcs lrhjk l ron

bulletin contains the problems processes to be run on the suppressed person rundown definition of problem the first and most vital action to begin the suppressed person rundown is to fully clear problem with the pc as problem not as condition or situation the war of purposes gives us what we call problems problem has the anatomy of purposes problem consists of two or more purposes opposed it does not matter what problem you face or have faced the basic anatomy of that problem is purposecounterpurpose the definition of problem is intention versus intention or two or more opposing and conflicting views on the same subject the dominant operating action of this rundown is knowing what problem is without the auditor feeding the pc cog he must clear the definition of problem with the pc so that it is fully understood and the pc can easily make up examples of problems youll get place on the rundown unless both auditor and pc understand what problem is running problems comes under gradient scale of confront and can go on and on before the pc gets up to an awareness of anything its really fascinating phenomenon the person is being harassed all over the place by something or somebody and he will eventually name it and identify it which is an achievement right there but when you first start to run problems on it youll find he does not have anything to do with it its all by itself floating out in space someplace the problem has nothing to do with him or anything else example auditor tell problem with your mother pc shes never home 279shes never home is not problem problem is twoterminaled the problem as the pc has given it in the example above does not contain anything live its just condition but gradually as problems processes are run he will come up to an actual statement that the problem is something that has to be solved and that it has something to do with him now were getting someplace problems processes the processes are taken up in the order they are given each flow of each process is checked for read before running it using the name of the terminal antagonistic to the pc each flow taken up is then run to the ep of cognition fn and vgis copy of this process sheet is placed in the folder of the pc being run on the suppressed person rundown and the flows of each process run are initialed and dated by the auditor when they have been taken to full ep end phenomena the suppressed person rundown is taken to the ep of friendly and unprompted origination to or about the pc by the antagonistic terminal this ep will occur when enough problems processes have been fully run on that terminal the auditors metering must be excellent as to miss reads and leave charged flows unrun can prevent the pc from attaining the ep of this rundown reference hcob 5 aug 78 instant reads hcob 3 dec 78 unreading flows if the pc has big win end off the session and let him have his win do not try to audit over persistent floating needle or you will end up

1978 issue ii remimeo class iv grad class vi cses class iv grad auditors ethics officers outline of pts handling pts situations can arise at any time during persons scientology auditing or training program and must be handled speedily and well to get the person back on his course of auditing or training many preclears new to scientology require pts handling as one of their first actions auditing or training must not be continued over an unhandled pts sit as processing or study under the duress of suppression will not produce results you do not go on hoping or ignore it or call it something else or do any other action except handle handling ptsness is too easy to allow for any justification or excuse for not doing so and the steps given below lay out the many handlings which can be used to bring about full resolution of all ptsness in all pcs education person who is pts is often the last person to suspect it he may have become temporarily or momentarily so and he may have become so very slightly or he may be even pts and have been so for long time but he is nevertheless pts and we must educate him into the subject pts cs1 the pts cs1 given in hcob 31 dec 78 iii educating the potential trouble source the first step toward handling pts cs1 must be done before any other pts handling is begun this action sets person up to understand his pts sit and the mechanics of it thorough pts cs1 is the basis of all successful pts handling pts interview metered pts interview per hcob 24 apr 72 1 cs series 79 pts interviews or 10 august handling per hcob 10 aug 73 pts handling done by an auditor in session or an maa d of p or sso will in most cases assist the person to spot the antagonistic or sp element once spotted the potential trouble source can be assisted in working out handling for that terminal or more rarely in deciding to disconnect from that person if all difficulty is encountered on this step or if the sp cannot easily be found the preclear or student is probably not pts type i and should be turned over to an auditor qualified to handle type ii pts situations with more advanced pts tech handling once the antagonistic terminal has been located handling is done to move the pts person from effect to slight gentle cause over his situation this handling will include whatever is needed to accomplish the result and will of course vary depending on the person and his circumstances good roads good weather approach to the antagonistic terminal is usually what is needed the handling must be agreed upon by the potential trouble source and the 290person assisting him and must be tailored to put the person at cause over his particular situation handling may include coaching him along to see how he himself actually pre cipitated the pts condition in the first place by not applying or by misapplying scientology basics to his life and relationship with the now antagonistic terminal per bpl 5 apr 72rc pts type handling additional references hcob 10

handling pts situations what is scientology it quite often happens that the persons antagonistic to the preclear have real concept of what scientology is this can also be true of very new scientologist who then misinforms others the book what is scientology is very useful tool the preclear can send copy of it to persons antagonistic to him and it will give them hope that the person will respond better to life or if they are antagonistic to scientology can show them what theyre being antagonistic to recommendations that the pts person obtain and use this book or anyone else who wants to inform his friends or get them on the right road as the book was not written for the purpose of deptsing people should be made by the interviewing officer the book was specially priced so it would be more generally available despite the high cost of publishing it is large and imposing book and contains the true answers to all the questions people might ask and so saves the pts person or any other person great deal of explanation time it is quite formidable weapon when used in that fashion besides being good book that scientologists should own in its own right can we ever be friends extraordinary successes in handling pts situations with the can we ever be friends cassette and booklet occur when these are used parents friends relatives of scientologists who due to misunderstoods or misinformation thought they were opposed to scientology and its aims have discovered after listening to this cassette that they are in full agreement with it and now give scientology their support this action is vital and must not be omitted the results available with this cassette cannot be underestimated it can be used by itself when communication has really broken down between the two terminals or in conjunction with other pts handling program as result of interview and the various actions connected with it as given above and in the referenced issues the interviewer must give the person program to be done by the person if the person does not do the program or report his actions on it or the program results in real change in the situation the interviewing officer must require the person to have auditing on the subject ruds can be flown andor pts rd must be given by qualified auditor in the hgc clears and ots can have ruds flown and can do all the pts rd except engram handling this is usually followed by suppressed person rd 291rudiments flying ruds and overts triple or quad flow on the antagonistic terminal is often done to get ruds in and enable the pc to better confront the pts situation he is faced with this would of course be done only in session by qualified auditor when so ordered by the case supervisor the pts rundown the pts rundown is done when

handling when you find you have potential trouble source on your hands the very first thing you must do is educate him on the fundamentals of ptssp tech do not begin any other pts handling on any pts person until he has completed the basic education steps of the pts cs1 given in this hcob in the absence of education into the basics of pts tech you will have pts stu dents and pcs asserting theyre not pts you will have upsets protest recurrences of once handled ptsness ptses will not cognite will not take action to handle the antagonistic terminal will not recover failure to educate simply doesnt work so very thorough job must be done at this point to guarantee the success of any pts handlings which follow now people and circumstances and pts sits vary and you may wish to carry the education steps of the pts person beyond what is given here before you begin any 293other handling on him i will leave that to your educated judgment however the steps of the pts cs1 given in this hcob must be done on all pts students and pcs before any sort of pts interview or 10 august handling or any pts auditing is undertaken the person should of course study the complete ptssp detection routing and handling course so that he understands the full mechanics that had been upsetting his life but the pts cs1 will give sufficient data and understanding so that he or she can begin handling the pts scene pts cs1 the following pts cs1 is not long action and can and should be accomplished speedily its purpose is to give to any pts student or pc the necessary data and rfactor on the basics of ptssp tech so that he understands and is able and willing to successfully handle his pts situation it can be done by an auditor in session or in the course room under the supervision of the word clearer and course supervisor note some pcs and students who have been trained or who have in the past received pts handling may protest that they know the terms and issues if this happens acknowledge with excellent trs and without invalidation or evaluation and tell them that this action is intended to make pts handling effective for all and is required step of the handling if the auditor or word clearer uses excellent trs and good rfactor arc breaks will occur and the person will have tremendous wins the auditor or word clearer should be fully familiar with this issue as well as all issues in the ptssp course pack he will need to take very thorough look at what has to be covered with the pc in this cs1 and know his materials very well and have them ready for reference and clearing any

space its like pulling wrapping of wool off the pc the sp persuaded or caused the pc to believe the environment was dangerous and that it was always dangerous and so made the pc pull in and occupy less space and reach less when the sp is really located and indicated the pc feels this impulse not to reach diminish and so his space opens up the difference between safe environment and dangerous environment is only that person is willing to reach and expand in safe environment and reaches less and contracts in dangerous environment an sp wants the other person to reach less sometimes this is done by forcing the person to reach into danger and get hurt so that the person will thereafter reach less the sp wants smaller less powerful beings the sp thinks that if another became powerful that

organization new crime came to light it consisted of carefully teaching and coaching auditors to get snap can squeeze done so they would set their meter sensitivity so low that reads could be obtained it was done knowingly and intentionally by the person so there would be auditor around that could spot his withholds he also obscured emeter drill 5 which shows the correct way to do can squeeze and get proper sensitivity anyone who would do something like this just to protect withhold without realizing he would also mess up hundreds of cases quite in addition to messing up his own is of course not only irresponsible but insane we think of insane people as being wildeyed maniacs but such is seldom the case more often they are quiet types who have little or nothing to say and speak softly this person would not have been seen as insane on casual observation and so he had worked his way into the post of training in charge just so he could protect his withholds and on that post then carefully mistrained all auditors in sight so this brings to view that there is new type of crime to alter and pervert tech or procedure to prevent discovery of withholds this enters many areas

mood drills tech sec qual sec beings can be fixed or stuck in chronic mood emotionalways sad always angry always bored etc just in life and livingness this makes them rather hard to live with but in an auditor it is fatal the mood of an auditor particularly if fixed and chronic can color the session and the results he obtains trs are matter of sound not how an auditor feels when an auditor has stuck or fixated mood such as monotony timidity dullness showing up in his tr drills or in session this can slow up pcs progress or rough up or upset pc the auditors trs should sound live and interested and natural mood drills have been developed to handle fixed uncontrolled or unsuitable tone levels in an auditor these drills consist of drilling tr i over and over at each tone level of the full tone scale hcob 25 sept 71rb revised 1 apr 78 tone scale in full you start low on the scale and do trs at each tone level in that tone then up to the next tone and the next ie tr 1 done over and over at dying then at the tone of useless and so on up the scale the coach simply has the student do tr i at the particular tone level so that the coach and the student are both satisfied that the student has conveyed that tone and the student has win technical fact is that moods or emotions are usually automatic which means they are not necessarily under control but tend to control the person himself it is as if he is under otherdeterminism technically you can take over the automaticity and put it under beings control just by having him consciously do it over and over you can also change chronic tone level by shifting persons attention from it by making him do something else reference ability 36 and abilitystraight wire body position voice tone facial expression and attitude are all part of conveying the mood or tone level for example the student doing mood drills is on tr 1 working on the tone anger he gives line from alice in wonderland and it sounds bit weak coachs patter thats it it sounds bit gentle lets get some more grrrr in it start student repeats the line but smiles bit although he sounds more angry coach thats it it sounded more angry but you smiled do it againyou feel angry start student gives the line again this time frowning fiercely and in very snarly tone of voice leaning forward aggressively coach good do you feel you did it coach continues until the student is certain he can do it easily the coach must be able to identify the various emotions and if he is in question about it the dictionary should be resorted to until both student and coach are in agreement on what the tone is or means and that it is being accurately and demonstrably expressed student drilling these must beware of misus and the coach must make sure that he and the student both understand each mood tone any moods that are too easy to do should be spotted by the coach and repeated until the automaticity is broken if mood is too hard for the student to master have him do tr 1 in different beingnesses eg timid student who is trying to sound antagonistic could be asked to do tr 1 as panther lion villain etc if you had him do it as timid bird or some such timid thing that would never be antagonistic you would probably have your student where he lived again do such things to student win and dont use it to harass him the whole point is to get him to do tr 1 antagonistically these shifts of beingness help to shift his attention off repulsion to an emotion he cannot easily do 305once begun mood drills should be continued until the whole scale is flat so the auditor doesnt get stuck on the tone scale but can do any mood easily and without strain when an auditor is upset about his voice you can have him try speaking melodiously boringly enthusiastically until he can change his voice mood about at will mood drills should be done when the auditor sounds mechanical or his tone is brush off not interested or some set emotion an auditor can be drilled on assessments in the emeter drill book with mood drills when his assessment is dull or monotonous any set emotion like sweet light and airy fairy or sad dreary deadly serious indifferent can be handled by drilling with mood drills 50 foot mood drills 50 foot mood drills can be used to cure fixed mood that doesnt seem to budge with regular mood drills student and coach go to an area where they can do some shouting without disturbance the coach and student are at least 50 feet apart and the mood drill is done as described above at this distance mood drills are not only fun to do but also enable an auditor to be at cause over how he sounds in session without strain and without his own feelings interfering with the session and thus to get maximum gain for the pc l ron

bulletin of 3 february 1979 issue ii confront tech has to be part of the tr checksheet the inability to confront is basically caused by withholds and where person cannot be drilled into confronting he has to have his withholds pulled that he has committed overts and doesnt want them exposed apparently causes him to withhold his attention and the result is his ability to confront is lessened also where person has overts on subject and is withholding he has tendency to complicate that subject and cannot get down to its basic simplicities the world looks very complicated to him probably because his attention is wrapped up in his withholds instead of on his real problems or the subject the new discovery here is that person who has overts and withholds on subject cannot perform in that area and introduces complexities for of course they cant confront it where person cannot take responsibility for his withholds and he is not bene fiting casewise from giving them up he is half dead as being it is vicious circle he began to commit overts because he couldnt confront things and then withheld what he had done because he had withholds and could not confront he began to take heavy drugs and alcohol these pushed him toward deadness and further worsened his ability to confront and even caused him to commit further overts which he then withheld and this further deteriorated his ability to confront and all this traces back to the fact that he couldnt confront in the first place there is nothing more irresponsible than dead man and when confront drops and withholds enter in one has entered the death slide as being this vicious circle can be handled in processing at various levels and will unsnarl and the person will become alive and able to confront but the first steps of it and ones which could carry him well up the ladder are the drills of the tr course if done properly and over and over in rotation each time to win on each particular drill truly the world begins anew by

how can squeeze can be done incorrectly so he will know all the points he may have to correct to ensure he gets an accurate can squeeze 1 coach picks up the cans and holds his hands on the table so the student can clearly see them 2 coach has student set sensitivity booster knob to lowest position and the sensitiv ity at i on the sensitivity knob 3 coach has student adjust the needle to the set line on the needle dial the coach will have the student readjust the needle to set as necessary at the beginning of each demonstration of the can squeeze 4 the coach gives the cans squeeze with an even pressure if there is read or very small one less than an inch at sensitivity 1 the student auditor moves the sensitivity knob to 5 and gets another can squeeze if still read or its smaller than an inch student moves sensitivity to 16 and gets another squeeze for pur 312poses of the following demonstration you want to set the sensitivity so that you can obviously see movement of the needle on the can squeeze of about an inch so the sensitivity could be set lower than 5 or higher than 5 so long as you get fall of about an inch on the squeeze 5 with the sensitivity setting determined in 4 above the coach will then squeeze the cans incorrectly each time in different way the coach shows the student what particular thing hes doing with his hands and then has the student observe what happens on the meter and the distance the needle falls on the dial when he does each version of an incorrect can squeeze as follows coach holds the cans with cups of palms and all fingers and both thumbs in complete contact with the cans as he squeezes the cans he lifts one finger off and then puts the finger back on after relaxing the squeeze this is an incorrect can squeeze b coach holds the cans as in this time he gives the cans very fast light squeeze this is an incorrect can squeeze c coach holds the cans as in squeezes them with gradual pressure and then when he releases the squeeze he relaxes his grip on the cans so it is much looser than before the can squeeze this is an incorrect can squeeze d coach holds the cans as in and this time gives hard fast squeeze this is an incorrect can squeeze coach holds the cans as in squeezes them firmly and only partially releases the squeeze this is an incorrect can squeeze f coach holds the cans as in but gives squeeze in 2 stages first little squeeze then suddenly harder one this is an incorrect can squeeze g coach holds the cans as in gives hard fast squeeze and holds the grip the student should notice that the needle swings way over to the right due to the sudden motion and that it returns only part of the way with the coach still maintaining the squeeze thus giving an incorrect measurement of the can squeeze student should see that the distance between the first needle position at set and the final needle position with the coach still maintaining the squeeze is the actual measurement of the can squeeze fall it is not the distance between the first needle position of set and the needle position at the far swing to the right hard fast can squeeze is an incorrect can squeeze h coach holds the cans so they are not in contact with the cups of his palms and squeezes them this is an incorrect can squeeze i coach holds the cans with the thumbs going up the sides and sticking out over the top edge of the cans and squeezes them this is an incorrect can squeeze j coach holds the cans in fairly tight grip and squeezes the cans this is an incorrect can squeeze k coach holds the cans with the forefingers lifted slightly off and puts the fore fingers on the cans during the squeeze this is an incorrect can squeeze the drill is continued until the student auditor gets the idea that an incorrect can squeeze gives inaccurate unreliable needle reactions section ii to give the student auditor proper idea as to what correct can squeeze is and to train him how to get correct can squeeze 3131 the following drill should be done first by the coach to demonstrate to the student auditor what correct can squeeze is the coach has the student auditor shake his hands until the fingers are loose and floppy b then the coach has the student auditor put his hands on the table palms up exerting control on his fingers the student auditors fingers will curl in toward the palm c now the coach simply places the cans in the student auditors hands at an angle across the palms the natural curl of the fingers is sufficient to hold the cans in place and the placement of the cans at an angle ensures that the maximum skin area is touching the cans the cups of the student auditors palms and all the fingers and both thumbs must be touching the cans ensure the thumbs go around the cans and not up the sides d now the coach has the student auditor gradually increase the pressure of his grip on the cans until light squeeze is achieved and then relax it this is correct can squeeze note ensure when the student auditor relaxes his grip that he does not take finger or thumb or his palms off the cans he should have about the same contact he had at the start as in c above 2 having done the above the coach now has the student auditor do the drill as follows have the coach pick up the cans and keep his hands on the table so the student can see them throughout the can squeeze b check the coachs grip on the cans to ensure it is correct as in b and c above the student may have to try out different sizes of cans small medium or large depending on the size of the coachs hands to obtain the correct size can which he can hold comfortably without strain and that fits into the cup of his palm with maximum skin contact c adjust the sensitivity booster knob to the lowest position d set the sensitivity knob at 1 on the sensitivity dial b adjust the needle to the set line on the needle dial c give the proper commands for getting can squeeze as follows squeeze the cans please thank you the student must ensure the coach gradually increases the pressure of his grip on the cans and relaxes it d note the distance the needle fell when the coach squeezed the cans now increase the sensitivity setting to 2 and repeat steps d b and d above again noting the distance the needle fell when the coach squeezed the cans f repeat steps d b and d for sensitivity setting at 3 then sensitivity 314setting 4 then 5 then 6 and on up until you have the needle hitting the pin on the can squeeze with the needle hitting the pin on the can squeeze you wouldnt be able to note the length of the needle fall flunks are given for not having the coach remove all rings or finger jewelry as they can cause the needle to give unusual reads for not checking that there is maximum skin contact on the cans for failing to see that the thumbs go around the can and not up the sides for failing to set the meter and needle up properly for failing to notice and handle sudden or hard or jerky or convulsive can squeeze instead of an even increase of pressure on the cans or sudden letting go of the cans for not making sure the coach doesnt take finger or thumb or palm off the cans when he releases the contact for failing to note accurately the distance the needle fell on the can squeeze and for giving the wrong commands lack of skill in earlier drills is corrected by pink sheet section iii to give the student auditor reality on setting the sensitivity for 13 of dial drop of the needle on the can squeeze the student auditor should know that setting the sensitivity for 13 of dial drop on the can squeeze is an integral part of setting up each and every session he does it is the sensitivity he will be using during the session it is vitally important he gets the correct sensitivity setting for each preclear at each session so that he will not miss reads or fns sensitivity setting which is too low or too high for that particular preclear in the particular session will obscure reads and fns thus upsetting the preclears case therefore the student auditor must be proficient on this drill 1 have the coach pick up the cans and keep his hands on the table so the student can see them throughout the can squeeze b check the coachs grip to ensure it is correct also ensuring you have the correct can size c adjust the sensitivity booster knob to the lowest position d set the sensitivity knob at 5 on the sensitivity dial b adjust the needle to set line on the dial c get the coach to squeeze the cans ensuring he does it properly d note the distance the needle fell when the coach squeezed the cans on step d d the needle will have fallen distance of either less than 13 of dial drop or b more than 13 of dial drop if its raise the sensitivity bit and repeat steps d b and d and continue to do this until you have 13 dial drop if its b lower the sensitivity bit and repeat steps d b c and d and continue to do this until you have 13 dial drop in other words keep adjusting your sensitivity lower or higher according to whether the drop is more or less than 13 of dial drop until you get the correct sensitivity setting each time new can squeeze is asked for the student auditor is to make sure the coach is holding the cans properly and is giving correct can squeeze f the student then notes the exact sensitivity setting at which he got the 13 dial drop flunks are given for errors as in section ii above and for failing to 315recognize when 13 dial drop of the needle on the can squeeze has been obtained for failing to recognize if the coach is giving considerably harder or lighter can squeeze than he was giving at sensitivity 5 and for failing to establish the correct sensitivity setting for 13 of dial drop on the coach 2 now the coach has the student auditor do the drill on number of other students with the coach watching until he is satisfied that the student can easily and accu rately establish the correct sensitivity setting for 13 dial drop can squeeze section iv to give the student auditor reality on how correct sensitivity setting for l3 of dial drop on the can squeeze gives readable and workable meter and how an incorrect sensitivity setting gives an unreadable and unworkable meter so the student will understand why he has to use sensitivity setting that gives 13 of dial drop 1 coach has the student auditor set the sensitivity accurately on correct can squeeze for 13 dial drop as in section iii 2 the student auditor does pinch test as follows student pinches the coachs arm hard enough to hurt little bit 3 now while watching the meter the student says to the coach recall that pinch i just gave you thank you 4 student notes the reaction of the needle to his command and the distance the needle fell 5 coach has the student do steps 2 3 and 4 several times each time noting what the needle does in response to recall that pinch 6 coach now has the student set the sensitivity at 1 student has coach squeeze the cans and notes whether theres read or not if there is read note size of read and leave the sensitivity at 1 if theres read on the squeeze the student still leaves the sensitivity at 1 7 the student auditor does new pinch test as in 2 3 4 and 5 above noting the difference in needle response to the command recall that pinch as compared to what it was in step 5 at the correct sensitivity setting there may be read at all and the student should notice that 8 coach now has student set the sensitivity at 32 and coach squeezes the cans 9 student does the pinch test again and notes the reaction of the needle to his com mand recall that pinch 10 coach has the student then set the sensitivity correctly for 13 of dial drop on correct can squeeze and does the pinch test again 11 the student should observe from these pinch tests that an accurate sensitivity setting determined from correct can squeeze gives readable and workable meter and that an incorrect sensitivity setting gives an unreadable and unworkable meter if he does not see this clearly then the coach would have the student redo steps 7 through 10 until the student sees why the sensitivity must be set for 13 of dial drop determined by correct can squeeze flunks are given for failing to note what the needle did and size of read in response to student telling coach to recall the pinch and for errors in setting sensitivity accurately and getting correct can squeeze when called for in the drill 316history developed as training drill by l ron hubbard at saint hill in decem ber 1963 and revised by l ron hubbard

and observing the needle fall the whole section is substituted with the following the exact setting of the sensitivity knob is done as follows have the preclear hold the electrodes cans in his hands with the cans in contact with the cups of his palms and all his fingers and both thumbs in comfortable grip set the sensitivity at 5 and adjust the position of the needle to set have the preclear squeeze the cans with an even gradual pressure not sudden hard squeeze watch the distance the needle drops if the distance the needle fell is less than onethird of dial drop raise the sensitivity some and get another can squeeze tinuing this procedure till youve got the sensitivity setting that gives you one third dial drop on the can squeeze if the can squeeze gave you more than onethird dial drop at sens 5 lower the sensitivity setting bit test 319another can squeeze continuing this procedure till you get onethird of dial drop in other words keep adjusting your sensitivity lower or higher

develops into sf f or bd which then can be used the whole section now reads change of characteristic occurs when we hit on something in the preclears bank it occurs only when and each time that we ask that exact question as the question or item alone changes the needle pattern it can be further explored with the suppress and invalidate buttons to see if it develops into sf f or bd which then can be used page 15 section 18 delete usually 320add may the whole section now reads question that stops rising needle is change of characteristic question and like fall means we have struck some thing further exploration may develop it into fall page 16 section 21 delete within one tenth to one half of second after you have asked question of the preclear add an instant read is defined as that reaction of the needle which occurs at the precise end of any major thought voiced by the auditor the whole section now reads it is not much used but must be known as it may have to be used sooner or later when we cant get falls the only needle reactions in which you should be interested are those which occur instantly an instant read is defined as that reaction of the needle which occurs at the

happening several times second the needle goes crazy slamming back and forth narrowly widely over on the left over on the right in mad war dance or as if it were frantically trying to escape it means hot terminal or hot anything in an assessment and takes precedence over fall the entire section is replaced with rock slam is crazy irregular left right slashing motion of the needle it repeats left and right slashes unevenly and savagely faster than the eye easily follows the needle is frantic the width of rock slam rs depends largely on sensitivity setting it goes from onefourth inch to whole dial but it slams back and forth it means hot item in an assessment and takes precedence over fall or it means that you have left rings on the pcs hands or have loose connection in the leads or meter if the latter two items verify as not present you are looking at rock slam in the pc re free needles page 17 section 41 delete it means an idle uninfluenced motion matter what you say about the goal or terminal it isnt just null its uninfluenced by anything except body reactions 321the entire section is replaced by it means the same as floating needle which is rhythmic sweep of the dial at slow even pace of the needle back and forth back and forth without change in the width of the swing except perhaps to widen as the pc gets off the last small bits of charge note that it can get so wide that you have to shift the tone arm back and forth back and forth to keep the needle on the dial in which case you have floating tone arm page 18 section 44 delete it doesnt happen until person is well above release so dont worry about it until you see it the whole section is replaced with it can occur after cognition blowdown of the tone arm at release point or on the erasure of dianetic chain page 18 section 46 delete free needle means when its used as term the preclear is getting awful close to clear the whole section is replaced with free needle or floating needle is one of the parts of

entire line is replaced with b theres an earlier similar overt or withhold page 22 section 5 delete in the case of past life possibility you add in this lifetime to your security question as you repeat that if the misdeed was in past life the fall will vanish the whole section is replaced with in the case of b when theres an earlier similar overt or withhold you must ask for it and get it

the emeter is right even when it seems to make the preclear wrong except when its false read which can be checked for re meter frailties page 25 section 7 delete if that doesnt stop it squirt some lighter fluid into the tone arm bearing from the meter face side add including the mark v until february 1979 the entire section now reads one exception the british and american hubbard electrometer early models including the mark v until february 1979 had carbon pot which is to say the tone arm was in pure carbon bearings if you could call it that speck of dust can get in the pot and cause the needle to rock slam whether connected to the preclear or not pull the lead wire jack disconnecting cans and if the slam continues its the pot thats wrong work the tone arm vigorously for short while if that doesnt stop it turn it in to be repaired later models of the british and american hubbard electrometer have wire wound pots and this doesnt happen l ron hubbard founder lrhjk copyright 1979 by

words and cycles of action misunderstood words and product misunderstood word can prevent person from understanding the remainder of what is heard or written i have now discovered that misunderstood on any given subject can prevent the completion of cycle of action related to that subject therefore those people who dont complete cycles of action on certain subjects have misunderstood word on them this then results in noproduct situations therefore when you are getting product look for the misunderstood word on the subject matter how long and arduous it is its there and when its found the person can go on and complete cycle of action and get product caution make sure the person actually does have an inability to complete cycle of action before you get into handling him you dont handle somebody who is completing cycles of action that result in production misunderstoods and perception misunderstoods can also act as perception shutoffs they can actually interrupt persons perception it is quite astonishing that perceptions such as sight sound and even touch can be shut off by misu words this opens the door to the fact that people apparently do not see hear notice or handle outnesses when they have misus on them this also may open the door to people who have perceptic shutoffs such as poor eyesight deafness or other perception difficulties misunderstoods and complexity misunderstoods lead to complexity people who have misus in an area are inclined to develop vast complexities they can generate confusions and complexities beyond belief 329people do this because having misunderstoods they do not confront and dupli cate in the area and so get into lot of thinkthink and unnecessary significance their ability to get things done in that area dwindles as result and at the bottom of all this is simply misunderstood words misunderstoods and total organize when you see an area that is organizing only you know that area is loaded with misunderstoods when people have incomplete cycles due to misus they get bogged down into organization you can tell when people have misusthey are totally involved in organize organize organize they dont know what they are doing there is level below thisthey have overts and withholds which prevent even organizing below that level people are pts lacking sense of organization actually lies below this it is below the level of misus overts and withholds and ptsnessand youd have to go north through ptsness and overts and withholds to even get to the misus misunderstoods and organize there can also exist condition where someone does not organize any corner of his area or work or organizations or lines this manifests itself by irrational demands to only produce and to prevent any organization so that production can occur at the bottom of this you are very likely to find misunderstood words particularly on the purpose of the production or why one is producing it is in this sector that you get overt products most

designed to sort out and handle the follow ing situations 1 when an item stating the pc has gone dianetic clear has read on cs 53 gf l3rf end of endless drug rundown list or int rd correction list or any other correction list and the read has been confirmed ie it is not false or protest read or read on assertion such read is only twoway commed to fn and is not datelocated or other wise handled at this point the person is signed up for dianetic clear special intensive during which he will get the state of clear fully polished up and rehabilitated 2 when an individual thinks he is or might be dianetic clear 3 when person has attested to dianetic clear and has not had formal auditing session to establish it but has only had mere d of p interview trying to audit or rehab in an interview is outtech misuse of d of p inter views and doesnt verify or rehabilitate the state 4 where there has been some attempt made to rehab the state of dianetic clear on 333an individual without use of this intensive which didnt reach the correct end phenomena or where the person wasnt doing well after the rehab notethe dianetic clear special intensive is not given to nondianetic clear in order to audit him up to that state its use is for verification and rehabbing of the state of dianetic clear per the above purchase of auditing if the person is in the middle of an intensive and goes clear or it is discovered that he has gone clear in past auditing the remaining hours of the intensive may be applied to the dianetic clear special intensive provided there is minimum of 5 hours remaining if there is less than five hours remaining then he would need to purchase minimum of 5 hours for the dianetic clear special intensive this issue gives the exact procedure to follow to handle each of the above situa tions standardly in an auditing session with hco pl 1 may 79 dianetic clear special intensives we have established the standard lines and policy concerning dianetic clear checks and rehabilitation the state of dianetic clear is not to be checked verified or rehabbed in d of p interview or any other type of interview such actions are done only in the dianetic clear special intensive this intensive is used to establish with eval or inval in the procedure whether the person has actu ally achieved the state or not b ensure that the person who has made it attains full resurgence of the state c establish for the person who has not yet made dianetic clear that he hasnt get any win he has achieved acknowledged and get him programmed and onto his next auditing to get him further toward achieving the state of clear d if he thinks this intensive is going to make him dianetic clear it establishes him on his proper rundown and gets him that much closer to clear fes and folder study immediately after the intensive is purchased and before the intensive is begun the first action is full fes of the pcs folders so that the cs has an accurate estimation of the case in general as well as data on any originations or actions taken on the subject of dianetic clear this fes must include examining the persons past auditing on the subject of int and ln lists because if either of these are out you cannot audit anything else until these are handled alternative choices as the fes and folder study may reveal outint outln lists or past rough auditing needing repair you would not then be able to proceed with the dianetic clear special intensive until outint outln lists or rough auditing were repaired during the dianetic clear special intensive you may find that the person has interest in the questions that he is there to become clear and didnt go clear in past auditing you may encounter crashing misunderstood words on the subject of clear or auditing this gives choice between 334a if int or ln lists are out or the person has had rough auditing sign him up for and deliver the end of endless int repair rundown ln list repair or cs 53 to fning list these are sold by 12t2 hour intensives and he would need these actions done anyway before he could proceed up the bridge note if he has gone dianetic clear and you have to handle int lists or repair past auditing before doing the dianetic clear special intensive you must indicate that he has gone dianetic clear and that this has not yet been patched up this indica tion is made before starting to handle int lists or repair b if there is evidence of outint or outln lists proceed with the dianetic clear special intensive c if during the dianetic clear special intensive you find that he has interest and didnt go clear in past auditing you would bridge him over to his next auditing step dont make him wrong for having bought the dianetic clear special inten sive but see that he gets onto proper program and gets that much closer to clear in the 5 hours the correct program is determined by the cs and would probably be word clearing objective processes or ned new era dianetics at the end of this 5 hours he would be sent to the registrar to get further intensives needed to complete the procedure each step of the intensive is carried out in formal auditing session never in an interview step i two way comm each of the following questions are taken up with the pc with good twoway communication it is important that all reads tone arm action with length of reads and bds and needle behaviour are noted clearly in the worksheets if the pc shows interest in the questions or in dianetic clear dont push him to answer or let him run on an unreading question instead clear any misunderstood word or words on the subject of clear and end off to get the folder to the cs to handle per choice c above under alternative choices this way he will at least get further toward clear within the 5 hours and it makes him right for having got the auditing typical cs for step 1 of the dianetic clear intensive would read as follows give the pc an rfactor on what you are going to be doing in this session b fly each rud 1 when do you feel you went dianetic clear 1a if pc doesnt feel he did go dianetic clear and is not interested ask him tell what you would like to accomplish in auditing take this to fn and end off for new cs 2 what happened at that time 3 is there anything else that occurred that made you feel you went dianetic clear 3354 how were you running dianetics before the point you feel you went dianetic clear 5 how were you running dianetics after the point you feel you went dianetic clear 6 did you experience life differently after the point you feel you went dianetic clear and since that time if so tell about it 7 has there been any invalidation of your originations regarding dianetic clear if so get who and what was said 8 has anyone evaluated for you on the subject of dianetic clear if so get who and what was said 8a if it turns out that someone suggested that he was dianetic clear or tried to feed him the ep or cognition take the evaluation or suggestion earlier similar to fn and end off for new cs 9 did you experience any other changes not already mentioned in this session that you connect with the state of being clear 10 has anyone discussed the subject of dianetic clear with you if so get details and pull strings to ensure there has been feeding of cognitions 11 have you always been clear 12 is there anything else you would like to say regarding being dianetic clear that hasnt already been covered here the cs may add questions of his own to the above at his discretion but these must not be evaluative nor invalidative when you have full data on each of the twoway comm questions end the session and send the folder to the cs the auditor should include in his proposed cs recommendation as to whether step ii or iii should be done as the next action step ii conditional datelocate the cs would only order step ii at this point after full review of data obtained in step i and under the following conditions it has been verified unquestionably in step i that the pc had attained the state of dianetic clear b the pc must have given the proper evidences of having gone clear c pc is fning with vgis d by content of the session and pc indicators there is bypassed charge concern ing the state of dianetic clear to be handled it will be in rare instances that step ii is done at this point in the intensive ordinarily datelocate is done as the last action following the dianetic clear intensive assessment list it is included here as conditional step for the pc who is manifesting all of the above indicators following step i step ii consists of 1 datelocate the point the pc went dianetic clear using the full and exact procedure given in hcob 15 nov 78 dating and locating 3362 when the point the pc went dianetic clear has been correctly dated and located the folder is sent to the cs 3 if datelocate has been correctly done the pc has stated the clear cognition in some wording has floating floppy needle and floating ta with vvvgis the cs may send the pc to attest to the state of dianetic clear if all of the above indicators thru d are not in or if it appears the pc has any bypassed charge to be handled the cs would not order step ii at this point but would order step iii the dianetic clear special intensive assessment list be done step iii the dianetic clear special intensive assessment list ref

been correctly done the pc has stated the clear cognition in some wording has floating floppy needle and floating ta with vvgis the cs may send the pc to attest to the state of dianetic clear end phenomena the end phenomena of the dianetic clear special intensive is full resur gence of the state of dianetic clear for the person who has achieved dianetic clear step iv conditional for the person who hasnt yet attained dianetic clear on one of the above steps of the intensive it may become obvious that the person hasnt yet attained dianetic clear once this has been adjudicated by the cs the following step is done if the pc still has any hours remaining from the 5hour intensive they would be used for this cs as it is still part of the intensive as more hours are needed they would of course have to be purchased 1 give the pc the rfactor that he hasnt attained the state of dianetic clear at this point and that he is being programmed so as not to be denied any of the gains on the grade chart as in this way he will be adequately prepared to do advance course levels the cs then programs the case so that this can occur and the pc is informed he should continue with his auditing program if he had already been allowed to attest earlier that the person handling the attest cycle didnt have all the data at that time if there is any upset on this indication go to step 2 if upset go to step 3 2 assess gf m5 to locate and handle the remaining charge cs 53 may be assessed if more appropriate 3 with pc vgis in find out if there is some valid win or gain of ability that he has achieved there will usually be one so get it and give him good acknowledgement 4 send the folder to the cs for adjudication unless other actions are necessary cs will have the pc sent to qual to attest to his win and completion of the dianetic clear special intensive 337the end result of step iv should be person who feels good about the gains he has made and who is eager to continue up the bridge dl caution it has been found that pc who has gone dianetic clear and who then receives messed up dl of the point may become uncertain as to when he actually did achieve this state at this point

nov 78 dating and locating auditors and cses take note the questions in the above sessions indicate what kind of questions should be asked to verify the state of dianetic clear or natural clear there may be other questions the cs may ask in addition to these bear in mind that you may often be dealing with untrained pcs who dont know quite what is being looked for an excel lent comm cycle is essential in these sessions and very smooth tr 3 and tr 4 are needed to really get your questions answered and clarified as necessary otherwise you may lose people who have actually made it on the other hand the questions are geared to find out what actually did occur and not to evaluate or lead person into premature attestation you must not evaluate for pc by asking questions that ask him to describe his current case state in relation to his bank or mental image pictures or asking him what his abilities are in relation to his mental image pictures the rule here is not to evaluate at all as it will only lead you and the pc into trouble smooth line so now you have it clearly stated we can now get pcs through these verification cycles smoothly an important point here is that whatever the outcome of the dianetic clear special intensive each individual should continue right along and not get parked somewhere on the bridge there is lot of progress to be made and with this intensive

quality product profes sional is not an audience and when he views things he looks for whats good in them and neglects the poor lowgrade things the reason he does this is so he has an ideal scene without an ideal scene he just operates off technical data and produces artwise low quality product and isnt professional without an ideal scene he can never get preconception of the shot in viewing things that approach an ideal scene the true professional works out how they did it and when presented with similar tasks of production can bring off things which approach an ideal scene in his own work another thing that separates member of the audience from professional is that the professional only thinks in terms of getting out an actual product it never enters his head that hes just there for the ride or that being an expert is enough member of the audience has faintest concept or idea of getting out product professional knows the rules of the game as matter of course so that he can achieve in the upper strata above that high quality of art when person simply looks at everything as to whether he likes them or not likes them hes just an audience and hes on the wrong side of the footlights this applies to writer director an actor cameraman makeup man propsman wardrobe man producer an artist any professional without this viewpoint he never accumulates ideal scenes so how could

long as is required and then is completed as planned to produce products one has to also have completed cycles of action com pleted cycle of action normally results in product where steps ah of hco pl debug tech lrh ed 302 int rewritten have been done to avail meaning products are not yet rolling out of the area then the tech herein is to be used as step i of debug tech to get the area producing just as misunderstood word can prevent person from understanding the remainder of what is heard or written misunderstood can prevent cycle of action from completing this is extremely valuable data as it gives us the major reason people dont complete cycles of action it is utterly amazing and magical an area is plagued with not dones and half dones and products resulting and one would swear that the reasons were infiltration sabotage evil intentions you name it but in the majority of cases it will be found that the above discovery is operating the person has misu on key word involved in the cycle of action the person usually doesnt realize he has misunderstood it is revelatory to him when he finds it so it isnt necessarily true that he will know so he himself additionally has number of wrong whys and wrong reasons there is usually one principal misunderstood that is preventing the cycle of action from completing this is called the crashing misu application while finding crashing misus is not substitute for full word clearing and while it is also true that the person can be pts and be engaged in creating problems it is nevertheless uniformly true that crashing misunderstood lies somewhere in the subject matter of the cycle of action which is not being completed 347the tech given in this hcob can be used by anyone who has checked out on it and drilled it the steps given here cover metered and nonmetered crashing misu finding using word clearing meter will make the action faster and more accurate but it is not vital the whole action does not take long to do and will save hours of purplefaced desk pounding and frustrated attempts to get people to produce it is to be used by execs supervisors cramming officers missionaires etc etcanyone who is responsible for seeing that products are gotten out crashing misu tech is used in debugging products it comes as step i of hco pl debug tech if any of the earlier steps are out then you can find all the crashing misus you like and still not get one single product theory cycle of action is parallel to cycle of understanding or cycle of communi cation the cycle of action is the physical universe expression of cycle of communi cation the cycle of communication occurs in the physical universe misunderstood interrupts not only the cycle of communication or understanding but also interrupts the motion or action that is the discovery person is trying to get the product of finished house he doesnt understand the word plumbing he may tell you that it is because of the price of materials that nobody can dig in that kind of ground that certain types of pipes arent available that he is having trouble with his wifeand his supervisors and bosses will tell you that he is just plain lazy that he has been bribed not to that he is secret drinker maybe and even less printable whys but when you get right down to it and use the tech you find that he has crashing misu on the word plumbing he thinks it is defined as drilling holes mentally this interrupts his ability to think any thoughts through on the subject his cycle of understanding is being interrupted by the crashing misu this then has parallel cycle the cycle of action of trying to get the finished house thus for want of understanding of word we get the actual physical inability to finish cycle of action on connected subject i can assure you that ethics conditions threat of suit physical violence none of these things are going to get anybody finished house only when his crashing misu plumbing is found and properly handled are you going to get finished house this tells you incidentally that the time track of shattered civilizations must have been strewn with these things it doesnt only apply to house it applies to almost anything man has ever set out to produce it would even apply to some general who suddenly wont finish battle or war amazingly you will discover that the crashing misu has probably been mans single greatest barrier to actually creating and main taining civilization you have to work with the tech yourself to actually appreciate its depth and power crashing misu finding where you have person not getting products not completing cycles of action despite attempts to debug per ah of hco pl debug tech you have to get in there and find the crashing misunderstood it will be directly on the subject there are various approaches to doing this starting very simply and getting more complex you would start off using the simplest approach and then if that didnt handle you would go into more thorough handling and so forth procedure 1 it is apparent or it is reported that someone is failing to complete cycles and is not getting out his products 2 before even talking to him you inspect his area as regards products per hco pl debug tech 348a you look for what products have been gotten out in the past b you look for products that are there completed c you look for products that can be attained in the immediate future d you look for value of products as compared to overall cost of production you look for overt products or cycles where products continuously have to be redone resulting in or few products this requires bit of homework 3 conditional if your inspection finds he is getting out actual products and that he is not producing overt products correct the reports and let him get on with it do not go on with the steps in this procedure 4 now if the earlier debug steps per hco pl debug tech have been done and it is obvious from your inspection that this person is still not getting out the products he is expected to get out or should be getting out you know that he has crashing misu you just start hunting and punching around for the crashing misu on the subject of the products he should be but is not getting out what dont you understand about that subject what misu word is there on this subject you keep at it this way until you get the crashing misu on the meter you would use reads to steer him to the area and the misu crashing misu finding differs from regular word clearing in that it is an investigatory procedure which utilizes all methods of word clearing and whatever else it takes to find the crashing misu you can use method 2 method 3 method 4 method 5 method 6 or method 9 to help you find the misunderstood the person you are handling may be sure that the misu is in certain issue but doesnt know what the word is it may require method 2 or method 9 to actually dig it out often method 5 is used whereby the word clearer asks for the definition of individual words checking to make sure that he knows the definition as well the point is that you are trying to narrow down the area further and further until you finally get the crashing misu and any method of word clearing or investigation that helps you do this is legitimate 5 you clear this word fully to vgis on the meter it would fn dont assume the dictionary will necessarily give the right definitiona missing or false definition might be the root of his trouble if dictionary textbook or encyclopedia can be found that gives satisfactory definition for the word you are still not stopped you can go over all of the related material to the word and work out with him what definition has been omitted or what is the proper definition for it this is last resort but it is necessary that anyone doing crashing misu knows this as man has not necessarily properly defined everything in his technical sphere or culture warning the inability to find the definitions is rare case only work out the definition when you have exhausted all possible texts and dictionaries and have cleared all of the words you have encountered in them whether you looked it up and found it or couldnt find it and had to evolve it make sure the definition is useful to him and that it blows his difficulty with it 6 assure yourself that this was his crashing misu and that it is real to him when he finds it he will quite often be chagrined and then go into vgis and cognite and may change considerably right in front of your eyes 7 send him to the examiner 8 run some reach and withdraw in the area where he had difficulty to good win and tell him to get on with it 3499 check back later to see that he is now completing cycles of action and getting his products out if he is then you have got it that is the ep 10 if he still isnt getting out the product then you havent yet found the crashing misu and you have some more work to do go over his area with him and look for things that he has difficulty with often it will leap right up at you get him to tell you what the difficulty is 11 now question him to find the misu on that subject that is behind those diffi culties often his statement of the difficulty will contain the misu itself on meter you would get read as he says it off the meter you would have to take the words that he said and ask him what they meant for example he might say the plumbing always seems to be the hardest part on meter plumbing would read and you would take it up right away if you werent using meter you could say well what does the word plumbing mean and hell say well it means uh drilling holes and there you have it now clear the word as in step 4 above run your reach and withdraw and send him back to work end phenomenon the end phenomenon ep of this action is the person now producing the products he wasnt able to produce before and completing the cycles of action related to his product the end phenomenon is not the fellow now all vgis and saying he can get the products feeling great etc that is all very well but is he now getting out the products and you keep handling him with crashing misus and related handling until he is producing the products and then you know you have completed the crashing misu handling additional factors there are various factors which must be known by anyone doing crashing misu finding and used if the above simple steps do not get the desired result of the person now tearing along getting his products ows since overts and withholds stem from misus in the first place you are liable to run into ows when doing crashing misu finding if the person has ows in the area this will be manifested in the form of resistance to finding the misunderstood word either overtly or covertly an example of this would be the person misdefining word and then when you have him look it up in the dictionary he says that he knew it all along or it could be straight noncooperation if you are using the word clearing meter the handling for the situation above would be to pull the ows to do this simply ask do you have any overts in the area of and pull them each one earlier similar to fn with all specifics until the question fned on asking do the same with withholds and missed withholds since you run the risk of missing withholds if you try pulling withholds without meter in doing the nonmetered crashing misu finding the way you would handle the above situation is to ask the person if he has some withhold concerning the area you are trying to handle and getting him to tell you about it if you do this then you must get him meter checked to ensure nothing has been missed there is another manifestation which can be encountered crashing misu simply cannot be found at all yet it obviously must be there the person seems to cooperate somewhat but crashing misu turns up this is again an ow phenom enon the person is holding on to his withhold so hard it is burying the crashing misu 350again you could run the risk of missing withhold if you simply ask him for his withhold on the subject but we cannot rule out the fact that doing so sometimes works the crashing misu simply doesnt seem to exist yet by all evidence of products or overt products it must exist so simply asking him if he has withhold on the subject gives us the gain of finding it straight off immediately and if we meter check him afterwards to find out if he has any more withholds it is very likely to pay off once he has gotten off the withholds the crashing misu can pop right up when you miss withhold remember fantastic amount of upset can be caused for the word clearer or the person himself so dont indulge in missing withholds once the ows have been pulled or gotten off by whichever of the above methods you will now be able to find the crashing misu and clear it up sometimes in clearing the misu you will hit chain of overts connected with the subject and these will have to be cleared up or you may not get your product an example of this was cleaner who could not clean the crashing misu found was the word clean and this went straight into whole track overts which had to be fully handled when the overts and the misus were cleared up the person went straight out and started getting real products defense mechanism you may find the person has defense mechanism which would make it impos sible to find the persons crashing misu as he believes it is ok to have misus in that area the defense mechanism consists of false data which acts as justifier for the misu an example of this would be i dont have to know that as im not professional or well im new to the post and so on the handling would be simply to ask the person if there was some reason why it would be ok to have misus in that subject and then strip off the false data and justifications then you can recheck for the crashing misu and you will find it is now available see hcob false data stripping the word clearers misus when he has found crashing misu on the subject the word clearers first action is to himself look up the definition and the derivation of the word so he himself understands it he then gets it fully cleared up with the person this is all done right there in the crashing misu session if he doesnt do that he wont be able to perceive how the person has misunderstood it or misapplied it previously example person in charge of the lights in theater could never get anything lit crashing misu was looked for and the word scene was found however the person glibly read the dictionary definition and said he had it already the word clearer made him look up the derivation wherein it was found that the glib person didnt understand it at all for the person when asked for an example described an actor and how he would put the light on the actor the word clearer having looked it up first before handing the dictionary over knew that scene was stage it was found that the persons crashing misu had so introverted him that he had never perceived that stage had backdrops scenery and floor the word clearer practically had to pry him out of his head to get him to see that stage had walls and backdrops and that these had to be lighted if the word clearer had not known the correct definition of scene he would never have detected that the person thought it meant actor even though the dictionary said it had to do with scenery crashing misu tech would have failed as the person was very convincing as to how he knew it all already yet in the example was giving totally incorrect demon stration 351showers of light broke through when the person realized for the first time that he had to light the whole stage and had been in total mystery why people kept yelling at him this had been going on for long long time in the persons job and was making him total failure at it practical usage always ask for instances of practical usage from the person you have found crashing misu on from these you can detect if hes got it and if he hasnt got it he may have to work and work to clear it further the end phenomenon of crashing misu tech is not finding the crashing misu but getting the person totally straight on it and actually getting out the product debug tech crashing misu finding is an integral part of debug tech as covered fully in hco pl debug tech it comes as step i of the whole procedure when products are not getting out cycles are not being completed there will invariably be crashing misus but there may be other factors involved which also have to be resolved the handling is just to go through the steps of the hco pl including crashing misu finding step 1 and product clearing step j you may find more crashing misus come up during or after the product clearing the whole point is that you use the whole debug tech procedure without trying to short cut it otherwise you get the ridiculous situation of clearing up the fellows crashing misu on plumbing and then find he cant get out the product of finished house because there are pipes and wont be any for 3 months because the owner cant afford them this all has to be resolved important note since the sole purpose of this debug tech is to get the person or area producing what it should be producing you would not continue past point where this had been achieved so for example if after step c of hco pl debug tech had been done any misus on issues related to the area of production had been cleared up the person was turning out great products in the expected quantity and time period you would not then start looking for crashing misus this would act as harassment not help similarly dont use any other step of am of the above pl where it does not apply one should let people have their successes once you have achieved what is desired with this tech dont carry on the rule is dont continue debugging past the point where the person or area has been successfully debugged and products are now rolling and you would know it was debugged because products of the expected quality would be coming out of the area in the expected quantity gradient approach the whole idea is to try the simplest approach first and then if that doesnt work go deeper the end phenomena for all this is person cheerfully and willingly getting his products and these appearing visible in the physical universe examples this is how it might go you might find yourself in the position of being respon sible for seeing that the house in the example given earlier on this bulletin got 352finished you notice that the deadline has been exceeded by weeks and still there is house the first thing to do would be the inspection as in step 2 of the procedure above you would discover that the house has plumbing that is what is holding up its completion points to h in hco pl debug tech have been gone over but things still arent moving so you approach the contractor personally and go over this with him you start hunting and punching around for the misu ask him is it possible that there is some word you dont fully understand in the area of building this house and hell say well noits just that i dont have enough men to do the plumbing now you already know from step of your prior inspection that he does have adequate personnel so you say well what about plumbing is there some word connected with plumbing that you dont get hell say but ive always had trouble with it now you ask him what does plumbing mean and when he says everybody knows that plumbing means drilling holes you have his crashing misu as you clear this up his initial embarrassment will turn into floods of relief and off he will go and get the house finished up in time now if you were able to use word clearing meter so much the better you would put him on the meter and ask him something like now on the subject of building houses is it possible you could have misunderstood the meter will read on this and you use the read to steer him to the area and find the misunderstood word this is then cleared to floating needle fn and very good indicators vgis it might not be as straightforward as above the case could arise where there was plenty of evidence that the person has crashing misu yet despite arduous search nothing comes up you would then ask the person is there something about all this you havent told if your trs are good and you dont have challenging or accusative attitude he will come up with it i cant finish the house because the machine that cuts and bends pipes is broken with bit of further questioning you find that he broke the machine and has been withholding this for weeks and didnt even dare mention that it needed repair for fear of being punished simple meter check would ensure that nothing was missed then up would pop the misunderstood on plumbing which he thought meant drilling holes wonder he broke the machine he was trying to drill holes with it so now with his withhold off and his misu cleared up he will feel immensely relieved and will most likely be able to go right off and finish up the house at the most you might need to product clear him and run some reach and withdraw in the area per the issues on product clearing in this series case histories here are some actual case histories to show how crashing misu finding goes and the sort of things one might expect to come across and have to handle in order to debug cycle or product with this tech case this was senior executive who was on the verge of being removed from post the general manager was impatient with the lack of products from that area the word clearer inspected the executives department and found that the main area of difficulty seemed to be handling personnel b the word clearer put the executive on the meter and asked him if there were any products he should be getting out but wasnt crashing misu came up on this directly c by twoway communication the word clearer confirmed that the main area of difficulty was handling personnel d he took the words that were directly related to the area mentionedper sonnel staff etcand asked the executive what each one meant he checked the dictionary to ensure the person had full understanding of the words the exec seemed fine on these 353e there was one word the executive seemed to have some hesitation on so the definition of that word was word cleared method 9 few words were cleared up but none of them turned out to be the crashing misunderstood f the area of difficulty was further narrowed down by two way comm to the obtaining and posting of personnel g words relating to this area were checked some of the definitions were m9ed to make sure the exec really did have them straightstill crashing misu was found h the executive originated an area of difficulty to do with handling authority that he felt was interfering with his ability to obtain and post personnel misus were found in this area however i the word clearer asked for overts and withholds in the area is there some thing youre not telling about this area is there something youve done you dont want known etc but none were found j he then checked for false data something that would justify having misunder stoods on that subject and found that the exec was loaded with false data on the subject of authority this was handled by two way commit did not take much to clean up as the exec was realizing by this time where his trouble was coming from and was only too willing to get it sorted out k the word authority was found as the crashing misunderstood this became obvious as soon as the false data came off this word was fully cleared to floating needle and very good indicators and the executive volunteered that he felt ready to go back on post and produce the word clearer ended off and returned the executive to work he started producing actual products and doing well case b this was technician in highly specialized and complex field who was having difficulty with his job and was unable to get approval on some tests that were urgently needed an inspection of his area revealed the situation to be exactly as described b the word clearer put him on the meter oriented him to the situation and asked him is there any single misunderstood word in the area of these tests c long search ensued in which several words were cleared none of which turned out to be the crashing misu d the word clearer then checked for withhold and found out that the techni cian had never understood an important dispatch relating to the cycle and had been withholding the fact this withhold was cleared up to floating needle this was followed by further search for the misunderstood which uncovered an area of upset and losses to do with technical writing f the word clearer checked for the misunderstood that must have preceded the losses and the crashing misu was founda very basic technical word in the subject g he attempted to clear the word with dictionary but found adequate definition h encyclopedias and textbooks were consulted but none of them had useful definition 354i eventually by combining textbooks and working out what it should be workable definition was arrived at and the subject became clear to the technician who was greatly relieved the technician returned to work and started producing the very next set of tests submitted were approved case c this case was an executive who was having trouble getting people in his area to produce the actions below were done unmetered the product inspection showed the executive to be unable to get his juniors to produce b he arrived for the crashing misu finding quite upset and this had to be handled before anything else c the word clearer went over his upset with him and sorted it out to point where he was willing to go ahead with the action d various words were checked what does junior mean what is the definition of executive and so forth crashing misu was found the area of difficulty was narrowed down further to getting compliance f on checking the word clearer found that the exec had crashing misu on the word compliance which was cleared to very good indicators the executive went back to work and found he could now handle his juniors case d this person was in charge of briefing missions he had recently had trouble with this and some missions had fired without full briefing resulting in failures the word clearer asked him on the meter if there was anything concerning his post he was having difficulty with b the difficulty was narrowed down by twoway comm until it was established that he felt he couldnt brief them fully due to lack of time c the word clearer checked for crashing misu concerning this difficulty none was found d he then asked if there was something the person was withholding about the subject several chains of overts were taken up each one to floating needle until the question itself produced floating needle on asking the word clearer again asked for crashing misu in the area and one of the words in the persons own post title was found and cleared this was the crashing misu the person was then able to get out his products case this was an auditor who was being product cleared on her post the product clearer discovered that there was certain part of her post that this auditor could not handle it was certain aspect of handling the preclear b he asked her if there was one single misu in the area and helped her trace it using the meter reads c the crashing misu was found and cleared in the dictionary to very good indicators 355d the auditor was then able to complete the product clearing and get back to work her main difficulty longer impeding her from getting products the above case histories show the variety of situations that can come up and the handlings that would be done they are by means all the situations that can arise in doing crashing misu finding cautions make sure you guide him on the subject of products all the time you could get right off the track and find yourself clearing up whole subject that had nothing to do with getting out his product an example would be trying to clear up the whole of chemistry on photographer there is chemistry involved in photography the film is developed and so forth with chemicals but the person is photographer not photo laboratory technician so he does not need to know all of chemistry to get his product another point is that sometimes person will have crashing misu cleared up on himself and immediately suppose that this is the crashing misu everyone else has this is not necessarily the case when one has crashing misu on crackers it is not necessarily true that everyone else has crashing misu on crackers the crashing misus will be different it is their misus one is after repair if the action bogs down and cant be sorted out or the person becomes upset during or after crashing misu finding then the difficulty should be sorted out right away with crashing misu repair list this list is done on meter by someone qualified to do so botched or bogged crashing misu finding must be repaired within 24 hours effects of crashing misus you can tell someone has crashing misu because when you start to question them about the cycle of action or demand the products they will go robotic on you they sometimes just stand there gaping at you and wont even answer your question they wont even be able to talk to you theres another manifestation you will come up against and that is the person becoming annoyed with you this indicates either that he was getting out products in the first place or that he had withhold in addition to crashing misu the solution is not to immediately shoot them for not getting out the product find their crashing misu if they get annoyed then find out which of the above it was and handle and then the justice factor would consist of disciplining them for going past misunderstoods without clearing them you have to teach someone to get in his own ethics in this respect so that others do not have to take justice actions on him summary well here you have the tech that will enable you to debug failures to produce the products required of him the person using this tech has to learn it well and become practiced in its application then he will get the full benefit of it and total reality on its power lets get busy and along with the remainder of debug tech find the crashing misu when products arent coming off the line this is indeed miracle tech so lets go get some miracles lrhdrgal l ron hubbard copyright 1979 founder by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 356hubbard communications office saint hill manor east

withholds or ptsness other tech exists to handle these however they also sometimes in shadowy way make their appearance doing m9 people doing m9 are doing it to get something understood or get some order done or get some product actually made and out in most cases m9 will produce marked gain however when it doesnt work one of the above is also present handling of these is covered in detail in other hcobs however the item the m9er is most likely to collide with in situations where m9 is really not getting much done is the mysterious crashing misu crashing misu while it is always sitting right there in pt big as life can sometimes appear to be elusive it eludes the most conscientious word clearer and the person himself despite honest efforts to find it lets say youve made an exhaustive search for the crmu youve hunted and punched in the area of his products youve word cleared him on the texts covering his products and youve found and cleared some misunderstood words none of which are it youve done the full crmu and product debug procedure by the book and you still havent gotten the crashing misuas evidenced by products at this point you could suspect one of the following 1 the word that has caused him to crash may be right there in plain view it does appear in the texts and orders covering the persons post and products but it has been missed why because the crashing misu which is not your ordinary common garden variety of misunderstood word will not always show up for what it is in m9ing the word may appear in the materials but the person reads it with stumble or reaction whatsoever as he is so certain he knows it and his misunder standing of it is so obscured by false data and false definitions it doesnt even read on the meter on method 2 or 4 because its way below his awareness 361so you wouldnt just assume there was nothing there because the word didnt turn up on method 9 or methods 2 or 4 youd need to move in with method 5 or 6 and probably also false data stripping in case like this to really pry it into view or 2 the crashing misu may not be on the subject of the product itself but in an area related to the subject if this is suspected you look for the crmu in the related areas and its very likely youll come up with the prize the reason it wasnt found in the first place is because the word didnt appear in the materials he was word cleared on and it didnt come up in search in the area of his products but it was sitting there all the time in an adjacent related area in two cases recently where staff members were being crammed on rejects of their products this phenomena turned up and was used and it all straightened out nicely the watchword is you utilize all methods of word clearing and whatever else it takes to find the crashing misu alert re method 9 the data above applies to routine method 9 word clearing as well as to crashing misu finding thus if youve m9ed the person on his post materials and hes not getting it or making it realize that he may be sliding over an mu or even crashing misu where the word actually appears in the materials and is obscured for the above reasons or that the misunderstood may be in an area related to the subject and the word itself doesnt appear in the text youre handling method 9 is superlative word clearing tool word clearers must keep it effec tive and not permit that effectiveness to be dimmed by failure to know and use the data in this bulletin so you check the related areas where its indicated or you marry up routine method 9 with crashing misu finding and all of its steps where the person isnt making it otherwise and youll find the elusive misunderstood or crashing misu is not so elusive after all it will come plainly into viewripe for the plucking l

barriers to study hcob 26 mar 79rb series 35rb rev 2979 word clearing series 60rb product debug series 7r misunderstood words and cycles of action misunderstood or notunderstood are terms used to define any error or omission in comprehension of word concept symbol or status most people go around thinking that misunderstood is just something they obviously dont knowa notunderstood notunderstood is misunderstood but there are additional ways person can misunderstand word misunderstood word or symbol is defined as word or symbol for which the student has 1 false totally wrong definition definition that has rela tionship to the actual meaning of the word or symbol whatsoever example the person reads or hears the word cat and thinks that cat means box you cant get more wrong example person sees an equals sign and thinks it means to subtract something twice 2 an invented definition an invented definition is version of false definition the person has made it up himself or has been given an invented definition not knowing the actual definition he invents one for it this is sometimes difficult to detect because he is certain he knows it after all he invented it himself there is enough protest preceding his invention of it to make it read on meter in such case he will be certain he knows the definition of the word or symbol example the person when very young was always called girl by his pals when he refused to do anything daring he invents the definition of girl to be cowardly person example person never knew the meaning of the symbol for an exclamation point but seeing it in comic strips as representing swear words invents the definition for it foul curse and regards it accordingly in everything he reads 3 an incorrect definition definition that is not right but may have some relationship to the word or symbol or be in similar category 363example the person reads or hears the word computer and thinks it is type writer this is an incorrect meaning for computer even though typewriter and computer are both types of machines example person thinks period after an abbreviation means that you halt in reading at that point 4 an incomplete definition definition that is inadequate example the person reads the word office and thinks it means room the definition of the word office is room or building in which person transacts his business or carries on his stated occupation ref funk and wagnalls stan dard dictionary of the english language the persons definition is incomplete for the word office example the person sees an apostrophe and knows that it means that some thing is owned s but does not know that it also is used to show that letter has been left out of word he sees the word cant and immediately tries to figure out who can is 5 an unsuitable definition definition that does not fit the word as it is used in the context of the sentence one has heard or read example the person hears the sentence i am dressing turkey the persons understanding of dressing is putting clothes on that is one definition of dressing but it is an unsuitable definition for the word as it is used in the sen tence he has heard because he has an unsuitable definition he thinks someone is putting clothes on turkey as result the sentence he has heard doesnt really make sense to him the definition of dressing that correctly applies in the sentence he has heard is to prepared for use as food by making ready to cook or by cooking ref the oxford english dictionary the person will only truly understand what he is hearing when he has fully cleared the word dressing in all its meanings as he will then also have the definition that correctly applies in the context example the person sees dash in the sentence i finished numbers 3 7 today he thinks dash is minus sign realizes you cannot subtract 7 from 3 and so cannot understand it 6 homonymic one word which has two or more distinctly separate meanings definition homonym is word that is used to designate several different things which have totally different meanings or homonym can be one of two or more words that have the same sound sometimes the same spelling but differ in meaning example the person reads the sentence i like to box the person understands this sentence to mean that someone likes to put things in containers the person has the right meaning for the word box but he has the wrong word there is another word box which is being used in the sentence he has just read and means to fight another in boxing match ref funk and wagnalls standard dictionary of the english language the person has misunderstood because he has homonymic definition for the word box and will have to clear the second word box before he under stands the sentence example the person sees plus sign and as it resembles cross he thinks it is something religious 364example the person hears the word period in the sentence it was dis orderly period in history and knowing that period comes at the end of sen tence and means stop supposes that the world ended at that point example homonymic misunderstoods can also occur when person does not know the informal or slang usage of word the person hears someone on the radio singing when my honey walks down the street the person thinks thick sweet yellow or golden liquid good to eat that bees make out of the nectar they collect from flowers is walking down the street he doesnt know the informal definition of honey which is sweet one pet name which is how it is being used in the song ref funk and wagnalls standard dictionary of the english language 7 substitute synonyma word which has similar but not the same meaning definition substitute definition occurs when person uses synonym for the definition of word synonym is not definition synonym is word hav ing meaning similar to that of another word example the person reads the word portly and thinks the definition of the word is fat fat is synonym for the word portly the person has understood because the word portly means of stately appearance and car riage impressive especially on account of size ref funk and wagnalls stan dard dictionary of the english language the person does not have the full meaning of portly if he thinks it just means fat knowing synonyms for words increases your vocabulary but it does not mean you understand the meaning of word learn the full definition for word as well as its synonyms 8 an omitted missing definition an omitted definition is definition of word that the person is missing or is omitted from the dictionary he is using example the person hears the line the food here is too rich this person knows two definitions for the word rich he knows that rich means having much money land goods etc and wealthy people neither of these definitions make much sense to him in the sentence he has just heard he cannot understand what food could have to do with having lot of money omitted definitions can come about from using dinky dictionaries if the person had looked up rich in small paperback dictionary he would probably still be stuck with his misunderstood dinky dictionary probably will not give him the definition he needs in order to understand the word he would have to get good sized dictionary to ensure it gives him the omitted definition which is having in high degree qualities pleasing to the senses luscious to the taste often implying an unwholesome excess of butter fats flavoring etc ref funk and wagnalls standard dictionary of the english language example the person reads he estimated the light at f 56 he cant figure what this f is so he looks up f in the american heritage dictionary and wonders if it is temperature or money or sports for foul or maybe the money franc the text doesnt refer to france so he cant figure it out omitted in the american heritage is the photography definition of f which simply means the number which shows the width of the hole the light goes through in the lens the moral of this is to have enough dictionaries around note it can occur that an accurate definition for word is not given in any dictionary which is an error in the language itself 9 nodefinition nodefinition is notunderstood word or symbol example the person reads the sentence the business produced lucre understanding occurs as he has definition for lucre the word means 365money especially as the object of greed gain ref funk and wagnalls standard dictionary of the english language it isnt that he has the word in correctly unsuitable or any other way defined he has definition for it at all he has never looked it up and gotten it defined thus he does not understand it the definition does not exist for him until he looks it up and gets it clearly understood example the person sees dot at the end of word on printed page and having definition for period tends to run all of his sentences together 10 rejected definition rejected definition is definition of word which the person will not accept the reasons why he will not accept it are usually based on emotional reactions connected with it the person finds the definition degrading to himself or his friends or group in some imagined way or restimulative to him in some fashion although he may have total misunderstood on the word he may refuse to have it explained or look it up example the person refuses to look up the word mathematics he doesnt know what it means he doesnt want to know what it means and he wont have anything to do with it discussion of why he refuses to look it up discloses that he was expelled from school because he flunked with violence his first month of his first course in mathematics if he were to realize that he flunked because he didnt know what he was supposed to study he would then be willing to look the word up example the person refuses to look up the definition of asterisk on dis cussion it turns out that every time he sees an asterisk on the page he knows the material will be very hard to read and is literary difficult and highbrow discussion of why he wont look it up usually reveals and releases the emo tional charge connected with it which he may never have looked at before prop erly handled he will now want to look it up having gained an insight into why he wouldnt any word you come across which fits one or more of the above definitions of misunderstood word or symbol must be cleared up using good size dictionary or more than one dictionary or text book or encyclopedia it is catastrophic to go on past or ignore misunderstood word or symbol as one simply will not understand what he is studying student must discipline himself not to go past misunderstood words he should learn to recognize from his reaction to what he is reading especially the mental blankness which usually ensues right after one that he has gone by misunderstood he should look them up and get them fully defined before going on with his reading students must be persuaded to do this it is selfdiscipline that has to be learned the definitions of misunderstood and notunderstood and their different types must be clearly understood by person seeking to clear them in himself and others the commonest error in word clearing is for the person being word cleared to believe that misunderstood is something he simply does not know with this limited definition he cannot adequately be word cleared nor can he adequately word clear others so these definitions of misunderstood and notunderstood should be very well known as it will often be necessary to clarify them to the person being word cleared good reading lrhgal l

on his job or in life at the bottom of his difficulties will often be found unknown basic definitions and laws or false definitions false data and false laws resulting in an inability to think with the words and rules of that activity and an inability to perform the simplest required functions the person will remain unfamiliar with the fundamentals of his activity at times appearing idiotic because of these notdefined and falsely defined words verbal hatting is the main source of false definitions and false data someone who knows tells someone else definition or datum the person now thinks he knows the definition even though nothing in the field makes any sense to him the word may not even read on the meter during misunderstood checks because the person thinks he knows politician is told by an advisor it doesnt matter how much money the govern ment spends it is good for the society the politician uses this rule and the next thing you know inflation is driving everybody to starvation and the government to bankruptcy the politician knowing he was told this on the very best authority does not spot it as false data but continues to use it right up to the point where the angry mobs stand him up in front of firing squad and shoot him down and the pity of it is that the politician never once suspected that there was anything false about the data even though he couldnt work with it there is field in all the society where false data is not rampant experts advisors friends families seldom go and look at the basic texts on subjects even when these are known to exist but indulge in all manner of interpretations and even outright lies to seem wise or expert the cost in terms of lost production and damaged equipment is enormous you will see it in all sectors of society people cannot think with the fundamentals of their work they goof they ruin things they have to redo what they have already done youll find people whose estimate of the environment is totally perverted to the point theyre walking around literally in fog the guy looks at tree and the reality of the tree is blurred by the fact that trees are made by god so he wont take care of the tree because he is convinced 367what were trying to cure in people is the inability to think with data this was traced by to false data as phenomenon additional to misunderstood words although the misunderstood word plays role in it and will have to be allowed for when person is having difficulty in an area or on post when he cant seem to apply what he has learned or what he is studying or when he cant get through specific drill or exercise in his training materials you would suspect he has false data in that area or on those materials if he is to use it at all effectively he must first sort out the true facts regarding it from the conflicting bits and pieces of information or opinion he has acquired this eliminates the false data and lets him get on with it inability to hat we are looking here at brand new discovery i have made which is that it can be nearly impossible to hat anyone who is sitting on false data on the subject you are trying to hat him on this is the primary reason people cannot be hatted and false data stripping therefore enables person to be hatted even though other approaches have failed this is very valuable discoveryit solves the problem of inability to hat or train sources false data on subject can come from any number of sources in the process of daytoday living people encounter and often accept without inspection all sorts of ideas which may seem to make sense but dont advertising newspapers tv and other media are packed with such material the most profound false data can come out of texts such as stanislavsky russian actor and director and even mothers have hand in it such as children should be seen and not heard where subject such as art contains innumerable authorities and voluminous opinions you may find that any and all textbooks under that heading reek with false data those who have studied study tech will recall that the validity of texts is an important factor in study therefore it is important that any supervisor or teacher seeking to use false data stripping must utilize basic workable texts these are most often found to have been written by the original discoverer of the subject and when in doubt avoid texts which are interpretations of somebody elses work in short choose only textual material which is closest to the basic facts of the subject and avoid those which embroider upon them it can happen if you do false data stripping well and expertly without enforcing your own data on the person that he can find whole textbook falsemuch to his amazement in such case locate more fundamental text on the subject examples of false texts eastman kodak lord keynes treatises on economics john deweys texts on education sigmund freuds texts on the mind the texts derived from the work of wundt leipzig 1879father of modern psychology and joke textbook on proper conduct for sheep written by wolf use of false data stripping false data stripping should be used extensively in all hatting and training activities current society is riddled with false data and these must be cleared away so that we can hat and train people then they will be able to learn useful data which will enable them to understand things and produce valuable products in life false data stripping can be done on or off the meter it can be done by an auditor in session by supervisor cramming officer or word clearer or by an exec or any administrator students and staff can be trained to do it on each other not lot of training is required to deliver this procedure but anyone administering it must have checked out on this hcobpl and have demoed and drilled the procedure if it is going to be done on the meter which is preferable the person doing it must have an ok to operate an emeter 368gradients it will be found that false data actually comes off in gradients for example student handled initially on false data on particular drill will appear to be complete on it he goes on with his studies and makes progress for while and then sometimes he will hit bog or slow in his progress this is usually an indication that more false data has been flushed up restimulated or remembered as result of actually doing studies or drills at that point more basic false data will come off when asked for the reason for this is when you first give student false data handling he doesnt know enough about the subject to know false data from the true when he has learned bit more about the subject he then collides with more false data hitherto buried this can happen several times as he is getting more and more expert on the subject thus the action of stripping off false data can and must be checked for and used in any training and hatting the rundown has to be given again and again at later and later periods as student or staff member may come up against additional faulty data that has been notised it can be repeated as often as necessary in any specific area of training until the person is finally duplicating and is able to use the correct tech and only the correct tech exactly theory there is philosophic background as to why getting off false data on subject works and why trying to teach correct datum over false datum on the subject does not work it is based on the socratic thesisantithesissynthesis philosophical equation socrates 470 bc 399 bc great greek philosopher thesis is statement or assertion antithesis opposing statement or assertion the socratic equation is mainly used in debate where one debater asserts one thing and the other debater asserts the opposite it was the contention of socrates and others that when two forces came into collision new idea was born this was the use of the equation in logic and debate however had they looked further they would have seen that other effects were brought into play it has very disastrous effects when it appears in the field of training where the person has acquired false thesis or datum the true datum you are trying to teach him becomes an antithesis the true datum comes smack up against the false datum he is hanging on to as it is counter to it in other words these two things collide and neither one will then make sense to him at this point he can try to make sense out of the collision and form what is called synthesis or his wits simply dont function synthesis unified whole in which opposites thesis and antithesis are reconciled so you wind up with the person either attempting to use false unworkable synthesis he has formed or b his thinkingness locks up on the subject in either case you get an impossibletotrain impossibletohat scene glibness probably we have here the basic anatomy of the glib student who can parrot off whole chapters on an examination paper and yet in practice uses his tools as door stop this student has been mystery to the world of education for eons what he has probably done in order to get by is set up circuit which is purely memory the truth of it is his understanding or participation is barred off by considerations such as nothing works anyway but one has to please the professor somehow 369the less person can confront the more false data he has accumulated and will accumulate these syntheses are simply additives and complexities and make the person complicate the subject beyond belief or the collision of false data and true data without the person knowing which is which makes him look like meathead therefore in order to cure him of his additives complexities apathy and apparent stupidity on subject in addition to cleaning up misunderstood words it is necessary to strip the false data off the subject most of the time this is prior to the true data and so is basic on the chain where this is the case when that basic false data is located and stripped the whole subject clears up more easily false data prone some people are prone to accepting false data this stems from overts committed prior to the false data being accepted the false data then acts as justifier for the overt an example of this would be student studying past misus on subject cheating in the exam and eventually dropping the subject entirely then someone comes along and tells him that the subject is useless and destructive well he will immediately grab hold of this datum and believe it as he needs something to justify his earlier overts this actually gets into service facsimiles as the person will use the false data to make the subject or other people wrong so if you see someone who is very prone to accepting false data on particular subject or in general the answer is to get the prior overts pulled then the person will not need to justify his overts by accepting any false data that comes his way procedure you may not easily be able to detect false datum because the person believes it to be true when false data stripping is done on meter the false datum wont necessarily read for the same reason you therefore ask the person if there is anything he has run across on the subject under discussion which he couldnt think with which didnt seem to add up or seems to be in conflict with the material one is trying to each him the false datum buries itself and the procedure itself handles this phenomenon when the false datum is located it is handled with elementary recall based on 1950 straightwire straight memory technique or straightwire so called because one is stringing line between present time and some incident in the past and stringing that line directly and without any detours was developed originally in 1950 as lighter process than engram running cleverly used straightwire removed locks and released illnesses without the pc ever having run an engram once one had determined whatever it was that was going to be run with straightwire one would have the pc recall where and when it happened who was involved what were they doing what was the pc doing etc until the lock blew or the illness keyed out straightwire works at lock level when overdone it can key in underlying engrams when properly done it can be quite miraculous steps determine whether or not the person needs this procedure by checking the following 1 the person cannot be hatted on subject 2 crashing misus can be found on subject yet it is obvious they exist 3703 the person is not duplicating the material he has studied as he is incorrectly applying it or only applying part of it despite word clearing 4 he is rejecting the material he is reading or the definition of the word he is clearing 5 you suspect or the person originates earlier data he has encountered on the materials that could contain false data 6 the person talks about or quotes other sources or obviously incorrect sources 7 he is glib 8 the person is backing off from actually applying the data he is studying despite standard word clearing 9 he is bogged 10 he cannot think with the data and it does not seem to apply b establish the difficulty the person is havingie what are the materials he cant duplicate or apply these materials must be to hand and the person must be familiar with the basic true data on the subject being addressed c if the action is being done metered put the person on the meter and properly adjust the sensitivity with proper can squeeze d thoroughly clear the concept of false data with the person have him give you examples to show he gets it this would be done if the person was receiving false data stripping for the first time the following questions are used to detect and uncover the false data these questions are cleared before they are used for the first time on anyone they do not have to read on meter and may not do so as the person will not necessarily read on something that he believes to be true 1 is there anything you have run across in subject under discussion which you couldnt think with 2 is there anything you have encountered in subject under discussion which didnt seem to add up 3 is there something you have come across in subject under discussion that seems to be in conflict with the material you are trying to learn 4 is there something in subject under discussion which never made any sense to you 5 did you come across any data in subject under discussion that you had use for 6 was there any data you came across in subject under discussion that never seemed to fit in 7 do you know of any datum that makes it unnecessary for you to do good job on this subject 8 do you know of any reason why an overt product is alright 9 would you be made wrong if you really learned this subject 10 did anyone ever explain this subject to you verbally 37111 do you know of any datum that conflicts with standard texts on this sub ject 12 do you consider you really know best about this subject 13 would it make somebody else wrong not to learn this subject 14 is this subject not worth learning the questions are asked in the above sequence when an area of false data is uncovered by one of these questions one goes straight on to step fhandling f when the person comes up with an answer to one of the above questions locate the false datum as follows 1ask have you been given any false data regarding this and help him locate the false datum if this is being done on the meter one can use any meter reads one does get to steer the person this may require bit of work as the person may believe the false data he has to be true keep at it until you get the false datum if the person has given you the false datum in step then this step will not be needed just go straight on to step g g when the false datum has been located handle as follows 1 ask where did this datum come from this could be person book tv etc 2 when was this 3 where exactly were you at the time 4 where was the person book etc at the time 5 what were you doing at the time 6 if the false datum came from person ask what was the person doing at the time 7 how did the person book etc look at the time 8 if the datum has not blown with the above questions ask is there an earlier similar false datum or incident on the subject under discussion and handle per steps 17 continue as above until the false datum has blown on the meter you will have floating needle and very good indicators do not continue past point where the false datum has blown if you suspect the datum may have blown but the person has not originated then ask how does that datum seem to you now and either continue if it hasnt blown or end off on that datum if it has blown h when you have handled particular false datum to blow going earlier similar as necessary you would then go back and repeat the question from the detection step that uncovered the false datum if there are any more answers to the question they are handled exactly as in step f location and step g handling that particular question is left when the person has more answers then if the person is not totally handled on the subject under discussion one would use the other 372questions from step and handle them in the same way all the questions can be asked and handled as above but one would not continue past point where the whole subject has been cleared up and the person can now duplicate and apply the data he has been having trouble with i conditional if false data stripping is being done in conjunction with crashing misu finding one would now proceed with the crashing misu finding j send the person to the examiner k have the person study or restudy the true data on the subject you have been handling end phenomena when the above procedure is done correctly and fully on an area the person is actually having difficulty with he will end up able to duplicate understand and apply and think with the data that he could not previously grasp the false data that was standing in the road of duplication will have been cleared away and the persons thinking will have been freed up when this occurs matter where in the procedure one ends off the false data stripping on that subject and sends the person to the examiner he will have cognitions and vgis and on the meter you will have an fn this is not the end of all false data stripping for that person it is the end of that false data stripping on the person at that particular time as the person continues to work with and study the subject in question he will learn more about it and may again collide with false data at which time one repeats the above process note false data buries itself as the person may firmly believe that it is true sometimes the person will have such faith in particular person book etc that he cannot conceive that any data from that particular source might be false one artist being false data stripped had received some false data from very famous painter even though the data didnt really add up and actually caused the artist tremendous problems he tended to believe it because of where it came from it took persistence on the part of the person administering the false data stripping to eventually blow this false datum with resulting freeing up of the artists ability to think and produce in the area misunderstoods misunderstoods often come up during false data stripping and should be cleared when they do one would then continue with the false data stripping one person being false data stripped knew he had some false data from particular source but the false data was complete blankhe couldnt remember it at all it was discovered that he had misu just before he received the false data and as soon as this was cleared up he recalled the false data and it blew this is just one example of how word clearing can tie in with false data stripping repeated use false data stripping can be done over and over as it will come off in layers as mentioned before if false data stripping has been done on specific thing and at some later point the person is having difficulty with drill or the materials the stripping of false data should be done on him again in such case it will be seen that the person recognizes or remembers more false or contrary data he has accumulated on the subject that was not in view earlier as he duplicates drill or his materials more and more exactly former interpretations he had notised incorrect past flunks that acted as invalidation or evaluation etc may crop up to be stripped off 373cautions code false data stripping is done under the discipline of the auditors code evaluation and invalidation can be particularly harmful and must be avoided all points of the code apply rudiments one would not begin false data stripping on someone who already has outruds if the person is upset or worried about something or is critical or nattery then you should fly his ruds or get them flown before you start false data stripping overrun one must be particularly careful not to overrun the person past blow of the false datum the stress in recall is that it is light action which does not get the person into engrams or heavy charge keep it light if you overrun someone past the point of blow he may drop into engrams or heavy charge just take the recall step to blow and dont push him beyond it datelocate datelocate is another way of getting something to blow if false datum does not blow on the recall steps despite going earlier similar then it could be handled with datelocate in session as ordered by the cs this would normally be done as part of false data stripping repair list datelocating false data would never be done except in session as ordered by the cs or as directed by the false data stripping repair list the auditor must be totally starrated on date and locating and practiced in it before he attempts it false data stripping repair list the false data stripping repair list is used in session by an auditor when false data stripping bogs inextricably or the person is not fn gis at exams or gets in trouble after false data stripping has been done bogged false data stripping session must be handled within 24 hours new students students who are new to scientology should not use this pro cedure on each other as they may be insufficiently experienced to deliver it competently in this case the supervisor or someone qualified would administer false data stripping to those students who need it summary the problem of the person who is unable to learn or who is unable to apply what he learns has never been fully resolved before misunderstoods were and are major factor and word clearing must be used liberally now however i have made major breakthrough which finally explains and handles the problem of inability to learn and apply mans texts and education systems are strewn with false data these false data effectively block someones understanding of the true data the handling given in this hcobpl makes it possible to remove that block and enable people to learn data so they can apply it with the ability to learn comes stability and the production of valuable products with stability and the production of valuable products comes the achievement of ones purposes and goals high morale and happiness so lets get to work on stripping away the false data which plagues man clogs up his ability to think and learn and reduces his competence and effectiveness lets increase the ability of individuals and the human race l ron hubbard founder lrhgal copyright 1979 by l ron hubbard all

word clearing make all the difference in the world to the quality of technical delivery consequences of word clearing lack of word clearing has recently brought about some false declares and return of quickie grades in many orgs it was found that new hcobs were not being word cleared at all the right thing to do is make full use of word clearing technology word clearing requirements from the date of this issue the qualifications division when giving high crime checkouts must require at least method 9 word clearing on the materials in addition to starrates and drills qual should employ other methods of word clearing such as methods 2 3 4 5 6 7 or 8 when deemed necessary to ensure full understanding of the materials being high crimed methods 2 4 and 5 are very effective in the hands of

clearing in all high crime checkouts and the student interne or staff member must be word cleared to where he honestly has misunderstood words on the materials former high crime checkouts where high crime checkouts have been done previously and attested they remain valid but if the auditor case supervisor or word clearer is later crammed on those materials the cramming must include full method 9

important successful training lineup there are valid bpls or hco pls now existing which can cel twinning ___________ twinning is the pairing up of two students training on the same subject to work together on their materials it is scientology innovation in training for years it was used highly successfully when done correctly and as standard action on scientology courses recently i discovered big why behind course failures that is that twinning as subject and practice has become confused and fallen into misuse or fallen out completely and one of the reasons behind that is that number of hcobs on twinning were canceled and one issue exists that covers the subject in its entirety this hcob reinstates twinning firmly and with emphasis it is not subject to cancellation it fully lays out the purpose of twinning the basics and rules and correct use of twinning when and how it is done the responsibility of twins and the responsibility of the supervisor and the handling of twinning bugs it reestablishes mandatory twinning on all practical courses such as the trs 377course or on the practical sections of course such as emeter drills it also covers twinning in some areas of theory study where it is obviously called for such as method 9 word clearing when done between students background in 1954 we found that when you teamed up students of comparable case level and ability they then made progress when we find something that is that workable we put it to use twinning was installed as fundamental part of the scientology system of training and it immediately and effectively brought up the participation and action levels of entire course rooms of students students grasped the application of the materials faster it gave us results originally twinning was used almost exclusively on practical drills later in the early 60s it was carried over into twin checkouts on theory still later with the advent of word clearing applied study tech and fast flow twinning as broad mandatory action for all students on theory was canceled even so some orgs continued twinning students unnecessarily on admin courses and some theory courses and were not enforcing twinning on courses where it is mandatory such as trs course twinning on practical courses and practical actions has never been canceled by and was never intended to be canceled however line in bpl bpl 18 oct 76rd rev 10978 urgent important successful training lineup which stated requirements of twin training or checkouts for academy are canceled caused twinning to be dropped out even on practical drills in some areas and threw confusion into the scene in other areas the above bpl has now been canceled with vengeance and is replaced by hco pl 25 sept 79 i urgent important successful training lineup and this bulletin restores twinning to its rightful place in training as the vital tool that it is why twinning one reason twinning is so vital is that it brings those people who have sunk back into their first dynamic up out of their first dynamic and onto the third it gives the student terminal to work with it puts students into communication into doingness and participation one doesnt learn by being spectator twinning not only gets students extroverted but also gets them to take some responsibility for their fellow man these are factors that are sadly lacking in modern permissive education twinning versus modern permissiveness with twinning we are cutting right across modern permissive teaching the modern tendency is to just let everybody do as they please and put their attention on whatever they please this is the think of the day and it is in in most basic school systems and has spread as well into many different fields probably someone somewhere thought it would be much quicker and easier and require much less confront to just let student sit there permissively with his attention wandering around in the total significance of it all and then claim he had passed the subject when he had never gone near it it is symptom of people who cant confront not to make anyone else confront we dont buy this it is totally batty the creeping disease of permissiveness non confront and spectatorism is simply part of the beautiful world of irresponsible slop it has place in scientology training 378real twinning enforced effectively pulls the student right up out of the vague permissiveness of modern think and lands him with some responsibility right from the start with that he can be honestly trained cause and effect person being trained is mainly working on an inflow basis day after day it is inflow inflow inflow this tends to put him at effect in twinning the person can balance his inflow with outflow this keeps him from going totally into effect it puts some cause into the scene person when he is expected to apply knowledge or skills must of course be at cause when he is trained totally at effect he can get into what is called stuck flow phenomenon whereby he cant outflow the subject yet if he is ever going to apply it he is going to have to outflow it twinning has the virtue of balancing inflow and outflow it will be found that when the person comes to apply the tech he is already able to outflow if he was trained using twinning when to twin it is not necessary to twin students on admin courses nor as general rule on tech theory courses you ensure the student is applying study tech and is not going past misunderstood words and you let him get on with it practical and practical courses are another matter mandatory twinning twinning is mandatory on those courses where the essence of the course is to train the student in the practical application of the data this would include the trs course any upper indoc and objectives course specialized emeter drills course and courses of similar nature even though such courses also include theory the final objective of such course is person trained and drilled in the doingness involved and twinning is absolutely essential for this purpose thus on such course twins are assigned at the beginning of the course and they remain assigned through to the completion of that course we call it assigning twins in concrete one does not musical chair twins once assigned nor allow them to drift from one twin to another the whole essence of twinning is to get two students to work together to assist each other and take responsibility for getting each other successfully through the course twinning on practical sections of courses on certain courses containing both theory and practical such as academy levels you would not necessarily twin students on the theory section of the course you would however definitely and mandatorily twin them on the practical sections for example twinning is must on emeter drills or such actions as assessment drilling drilling of special rundown procedures where this is called for learning drills obnosis drills and other practical applications twinning on word clearing 379one always twins students where method 9 word clearing is to be done between the students themselves and not by word clearer similarly method 8 word clearing is twinned on exactly the same turnabout basis as described in method 9 ref hcob 30 jan 73rb rev 1679 word clearing series 46rb method 9 word clearing the right way an example of turnabout on method 8 would be first twin clears word second twin then clears word and word b first twin then clears word b and word c etc you do two actions consecutively every time twins may also be assigned to get each other through other methods of word clearing in this way henceforth on courses such as the primary rundown where word clearing is the essence of the course twinning is mandatory wherever twins are assigned whether for an entire course or for practical sections of course the rules of twinning apply assigning twins the supervisor is responsible for assigning twins he should take care to team up students of comparable case level and training and abilities inasmuch as possible in this way both twins make the best progress twinning very fast student with slow student should be avoided if possible as it can be frustrating and upsetting to both students this must never be used as an excuse not to twin students however ideally one matches them up according to their capabilities and twinning goes smoothly and produces best results when this is done in some rare instances it may be necessary to reassign twins who have been incorrectly paired but it should not be necessary if care was taken in teaming them up correctly to begin with otherwise once assigned twins work together through to successful completion of the course or activity turnabout the rule of twinning is that it is done on turnabout basis turnabout is done as follows one student coaches his twin through drill or section of drill they then turnabout and the second twin does the same drill or section of that drill plus the next drill or next section of the drill they then turnabout again with the first student doing the drill his twin has just done plus the one following the same system applies in method 9 or method 8 word clearing one twin clears word or m9s paragraph or section of the text they turnabout and the second twin clears the word or m9s the paragraph or section plus the following one they turnabout again with the first twin now clearing or m9ing the word or section his twin just cleared plus the one following turnabout is applied as well to starrate checkouts where these are called for it may be done by checking out an entire bulletin on ones twin before the turnabout is done or where very long text is to be starrated the turnabout can be done after each section 380with the turnabout system one person is not constantly leading and misunder stoods are kept picked up between twins the twins keep apace with each other we dont get unbalanced flows and both are kept progressing the twins responsibility twin is responsible for seeing that the student with whom he is twinned knows and can apply the material he has studied twins must be made aware of this responsibility at the onset of the course the twin word clears his fellow student he listens to his sentences and sees that they are correct and fit the definition of the word being cleared he makes sure his twin understands the materials if the student doesnt know them cold the twin helps the student find his misunderstood words and gets him through any difficulties twins do practical drills together they coach each other to wins and certainty in applying the materials 100 correctly if student flunks supervisor checkout on materials hes been passed on by his twin both students get flunk the twin must have misunderstood himself if he missed the other students goof morale and production morale depends on production production in training is the evidence of the demonstration of competence morale is up when competence is demonstrated morale is up when production is up morale isnt necessarily built by being nice twinning actions are carried out with good arc but being nice is not enough student getting good stiff coaching session from his twin and passingor getting good stiff checkout and passing feels great he has really accomplished something he knows that he knows the data or drill student who gets poor or nonstandard coaching or checkouts feels and knows that he has been cheated if his twin is just being nice he doesnt win and doesnt appreciate the checkout his morale will be down one keeps his twins morale and production high one gives him tough standard coaching sessions so he becomes competent one gives him tough standard checkouts so he knows he has demonstrated his competence in the materials it is always done with good arc it must be real to student and supervisor alike that twinning is not namby pamby brushoff activity one is responsible for getting his twin through the course if one twin goes to review the other goes to review if one twin goes to ethics the other goes to ethics if one twin should blow the other twin must go and get him one is responsible for getting his twin through the course there have been cases in the past where one twin worked like mad to get the other twin through an extensive section right at the end of the course the other twin then 381simply went off and would not do the same so the first student could also finish the course it is now firm policy that where such an instance occurs the student who abandoned his twin just because he himself was finished may not be certified and may not be given course completion until he has completed his twin twins are responsible for getting each other through the course the supervisors responsibility it is the supervisors responsibility to enforce twinning per the points in this bulletin he assigns twins pairing them according to their capabilities he ensures twinning is being done by the book on turnabout basis with both twins making progress he makes sure twins are wearing their hats as twins and taking responsibility for getting each other through exactly as laid out in course materials double flunk is given when student flunks supervisor checkout on materials his twin has passed him on double flunk means the student and his twin are both flunked in such case as if the twin has missed the students goof he must have misunderstoods of his own the supervisor maintains high tech standards by adhering firmly to this system and when he must double flunk he makes sure both twins get handled on the goof situation can occur where student and his twin get into games condition one with the other this gives noprogress problem situation the students who are twinned are not both working toward the same goal but one is in opposition to the other in some way this gives progress wins production demonstration of competence being permitted and low morale it is the responsibility of the supervisor as well as the twinned students to not permit such situation to occur with any failure of twin to be twin and assume that responsibility the supervisor gets the student checked out on this bulletin and any other applicable course material and ensures the student is fully handled to keep the course morale high supervisors must insist on production and on the demonstration of competence on all materials by the student and his twin in case where student gets sent to review or ethics the supervisor must uphold the rule that his twin always gets sent as well he ensures that any blown student is recovered by his twin in all such cases the supervisor keeps track of his students and ensures theyre handled and gotten back on course rapidly supervisor who understands the why of twinning and sees it is carried out standardly is going to produce causative responsible graduates who can apply what they have learned emphasis on verbal data all students should be made aware from the beginning of training that the answers to their questions are in their course materials or other source references 382the issues on verbal tech hcob 9 feb 79 how to defeat verbal tech and hcob 15 feb 79 verbal tech penalties should be wellknown in the course room even so students particularly when they are new sometimes get into an exchange of verbal data or opinion while they are twinning supervisor must be on the alert for this and step in to handle at once when he observes it happening he uses study tech to straighten the scene out and always refers the students to the above mentioned hcobs on verbal tech twinned students of course bear responsibility for not spreading verbal tech neither between themselves nor to anyone else for that matter twin always refers his fellow student to source materials handling bugs on twinning the main twinning bugs which could arise are those which were encountered earlier on the saint hill special briefing course one twin would get sent to ethics or cramming or review and the other one then had twin thus twinning could get to be little bit unpopular and could block somebody from finishing the course unless these factors are handled the remedy for this sort of thing is to send both twins to ethics both twins to cramming both twins to review and if anybody blows send his twin after him in other words we dont buy the idea that everybody is totally irresponsible for everybody else in this wonderful first dynamic world this is not mere expediency it takes only good straight look at the purpose and why of twinning to recognize the value of this system those who do recognize its value will enforce and maintain it there is another situation which could act as bug in twinning what happens when one twin actually does disappear from the scene totally in spite of checkouts and crammings and ethics what do you do with the remaining twin unhandled it can stop course for student so handled it must be and with time wasted you dont let the odd twin rattle around on his own for very long if hes not too far advanced into the course he can be twinned with an oncoming student wellrun course room will always have new students enrolling every effort is then made to get the newcomer caught up with his twin as rapidly as possible but what of the more advanced student who loses twin if theres absolutely other single terminal to team him up with there is still solution far preferable to having him continue on his own you match him up with set of twins of comparable ability and advancement to his and you turn that twinship into trio once formed you run that trio as tightly as you would any twinship the turnabout system would then need to be adjusted to round robin example coaches b b coaches c c coaches and it would then reverse this is more easily seen if it is diagrammed coaches b on the 1st action drill definition etc b b coaches c on the 1st action c c coaches on the 1st action and then it reverses b c coaches b on the 2nd action 383a b coaches on the 2nd action c coaches c on the 2nd action and now it reverses back coaches b on the 3rd action b b coaches c on the 3rd action c c coaches on the 3rd action and now it would reverse back again c coaches b etc and so on through the drill definition or m9 section all the rules of twinning then apply to these three you assign the trio in crete and you ensure they keep advancing again the point here is that we operate on the third dynamic where one does take some responsibility for his fellow man handling bogged students and their twins when bogged student cannot be handled in the course room with standard word clearing and study tech and he is sent to cramming review or where indicated to ethics his twin is also always sent the idea is not only to keep the twins together and taking responsibility for each other but to also correct and repair both of them as needed in other words one twin doesnt simply sit there and observe the other twin being handled the twin of bogged student will also require handling in review ethics or cramming himself if student has ended up on review lines it must be assumed that the twin has goofed as twin and has misunderstoods on the course materials this must be sorted out and resolved by the dir review when the twins route through review the dir review determines by interview what the trouble is and how it should be resolved this is done on an individual basis for each twin for example the bogged student may need word clearing or word clearing correction list and his twin may need to restudy this twinning bulletin or other course materials in ethics for example student may be involved in some sort of outethics situa tion such as continually being late for course in any ethics situation one would look for the possibility of mutual rudiments between twins whether or not mutual ruds exist the twin would always be given some handling in regard to his responsibility in the situation in the above example the ethics officer might handle the student with an amends project he would then go over with the twin the matter of his responsibility and what steps he could take to ensure the student gets to course on time the twin would then get the student through his amends get through his own handling whatever its nature and the two of them would then go back to course 384the twin sees the student through his review cramming or ethics cycle and whenever possible is used to help the student get through it he also receives appro priate handling himself the rule is when one student becomes bogged his twin is always sent with him to cramming review or ethics in the rare case where student is going to require extensive handling in review or ethics such as case handling or suspension from course where such would be truly warranted the dir review or ethics officer may send the other twin back to course to be retwinned with another student the supervisor always checks up on any students

mus and confusions which are obscuring the crashing mu in attempting to find the crashing mu one might have to find and clear these other mus before the person can locate the crashing mu which has been buried by these other mus and which is hanging up the cycle of action or the product crashing mu is mu that crashes subject and crashes person it is straight on the subjectline that is giving trouble and is totally blocking the persons compre hension of the subject this is not to be confused with other mus these would include grammatical mus mus on disrelated subjects or mus on simple words crashing mu is quite different it is directly on the subject and it totally blocks the persons understanding of the subject and stops any cycles of action or products on that line handling other mus obscuring the crashing mu are located and cleared using any of word clearing methods 29 or combination of these one might have to do method 2 and method 4 on certain materials for example before the crashing mu can then be located method 9 is very thorough and fruitful method of word clearing materials by whatever method the mus are found and cleared any mus that come up during crashing mu finding are immediately cleared this does not mean however that one has found the crashing mu one has simply unburdened it b overts and withholds ref academy class ii materials as covered in hcob 8 sep 64 overts what lies behind them overts and withholds can enter in after the person encounters misunderstood word or symbol on the subject or in the area having committed the overt the person may now be withholding so hard that it can become impossible to get his attention onto the mu word that comes earlier in time and is more basic than the withhold 387an example of this would be someone who had broken machine as result of trying to operate it over his mu on how it worked his attention would become so caught up with withholding this overt that he might not be able to confront the area at all let alone find the underlying crashing mu the persons withholds on the subject of the area not only prevent him from talking about it sensibly to the person trying to find his crashing mus but also tend to withhold him from the subject itself he wont be able to think well on that subject because he is withholding data concerning it the person might also be frightened of punishment or discipline if he did reveal his overt therefore communication with the crashing mu finder or the subject also may block up his memory or his ability to think on the subject and so crashing mu can be buried totally out of sight handling the handling of ows would depend on whether or not one was using meter for the crashing mu finding in metered crashing mu finding one would ask concerning subject under discussion is there anything you are withholding and if it was reading one would handle per hcob 11 aug 78 i rudiments definitions and patter suppress and false could be used as needed one could also check and handle concerning subject under discussion have you committed any overt concerning subject under discussion has withhold been missed in nonmetered crashing mu finding one could ask the person if he had any overt or withhold concerning the subject under discussion very often if one is in good communication with the person and there is accusativeness or duress he will say well actually i didnt want to tell anyone but i lost all the ruddy rods or whatever the withhold was in nonmetered asking for overts or withholds one must get the person meter checked immediately afterwards to ensure nothing gets missed it goes without saying that person can get very misemotional or blow or get very angry with the crashing mu finder if you miss withhold on him so dont be surprised if you get sudden blowup when you use unmetered overt or withhold questions c false data ref hcobpl 7 aug 79 false data stripping person who has been given and has accepted false data or false definitions on subject may become convinced that he knows the words when in fact the data and definitions may be entirely false this may even prevent the misunderstoods from reading on the meter it can certainly bury crashing mu because the persons certainty that he knows the data will prevent him from looking for the crashing mu which is blocking him from getting products handling one handles false data by stripping it off exactly per hcobpl 7 aug 79 false data stripping this is procedure which locates the false data and then blows it by recall it is an extremely effective way of getting off the false data which is blocking the persons understanding of subject by giving him false understanding d justifications ref hcob 21 jan 60 justification hcob 7 jul 64 justifications person can have defense mechanism whereby he justifies having crashing mu by giving reasons why it is ok not to understand the subject or area he explains 388why he doesnt have to understand and makes others wrong for trying to set him straight on it examples of this would be im new and havent been at it too long i have to spend so much time on my post i dont have time to learn about it only professional could really understand this one really knows anything about that subject anyway they keep changing the terminology so how could i learn it handling the handling of justifications is covered in hcob 7 aug 79 false data stripping which has several questions in the section on locating the false data which are designed to pull off the persons justifications for failure to understand subject or inability to turn out professional products in an area basically the questions ask for anything that makes it ok not to know particular subject or not to get results with that subject when the justifications are located they are blown with recall just as with false data in general if there are justifications present or if the trouble does not resolve with pulling off justifications then it will be handled with the next sectionservice facsimilies since justifications as used here are really specialized kind of selfserving service facsimile justifications and service facsimiles are actually cousins service facsimilies ref academy class iv materials hcob 5 sep 78 anatomy of service facsimile hcob 6 sep 78 ii service facsimiles and rock slams hcob 6 sep 78 iii routine three sca full service facsimile handling updated with new era dianetics service facsimile is an idea someone uses to make himself right and others wrong these ideas are held in by engrams for the purposes of crashing mu finding they can be handled by recall if you are trying to find someones crashing mu and he has service facsimile getting in the way then his efforts will be taken up entirely with trying to make himself right and you and others wrong and you will not be able to get to the crashing mu he would even feel made wrong if crashing mu was found one person who was being checked for crashing mu in an area in which she was goofing could not even see her goofs let alone crashing mu eventually she admitted that she had the idea that she could not be wrong regarding this particular subject when this was spotted and cleared up the crashing mu could be located and the whole area straightened out handling if the person is manifesting the symptoms of service facsimile or if the failure to find crashing mu where one obviously must exist is not resolved with ad above then the word clearer would ask is there some idea you are using which makes you right and others wrong and twoway comm with him about it without getting into listing for an item usually the person will give up the service facsimile and realize that he has been making himself right and others wrong he will feel very relieved to have spotted it and will be able to look for and find his crashing mu if however the service facsimile does not come up on request and twoway comm then the person should be sent for handling by an auditor on service facsimiles cautions 389the remedies given in this hcob must be understood to be remedies for inability to locate the crashing muthey are not substitutes for standard application of the tech of finding and clearing crashing mus one would always begin with the standard approach to finding the crashing mu and if none was found only then would one check for and handle each of the blocks given above in the sequence given if one found something on any of ae above one would handle it and then check again for the crashing mu one does not automatically check all of ae the sole idea is to handle whatever is burying the crashing mu and as soon as that has been achieved one returns to crashing mu finding if half way through the false data stripping for example the person realizes he has had crashing mu on then thats it you wouldnt now continue the false data stripping you would complete the step you were on and then end off the same goes for any of the remedies as soon as the crashing mu is found or findable the purpose of the remedy has been achieved and that would be it as it is fatal to miss withhold on someone it is very important that any withhold pulling done is thorough and goes to real vgis whether it is metered or unmetered withhold pulling off the meter must be followed by meter check whether anything is found or not similarly in asking for service facsimile it is possible to start the person listing and if he gets sick or caves in later one must assume that this has occurred and get the action repaired in session rapidly note of course if the person is pts and dramatizing creating problems you may not be able to get anywhere at all until he has been run on clay table deptsing to full ep these cautions are not given here to make it look difficult or dangerous to do crashing mu finding it is usually very straightforward however if one is going to get results every time he must be aware of the possible errors or barriers that he may run into and should know how to handle them summary sometimes crashing mu finding draws blank even though there is plenty of evidence that crashing mu exists other misunderstoods overts or withholds false data justifications and service facsimiles can bury the crashing mu if one runs into this situation one must not abandon the crashing mu finding as the person will continue to have difficulty and will not get out his products the answer is to handle the blocks that are preventing the crashing mu from being found and then find and clear the crashing mu then one can get the

february of this year i promised that there would be policy letter issued covering the tech more fully well there have been further breakthroughs in the area of debugging production the tech given in that lrh ed has been acclaimed by hundreds to be miraculous this policy reissues that tech and brings it up to date with the new discoveries history recently i noticed quite few programs were not progressing rapidly i found many targets bugged project operators did not seem to know what to do and were getting losses and becoming frustrated their targets were bugged bugged is slang for snarled up or halted debug means to get the snarls or stops out of something i had always been given to believe somebody had developed and written up debug tech people would often tell they had debugged this or that so of course i assumed that the tech existed and that issues and checksheets existed and were in use yet here were people operating projects who couldnt get the targets done by them selves or others i didnt recall ever having written any policy letter containing the tech of debug ging programs or targets 400so i called for the various debug checksheets and debug issues they were using and found something very astonishing none had any real tech on them to debug something they just had various quotes that did not necessarily apply i did study of the subject based on what people trying to debug should be doing and what they were not doing and developed fast relatively simple system some project operators were located in very bugged areas which had brought them to apathy and even tears of frustration the new debug tech was put into their hands and they came streaming back in wild excitement it worked their areas were rolling i am releasing this tech to you as it is vital that programs are quickly executed and that production occurs this debug tech is tested fully valid and for immediate use debug tech is vital executive tool anyone who is responsible for getting targets and programs executed getting production out turning insolvency into solvency and generally making better world frankly cant live without it debug tech is used to debug program targets programs lack of completion of the cycles of action which lead to production and in short whenever there is any insuf ficiency of viable products coming from an area org or individual the tech 1 inspection the first action in debugging an area is an inspection to see what is going on in terms of production in inspecting the area you do the following 1 you look for what products have been gotten out in the past 2 you look for products that are there completed 3 you look for what products can be attained in the immediate future 4 you look for the value of the products produced as compared to the overall cost of the production organization 5 you look for overt products or cycles where products continuously have to be redone resulting in or few products the full volume of data on how to do an investigation is given in the investigations checksheet on page 175 of the volunteer ministers handbook when you first inspect an area for products you just look policies on look dont listen apply hco pl 16 mar 72 series 8 look dont listen dont listen to how they are going to get 150 products just look and walk around with clipboard if you dont see 150 products waiting to be shipped or invoices showing they have been they dont exist if you dont see receipts for 150 shipped products they dont exist and never have the product is either there or there is ample shipping or departure or finance evidence that they have just left or been shipped products that are only in peoples heads dont exist dreams are nicein fact they are essential in life but they have to be materialized into the physical universe before they exist as products 401the most wide trap the debugger can fall into is but next week since experience will tell you that next weeks production may never arrive the definition of product is something that can be exchanged for valuable product or currency they have subproducts these are necessary subproduct can also be an overt product and block final products when you have done your product inspection you then look over the period of time from viewpoint of time and motion this is to answer the question are things arranged so that there is time wasted in useless motions which are unnecessary this includes poor placement of materiel on flow line or tool sheds five miles from the site of work so that one has to go there every time one wants hammer outof sequence flows or waits one counts up the amount of wasted time simply because of the disorganization of place it isnt enough to say place is disorganized how is this disorganization consuming time and motion which is not resulting in higher quantity of production examples of this are quite gross when you have done this study during which of course you have made notes you will have the raw materials necessary to make an estimation of the area if there is not an adequate and even spectacular record of products getting out and if products have to be redone or if products are coming out you proceed as follows ii personal handling find product that can be gotten out any product and insist that it and products like it or similar cycles be gotten out flat out by the existing personnel do not let this debug act as an excuse for them not to produce the first step of this handling is to demand production when you have gotten them on that you enter in upon second stage of debug this consists essentially of finding if the place is knowledgeable enough and able enough to produce what is actually required and what is actually valuable or being needed from it this is accomplished as follows note you should not attempt to find crashing mus etc until the above inspec tion and the steps to h below have been done where are the orders relating to this target or project or production area can include policies directives orders bulletins issues despatches tapes valid texts and previous debugs and any and all files handling collect up all of the orders relating to this target or project or produc tion area this includes the orders and policies the person is operating off of as well as all those he should be operating off of at this point you may need to employ the how to

may find the senior is failed student himself and this you would also have to handle note person who cannot be hatted at all has false data the handling would be to strip off the false data 403g is

to produce handling get the right stat figured out so that it agrees with what he is supposed to produce and actually measures his actual production 404m wrong vfp or wrong product do they have the idea of vfp right or does the org think its the award rather than the product ie gi rather than an audited paying pc or trained paying student it of course can occur amazingly that the person or department etc is trying to turn out product that has exchange value this can occur because what they do produce is so flubby as to be called an overt product which nobody can use further on up the line or even at the end of the line you handle this by coming down on their sense of fitness of things overt products waste resources and time and personnel and are actually more destructive than on first glance they cannot be exchanged but they also waste resources as well as lose any expected return you can remedy this sort of thing by improving their tech so they do turn out something decent and useful they can also be turning out type of product nobody wantssuch as 1819 buggy whips in space age they may be great buggy whips but they wont exchange because nobody wants them they may also be getting out products of excellent quality but never tell anybody they have or do them this can apply as narrowly as one worker who doesnt tell anybody he is having or doing them or whole organization which with complete asininity never markets or advertises their products it is also possible that combination of all three things above may be found it also may be they have all sorts of

debug tech checklist it is very useful checklist as the points of debug can be assessed on meter by an auditor or any person trained to use an emeter or be administratively used by anyone wishing to debug an area hcob 23 aug 79 issue iis product debug repair list is for use by an auditor to repair someone who has been messed up by somebody trying to debug his area as faulty debugging can mess person up this repair list has been written to remedy that should it occur normally in an area that is very bogged and not producing the first question or two will deliver the reasons right into your hands they are trying to produce blue ruddy rods but the order they finally dig up after fifteen minute search says specifi cally and directly that green finglebums are what are wanted here and that blue ruddy rods are forbidden it is usually outrageous and large as you go down the list you will find out that you are running into things which open the door to justification so you take very good care to notice the justifications which are being used the handling of justifications is indicated in hcob 23 aug 79 issue i crashing mus blocks to finding them and the hcob of justifications 21 jan ad10 what to handle handling of course is indicated by what you find and the above references but handling must always be in the direction of at least 50 production even while debugging do not go for an allorganize handling also do not go for an allproduction handling person once trained on the data as contained in this pl crashing mu tech false data stripping and product clearing will be able to get almost any area debugged 406and producing it is important to remember that debug tech applies from the very small expected action to the huge expected project the ep of debug the above debug actions are never carried on past the point where the target or area or individual or org has been debugged once production has been debugged and desirable products are now being gotten for real in adequate quantity the debug has been accomplished this could occur at any one of the above steps and when it does you let the area get on with producing the products they are now able to produce evaluation and programming there is whole different technology called evaluation the full tech on how to execute and program is contained in the data series and the data series evaluators course and

you will need debug tech even when you are an accomplished evaluator with the debug tech and the added steps of crashing mu finding overts and withholds false data stripping product clearing etc you will be able to crack the back of the most resistive nonproducing areas and get them into roaring highmorale production between february 79 and 23 august 79 i have spent great deal of development time

getting out products when they dont get them out the unit or organization fails it is extremely upsetting and puzzling to staff member and to his seniors when he cant get out the products expected of him i have seen an executive going around in circles for weeks trying to guess why such and such staff member couldnt get out the products of his post area i have seen staff members actually in tears because they were unable to achieve the products of their post i have also seen people busy busy busy and totally unaware of the fact that they were producing absolutely nothing lrh ed 302 was breakthrough it has now been written into hco pl 10 june 79 debug tech and contains considerably expanded tech on how to debug products people have had very great success in applying it to give them even greater successes i have rewritten lrh ed 3021 into this pl the whole object of this checklist is to debug lack of products and accomplish ments of an org or post this debug checklist is used in conjunction with hco pl debug tech it gives the person doing the debug list of things that could be standing in the way of production the sequence of handling is as laid out in the debug tech pl the first action is an inspection of the area then come the personal handling steps this sequence must be followed in any debug action for instance if you havent done the inspection then how would you know what it is you are trying to debug this checklist can be assessed on meter or be administratively used off the meter by mission operators program operators project operators evaluators executives and anyone else needing to debug cycle of action or lack of products including any staff member or student himself 408when assessed on meter each reading line would be taken to fn by doing the handling given for that line when doing this checklist the individual should have the issues and references he may need to carry out the handlings along with him the ep of debug debug actions are never carried on past the point where the target or area or individual or org has been debugged once production has been debugged and desirable products are now being gotten for real in adequate

wriggling around moving fidgeting watering red eyes and blinking and swallowing are ok these manifestations show that person is not confronting is nervous afraid flinching or in grief of course the coach never insists that the student mustnt blink nor that he mustnt ever swallow he coaches the student to do the trs until he can do them comfortably and competently at which point those manifestations of nonconfront are longer present good auditor can be there comfortably and would never distract pc 4 hco pl 4 nov 71 ii academy prerequisite this issue omitted mention of the hard trs course as an academy prerequisite as result of which the hard trs course was dropped out of the training for auditors hard trs course is essential to the ability to audit at any level of auditing patacake meaning childs game trs were originally used in div 6 for raw public to get them on coaudit in london in the 50s and still might be of some small value for raw public that never intended to be auditors but they sure wont pass or make real auditor in this era of permissive education forget the permissiveness the day we dropped out hard trs we entered an era of less case gain for pcs 5 btb 5 nov or rev 244 78 tr course debug drill this issue stresses the same points covered in i and 2 above and gave rise to false passes and quickying 6 hco pl 6 nov 71 iii internships lineup auditor internships this issue states that interns and auditors do daily trs and gave rise to the false idea that ones trs could go out overnight and youd have to get them in again the next morning once an auditors trs are in they are in the way to get your trs in is to do the trs course this doesnt mean that you cant do trs again it is usual to check an auditors trs in cramming and handle any outnesses but once trs have been done fully and honestly they are in and they stay in from there on out 7 hcob 7 apr bra rev 222 79 gradients in trs the earlier system the one i originally used was successful the trouble was that others added in the idea it takes hundred hours and actually thought it would take them months to get through trs course and were sticking students in on one tr 418cycling through the trs remedies that but one must ask what it is remedying its remedying bunch of knuckleheadedness and invalidation in the first place cycling through the trs has been given new definition and action the student goes up through the trs until he or she sticks and then starts back at the beginning of the trs it is technical fact that when one cannot do lower level tr one is not likely to do an upper level tr get the student through the trs the hard way each one to pass one at time if the student hangs up or fails on later tr start him or her from the beginning of the trs again 8 hcob 8 dec 74 tr 0notes on blinking this issue has been misinterpreted by some who figured that because the coach doesnt flunk the student for blink that it was then ok for the student to blink excessively in distracting manner this issue also points out that the person is thetan and not body but that doesnt mean that it is ok for the student to writhe nervously in the chair and call that tr 0 the coach does not flunk person because he blinked nor does he flunk the person because he breathed but theres big difference between someone who cant confront who blinks excessively and squirms around nervously and an auditor who can comfortably be there without flinching or being distractive in any way to the preclear which would be an auditor code break good auditor is never distractive to pc and person who can confront doesnt have excessive body motion of any kind he can be there comfortably confronting blinkless tr 0 needs to be defined it means that when persons tr 0 is in he doesnt exhibit any manifestation of inability to confront including blinking nervously flinchingly or doing anything else that shows nonconfront automatic body functions dont have anything to do with trs and are not taken up by the coach or supervisor nor do you do patacake trs and you never pass someone who makes reactive body motions get the student able to confront any good auditor or scientologist takes this ability for granted totally blinkless wide open staringeyed tr 0 and tr 0 bullbait are not re quirement for pass but any truly competent auditor can do it 9 btb 8 mar 75 iv cramming series 5rb trs in

how difficult they are to do were entered into the original tech the tech then got dropped out of use and permissive trs crept in and then the trs course the hard way got dropped out of the training of an auditor theres such thing as an auditor who cant do trs excellent trs are the hallmark of good auditor scientologists are known for their trs but an auditor cant get results without trs and good

when you have cleared up the reads to fns and have an fn begin the exact cramming orders indicated you can mimeo small form on which to assess these and mark reads which will save time the form would

officer would assess on the form above and clip it to the work sheets previously misdone cramming misdone crammings and failure to fly the ruds in cramming will mess up staff members and undisclosed overts and withholds will prevent any gain not just in auditing but in word clearing or cramming or other qual corrective actions resistance to cramming protest of cramming or natter about cramming or other qual corrective actions are indicative of outruds especially overts and withholds against cramming or qual or on the subject on which the cramming order was written 421these symptoms of resistance or natter can also stem from having been crammed over outruds in the past or having been mishandled in cramming the way to handle someone who has been crammed over outruds in the past is to assess the following and fly each reading line to fn have you been crammed over an arc break _____ present time problem _____ withhold _____ an overt _____ any invalidation _____ any evaluation _____ if someone is nattery about cramming qual correction actions or qual use the assessment above on the subject of their complaint eg you could assess have you been word cleared over if the above does not resolve the matter fully use the cramming repair assess ment list hcob 2 jun 78r or other specific list such as the word clearing correc tion list wccl cramming officer qualifications because the cramming officer is required to do these actions he or she must get checked out on how to do them possibly reason why some did not fly the ruds despite hcob 15 oct 74 cramming over outruds is that the cramming officer did not know how to fly ruds and had not gotten himself trained to do so then either didnt fly ruds before he attempted to do the cramming order or did not do the cramming order at all because the ruds were out both of these errors show an effect attitude that real cramming officer or scientologist for that matter would be guilty of cramming officers get tech in and being applied staff members successful and winning on their post and are therefore very causative cramming officer must get checked out on flying ruds and overts as these are vital tech of the cramming hat if classed auditor he must get checked out on use of correc tion lists such as the cramming repair assessment list wccl etc failure to check out on and use the tech of the post is an ethics matter worksheets the worksheets wses of all such actions ie ruds word clearing crammings cramming repair lists product debug assessments and any other qual corrective action are put in the pc folder and sent to the case supervisor cs the cs will correct any outtech or failure to fully handle and in the case of fn at exams or other outtech red tags the folder until the matter is fully repaired these worksheets must be complete accurate and legible in the case of non fn exam or other bad indicator these have rush priority and must be handled fast all the rules regarding worksheets apply to cramming and any other qual corrective actions is cs needed before flying ruds in cramming someone may wonder if he needs to get cs to fly the ruds before doing so in cramming action the answer is you do not need to get the pcs folder to the cs 422before you fly the ruds in cramming to do so would make an unnecessary delay and you dont need cs to fly somebodys ruds the cs case supervisor instruction is contained in this issue and that is what you do folder check before cramming sometimes staff member has been known to have been started on and left incomplete on several different actions eg the staff member is started on cramming order but before this is complete someone starts doing crashing misunderstood handling on him they end for lunch and after lunch someone tries to start yet another action on the staff member this is serious situation indeed and it could be enough to spin somebody so it is mandatory that before starting an action you must check the folder first cramming orders and flying ruds in cramming and other qual corrective actions do not require cs ok before doing them as this would put an unnecessary and arbitrary delay on the line and could be used as an excuse not to do the action eg i couldnt fly his ruds because i didnt have cs to fly the ruds so i didnt do anything but since one would not start new cycle in the middle of another incomplete cycle and would not try to fly ruds or word clear over mutant or outlists provided these really were out and not just false or protest read the folder must be checked by the person who is going to do the action this only takes minute to do before starting cramming or other qual corrective action look in the folder to ensure the person isnt in the middle of another qual corrective action or csed to get flubbed action repaired after the cramming or other qual corrective action send the folder to the case supervisor with legible worksheets on what you did and the exam form fesing if person has been crammed or has had other qual corrective actions and has gotten worse or made improvement then get all qual corrective actions done on the person fesed by the case supervisor and program and cs to repair these and get that program done comm ev anyone who interrupts or crossorders or prevents such program from being done as that would be suppressive such program has the priority of repairing flubbed session and the folder is red tagged until handled use the tech there are several new qual corrective actions as well as all the earlier tools of cramming these produce spectacular results

posted or so posted to ensure that 1 staff courses are provided and running 2 staff courses are attended 3 what is course pl is in on all staff courses 4 staff courses must approach an ideal scene per hco pl 10 oct 78 courses their ideal scene this requires manning up the staff section accordingly and it requires getting the necessary study materials there an org that pleads not enough personnel to post an sso and staff study supervisor or funds for course materials is simply not going to expand because they wont have the trained hatted staff they need to expand with 426putting staff courses there it has been demonstrated time and again over the years that tightly scheduled tightly run wellsupervised courses fill up and turn into expanding courses this is as true of staff courses as it is of courses offered to the public sloppy staff scheduling enforcement of study schedules missing course materials lack of proper supervision are all contributory to staff not studying under these conditions staff members stay away in droves such conditions provide an excuse for the staff member who tries to avoid study anyway due to his misunderstoods and they make it difficult for the staff member who is honestly trying to get through his study tip there is valid excuse for any org not providing standard scientology study courses for its staff staff members are the most onpurpose scientologists around they need and deserve to study on standard scientology courses and by that is meant courses with what is course pl fully in so the order for the sso to put staff courses there means what is course pl put in in full force that requires trained staff course supervisor in there supervising during sched uled staff study periods and doing it by the book he has roll book and he calls the roll for each scheduled course period he targets his students he enforces twinning he ensures that misunderstoods are being picked up and handled he sees that checkouts get properly done he directs students with questions to the correct source reference and he ensures slow or bogged students are debugged and gotten moving using all the new and current debugging tech it requires that checksheets exist for staff courses with the bulletins policy letters tapes mimeo issues and reference books called for on the checksheet available in the staff course room it means that materials such as clay tape players routing forms bulletin boards student files stat graphs progress boards and other items required in standard course room are there for use and are used for large staff staff course admin will be needed and theres got to be space provided so staff courses can be put in ideally this would be in the staff section in qual not mixed in with public courses schedules are handled by working out three or four regular staff course periods day morning afternoon and evening each period would be 22 hours long which is the amount of time each staff member is entitled to daily staff member then gets assigned to the specific period which best fits with his particular post or post time he gets enrolled for that period and he does his study during that period on standard staff course day staff would ordinarily study on foundation hours and foundation staff would study during the day getting staff courses attended the final and essential part of course per what is course pl is students the sso is responsible for seeing to it that staff courses are attended onehalf this battle is won by putting complete standard snapandpop staff courses there such courses are inviting and students gravitate to them 427executive support the other half of the battle is won by the sso getting in firm liaison lines with execs and seniors for their support in maintaining regular staff study executives and seniors are also responsible for ensuring their juniors are studying and getting hatted and trained ref hco pl 15 sep 70r rev 25479 ethics important executive responsibility for training staff any executive worthy of the post will see to it that his staff are being enhanced that is actually one of the attributes of successful executive such person demon strates that he is aware of what it takes to expand that hes capable of that much planning and prediction and that hes aware of the consequences of trying to maintain any kind of production with untrained staff too often seniors dont make their juniors study the common plea will be pro duction demands or we need to get this job done now and staff can make up their study time later etc etc but later never comes this is simply an indication of outplanning outtargetting and the inability to get in routine organized actions such an exec is walking downhill road into deeper and deeper mire of cope hell never get out of cope with untrained unhatted staff his only hope is to get in proper planning of the work load with scheduled study time set up for each of his juniors and that schedule enforced and here the sso can be of real assistance to him people who dont study the real underlying reason for people not studying is always misunderstoods it will be found that executives and seniors who dont push study or dont demand their juniors study are very often bugged students themselves it will also be found that those areas where staff arent studying regularly are in most cases the bugged and nonproducing areas or areas that are having lot of difficulty these are actually both old known and proven facts that have been proven time and time again the sso must get the staff study sups to debug those bugged students executives and staff alike as behind every staff member or any student who does not study is solely misunderstood words it is not post problems or other excuses it will just be misunderstoods getting these cleaned up will get the student winning on course and working to get himself or herself to study daily areas and people that study are in turn organized upstat and productive sso authority with the sso given the responsibility and the job of getting staff hatted and trained he or she must also be given the authority to get that responsibility carried out and the job done therefore with this policy letter the sso is empowered to assign penalties and take ethics action on any executive or senior who does not regularly send his staff to the staff hatting course 428such actions would range from beginning warning or caution to ethics chits or the calling of an executive court of ethics on the offending exec or senior in the latter case any amends assigned as the result of such court would be done for the sso in the sso area or in the staff course section at the discretion of the sso in the case of continued omission or refusal to get or support actions to get his juniors hatted and trained the executive or senior is subject to committee of evidence on the charge of treasonable neglect ref hco pl 15 sep 70r rev 25479 ethics important executive responsibility for training staff in situations where it becomes necessary for the sso to issue chits or take other action per the above on any executive whether posted higher on the org board or not

carrying out the responsibilities of his post in any of the above justice actions initiated by the sso upstats would always be taken into account per the justice pls an additional factor to be considered however is that rising statistics do not continue rising for long in the face of neglected hatting and training even upstats are required to study and enforce study upstats is excuse to not study or for an exec to not push study some advice for ssos if i were an sso id grab this policy letter and run with it id get real gungho campaign going for staff hatting and training id get it all handled before it became any kind of ethics situation id call meeting of all the execs and div heads from the top down and get their support and solid agreement on getting staff courses in and maintained that would have to include some finance personnel as well as their support and assistance and knowhow will be needed when it comes to obtaining the materials needed to comply with what is course pl id make this policy letter as well as wiac pl well known to each and every one of them id do survey on staff and execs and from it work out the three or four best daily study times of 2t2 hours each id dispatch every senior individually and meet with him personally if needed to get each of his juniors assigned to specific study period and make sure from an org crew list that every single staff member was ac counted for schedulewise and that every single one of them was there at the assigned time studying id demand staff courses supervisor and get recruitment actions going recruit ment letters being written to beefup the staff section id make sure the supervisor ran tight snapandpop absolutely standard in tech onpolicy staff courses and id be in there checking routinely to make sure it was happening id take hard cold honest look at and inventory of training materials and id work out sound plan for getting the most needed items first and start accumulating the rest as fast as possible id have my pos in to the fp committee every week id promote training and hatting to the staff loud and clear in the org newspaper at musters and make sure they heard of staff course wins and successes at every opportunity id just push relentlessly until i had every point of what is course pl soundly in and if i were an executive in an org id back up an sso who did that 100 429before long staff courses would be humming along smoothly and routinely and getting even bigger and better attended with word of mouth promotion from satisfied staff members production will increase morale will shoot up stats will rise and with that staff pay will be higher and conditions improved the whole scene will be one of bustling expanding activity with staff enhanced theres little work to it its not accomplished haphazardly or by one person alone but it can be done im counting on ssos to get it done and im counting on the executives of every org to back up the sso in

sets the policy therefore it is policy not to assign an auditor whose grade and class is less than that of the pc this policy becomes even more important when handling assignments on preots because if the auditor were of lower case grade it would prevent the preot from communicating to the auditor and the auditor not being aware of or trained on the materials of the level of case of the preot would not be able to audit that preot and would risk disaster for the preot as well as himself as cramming officers fly ruds in cramming and as some of the cramming and qual corrective actions can get into

to defeat verbal tech trs have been under study and pilot for the past year as just about this time last year it became all too obvious through review of the videotaped trs of special corps of auditors as well as those from piloted trs courses that students seemed to have become incapable of mastering the trs this presented mystery as i have always been able to teach trs effectively in about weeks time give or take few days once the student has his basics in its done by simply getting the student to do it as trs are not think action nor subjective action theyre practical drills on the comm cycle theres nothing subjective about them trs are doingness but we suddenly had entire corps of student auditors unable to master these drills what had happened to the teaching of trs good many months were spent in isolating exactly what had gone wrong and it has now all been boiled down to very few factors 1 hard trs had been dropped out 2 doing the communication formula in clay had been omitted those were the two major points of change and when these two were omitted that was it that was the end of anybody being able to do trs one cant master trs without familiarity with the comm cycle one cant master trs with permissive pat acake drilling trs are gotten in by drilling them hard it is one thing to try to teach hard trs to raw public and it is quite another to make an auditor people studying to become auditors have to be made into auditors its all right to teach mild trs course in division 6 and one should but when it comes to making auditors there is substitute for hard trs 433somewhere along the line doing the communication formula in clay as the begin ning part of the trs course was dropped out this left the student with slightest concept of why he was doing trs the communication formula is scientology dis covery and when you omit teaching it the student suffers from outbasics so the omission of doing the communication formula in clay on trs course was fatal there were also three additional factors found to be further influencing the scene 3 student auditors had real understanding of the arc triangle thus their communication was stuck because their affinity and reality and therefore their understanding were deficient 4 the lack of bona fide trs checksheet had opened the way for all kinds of false data to be entered into the subject 5 ignorance of the end phenomena of trs course or why they were doing trs the result of this past years study and piloting and the isolation of these factors has now culminated in full and final trs course which will be issued very soon in unalterable book form meantime this bulletin is being issued as holding action to make these errors and omissions in the teaching and drilling of trs broadly known so that they can be remedied at once wherever auditor trs are being taught omitted checksheet and false data since the cancellation of hco pl 24 may 71 the professional tr course there has been real trs checksheet complete with the basics of com munication and the theory of communication which underlie the trs that was huge outbasic right there trs as drills appeared on various checksheets sometimes with several accompanying bulletins but omitted was any thorough preliminary insequence study of the theory upon which the trs are based here we had course without checksheet which made it possible for false data to spring in from various quarters and so it did it wasnt that people were willfully entering false data into the subject it was simply that there was standard checksheet which took the student through the true data and only the true data on the simple basics the arc triangle and the communication formula underlying the trs and then the trs drills themselves with that situation you can get all kinds of false data coming into an area and that is exactly what was found almost one for one the students coming onto the special piloted courses conducted this past year were ridden with false data various types of think and figurefigure and alteris of the tech of the trs number of btbs and bpls on the subject contributed to this scene and actually perpetrated outtech in the area and these have now been canceled by specific title by hcob 23 sep 79 cancellation of destructive btbs and bpls on trs which lists and corrects the outnesses these issues introduced further handling is to give the student the true data on communication and trs as covered in the chapters on arc in problems of work and fundamentals of thought the chapters on communication in dianetics 55 and hcob 16 aug 71r trs remodernized as he studies this one then digs up and strips off the false data accumulated on the subject or drill using hco pl 7 aug 79 false data stripping where false data on subject exists it hits immediately and directly up against the true data and until this conflict is blown by false data stripping the person can be untrainable on the subject 434thus this brand new tech tool false data stripping is and has been tremen dously useful in correcting tr outnesses and ensuring correct training on the trs it might be noted in passing that the most false subject on the planet at this time is psychology because the mission of psychologist is government oneto make the population into controllable zombiesthe subject is being taught earlier and earlier in schools and lot of your students and even supervisors have been subjected to this propaganda and false data about man and the mind i recall that the people it took longest to get through trs courses were professional psychologists the basis of this is false datathey are loaded with it it is not that psychology teaches anything about communication they never heard of the subject until we came along but that they simply have so many false data about life that they actually cant study or drill in life subject such as scientology and you may find it necessary to clean this up this prevents horrible slows on trs courses its not an action that would be done in the course of course but would be done in review the communication formula in clay the trs are drills on the various parts of the communication formula this basic datum seems to have become obscured in recent years it appeared that to many trs were considered to be drills that were done for the sake of doing drills with only some vague accompanying idea of their actual use or application or how they related to auditing and an auditing session the truth of the matter is that trs are simply the drills that enable person to polish and perfect his comm cycle but if one doesnt know what the cycle of communication is to begin with if one isnt totally familiar with the various parts of the communication formula the trs as drills are not going to make much sense to him drilling becomes struggle because he doesnt even know what it is hes trying to handle so one of the first things trs student needs is sound understanding of the communication formula the way to learn the communication formula is to do it in clay that defines it puts it there in the physical universe for him by demonstrating the communication formula all of its parts in clay he will actually see how it works it becomes real to him now he knows what it is hes drilling unfortunately with the cancellation of the 24 may 71 trs checksheet the basic action of demonstrating the communication formula in clay was dropped out and with that real understanding of the use of trs was obscured for many representing the comm formula in clay is now reinstated firmly as vital pre liminary step to drilling trs use of the arc triangle even below an understanding of the communication formula comes an under standing of the arc triangle now we are getting more basic this turned up as very interesting technical factor in reviewing countless tr video tapes this past year it was actually very interesting technical bug i studied and studied these flunked video tr sessions to find the common denominator of all of them and i finally nailed it what i found was that they were specializing in c communication on the arc triangle they were specializing in c but what was out was their affinity and r reality and their c was being peggedit would go up just so farbecause they werent anywhere up the line on their and r 435as result they couldnt understand anything the other guy was saying most of the flubs were on this basis they didnt have any pc there they werent listening to what the pc said the arc was out the bottom the person gets stuck without full use of the arc triangle you can raise the communication level but then you have to raise the reality and then you have to raise the affinity and then you get some understanding only then can you continue to improve each point of the triangle on most of those videos they were stuck with the communication being raised just bit and that was that because they werent raising the affinity and reality levels along with it so they did not advance or improve handling is to make sure the student gets very sound understanding of the arc triangle and its use before he tackles the trs this can be accomplished by having him represent it in clay using the chapters on arc in fundamentals of thought and problems of work and chapter vii of dianetics 55 when he knows how and r and c interrelate and how theyre used to bring about understanding hes then prepared to really grasp the communication formula and when he has good familiarity with the communication formula he can drill the trs and polish up his own communication cycle and improve with comparative ease trs the hard way when trs the hard way slipped out of use and permissive trs entered the pic ture the results were less competent auditors and less case gain for pcs auditor trs must be taught rough tough and hard this does not mean invali dative drilling or coaching or supervision it does mean you get the student to do the trs hes got to drill the trs not figurefigure on them or dive into his case to avoid them trs the hard way means stringent spoton coaching and supervision on the proper gradient each button found on the student is flattened before it is left flunks are given when the student flunks and when he flunks he goes right back in again and he drills it until hes got it the trs are taught and drilled per the 16 aug 71r bulletin training drills remodernized and per the advices in hcob 23 sep 79 cancellation of destructive btbs and bpls on trs the student is coached to wins not losses you make sure he understands the drill and after that its matter of his doing it its matter of keeping him at it getting him through it regardless of what buttons crop up to be flattened until hes mastered each tr and can handle any comm cycle with ease permissive nambypamby patacake trs have place in the training of an auditor or on bona fide trs course student who hasnt mastered his trs wont master any of the training that follows them the way to master trs is to drill them the hard way it is hard trs that make an auditor more gradient approach to trs would be taken on the has course where the new scientologist is getting his first taste of how to handle communication in his everyday life and livingness given sound training on the basics arcu and the formula of communication with any false data stripped off and the student then drilled on trs the hard way to perfection youll find he comes through with flying colors to smooth flubless comm cycle and it doesnt take year or even months to accomplish it 436end phenomenon of trs as the students really had idea of the communication formula as such due to the omission of the requirement that they do it in clay and learn it they of course didnt know where they were going surprising number of students were heard making stupid remarks like i would never use the trs in auditing which is about the same as saying i would never use food when i eat practically students on trs courses had any idea why they were doing trs or what had to be achieved in order to be finished product on trs course this unfortunately included the supervisors and of course the coaches so one got all sorts of silly invalidative evaluative teaching and coaching if they didnt know where they were going and what the end phenomenon of trs course was of course they couldnt train student toward it and so trs courses which would only involve week or two turned into months and months of floundering around due to miscoaching and mainly destructive criticism which had purpose instruction and coaching are not based on opinion they should be based on producing the end phenomenon the primary valuable final product of trs is professional auditor who with comm handling alone can keep pc interested in his own case and willing to talk to the auditor the secondary valuable final product of trs is person with the session and social presence of professional auditor and that presence can be summed up as being who can handle anyone with communication alone and whose communication can stand up faultlessly to any session or social situation matter how rough the end phenomenon of trs is being who knows he can achieve both of the above flawlessly and from here on out thats the ep and thats the direction all instruction and coaching must take each tr must be in against the standard above as we know the communication formula and as the trs are parts of it the end phenomenon can be achieved relatively rapidly it is that we know for the first time in mans history the communication formula that makes it possible to drill people on it and produce the above end phenomenon this was major point that was being missedthat one was trying to produce something if you dont know what youre trying to produce it can take forever cant it prerequisite there is one factor that would effectively block smooth run through this train ing basics or basics youre not going to get person who has been loaded up with drugs to grasp this data and come out the other end as any kind of product until hes had his drugs handled you now have the purification rundown to handle that along with objectives and the drug rundown with this fantastic new rundown which is an undercut to all training and processing we have the means to make even the seemingly untrainable trainable 437summary i wanted to let you know what has been happening in regard to trs study and training over the past year and what bugs have now been uncovered each of the points taken up in this bulletin have now been solved you will have very complete professional trs course released in book form in the near future meantime the materials exist and are available on which to train students in trs and do so very effectively therefore this issue is your license to include on any current checksheet which calls for auditor trs the materials and actions covered herein the data is being given you for your immediate use so ill expect to see you turning out crops of auditors with flawless trs it can be accomplished by getting in the five points covered in this bulletin alone l ron hubbard founder lrhdr copyright 1979 by l ron hubbard all rights reserved 438hubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 30 december 1979 remimeo how to build sauna refshcob 6 feb 78ra the purification rundown rev 41279 replaces the sweat program hcob 6 feb 78ra1 he purification rundown addition of 201279 errata and additions anyone building sauna should be warned that it has to be properly built so as not to cause injury or casualty to persons using it the purification rundown is not only the initial necessary preliminary undercut to the majority of cases planetwide but orgs will find it in great popular demand in the immediate future as news of its remarkable results have already spread rapidly through wordofmouth every org must be able to deliver the purification rundown in order to deliver the rundown an org will need the use of sauna and in order to deliver it most efficiently an org would have its own sauna the major part of the 5hour daily period on the purification rundown is spent in the sauna bath after working up the circulation by period of running thus if the sauna bath is situated right on the org premises or adjoining or very close to the org premises and operated under the orgs jurisdiction it will not only be more convenient and more workable but more economical as well this issue is written to provide the basic data on how an org can equip itself to deliver the rundown most ideallyvia its own sauna bath sauna definition of the word sauna is finnish word which describes the finnish custom of bathing or deep cleansing by intense heat which induces perspiration technically the term sauna bath refers to specially constructed wooden room properly insulated and heated to temperatures of between 140 and 200f or approx imately 71 to 93c to induce profuse sweating it is equipped with wooden benches at different height levels on which the bathers sit or recline as heat rises the air is hotter around the higher benches and somewhat cooler around the lower benches so one can take his choice depending upon his heat tolerance the sauna room is also necessarily equipped with its own heat source building sauna in building sauna the two main factors to be taken into consideration are location of the sauna room and b the type of heat source to be used 439the choice of location of the room can depend upon what type of heat is available and most economical and the location of the main source of heat with these two factors determined one can then get into the other aspects of sauna installation which include size of the room foundation and flooring wiring walls ventilation insulation exterior finishes safety measures and any accessories needed cost analysis before undertaking the building of sauna all of the following data will need to be taken into consideration and cost analysis must be done based on building codes and local prices and accessibility of materials and equipment in other words cost analysis and planning is done first so that all the aspects of an effective operational sauna are considered and provided for in advance properly targetted construction program can then be carried out rapidly in the pac area very workable sauna was constructed for approximately 1600 1200 of which was for construction and construction materials 400 of which was for sauna unit heaters with good planning it is possible for any org to equip itself with standard sauna room vital to the delivery of the purification rundown its construction and maintenance should then more than pay for itself as the rundown is sold and delivered building codes and permits it will be necessary to check with your building department to determine what permits are needed for sauna installation and what the local building codes require in the way of structural design and construction materials most building codes in the united states set standards similar to or based on those of the uniform building code and the national electric code for foundations framing and wiring zoning laws may enter into it however as you will not be in the business of operating commercial sauna and as many home owners and even business executives now install their own private home or office saunas there should be difficulty in obtaining the necessary permit for installation building codes and building permit requirements must be complied with for both safety and legal reasons it would be foolish for an org to endanger its tenancy of building by any infraction of such regulations location of the sauna sauna room can be built inside another room in other words one could use fairly small room for this purpose by insulating and paneling it properly or one could partition off part of large room with proper wall construction insulation and interior finishing an ideal selection for sauna would be room with drain in the floor or one where drain could be easily installed it should be located near shower which may also need to be installed as cooling showers may be necessary for large majority of people during the hours of sweat out in any case nearby source of running water is must as sweaters should drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration and this must be easily available it is also needed for convenience in taking salt or potassium gluconate tablets and vitamins ideally two showers and two locker rooms one each for men and women would be located conveniently near the sauna depending upon the type of heat to be used it may be advantageous to select room fairly close to the heat source to prevent the necessity for extensive additional wiring or piping for example if steam heat is used the closer the room is to the steam furnace or boiler the better as steam pipes all well and properly insulated would need to be run from the heat source to the sauna steam heaters the more such piping is 440needed the greater the cost naturally and there is also the additional factor of it taking longer to get the steam actually coming through to the sauna heaters choosing room with the least outside wall or window surface is also desirable this is due to the fact that the more outside wall surface there is involved the more insulation and heat is required to maintain proper sauna room temperatures it may be necessary to select the sauna room according to local building code and permit regulations where an org simply does not have the space for building sauna right on the org premises it may be necessary to rent or purchase additional space in nearby or adjoining building for the installation of its sauna size of sauna room sauna room must not be too large for the sake of economy too large room is too expensive and too difficult to heat an org however will want sauna room that can accommodate between 10 and 15 people at once as the traffic will require it some suggested sizes are 12 x 10 x 7 feet 14 x 14 x 7 feet or 12 x 16 x 9 feet the height of the room is never more than 9 feet and most often 7 feet is best as high ceiling simply results in loss of heat because heat rises thus low ceiling prevents the heat from rising into space where it wont be used the size of the room should be determined by the number of people you expect to be using it at any one time it is usual to allow 65 cubic feet of space for each person rectangular or squareshaped room provides the optimum shape space for arrangement of the tiered benches it should be kept in mind that the size and power of the sauna stove required to heat the room will depend directly upon the size of the room sources of heat by far the biggest single factor to be taken into consideration in installing sauna is the source of heat to be used the types of sauna stoves available are 1 gas 2 electric 3 wood burning which would not be practical for an org and 4 steam heaters can also be used where the org has yearround supply of steam such as would be routinely supplied for dishwashers laundry or hot water heating otherwise where steam is used only for central heating of the building it would be far too expensive to run steam boiler in the summer for sauna use only additionally there would be heat loss even with shutoffs to different areas in large building however where steam is required all the time for other purposes steam would probably be the most economical or it might be practical to purchase small steam generator for sauna heating purposes only the choice of the type of heater to be used should be determined by the most economical heat available to the org cost comparisons should be made locally to determine installation costs and operating costs of different heating systems 441electric stoves electric sauna stoves are by far the easiest to install and the cleanest they are efficient but they may not be the most economical to operate depending upon the cost of electricity in the area with an electric stove you will need at least 220 volt supply of electrical power to the sauna this is the same voltage that operates kitchen stove or clothes dryer but it must be determined that the existing power supply in the org can safely support the additional power required for the sauna heater if not you may need to install an additional power supply the size of the stove is importantit must be the correct size powerwise to produce the required sauna temperatures the size will depend upon the size of the room and the location of the room less power for example would be required for small room or room with outside wall exposure the power of an electric stove is measured by the number of kilowatts needed to heat the stove elements one kilowatt kw 1000 watts prefabricated electric sauna stoves come anywhere from 22 kilowatts to 18 kilowatts in power to compute the size electric stove needed allow i kilowatt for every 45 cubic feet of room space find the number of cubic feet of room space by multiplying the length by the width by the height of the room this gives you the total cubic feet or volume of the room divide the volume by 45 to get the number of kilowatts needed to heat that room example the volume of 12 x 10 x 7 foot room 840 cubic feet 840 1844 kilowatts 45 1844 kilowatts is the power required to heat 12 x 10 x 7 foot room to proper sauna temperatures the above is the formula that would be used in temperate climates in colder climate stronger stove would probably be required prefabricated electric sauna stoves have control unit that is always installed outside the sauna room as the controls are not built to withstand high temperatures these stoves usually also include safety device that cuts off the electrical current should there be malfunction of any kind gas stoves the power of gas stove is measured by the number of british ther mal units btus of heat the stove generates british thermal unit is the amount of heat necessary to raise i pound of water i degree fahrenheit gas heaters are graded according to the number of btus they provide in one hour to compute the size gas stove required allow 1000 btus for every 15 cubic feet of sauna room volume example the volume of 12 x 10 x 7 foot room 840 cubic feet 840 cubic feet divided by 15 cubic feet 81450 56 multiply 56 x 1000 btus 56000 btus needed from gas heater to heat 12 x 10 x 7 foot sauna room gas heaters usually cost less to operate than electric heaters they are bit more complicated but not necessarily more expensive to install the heater would need to be connected to the buildings gas supply line by approved gas piping standard 442approved galvanized steel pipe with threaded ends and standard galvanized steel fittings for any bends elbows in the pipe with approved thread sealout would be required such piping would need to be done professionally possibly contracted or inspected professionally when completed old gas heaters however wellrenovated they might be are not permitted for this purpose modern gas heaters for sauna use are built with special safety shutoff valves and safety pilot flame designed to cut the gas supply off should the pilot light go out if an org is to use gas heat in the sauna onv modern gas heater with these safety features is permissible for org installation with modern gas heater the gas is piped in to small burner in sealed combustion chamber in the stove air is drawn into the chamber from outside the sauna and expelled through the flue gas heaters especially require an adequate air supply and suitable venting soap bubble test for leaks in gas lines the following test can be done to detect leaks in gas pipe line particularly at the elbow joints or any place where two pieces of pipe are spliced together with threaded ends mix i part liquid detergent with 4 parts water in cup or can pressurize the line by opening the gas line valve with soft brush mix up the soap solution and daub it well around any joints of pipe if there is the slightest leak it will show up in big soap bubbles if any such leaks are found the pipe connections would need to be redone and then thoroughly reinspected both gas and electric prefabricated sauna stoves are metalencased usually with two or even three layers of noncorrosive metal with air between them the outermost layer of metal which is usually of stainless steel or baked enamel prevents the surface from becoming too hot and inhibits the loss of heat from the front and sides of the stove both the gas and electric type stoves are thermostatically controlled sauna stones prefabricated sauna stoves are designed with metal tray at the top to hold and heat pile of stones or rocks called konno rocks konno rocks technically known as peridotite maim are quarried in finland they are ideal for the sauna as they store heat well help to distribute soft heat evenly throughout the sauna room and help to maintain the required sauna temperature another virtue of these stones is that they can withstand high temperatures and do not crack or explode when subjected to high heat pressure to allow for good air circulation the stones should be loosely packed in the tray if one wishes to add steam to the sauna longhandled ladle is used to pour water on the hot stones resulting in bursts of steam which fill the sauna room supply of konno rocks or stones is usually included with the purchase of pre fabricated sauna stove the stones will usually last through five years of routine use they may also be purchased separately commercially wood burning stoves although the wood burning stove is in the best finnish sauna tradition it is highly impractical for org use it takes good quantity of wood to heat sauna adequately and routine stoking would be required as well as convenient storage space for the wood supply further the cost of wood as fuel can be high and there is wide variance in the heatproducing qualities of different woods it takes considerable time to heat sauna room to the required temperature with wood burning stove and the ashes from wood fire must be removed periodically for all of the above reasons wood burning sauna stove is not recommended 443steam heaters where steam is available the year round steam unit heaters can be used as was done in the sauna built in pac and this is probably the most economical method of heating the sauna unit heater is combination heater and fan so arranged that the fan blows air through the heater thus speeding the transfer of heat from the heater to the room air steam unit heaters are rated according to the number of btus they will produce when supplied with 60 degree f entering air and 2 pounds per square inch steam pressure as entering air becomes hotter the heater puts out fewer btus but by increasing the steam pressure to the unit heater you can increase the amount of btus it puts out check the steam capacity of the unit which is probably 150 pounds per square inch by adjusting the pressure reduction valve and so admitting more or less steam pressure to the unit heater you can raise or lower the temperature of the sauna safety valve is used to protect the unit heater in the event that the pressure reduction valve should fail though this is quite unusual one should insist on clear instructions on how to mount any safety valve that is purchased actually the unit heater can be heated by electricity gas steam or hot water an electric unit heater is the easiest to install depending upon the existing voltage supply as described earlier but an electric heater will use around 13 of watt to put out one btu per hour to heat room 14 x 14 x 9 feet high this would require upwards of 18000 watts per hour which depending upon the geographical location can be quite an expensive operation hot water heaters require high water temperatures around 180 degrees f mini mum gas or oil heaters depending upon local availability of fuel can be fairly inexpensive to purchase and use but they require sufficient air supply and the proper venting to be safe remember that any combustion including electrical com bustion consumes oxygen and as oxygen diminishes it will give off carbon monoxide which is quite deadly poison perhaps your best bet from the standpoint of safety and economy would be small steam generator external to the sauna and well vented providing steam to unit heater in the sauna specifications for steam fittings if steam is used the following specifi cations might be used as guide in the selection of steam fittings for steam piping maximum pressure 150 pounds per square inch

the foregoing should be considered guide only as installation instruc tions for your heating system should be available from the manufacturer the unit heaters described above whether heated by steam gas electricity or hot water provide dry heat sauna of less sophisticated type than the specially designed prefabricated gas or electric sauna stoves you will need to check the various systems and costs with your local dealer to determine the most suitable sauna heater for your area construction of the sauna foundation and flooring the floor of the room you are converting into sauna serves as the foundation if its concrete floor all you would then need to do would be to add wooden slats in duckboard construction duckboards are easy to remove for cleaning pur poses or you could cover the floor with ceramic tile if the original floor is wood the handling would be to install wood frame made of 2 by 4 sleepers add some good thermal insulating material not fiberglass and put down subfloor of plywood over that the plywood floor could then be covered with ceramic tile or seamless sheet vinyl for waterproofing only waterproof adhesives would be used ideally the floor would be slightly sloped toward drain as it will need to be scrubbed down routinely to be kept clean framing the first walls put up can be sheets of sheet rock the room is then framed with 2 x 4 studs spaced to permit insertion of 3inch thick insulation batts the studs are nailed to the wooden 2 x 4 sleepers below the subfloor if the floor is concrete they are attached with anchor bolts or concrete nails the studs may be 16 or 24 inches apart according to building codes the ceiling lowered to 7 or 9 feet is constructed exactly as the walls are with the rafters spaced for insertion of insulation batts note at this point although the wall construction is not yet complete any needed holes for conduits for electricity or other heat should be drilled in the sheet rock and studs insulation good insulation is important in sauna asit helps retain the heat and keeps the cost of heating down the best insulation is expanded polyurethene the insulation batts 3 inches thick come in strips with flanges which can be stapled do not use glue to the framing studs the 3inch thick part of the insulation batt is inserted between the studs finishing of the walls with the insulation installed vapor barrier of struction plastic is then nailed or stapled to the studs the vapor barrier prevents moisture from collecting inside the walls the same insulation and vapor barrier is also installed in the ceiling walls and ceiling are then covered with onehalf inch gypsum board for the final covering walls and ceiling are paneled with saw textured linch by 6inch wood paneling with the smooth face exposed inside the sauna kilndried redwood is commonly used for such paneling where it is easily available this and cedar are especially popular because of their high insulation factor they make the sauna easier to heat and remain cooler to the touch other lowdensity softwoods which 445resist heat can also be used such as white pine sugar pine ponderosa pine spruce and hemlock care should be taken to select finished verticalgrain woods as free of knotholes and resin pockets as possible any knotholes or resin pockets must be placed near the floor never on the ceiling or high on the walls as the melting resin could drip and burn the bathers any nails or staples used in the construction should be of rustresistant hot dipped galvanized finish ventilation the sauna needs to be properly ventilated to provide enough oxygen free flow of air and an escape for the bad air while still retaining the room heat poor ventilation in the sauna can cause dizziness or even asphyxiation building requirements usually call for vent area of 120 the floor area but not less than 1 12 square feet but this must be checked with your building department the intake vent is located near the floor and can be approximately 12inch slit under the door the outlet vent would be on the opposite wall near the ceiling and could be vent of about 4 inches in diameter with this arrangement the good air is pulled in low in the room and can circulate while the bad air leaves through the vent near the ceiling it is good idea to provide slide cover for the outlet vent so it can be adjusted to control the amount of air leaving the room wiring any wiring to be done will have to meet very strict electrical standards for complete safety the installation of wiring and electrical circuits to handle an electric stove should your sauna have one control panel thermostat and lighting for the room will probably be required to be done professionally in sauna wiring must be used that can hold up under 200 degree f or higher temperatures and also withstand moisture also the wiring must be located in the dry areas behind the insulation all switches and controls are installed outside the sauna as these do not withstand high heat sauna door the recommended door is solidcore philippine mahogany slab door this is not true mahogany and should not be too costly it should be solidly mounted with 4 hinges and not too tight in the frame as it will expand slightly or shrink with changes in temperature when solid core door is used you would also add frame insulation and paneling to it caution sauna doors should always open out and must never be fitted with any type of latch that could get caught or stuck and lock you in ball or roller catches are probably best for this purpose there is never an outside lock installed on the door wooden handles must be used on the door never metal as it becomes too hot to touch one should avoid using any metal frames or hardware in the sauna wherever possible for the same reason any metal fasteners or lighting fixtures which must be used should be noncorrosive and placed well away from where bathers could touch or brush against them accidentally as they could cause burns sauna benches the sauna benches are preferably made of redwood 2 x 2 and 2 x 4 as other materials can leak hot pitch or give off toxic fumes when heated bench sizes vary but the best approximate size is about 15 34 inches wide 32 inches high with an 8 inch step benches are installed in tiers at various levels in the room the lower benches should be bit wider than the upper ones to provide room for peoples feet 446benches can be located on three sides of the room but would never be placed against the wall where the stove is located additional safety measures whatever the choice of sauna stove it must be mounted according to building department regulations whatever distance from the wall is required and with whatever type wall insulation behind it that is required wooden railing is placed around the front and sides of the stove for bathers protection accessories you will need thermometer that reads at least up to 200 degrees fahrenheit and you will probably want to install clock in the sauna these acces sories should be of the type that are manufactured for sauna use curing the sauna curing the sauna means preparing it for its first use when your sauna is complete sweep down and vacuum all walls ceilings floor benches corners next wipe all walls ceiling benches fixtures stove accessories etc with damp cloth and warm water with the sauna door propped open turn the heater on for about half an hour the stove may smoke bit if it is burning off its protective coating finally close the sauna door bring the room temperature up to 200 degrees f for about 5 or 6 hours your sauna will then be ready for use hygiene the sauna must be scrubbed down routinely to keep it sanitary and free from perspiration odors any duckboards on the floor should be removed and scrubbed and then replaced it is also good idea to routinely fully ventilate the room particu larly after heavy use so wood surfaces can be given chance to dry how to take sauna before going into the sauna all jewelry wristwatches eye glasses or contact lenses should be removed as these could become uncomfortably hot or be damaged by the heat it is best to shower briefly with warm water just before going into the sauna and after the running period which has brought up the circulation the period of sweat out in the sauna would then be followed by another cleansing shower in an org sauna used by all swim wear not too tightfitting or loose shorts and tank top for women would be worn ideally an org would have two saunas for its public one for men and one for women the same dress could be worn in this case if preferred or the bather could simply sauna in large towel complete prefabricated saunas are available on the market and possibly these should be priced but an org in any area will probably find it more economical to build its own with careful planning and costing economical use of materials but without stint ing on safety measures very workable pleasant sauna can be built for the orgs use in delivering the purification rundown as saunas are becoming more popular by the day there are numerous reference books or magazines which can be found in the library or on newsstands which would give you further data on saunas two of these are how to build sauna by carlton hollander drake publication of ster ling publishing co inc new york hot tubs spas home saunas by
