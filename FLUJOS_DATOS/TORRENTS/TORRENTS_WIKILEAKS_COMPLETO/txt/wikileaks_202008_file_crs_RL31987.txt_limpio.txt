sets an income standard and allows certain individuals whose income exceeds that standard to spend down to 1 for additional information on dual eligibles see crs report rl30813 federal and state initiatives to integrate acute and longterm care issues and profiles by edward alan miller 2 the data used in this report provided by cms does not differentiate between medicaid service expenditures and expenditures for medicare copayments and deductibles 3 though most over 98 of dual eligibles qualify for medicaid as elderly or having blindness or disability about 16 are children and adults who qualify under other eligibility pathways 4 many medicaid beneficiaries with disabilities do not qualify for medicare because they do not have sufficient work history in which they paid medicare taxes
