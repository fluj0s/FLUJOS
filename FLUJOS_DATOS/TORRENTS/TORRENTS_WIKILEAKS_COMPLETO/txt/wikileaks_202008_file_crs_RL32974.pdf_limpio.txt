common aquaculture hybrid is the sunshine bass the re sult of the fertilization of white bass eggs with striped bass sperm 2for list of genetically engineered organisms under research see table 22 in national continuedgenetically engineered fish and seafood through selective breeding farmers and sc ientists have history of modifying animals to maximize desirable traits in the broadest sense genetic modification refers to changes in an organisms gene tic makeup not occurring in nature including the production of c onventional hybrids1 with the advent of modern biotechnology eg genetic engineering or bioengineering it is now possible to take the gene or genes for specific protein either from the same species or from an entirely different one and transfer it to create an organism ex pressing novel trait or trait outside the normal range of variation for the species this technique can add both speed and efficiency to the development of new f oods and products genetically engineered plant varieties such as he rbicideresistant corn and soybeans have already been widely adopted by us farmers and ge netically engineered fish or seafood may similarly be adopted by the aquaculture industry background potential issues include the impacts of genetically modified gm fish and seafood on the environment and food safe ty and whether gm foods should be specially labeled underlying these issues is the question of whether us regulation and oversight of biotechnology with re sponsibilities spread primarily among the us department of agriculture usda the food and drug administration fda and the environmental protection agency epa remain appr opriate pa rticularly as newer applications emerge that did not exist when the current regulatory regime was established for

species to introduce or amplify economically valuable traits fish are of particular interest to researchers since many fish produce large quantities of eggs those eggs being external to the animal as opposed to mammals that produce fewer eggs internally make it relatively simple to insert novel dna research on gm strains is currently under development for at least 35 species of fish worldwide as well as for vari ety of mollusks crustaceans plants and marine microorganisms for various purposes fish are being modified to increase food for human consumption to produ ce pharmaceuticals to test

scientists and nvironmental groups21 national research council repor t states that transgenic fish pose the greatest sciencebased concerns associ ated with animal biotechnology in large part due to the uncertainty inherent in identifying environmental problems early on and the difficulty of remediation once probl em has been identified22 critics and scientists predict that gm fish could breed with wild popul ations of the same species and potentially spread undesirable genes in addition they argue that transgenic fish especially organisms that have been modified so as to enable them to withstand wider ranges of salinity or temperature could be more difficult or impossible to eradicate similar to an invasive species escaped transgen ic fish could harm wild fish through increased competition or predation critic s maintain that an indication of this potential problem may be noted where non gm salmon from nearshore net pens in the northwest united states23 british columbia24

in genetic conservation of salmonid fishes by j g cloud and g h thorgaard eds new york ny plenum press 1993 pp 93112however it is not known whether gm fish could survive in the wild in sufficient numbers to inflict permanent popul ation damage one study indicated that when food supplies were low gm fish might have the ability to harm wild population although the authors caution that laboratory experiments may not reflect what would happen in the wild26 biotechnology proponents argue that gm fish would be unlikely to survive in the wild since they would likely be less adept at avoiding predators predictive model popularly termed the trojan gene model was put forward after observing that gm japane medaka fish commonly used as an experimental model were able to outc ompete nonaltered fish for mates the resulting offspring were less fit resulting in the eventual demise of the modified population27 even if fastgrowing gm fish do not spread their genes among their wild counterparts critics f ear they might disrupt the ecology by competing with native fish for scarce resources the consequences of such competition would depend on many factors including the si ze of the wild population the number and specific genetic strain of the escaped fish and local environmental conditions other potential safeguards also exist for example fda coul d require that only sterile gm fish be approved fo r culture in ocean pens fertilized fish eggs that are subjected to heat or pressure shock re tain an extra set of chromosomes the resulting triploid fish do not produce normal eggs or sperm and females do not exhibit maturation of the ova ry or reproductive behaviors28 thus allfemale lines of triploid fish are the best current thod to ensure nonbreeding populations of gm fish nonetheless there are batchtobatch variations in the efficacy of triploidy induction and it is uncertain whether this method could be effective for all species of fish it has not been successful for shrimp29 also critics question whether escaped male triploid fish which in some species have sufficient sex hormone levels to enable normal courtship behavior could ma with wild individuals lowering reproductive success of the wild population30 the ecological risks of stocking gm shellfish in the wild have not yet been thoroughly considered but confinement ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32974crs6 31many shellfish such as oysters broadcast th eir eggs and sperm into the water column and have larvae that have planktonic or swimming form making them very difficult to contain in an open water pen

more difficult than confinement of fish due to their methods of repr oduction and dispersal31 other sterilization methods are currently under study and it is likely that research in this area will increase options for containment critics of gm fish speculate that the risks to native fish populations however small ma outweigh the potential bene fits of this technology especially where native fish populations are already threatened or endangered to be most effective in reducing ecolo gical risk the national research council report on the bioconfinement of genetically engineered organisms recommends that each individual organism have its own bioconfinement32 plan guidelines for designing and implementing confinement of gm aquatic species have been developed by us partment of agriculture sanctioned working group33 also since single method is likely to be 100 certain bioconf inement redundancy is crucial especially if it will not be combined with physical confinement growing gm fish in isolated onshore tanks rather than in offshore or nearshore pens may minimize the risk of escape into the wild international developments many countries and intern ational institutions have promulgated policies for oversight of gm organisms including aquatic species34 notably canada where development of gm salmon is progressing has regulations that are more prescriptive and restrictive than those in the united states nations that are party to the united nations convention on environm ent and development adhere to the cartegena protocol regarding international transfer of gm organisms each such nation has designated an oversight authority and permitting process cuba is such nation it has regulations and seems poised to approve co mmercial production of transgenic tilapia cuba like much of the world seems to be waiting to see whether the united states will approve commercialization of the gm salmon this decision may prove to be tipping point in co mmercialization of gm fish and gm farm animals more generally lternatively should chile major producer of atlantic salmon approve producti on of gm salmon this could provide the tipping point the

engineered fish camp aign at http wwwpertaining to gm aquatic organisms s important bearing on how technical and policy issues may be resolved possible benefits nd disadvantages of gm fish and seafood biotechnology proponents maintain th at genetic modification has many advantages over traditional breeding methods including faster and more specific improvement of beneficial traits because scientists are able to directly manipulate the traits they wish to create or amplify the desired change can be achieved in very few generations frequently ma king it faster and cheaper than traditional methods which may require many gene rations of selective breeding genetic modification allows scientists to precise ly select traits for alteration enabling them to create an organism that for example grows larger or faster or has different nutritional content proponents claim that fastergrowing fish could make fish farming more productive increasing yields while reduci ng the amount of feed needed which in turn could reduce waste shellfish and finfish genetically modified to enhance disease resistance could reduce the use of antibiotics increased freeze resistance in fish could lead to the ability to grow freezeresistant species in previously inhospitable environments allowing aquacultu re to expand into previously unsuitable areas research efforts are also under way to address selected human health concerns such as genetically modifyin g fish to produce human drugs like blood clotting factor and creating shellfish th at will not provoke llergic reactions biotechnology proponents claim these advant ages could translate into number of potential benefits such as reduced costs to producers lower prices for consumers for edible fish and pharmaceuticals and envir onmental benefits such as reduced water pollution from wastes food scientists nd the aquaculture industry may support the introduction of genetic engineering provi ded that issues of product safety environmental concerns ethics and in formation are satisf actorily addressed on the other hand while the majority of consumers in the united states appear to have accepted gm food and feed crops35 it is uncertain whether consumers will be as accepting of gm fish although such fish may taste the same and some are expected to be less expensive than other farmed fish36 ethical concerns over the appropriate use of animals in addition to environmenta l concerns may affect public acceptance of gm fish as food37 ongoing campaigns by environmental and consumer groups have asked grocers restau

try says that it has ccessfully educated the public to discriminate among fish from different sources such as wild and farmed salmon it is possible that publicized escape of gm fish could lead to reduced public acceptance of both the wild and the nongm aquacultured products many environmental and cons umer groups are asking that genetically engineered products be specially labele d however industry groups are concerned that such labeling might lead consumers to belie ve that their products are unsafe for consumption39 to date there has been little legislative activity in congress on gm
