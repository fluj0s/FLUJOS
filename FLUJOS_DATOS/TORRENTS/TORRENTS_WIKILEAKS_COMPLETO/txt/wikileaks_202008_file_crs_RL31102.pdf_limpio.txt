issues for consid eration and oversight of student loan repayments are examined in th next sections of the report legislative history of student loan repayment 101st congress executive branch loan repayment program senate bill on may 18 1989 one month after the publication of the volcker commissions report senator ted stevens in troduced for himself and senator david pryor s 1071 bill to authorize the repaym ent of student loans for certain federal employees in his statement accompanyi ng the introduction senator stevens noted the commissions recommendation and stated that the bill was designed to improve the federal governments ability to compete for top college graduates many of whom have heavy debt and simply cannot afford the option of federal service saying that agencies would have discretion to use the authority as they saw fit to recruit highly qualified people that are important to its mission senator stevens emphasized that agencies would be required to absorb the expense of loan repayment out of their existing payroll budget and went on to say that the provision envisioned new outlays whatsoever according to senator stevens this would ensure that this authority is used sparingly and only when necessary and require agency managers to make some tough decisions in reallocating funds to use this recruiting incentivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31102crs4 13

and cessation of the loan repayments if the employee separated either voluntarily or for reasons of poor performance from federal service were viewed by senator stevens as ensurin g the government return on its human resource investment13 senator pryor reiterated the comments of senator stevens in saying that agencies will have wide latitude to work out how much of loan will be repaid by the agency and the length of time the employee will have to commit to staying with the agency he anticipated that agencies will exercise great discretion in using this program as they will be required to absorb the costs14 after referral to the sena committee on governmental affairs s 1071 saw further action house bill in the house of representatives representatives benjamin gilman and william ford introduced h r 2544 on june 6 1989 which included as section 3 provisions on student loan repayment similar to those in s 107115 representative gilman in statement accomp anying the introduction noted that the volcker commission had recomme nded repayment of student loans and said the bill would make the federal g overnment an employer of first choice for many of our nations finest students he stated r epayment shall be from funds already appropriated at the time of appointment he also tha nked senators stevens and pryor for formulating and drafting major provisions of the bill on the repayments16 house subcommittee hearing the public service education assistance act of 1990 hr 2544 was referred to the civil service subcommittee of the house committee on post office and civil service the subcommittee conducted hearing on the bill on july 27 1989 and took testimony from the director of the office of personnel management the execu tive director of the national commission on the public service and the special couns of the consumer bankers association in remarks during the hearing representa tive ford described hr 2544 as sort of gi bill for civil servants17 opm director constance newman stated that the agency had not given enough considerati on to how much this approach would cost or to whether the benefits would justif the cost she also expressed several concerns

government just long enough to qualify for loan repaym ent and then move elsewhere consideration of the equity of recruitment incentive that would have value for those who have already paid their own way through college the essential need to limit the coverage to occupations where there is difficulty in recruiting or retaining employees with critical skills identified as scien tists and engineers the need to examine carefully the administrative feasibility of agencies making loan repayments the lack of provision on central regulatory authority to ensure uniformity among the agencies the inappropriateness of not having an employee repay any loan payments made by the agency if he or she fails to complete the service requirement and the lack of limit on how large repayment commitment could be made18 the latter three concerns were addressed by provisions that were included in the bill when it was reported to the house aske d about the appropriateness of threeyear service requirement mrs newman stated that three is probably fairly standard time but the concern is that we have some assura nce that the kinds of people if you go with this type of approach actually have an intent to participate in public service and that they arent just using this as vehicle to repay their loans and whether or not three year limitation provides enough assurance that you get at least some benefit from having participated in this i dont know19 l bruce laingen executive director of the national commission on the public service viewed the legisla tion as step in enriching the talent pool of government and as practical way to get young pe ople started on their careers according to laingen entry level payment in govern ment is increasingly noncompetitive with the private sector and combined with slow procedures by government in hiring on the one hand and students loan s to repay on the other of ten makes government even for those who actually seek government service an unattractive career choice20 another witness consumer bankers ssociation special counsel john dean noted the significant student loan indebt edness of students with advanced

an employer able to provide the highest level of compensation possible and in most cases that is not the federal government in order to encourage extended government service dean suggested that larger repayments be made for longer years of rvice his concerns about the legislation related to the following the need for close examination of existing program regulations to assure that borrower records are appropriately documented especially for cases where limit ations on the maximum repayment amount provided under the program result in residual amount still owed by the individual student loan borrower making sure that when federal check comes in for student loan it is applied to the correct loan ensuring that if the check is for an amount that is less than the amount due on the loan note in th computer file will indicate that second check will be coming so that an insufficient notice payment will not follow receipt of the first check from the federal government identifying who will be held accountable for delinquency on the loans if there is paperwork error and the federal government payment arrives late and the possibility of precipitating em ployee delinquency or default on loan if he or she longer qualifies for loan repayment because of performance reasons or separa tion from government service21 house bill reported on february 7 1990 the house committee on post office and civil service reported the bill to the house but further action occurred as reported hr 2544 differed fro m the senate bill in several respects for example it did not cover student loan s made insured or guaranteed by state governments the bill also provided th at in selecting employees to receive student loan repayment benefits an agen cy shall consistent with the merit system principles set forth in paragraphs 1 and 2 of section 2301b take into consideration the need to maintain balanced workforce in which women and members of racial and ethnic minority groups are appropriate ly represented in

in june 1988 on the federal governments difficulties in recruiting and retaining highly qualified professional technical or administrative personnel23 according to these reports pay rates significantly less than those offered by the private sector negative image of public service and lack of information bout careers in government were among the reasons inhibiting the federal government from attracting and keeping skilled individuals the committee report stated that the new authority is an attempt to bolster efforts to recruit topflight ca ndidates for employment with the federal government and noted that the repayment program would be used as recruiting tool to attract individuals with criti cal skills necessary for the agency it acknowledged criticisms that these repaymen t provisions could result in disparate treatment of equally qualif ied candidates solely on th basis of their form of indebtedness the report expressed the committees opinion that remedies for an otherwise gravely lacking federal compensation system must be sought wherever the federal government can exert unique pressure24 with regard to limitations on the size of the repayments the committee stated its intent to strike balance between the extremely high loan indebtedness of many college graduates and the limited resources available to federal agencies for new initiatives in programs and employee benefits further the committee noted that the loan repayment was to apply to indebtedness outstanding at the time an employee entered into an agreement25 cbo cost estimate the congressional budget office cbo estimated that the cost of the student loan repayment program in 1991 would be between 2 and 3 million with the potential to increase to 10 to 15 million by 1995 cbo also estimated that administrative costs would total less than one million dollars the cost estimate assumed that most agencies would agree to reimburse loan payments for at least five years26 views of the departments of education and justice the department of education doe and the department of justice doj submitted views to the house committee on post office and civ il service opposing hr 2544s provisions to establish student loan repayment pr ogram doe believed that the program would be extremely costly with overl generous agency repayment amounts permitted and is unlikely to correlate to the recruitment needs of the federal servicehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31102crs8 27 ibid pp 1718 28 ibid pp 1617 29 ibid p 19or alter any significant numbe r of students decisions to enter the federal service27 additional concerns expressed by doe were that the program would set dangerous precedent by allowing for the first time cancellation of guaranteed student loans gsls in exchange for performance of certain activity introducing cancellation for one ac tivity would almost certainly lead to pressure for cancellation for many other meritorious activities very probably be poorly correlated to recruitment needs and be unlikely to affect many decisions on whether to enter the federal service prior efforts to attract recruits to certain professions ch as teaching through loan forgiveness and similar programs have not had si gnificant impact on students decisions to enter the field provide potential windfall for some employ ees particularly in light of the high agency repayment amounts permitted aggravate current retention problems if employees need only complete three years of federal service to take advantage of the repayment program some may well work only long enough to earn the cancellation before moving elsewhere other programs such as the perkins loan program in the higher education act of 1965 20 usc 1001 et seq require five years of service in certain teaching positions before the entire loan is canceled by authorizing payments up to 6000 per year provide very generous yearly bonus far in excess of the amounts generally available to small number of employees in the form of cash awards or merit pay bonuses for outstanding service thus employees who either ve student loans or who have already repaid their loans would in essence be compensated at lower rate than other employees simply because they do not have particular form of debt this type of inequity could have demoralizing effect on the federal employees not participating in the repayment program and create retention problems the federal government should not be in position of rewarding students who finance their education through federal student loans and penalizing students who chose work or savings to finance their postsecondary education create situation in which it could be very difficult to regulate effectively the very broad subjective authority of an agency head to waive right of recovery against an employee if it would be agains t equity and good conscience or against the public interest28 doj also declined to support student an repayment the agencys concerns were that the program would not provide reliable incentive for recruitment and retention because its usefulness depends upon the nature of an individuals indebtedness and thus varies from candidate to candidate29 additionally justice believed that the programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31102crs9 30 ibid 31 the amendment was an amendment to an amendment that had been offered by rep mavroules 32

as highly desirable and these staff positions have certain cachet that arguably makes them at least as desirable as other federal jobs113 congress watchers observe that congre ssional staff tenure is

law firms in hiring new attorneys as clerks unlike executive branch agencies the judiciary has not sought statutory authorization to use its appr opriated funds to re pay student loans as recruitment or retention incentive for prosp ective or current employees137 issues for consideration agencies may consider several issues as they implement student loan repayment programs or determine whether the establis hment of such programs is desirable or feasible among these issues are how the program will be funded the length of the service agreement between the agency and the employee the criteria for eligibility and the kinds of program data to be collected each is discussed belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31102crs40 138 telephone conversation with department of state staff on feb 6 2002 pl 10777

support agencies to blish student loan repayment programs the law does not provide funding to implement those programs the legislative history of the 1990 law is clear that the authority is to be used sparingly and that additional appropriations we re anticipated despite this intention specific appropriation for repayments is sometimes requested and r eceived by agencies the department of state for example requested an appropriation of 7 million for fy2002 and received an appropriation of 2 million for such repayments138 the fy2002 legislative branch appropria tions act pl 10768 authorized appropriations for student loan repaym ent program for senate employing offices in fy2002 and each succeeding year not all agencies receive sp ecific funds for the program however absent this agencies must prioritize among all available recruitment and retention incentives including student loan repayments and then allocate funds accordingly from existing pay nd benefits programs consideration might be how to use the funding availabl for incentives in manner that would benefit the greatest number of employees139 the us commission on national security21st century known as the hart rudman commission recommended that add itional funds to maximize agencies options in recruiting and retaining high quality personnel be provided identifying student loan repayments as one of many incentive programs designed to recruit and retain employees the commission stated that the lack of agency use of the programs resulted from lack of funds the co mmission noted that because all incentive programs are drawn from the same pool of m oney as that for salaries administrators must trade off incentives for some employ ees against th ability to hi re additional personnel the commission also recomme nded loan forgiveness for those individuals in science mathematics and engineering entering civilian government or military service140 required service agreement currently service agreement of

ibidyears among the considerations that might enter into an agencys discussion of the appropriate length of service agreement are these whether the repayments are used to recruit or retain employees the time and resources that would be expended to hire and train employees to replace those who are leaving the time that it takes for newly hired employees to develop expertis in their positions and whether service agreement longer than the minimum would diminish the interest of employees in working in agencies with extended requirements additionally member of congresss tenure in office may affect the d ecision on the length of the service period required in house and senate offices eligibility criteria when publishing the proposed regulations opm identified five factors to be considered in determining whether the loan repayments should be authorized and the amount of such payments the success of recent efforts to recruit high quality candidates labor market factors affecting recruitment special qualifications or education needed the cost of training current versus new employees and the practicality of using other recruitment and retention incentives opms final regulations noted that becau several agencies complained that the factors to be considered portion of the criteria for payment section were overly restrictive and burdensome thes were deleted from the final rules141 requirements for written determinations of the need for the repayments based on recruitment and retention see the crite ria for repayments section above were retained in the final regulations in final regulations implementing the amendments to the law opm noted suggestion that the term highly qualified personnel be defined in the regulations opm stated that it did not adopt this ggestion because standard definition of highly qualified personne l may limit agencies in their use of this authority as there are many ways in which individuals may be deemed highly qualified in relation to the duties they perform or the skills they possess142 as for making the determination that an employee would likel leave government service without the repayment benefit opm stated that the regulations give agencies wide latitude and do not require proof from private sector employer to use repayment as retention incentive143 the flexibility inherent in the opm criteria for student loan repayments may be considered by agencies in deciding whether repayments or other recruitment and retention incentives would best meet their needs the desire to fairly administer repayment program and not adversely affect employee morale may prompthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31102crs42 144 the american federation of government employees afge very much favors the benefit for both recruits and incumbent

committees the senate committee on governmental affairs and the house committee on government reform in general have exercised jurisdiction over federal employee issues other committees such as appropriations also may have an interest in seeing the reportsconsideration of these issues whether ju st new recruits or both new recruits and current employees would be eligible for student loan repayments the capability of new recruits to repay their student loan s depending on the pay grade at which they are hired and the fact that some current employees may have already recently paid off their student loans144 records and reports pl 106398 requires covered agencies to report annually to opm on the number and job classifications of employees receiving student loan repayments and the cost of providing the repayments the regulations implementing the law state that cost is defined as the total amount of student loan repayments and not the costs of administering the program u nder the regulations records on student loan repayments must be maintained by the agencies for three years or until after opm formally evaluates the prog ram whichever comes first opm must report annually to congress on agencies use of student loan repayments145 given the expansion of student loan repayment programs especially in the last year more comprehensive indicator of expenses would be pr ovided if opms nnual report included information on the costs of administering the programs in congress the senate disbursing ffice under the office of the secretary of the senate reports annua lly to the committee on appropriations and to the committee on rules and administration on the loan repayments made to senate employees the office of the chief adminis trative officer reports annually to the committee on appropriations and the committee on house administration on repayments made to house employees the legislative branch does not require report of its agencies that is publicly available or comparable to opms report one way to assess the effectiveness of the repayments as recruitment and retention tool could be survey of the employing offices providing repayment benefits that would detail similar elements as presented in the opm report agencies might examine whether student loan repayment records should be maintained beyond the period prescribed by regulation longer period of record keeping might be useful if an employee leaves to work at another federal agency andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31102crs43 in turn also receives loan repayment from that agency the collected data could be useful in evaluating the cost desirability feasibility and effectiveness of the programs pilot programs instituted to test the effectiveness of repayments in meeting workforce management goals could serve as models for other agencies as yet undecided about establis hing repayment programs oversight of repayment programs in order to enhance the oversight of student loan repayment programs opm may want to expand the information pr ovided in its annual report to congress additional data that could be re ported might include the following the costs of administering such programs the number of individuals who leave government service after receiving repayments and completing the minimum required service period the number of individuals who ve been granted waivers from repaying the benefit if they do not fulfill the service agreement an agency head may waive the repayment for reasons of equity or public interest and the attrition rates of employees both receiving and not receiving repayments other information that could be incl uded in the opm report might be the composition as to sex and race of recipients to determine whether the program is being administered in an equitable manner and details on the written determination document that recipients sign to attest that they would leave federal service in the absence of the student loan repayment congress opm and the agencies themselves also may wish to examine whether the intent of congress that repayments be used sparingly and with great discretion is being fulfilled particularly since the number of repayments has increased so significantly between fy2004 and fy2005 individual executive agency reports on student loan repayments are not available publicly perhaps agencies would consider posting these reports on their internet websites oversight of the repayment programs may be strengthened by evaluations conduc ted by agency inspectors general or the national academy of public administration currently several agencies have anecdotal evidence on the effectiveness of their student loan repayment programs some agencies are into their fourth year of using the incentive while others have one to three years of experience with the program in order to further assess the impact of repayments agencies may institute systematic entrance and exit interviews that query their employees on the importance of receiving student loan repayments compar ed to other available recruitment and retention incentives in addition the recru itment and retention re sults for new hireshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31102crs44 who received and did not receive the repaymen ts could be compared to determine the effectiveness of the repayments information on the specific recruitment and retention challenges that agencies are trying to mitigate through the use of repayments also would illuminate whether they are primarily competing with other agencies or with the private sector for
