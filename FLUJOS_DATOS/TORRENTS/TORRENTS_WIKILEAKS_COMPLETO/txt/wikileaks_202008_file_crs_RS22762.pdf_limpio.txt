icr and the ibr plans borrowers must make payments of not ss than the monthly amount calculated according to standard 10year repayment period to be eligible for loan forgiveness it would appear that in practical terms to qualify for loan forgiveness under this provision borrowers may be precluded from repaying according to the extended and graduated repayment plans on the basis of these requirements it appears that for borrowers to make 120 payments on their loans and still have an outstanding balance available to be forgiven after the completion of those payments borrowers will need to make at least some of their payments according to either the icr or ibr plans additionally it appears that if borrowers repay according to either the icr or ibr plans their incomes relative to their debt bur den must be sufficiently low for at least some period such that their monthly payments calculated according to the respective plan are less than the monthly payment amount calculated according to standard repayment plan with 10year repayment period otherwise after making 120 monthly payments borrowers will have fully repaid their loans

g346g561forgiveness provision might be clarified by ed and be addressed in future guidance or regulations such issues include the procedures borrowers will follow in applying for loan forgiveness how borrowers will substantiate their fulltime employment in public service jobs during repayment how any breaks in fulltime employment in public service jobs will be addressed and how borrowers may ensure that they have selected repayment plan under which all of their monthly payments will satisfy the minimum monthly payment amount necessary to be counted toward the 120 monthly payments required for loan forgiveness g5g152g151g156g152g149g146g141g138g157g146g152g151g561g14g152g138g151g156g561 guidance might also be provided to clarify number of issues concerning consolidation loans for example it is unclear whether payments made by borrowers on their dl program loans will continue to count toward the 120 monthly payments required for loan forgiveness if these borrowers subsequently consolidate their loans into new dl consolidation loans or whether consolidation loan borrowers must restart counting toward the required 120 monthly payments the terms of the loan forgiveness provision indicate that borrowers must make 120 monthly payments on their loans according to either the icr plan the ibr plan or another repayment plan that is based on 10year repayment period since consolidation loan is new loan borrowers of consolidation loans may only be able to count the payments made on their consolidation loan toward the 120 monthly payments required for loan forgiveness in addition for borrowers of consolidation loans the maximum repayment period under the standard repayment plan may range from 10 years to 30 years depending on borrowers total student loan indebtedness 7 it appears that consolidation loan borrowers may need to ensure that they repay at least the monthly payment amount calculated according to 10year repayment period to maintain eligibility for loan forgivenes s regardless of whether they would otherwise be eligible to repay according to maximum standard repayment period of 12 15 20 25 or 30 years depending on their total student loan indebtedness finally prior to july 1 2006 married borrowers were eligible to obtain joint consolidation loans future guidance might address the eligibi lity of joint consolidation loan borrowers to have their loans forgiven under the dl loan forgiveness provision for public service employees guidance might address whether one or both borrowers must meet the employment and repayment requirements for loan forgiveness and if these requirements are met by only one of the joint borrowers whether that borrowers propor tionate share of the joint loan balance will be forgiven guidance might also address how the future eligibility of ffel consolidation loan borrowers to reconsolidate their loans into federal direct consolidation loans for purposes of using the dl program loan forgiveness provision effective july 1 2008 will apply to joint borrowers 7 for details on repayment plans available to borrowers of dl program loans see us department of education direct loan bulletin new direct
