international agreements with other states or internati onal organizations that are legally binding this section briefly describes the form that these agreements may take under domestic practice in this regard it is important to distinguish treaty in the context of international law in which treaty and international agreement are synonymous terms for all binding agreements7 and treaty in the context of domestic american law in which treaty more narrowly refe rs to particular subcategory of binding international agreements treaties under us law treaty is an agreement negotiated and signed8 by the executive branch that enters into force if it is approved by twothirds majority of the senate and is subsequently ratified by the president in some cases such as in many bilateral treaties ratification occurs through presidential signature in the case of certain multilateral treaties ratification may occur only after the treatys instruments of ratification are submitted to the

agreements that the united states enters into are not treaties but executive agreements13 agreements entered into by the executive branch that are not submitted to the senate for its advice and consent congress ge nerally requires notif ication upon the entry of such an agreement14 there are three types of prima facie legal executive agreements 1 congressionalexecutive agreements in which congress has previously or retroactively authorized an international agreement entered into by the executive 2 executive agreements made pursuant to an earlier treaty in which the agreement is authorized by ratified treaty and 3 sole executive agreements in which an agreement is made pursuant to the presidents constitutional authority without further congressional authorization the executive s authority to promulgate the agreement is different in each case in the case of congressionalexecutive agreements the constitutionalityseems well established15 unlike in the case of treaties where only the senate plays role in authorizing the agreement both houses of c ongress will be involved in the authorizing process for congressionalexecutive agreemen ts congressional authorization of such agreements takes the form of statut which must pass both houses of congress historically congressionalexecutive agreements have been made for wide variety of topics ranging from postal conventions to bilateral trade to military assistance16 the north american free trade agreement and the general agreement on tariffs and trade are notable examples of congressionalexecutive agreements agreements made pursuant to treaties are also wellestablished as legitimate though controversy occasionally arises as to whether the agreement was actually imputed by the treaty in question17 since the earlier treaty is the law of the land18 the power to enter into an agreement required or contemplated by the treaty lies fairlyclearly within the presidents executive function sole executive agreements rely on neither treaty nor congressional authority to provide for their legal basis there are number of provisions in the constitution that may confer limited authority upon

he has clear exclusive constitutional authority such as an agreement to recognize particular state for diplomatic purposes the agreement is legally per missible regardless of congresss opinion on the matter20 if however the president enters into an agreement and his constitutional authority over the agreements subject matter is unclear reviewing court may consider congresss position in determining whether the agreement is legitimate21 if congress has given its implicit approval to the president entering the agreement or is silent on the matter it is more likely that the agreement will be deemed valid when congress opposes the agreement and the pres idents constitutional authority to enter the agreement is ambiguous it is unclear if or when such an agreement would be given effect the atlantic charter which presid ent franklin roosevelt and british prime minister winston churchill agreed to in 1941 to delineate angloamerican war aims is an example of sole executive agreement effects of international agreements on us law the effects that international agreements entered into by the united states have upon us domestic law are dependent upon the nature of the agreement whether the agreement is selfexecuting or nonselfe xecuting and possibly whether it was made pursuant to treaty or an executive agreement selfexecuting vs nonselfexecuting agreements c r t i n international treaties or executive agreements are considered selfexecuting meaning that they have the force of law without the need for subsequent congressional action however many other treaties and agreements are not considered selfexecuting and are understood to require imple menting legislation to take effect as enforcing us agencies otherwise lack authority to conduc t the actions required to ensure compliance with the international agreement22 treaties have been f ound to be nonselfexecuting for at least three reasons 1 the agreement manifests an intention that it shall not become effective as

existing domestic law concerning amatter covered by an international agreement that is not selfexecuting remains unchanged and controlling law in the united states however when treaty is ratified or

traditional state authority through treaty implementing legislation remains unclear though there is reason to believe that it could not enact legislation that infringed upon the essen tial character of states such as through legislation that commandeered state executive and legislative authorities see printz v united states 521 us 898 1997 new york v united states 505 us 144 1992 see generally

selfexecuting agreement will trum p an earlier inconsistent statute33 in the case of treaties and executive agreements that are not selfexecuting it is the implementing legislation that is controlling domestically not the agreements or treaties themselves34 customary international law customary international law is defined as resulting from general and consistent practice of states followed by them from sense of legal obligation35 this means that all or nearly all states consistently follow the practice in question and they must do so because they believe themselves legally bound concept often referred to as opinio juris sive necitatis opinio juris if states generally follow particular practice but do not feel bound by it it does not c onstitute customary international law36 further there are ways for states to avoid being subject to customary international law first state which is persistent objector to particular requirement of customaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32528crs8 37 id 102 reporters n 2 the philosophy underlying the consistent objector exemption is that states are bound by customary international law because they have at least tacitly consented to it binding them to abide to cust omary practices despite their explicit rejection of these norms would violate their sovereig n rights though states are likely still bound in the case of peremptory jus cogens norms

customary intern ational law is our law but only when there is not already controlling executive or legislative act41 there does not appear to be case where the court has ever struck down us statute

cogens norm state practice must be extensive and virtually uniform44 the alien tort claims act perhaps the clearest example of us law incorporating customary international law is via the alien tort claims act atca45 the atca originated as part of the judici ary act of 1789 and blishes federal court jurisdiction over tort claims brought by alie ns for violations of the law of nations46 until 1980 this statute was rarely used but in filartiga v penairala the second circuit relied upon it to award civil judgme nt against former paraguayan police official who had allegedly tortured the plaintiffs while still in paraguay in doing so the filartiga court concluded that torture constitutes violation of the law of nations and gives rise to cognizable claim under the atca47 since that time the atca

when and whether the atca provides for cause of action on the basis of an alleged violation of customary international law the supreme court held that some but few torts in violation of international law are recognized under the atca52 the court stated that legitimate atca claim should rest on norm of international char acter accepted by the civilized world and defined with specificity comparable to the features of the 18th century paradigms we have recognized ie violations of sa fe conducts infringement of the rights of ambassadors and piracy explaining that these norms are part of federal common law53 the court declined to provide exampl of other offenses that might provide grounds for an atca and counseled restraint in finding them54 though the majority opinion cites to filartiga on number of occasions incl uding citing in dicta to the filartiga courts finding that for purposes of civil liability the torturer has become like the pirate and slave trader before him hostis humani generis an enemy of all mankind55 the court did however conclude that two international agreements that the united states is party to that have been widely recognized as sources of jurisprudence regarding customary international law the universal declaration of human rights and the international conve ntion on civil and political rights did not in themselves constitute an interna tional norm

years foreign or international legal sources have increasingly been cited by the supreme court when resolving domestic legal issues58 while these sources have been looked to for persuasive valu they have not been treated as binding precedent upon us courts reference to fo reign law or jurisprudence is not new occurrence for example in 1815 the supr eme court noted that decisions of the courts of every country so far as th ey are founded upon law common to every country will be received not as authority but with respect59 with respect to international law and treaty interpretation at least fo reign practice and understanding have always been considered to have persuasive value60 however domestic court reference upon foreign law and practice has become increasin gly controversial there is some dispute among scholars and policym akers over the extent to which american courts can and should rely on foreign practices in making decisions interpreting us statutes and the constitution particularly following recent supreme court rulings that referred to foreign jurisprudence61 possibly the most notable recent reference to foreign law by us court occurred in the supreme courts majority opinion in the 2003 case of lawrence v texas which held that texas statute outlawing sames ex sodomy violated the due process clause of the 14th amendment62 in an earlier court decision upholding antisodomy laws bowers v hardwick chief justice burger had written that practices akin to those in question in lawrence had been prohibited throughout western history63 writing for the majority in lawrence justice kennedy responded to this claim by noting that decisions by other nations and the european court of human rights within the past few decades conflicted with the reasoning and holding of bowers the courts opinionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32528crs12 64 lawrence 123 sct at 2483 in dissent justice scalia referred to the majoritys discussion of foreign law as meaningless

clear how persuasive foreign law is considered to be or whether the courts decision in lawrence and other recent cases evidences growing practice of looking to foreign jurispruden ce to inform domestic decisions65 thus far it does not appear that an american court has base d its holding on question of statutory or constitutional interpretation so lely on foreign law alt hough foreign law and practice have historically had role in american jurisprudence and courts will likely continue to refer to it where when and how significantly they will rely upon it is difficult to predict
