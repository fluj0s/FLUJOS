by amb d kathleen stephens reasons 14 bd summary 1 c group of five rok opinion leaders and experts on north korea issues told as kurt campbell on february 3 it was difficult to predict whether kim jongils youngest kim jongun would be able to succeed his father without sparking instability in the north of the five experts one thought the younger kim might succeed and one argued his lack of leadership experience made it unlikely he would win the support of the ruling elites they agreed that kim jongils brotherinlaw jang songtaek would prove strong rival for the younger kim and would probably be tempted to challenge him kim jongil had used draconian controls and international aid to discourage coups after having foiled three such attempts in the late 90s chinas strategic interests were fundamentally at odds with usrok interests in north korea end summary succession in progress but success in doubt 2 c assistant secretary kurt campbell met on february 3 with korean opinion leaders with keen interest in dprk issues to hear their views on the future of north korea the experts agreed that regime succession was fully underway and that the north korean people had accepted the process xxxxxxxxxxx said north korean diplomat based in beijing had told him over the phone that morning that the dprk foreign ministry had instructed all of its overseas missions to lay the foundation for leadership change in pyongyang most of the experts believed the challenge for kim jongils youngest and designated heir kim jongun would most likely come after his father died xxxxxxxxxxx recalled the chosun dynastys 500 year history in which political intrigue and tension might simmer for years but tended to erupt only after the king died 3 c the group agreed that kim jongils brotherinlaw and righthand man jang songtaek was spearheading the succession drive and would be rival for power once kim jonguns father died but the group was split on the younger kims prospects for holding onto power xxxxxxxxxxx believed it would be difficult for jang to wrest power from the younger kim once the succession process was complete xxxxxxxxxxx suggested it was unclear whether jang would be content to control the younger kim from behind the curtain or would challenge him directly for outright control xxxxxxxxxxx doubts about younger kims experience 4 c there were many reasons to doubt that kim jongun would be able to successfully fend off challenges to his control after his father died xxxxxxxxxxx noted that kim jongil had twenty years of experience as an official of the korean workers party before his father died furthermore kim jongil had the benefit of years of guidance from his father after he had been officially anointed in 1980 to eventually succeed him by contrast kim jongun had very limited experience and might not get much direct guidance before kim jongil dies even now xxxxxxxxxxx it was not clear that kim jongils health was good enough to exercise the faculties necessary for daytoday management of state affairs given the limited opportunity the younger kim had to gain experience xxxxxxxxxxx doubted his ability to solidify his position in the party and win the unwavering support of pyongyangs power elites xxxxxxxxxxx recalled the tumultuous state of affairs in the rok following the death of president park chung hee in 1979 and suggested the dprk succession would be 100 times more troublesome xxxxxxxxxxx tight control and aid kept regime afloat 5 c xxxxxxxxxxx opined that brutal repression and international aid had been the secrets of kim jongils ability to fend off challenges after three separate coup attempts in the 90s kim jongil had implemented very strict controls and sent stern warning to wouldbe plotters by executing anyone who had been even remotely involved in the plots therefore only the military could even dare consider rising up but the security services had successfully kept the military in check xxxxxxxxxxxwent on to suggest that the indulgence of the international community over the past ten years had also helped sustain the regime the largescale assistance provided to the regime by the rok china the us japan and others had been intended in part to avoid hard landing and indeed had kept the regime afloat he said name removed suggested that north korea had skillfully played washington and beijing off one anotherxxxxxxxxxxx believed that the dprk had exploited large amounts of assistance from china taking advantage of situation in which beijing was presumed by washington to have significant influence over pyongyang china complicates the endgame 6 c the experts agreed that chinas obsession with dprk stability at all costs was clearly and fundamentally at odds with us and rok interests given choice between reaching out to seoul or beijing name removed believed that pyongyang elites would reflexively look to china for support if they believed they needed help in maintaining stability the seoul option would be unacceptable because of the usrok alliance and concerns over becoming subservient to seoul china on the other hand would gladly provide support with few or strings attached just to maintain the dprk as an independent entity xxxxxxxxxxx maintained 7 cxxxxxxxxxxxnoted that although washington had keen interest in both denuclearization and human rights the us stake in north korea was minimal compared to that of china by virtue of its proximity to the north china did not share american perspectives on these two key issues considering them somewhat abstract rather beijing was concerned about what it considered to be more concrete issues such as potential flood of economic migrants and broader social unrest on its immediate border reaching the people and close cooperation are key 8 c negating chinese influence over the long term name removed observed would involve close usrok cooperation in winning the hearts and minds of the north korean people xxxxxxxxxxx
