established expedited or fast track procedures by which congress may disapprove broad range of regulatory rules issued by federal agencies by enacting joint resolution of disapproval for in itial floor consideration the act provides an expedited procedure only in the senate the house would likely consider the measure pursuant to special rule the senate may use the procedure for 60 days of session after the agency transmits the rule to congress in both houses however to qualify for expedited consideration disapproval resolution must be submitted within 60 days after congress receives the rule exclusive of recess periods pending action on disapproval resolution the rule may go into effect unless it is major rule on which the president or issuing agency does not waive delay period of 60 calendar days if disapproval resolution is enacted the rule may not take effect and the agency may issue substantially similar rule without subsequent statutory authorization if rule is disapproved after going into effect it is treated as though it had never taken effect if either house rejects disapproval resolution the rule may take effect at once if the president vetoes the resolution the rule may not take effect for 30 days of session thereafter unless the house or senate votes to sustain the veto if session of congress adjourns sine die less than 60 days of session after receiving rule the full 60day periods for action begin anew on the 15 th day of session after the next session convenes except for submission of disapproval resolutions and final congressional action thereon the expedited procedures under the act apply only to senate consideration the house would consider disapproval resolution under its general procedures very likely as prescribed by special rule reported from the committee on rules in the senate once the resolution has been before committee for 20 calendar days the panel is discharged if 30 senators submit petition for the purpose once the committee has reported or been discharged motion to proceed to consider the resolution would in practice be nondebatable and the act prohibits various other possible dilatory actions in relation to the motion and the resolution floor debate on the resolution is limited to 10 hours and amendment is in order the act does not preclude amendment of disapproval resolution in the house and means may exist of overcoming the prohibition on amendment in the senate for these reasons and because the initial texts could differ the resolutions initially adopted by the two houses might not be identical the act enables congress to avoid the need to resolve differences between the two versions by providing that when either house adopts disapproval resolution the other shall first consider its own disapproval resolution and then vote on the resolution received from the first as long as the substantive effect of both is similar the difference in text should not affect the ultimate effect of the legislation if the substantive effects differ presumably the two measures could not be linked in this way by using the expedited procedures of the act

also known more informally as fast track procedures for congressional action on these joint resolutions of disapproval 3 the expedited procedures established by the act include several special features not found in many other statutes providing for expedited procedures that raise issues about how congress may apply the procedures in practice to begin with most though not all of the expedited procedures established by the act regulate action only in the senate the act also provides for an unusually complex set of action periods and deadlines finally other provisions of the act impose restrictions that shape and limit the opportunities for action afforded by the expedited procedures 4

statutory provisions that govern congressional consideration of specified kind of measure most expedited procedures regulate consideration of joint resolutions either to 1 disapprove some action that the statute authorizes the president or an agency of the executive branch to take only if congress does not disapprove or 2 approve some action that statute authorizes to be taken only if congress

will be able to take it up and complete action on it within limited period of time5 expedited procedures that are provided for in statute function as rules of each house of congress these rules however are applicable only to the measures specified by the statute the constitution confers the power to make procedural rules on each house of congress separately but as with any other statute enactment of statute that establishes an expedited procedure requires action by both houses and the president for this reason expedited procedure statutes usually include language declaring that those procedures are enacted under the constitutional rulemaking authority of each house and reserving to each house the authority to change those applicable to itself 6 the congressional review act follows this practice g21g157g138g157g158g157g152g155g162g561g22g146g150g142g561g8g155g138g150g142g156g561 the congressional review act establishes three principal time periods for congressional action on joint resolution disapproving rule or regulation proposed by the executive branch two of these here called the initiation period and the action period regulate congressional action on joint resolutions of disapproval under the act the third which this report refers to as the waiting period affects the possible effective date of certain rules that the act defines as major each of the three time periods nominally runs for 60 days and all run roughly concurrently however the starting point of the initiation period may differ slightly from the others and the days of the three periods are counted in different ways these differences elaborated in the following pages but summarized below in table 1 play key role in determining how the act may operate t able 1 defining elements of

reconcile house and senate action on disapproval resolution submitted and considered in accordance with the act these procedures need not occur within the constraints of the time periods specified and are not associated with any provisions restricting the time at which they must occur pursuant to other provisions of the congress ional review act however various actions by congress or the president can elaborate or alter the effect and application of these three basic time periods specifically the sine die adjournment of session can result in renewal of the initiation period and action period congressional action to defeat disapproval resolution can result in termination of the waiting period and presidential veto of disapproval resolution can bring about an additional waiting period whose extent may depend on subsequent congressional action in relation to the veto the following sections address the operation of these subsidiary time restrictions as well as the three basic ones g11g151g146g157g146g138g157g146g152g151g561g18g142g155g146g152g141g561g138g151g141g561g3g140g157g146g152g151g561g18g142g155g146g152g141g561 even in the absence of the congressional review act the general legislative powers of congress would presumably always allow passage of bill or joint resolution overriding or abolishing rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to law by an executive branch agency the effect of the congressional review act is simply to establish expedited procedures for congressional consideration of joint resolution accomplishing this end the act makes these expedited procedures available to congress if two conditions are met first disapproval resolution may be considered under the expedited procedure only if it is submitted during specified initiation period second the senate may consider the resolution under the expedited procedure only during specified action period as discussed later the resolution must also conform to certain content requirements

days after congress receives the rule in contrast to both the waiting period and the action period recess days are excluded in calculating this initiation period any day that either house is in adjournment during recess of more than 3 days does not count toward this time limit 7 normally in other words weekend days will count toward the initiation period but district work periods will not 7

period applies only to initial consideration in the senate because the act establishes expedited procedures for initial house consideration the senate may use the expedited procedures to complete initial consideration of disapproval resolution only during the 60 days of session following congressional receipt of the rule and if required its publication in the federal register any day on which the senate does not meet does not count toward the time limit for this action period8 g7g143g143g142g140g157g561g152g143g561

session after rule is submitted congress adjourns its session sine die under these conditions both periods start over again in the new session of congress beginning in each house on the 15 th day of session after congress reconvenes9 this provision helps ensure that congress will effectively have the full periods established by law to act on disapproval resolution under the expedited procedure absent this special provision the initiation period and action period might end up being split between two sessions of congress so that in each session congress would have less than 60 days to act if president submitted proposed rule shortly before sine die adjournment congress might not find it feasible to complete action on disapproval resolution either in the time remaining before the end of the session or in the portion of the 60 days remaining at the start of the new session completing action could be especially difficult when the new session was the first session of new congress for in that case the disapproval resolution would have to be submitted anew and proceed through all the stages of the legislative process from its start in perhaps many fewer than 60 days renewal of the full

effect until 60 calendar days after the rule has been both published in the federal register and submitted to congress unless the rule is one for which such publication is not required in which case the 60 days begins when the rule is simply submitted to congress13 the president may waive this additional waiting period for major rule if he determines that for any of several stated reasons more expeditious implementation is necessary and so notifies congress14 if he does so the major rule may go into effect subject only to the stipulations of the administrative procedure act in sum the 60day waiting period established by the congressional review act applies only to major rules for which the president has not waived its application rules that are not major as well as major rules for which the president waives the additional waiting period may take effect as provided by the administrative procedure act after 30 days unless the rule itself provides for later date

waiting period for major rules is defined in calendar days the action period and initiation period are defined in ways dependent on the congressional schedule as result the waiting period will normally expire first because its clock runs continuously without interruption the action period for the senate normally will expire later because its clock pauses on each day the senate does not meet the initiation period normally will expire between the other two because when congress does not meet its clock sometimes runs during breaks of three days or less and sometimes pauses during more extended recesses for example suppose that after major rule is submitted and published each house meets for 5 days week except for one recess of two weeks the waiting period expires after 60 calendar days the recess extends the initiation period to 76 calendar days the action period elapses only at the rate of 5 days per week when the senate is in session and not at all during the recess it expires after 14 weeks or 96 calendar days 15 these differences have significant implications on how the disapproval procedure under the act may operate specifically the initiation period and action period pause when congress is not in session as result they cannot expire while congress is out of session and so cannot by the timing of their expiration prevent congressional action under the expedited procedures of the act the action period normally will continue after the initiation period ends if any disapproval resolution is submitted during the initiation period some time will 13 5 usc section 801a3 14 5 usc section 801c the stated reasons include threats to health and safety criminal law enforcement national security and implementation of trade agreements 15 it is theoretically possible however that 60 days excluding recesses will outlast 60 days of session day on which the senate is in session and the house in recess counts as day of the action period for the senate but not as day of the initiation period if enough such days occur the action period of 60 days of session could expire before the initiation period of 60 days excluding recesses at that poi nt disapproval resolution could still be submitted yet the expedited procedures could not be used for considering it

consider the resolution under the expedited procedures of the act the initiation period normally will expire before the action period does if any resolution is submitted after the initiation period expires congress will be unable to consider it under the expedited procedures of the act even if the action period has not expired the presence of the waiting period means that congress will normally have 60 days to use the expedited procedures of the act to disapprove major rule before it becomes effective because the action period normally will continue after the waiting period ends and by the same token after the effective date of rules other than major rules congress will normally retain the ability to use the expedited procedures of the act to disapprove rule for some period after the rule has already gone into effect the following two sections pursue the implications of this last circumstance

disapprove rule that has already taken effect can arise in several different ways first the rule may be major rule which normally may take effect when the waiting period expires in this case the action period for the senate normally will continue after the waiting period ends 16 the senate remains able to act on disapproval resolution under the expedited procedure during the remainder of the action period second rule that is not major rule is not subject to the waiting period and so may take effect even earlier in the action period during the remainder of the action period the senate has correspondingly longer window of opportunity to adopt resolution under the expedited procedure disapproving the rule that has already taken effect third congress may adjourn sine die before the original action period expires both the action period and the initiation period begin anew with the 15th day of session in the following session of congress17 the adjournment however does not extend either the waiting period for major rule or any other restriction on the effective date of rule the date when the rule takes effect is unaffected by the sine die adjournment in the new session as result the procedures of the congressional review act remain available for c ongress to disapprove the rule even though the rule may already have taken effect finally the congressional review act explicitly contemplates that even after the action period has terminated congress may still enact joint resolution disapproving rule pursuant to the act for this purpose the disapproval resolution would have to have been submitted during the initiation period and would have to meet the content requirements of the act 16 the reverse could also be true however if federal register publication does not occur until well after the rule is submitted to congress 17 5 usc section 801d and 802e for the ho use the new initiation period begins on the 15th legislative day of the new session

resolution disapproving rule that has already taken effect under any of the circumstances just described the rule shall be treated as though it had never taken effect18 the intent seems to be that in these cases any consequences the rule had already had would be undone retroactively this stipulation applies only to disapproval resolution that was submitted and received final action in accordance with the provisions of the congressional review act if congress enacted measure overriding or abolishing regulation through proceedings that did not meet the procedural requirements of the act or in form that did not meet the content requirements of the act for disapproval resolution it would not have this retroactive effect

the congressional review act establishes additional relations between the waiting period and certain actions on disapproval resolution if either house rejects disapproval resolution or sustains veto of one the waiting period terminates immediately 19 on the other hand if the president vetoes resolution to disapprove major rule to which the waiting period applies an additional waiting period occurs during which congress may override the veto this additional waiting period is defined as 30 days of session rather than calendar days as for the initial waiting period the act does not specify how the end of the period is determined if the 30th day of session in each house occurs on different day20 taking these additional provisions into account the possible configurations of legislative action and its consequences for major rules to which the waiting period applies comprise the following congressional action if neither house of congress acts on disapproval resolution during the original waiting period the rule takes effect when that period expires or later if so provided in accordance with the administrative procedure act or the terms of the rule itself rejection by either house if either house votes to reject the disapproval resolution the action presumably ensures that disapproval resolution will pass both chambers at that point the waiting period is vitiated and the rule may take effect immediately or later if so required by the administrative procedure act or the rule itself 21 passage by both houses veto if both houses pass the disapproval resolution and the president does not veto it the resolution becomes law and the rule becomes of force and effect whether or not the waiting period has expired 22 passage veto attempt to override if both houses pass the

during this new waiting period the rule takes effect when the 30 days of session expire or later if so required by other authorities23 passage veto sustained by either house if either house votes to sustain the veto congress can longer override at that point the additional 30day waiting period is vitiated and the rule may take effect immediately or later if so required by other authorities 24 passage veto overridden if both houses override the veto the disapproval resolution becomes law so that the rule becomes of force and effect as already explained it is possible that congress could pass resolution to disapprove rule during the action period but after the rule has already taken effect if the president then vetoed the disapproval resolution the rule would presumably be considered to remain in effect pending congressional action on the veto under these circumstances in other words the additional waiting period would presumably not occur this interpretation seems consistent with the general intent of the congressional review act that rule may be vitiated through congressional disapproval even after it has already taken effect

congressional review act begins when member of either house submits joint resolution of disapproval unlike some expedited procedure statutes the act does not provide that the joint resolution be introduced either automatically or by specified members or at any specified time except that it must be during the 60day initiation period if the resolution is to qualify for consideration under the terms of the act if members wish to see given regulation disapproved disapproval resolution need be submitted in practice because the prescribed information is provided to committees of jurisdiction or their leaders it is leaders or other members of the committee who may be most likely to submit disapproval resolution in each house any disapproval resolution submitted is to be referred to the committee or committees with jurisdiction 27 this step is consistent with the regular procedure in each chamber and will presumably take place in accordance with normal practice house resolutions may be referred to primary committee and also to additional committees with jurisdictional interests in the matter the rule addresses senate referrals will normally be to the committee whose jurisdiction predominates in the subject matter g8g152g155g150g561g152g143g561g6g146g156g138g153g153g155g152g159g138g149g561g20g142g156g152g149g158g157g146g152g151g156g561 to be eligible for consideration under the expedite d procedures of the congressional review act disapproval resolution must follow narrowly prescribed form the text may only identify the subject of the rule and the agency submitting it and state that congress disapproves the rule and that it shall have force or effect28 these provisions appear to make the procedures of the act available only for joint resolutions to disapprove submitted rule as whole so that the expedited procedures of the act could not be used to vitiate only certain provisions or portions of rule on specified subject 29 under these standards resolution whose text includes any findings or other additional provisions for example would be ineligible for consideration under the expedited procedure nevertheless the congressional review act does not specify the contents of the disapproval resolutions it governs as precisely as do some other expedited procedure statutes for example although the act stipulates the form of language for disapproval resolution it does not specify the precise terms in which rule must be described as result resolutions might be submitted in each chamber proposing to disapprove the same rule in different terms raising the possibility that disapproval resolutions initially approved in the two chambers might not be identical in the 107 th congress for example sjres 6 proposed to disapprove the rule submitted by the department of labor relating to ergonomics published at 65 federal register 68261 2000 while the house companion measure hjres 35 proposed to disapprove the rule submitted by the occupational safety and health administration on november 14 2000 65 federal register 68261 et seq relating to ergonomics 27 5 usc section 802b 28 5 usc section 802a 29 see rosenberg congressional review of agency

contain preamble preambles are uncommon in modern congressional practice and when resolution includes them they are often routinely stricken out at the conclusion of floor proceedings yet if either house did adopt disapproval resolution with preamble the resolution might again fail to be identical with companion measure from the other house similar problems might arise in any case in which the two houses adopted resolutions disapproving the same rule but with different texts as described later for example the congressional review act prohibits amendment of disapproval resolution only in the senate in any case of this kind measure could go forward to the president until both houses had agreed on single version housesenate conference or other process for reaching this agreement might be unable to conclude within the time constraints of the expedited procedure or at all many expedited procedures attempt to prevent this situation from arising either by prescribing the precise form of the measures covered by forbidding amendment to those measures or both the act deals with this potential problem instead by the way it regulates the process sometimes called the hookup by which single vehicle is selected for further action after each house has initially adopted its own measure in addition however these problems are at bottom procedural and technical rather than substantive and could usually be easily overcome if majorities in both chambers wished to disapprove rule for example members might often prevent problems of this kind from arising by informally coordinating their efforts so as to ensure that disapproval resolutions submitted in each house would share the same text if disapproval resolution did not meet the cont ent requirements of the act or if it were not submitted during the initiation period congress could still consider it under its ordinary procedures if such resolution were enacted it would presumably suffice to put the regulation disapproved out of effect this action however apparently would not preclude the issuing agency from proposing new rule that is substantially the same as the disapproved one the act applies this prohibition only if the disapproval resolution both conforms to the content requirements specified by the act and was submitted during the initiation period for this prohibition to apply on the other hand the terms of the act do not appear to require that the senate has considered the disapproval resolution either under the expedited procedures or during the action period 30

procedures expedited procedure statutes more typically provide that after specified time period either the committee is automatically discharged or motion to discharge it is privileged meaning that the motion could be offered on the floor by any senator and would not be debatable by requiring the joint action of 30 senators the congressional review act makes discharge somewhat more difficult ensuring that it can occur only for disapproval resolution that has significant senate support at least in some cases these features of the expedited procedure may leave the committee little time to act on the disapproval resolution for example perhaps senator may wish to introduce the resolution until after the senate receives the gao report on the rule but this report may not arrive until 15 calendar days after the rule is submitted while the discharge procedure will become available after 20 calendar days the committee might then have 5 calendar days or fewer to take up the resolution before it could be subjected to discharge if disapproval resolution is submitted until the discharge procedure has already become available the motion might be offered even more closely after submission of the resolution if the committee of jurisdiction favors the disapproval resolution it may mark up and report the measure before the discharge procedure becomes available it may also do so thereafter as long as the discharge procedure has not yet been used once the committee reports it can longer be discharged but the resolution goes to the calendar and motion to proceed to its consideration can be offered the congressional review act does not expressly forbid consideration of amendments in committee but it does prohibit amendments on the senate floor committee can only recommend amendments which become part of the measure only if adopted on the floor because the statute precludes the adoption of amendments on the floor any recommended by the committee will be moot for this reason the committee will in practice find little purpose in acting on amendments to disapproval resolution and its markup will presumably consist only of consideration the committee might circumvent this restriction by reporting an amended version of the disapproval resolution as an original measure in lieu of the resolution referred if the text of this new measure met the statutory requirements for disapproval resolution and the committee acted before expiration of the initiation period the measure would presumably be eligible for expedited consideration under the congressional review act at the same time however the resolution initially submitted not having been reported would presumably also remain subject to the expedited discharge procedure of the act

of this special provision in the expedited procedure has the effect of waiving these layover requirements the motion to consider is normally reserved to the majority leader to whom the senate in practice accords responsibility for arranging the floor agenda nevertheless by including the motion explicitly in the expedited procedure the act emphasizes that the senate in principle has means of calling up the disapproval resolution matter what position the committee or leadership take on it as with any other measure of course disapproval resolution could also be brought up for consideration by unanimous consent which would usually be obtained by the majority leader several provisions of the expedited procedure protect against various potential obstacles to the senates ability to take up disapproval resolution some of these help ensure that the senate will be able to vote on motion to proceed once the motion is pending by prohibiting motion to postpone its consideration motion to amend it though senate rules generally prohibit amendment of motions to proceed anyway or motion to proceed to consider some other business which would displace the first motion to proceed any points of order that might be raised against the measure or its consideration are waived as well 33 finally if the motion to proceed is adopted motion to reconsider that action is prohibited the congressional review act omits one other provision that appears in many expedited procedures for taking up resolutions of disapproval the act does not explicitly make the disapproval resolution privileged it is established senate practice that motion to proceed to consider matter is debatable and therefore subject to filibuster unless the matter in question is privileged senate precedents however indicate that if statute establishes time limit for the consideration of specified measure the provision has the effect of rendering the measure privileged so that motion to proceed to its consideration is not debatable consistent with this principle the senate has treated motion to consider disapproval resolution under the congressional review act as not debatable even though the act does not explicitly bar debate 34 g8g149g152g152g155g561g5g152g151g156g146g141g142g155g138g157g146g152g151g561g146g151g561g157g145g142g561g21g142g151g138g157g142g561 after the senate takes up the disapproval resolution itself further series of provisions protects the ability of the body to continue and complete that consideration first once the motion to proceed is adopted the resolution becomes the unfinished business of the senate until disposed of and motions to proceed to consider other business or to postpone consideration of the resolution are prohibited 35 under these conditions other business may interrupt consideration of 33 the act does not make explicit whether the waiver of points of order would apply against point of order that resolution fails to meet the requirements for consideration under the expedited procedure 34 motion to proceedsjres 6 proceedings in the senate congressional record daily edition vol 147 march 6 2001 p s1831 35 5 usc section

consent if the senate does turn to other business by unanimous consent the disapproval resolution automatically recurs as pending after the interruption unless the unanimous consent agreement provides that the other business displace the disapproval resolution as the unfinished business second it is not in order in the senate under the act to move to amend or recommit the disapproval resolution the senate sometimes uses the motion to recommit in such way as to effect an amendment these provisions therefore help to ensure that the senate disapproval resolution will remain identical at least in substantive effect to any house joint resolution disapproving the same rule this identity could be destroyed by house action on its own measure however inasmuch as the act includes prohibition against house amendment of the measure during committee or floor consideration also some expedited procedures explicitly prohibit the senate from suspending prohibition on amendment by unanimous consent but such additional safeguard appears in the congressional review act third senate debate on the resolution is limited to 10 hours equally divided between supporters and opponents so that filibuster is possible on the resolution itself in addition the act provides that motion may be offered to limit the time for debate further and this motion itself is not debatable any appeal from ruling of the chair during consideration of disapproval resolution or motion to proceed to its consideration also is to be decided without debate 36 this prohibition further inhibits any potential use of appeals for dilatory purposes though this use is already constrained by the overall cap on debate time on the other hand to forbid appeals altogether would have tended to prevent the senate from exercising its constitutional authority to determine its own rules finally the act provides that at the conclusion of debate the senate automatically proceeds to vote on the resolution intervening action is permitted except that one quorum call may take place if any senator so requests37 this quorum call is not required if not requested the senate is to proceed immediately to vote absent this pr ovision however it might become impossible to stop the senate from disposing of disapproval resolution quickly by voice vote when few senators were on the floor it might also become impossible to secure roll call vote under these conditions because not enough senators might be on the floor to second demand for one on the other hand if the act did not prohibit other intervening actions at this point those actions might be used for dilatory purposes for example opponents might delay vote by offering and obtaining roll call votes on motions to table the resolution and to adjourn

measure but instead on the resolution already received from the other house in this way both houses take final action on the same measure if both adopt it the requirements for presentation to the president are satisfied38 unlike the components of the expedited procedure that apply to senate consideration alone these provisions govern action whether or not the action period has expired in one respect these proceedings reflect normal practice in both houses for carrying out hookup between corresponding house and senate measures normally each house initially considers its own measure but the house that acts second then takes up and passes the corresponding measure already received from the other if the two measures are not identical the house acting second normally amends the measure received from the other with the text of its own measure this action enables the two houses to proceed by conference or otherwise to resolve the differences between these two versions of the same measure the expedited procedure of the congressional review act avoids this necessity by requiring one chamber to vote directly on the measure received from the other without amending it it appears that these provisions of the act would apply even if the texts of the two measures are not identical as long as the chair could determine that both would disapprove the same rule and that they therefore corresponded to each other for purposes of the statutory procedure in this way even if the two houses initially consider disapproval resolutions with differing texts both will ultimately vote on the same text namely that approved by whichever house acted first this mechanism helps to prevent any delay that might arise if the house and senate could not agree on final text through conference or amendments between the houses g24g142g157g152g142g156g561g138g151g141g561g17g159g142g155g155g146g141g142g561g3g157g157g142g150g153g157g156g561 if both chambers adopt disapproval resolution the president might normally be expected to veto it because if his views were not favorable to the regulation in question the agency would probably not have submitted it to congress in the first place this consideration however may not apply in situations in which the president under whose administration the rule was submitted has been succeeded by another who takes contrary view of the regulatory issue in question congressional action on the ergonomics regulation in the 107 th congress exemplified such situation except for the additional 30day waiting period already described however the congressional review act provides expedited procedure fo r overriding veto consideration of veto messages is generally considered privileged in both chambers pursuant to the requirements of the constitution the procedures of neither house however require vote on whether to override in the senate an attempt to reach such vote might be delayed or blocked by filibuster in other respects the normal procedures of each house pr obably would suffice to allow majority that wished an override vote to secure one 38 5 usc section 802f

procedures of the cong ressional review act eliminate many of the constraints on action inherent in the normal legislative process the act lacks certain provisions found in many expedited procedure statutes as the preceding discussion shows these omissions in certain respects limit the ability the act confers on congress to enact the disapproval resolutions for which it provides these limitations may in practice present little obstacle to successful action nevertheless determining how the act may most effectively be used may require taking them into account among the special features described in the preceding sections three appear potentially the most noteworthy in this connection

the expedited procedure in the act covers committee and floor consideration of disapproval resolutions only in the senate committee and floor consideration in the house of representatives is to occur under its regular legislative procedures the act provides special mechanisms to help ensure that the house can complete action in mitigation of this potential obstacle the house possesses wellestablished general means to expedite the consideration of measures which can readily be used for disapprovals under the congressional review act if the leadership and the pertinent committee are supportive specifically the house might likely consider disapproval resolution pursuant to the terms of special rule special rule is house resolution which the committee on rules has jurisdiction to

resolution of disapproval like any other proposed law may be enacted only through being presented to the president for approval if congress passes joint resolution disapproving particular rule president who favors the rule can veto the measure in that case the rule will take effect unless twothirds vote in each house overrides the veto 39 experience shows that particular circumstances may arise under which this requirement may present little obstacle to congressional action if in the interim between promulgation of the rule and congressional action new administration unsympathetic to the rule assumes office any disapproval resolution may not likely be vetoed in the first place congressional disapproval in 2001 of the ergonomics regulation proposed by the clinton administration in the previous year illustrates this situation at that time substantial congressional interest was expressed in using the congressional review act to disapprove numerous other rules promulgated in the last months of the clinton administration as well although this interest did not result in other legislative action 39 rosenberg congressional review of agency rulemaking pp 910

makes it substantively dissimilar from the other or otherwise ineligible for consideration under the expedited procedures for final action or that each house will take initial action on disapproval resolution of its own each of these possibilities might present different kind of difficulty for achieving final enactment in practice however each kind of difficulty could likely be readily overcome when majorities in both houses are supportive of the disapproval effort under most circumstances coordination of disapproval efforts between the two houses could suffice to avoid potential problems

explicit in making its mechanism for expedited disapproval applicable only to rule as whole disapproval resolution amended in this way would apparently cease to fulfill the requirements for disapproval resolution to be eligible for the expedited procedure when rece ived in the other house the amended resolution would then fail to qualify for the automatic hookup for which the act provides instead the second house could refer it to committee which might either report it with or without amendment or take action and effectively kill the measure alternatively the second house could use its regular procedures either to consider the amended resolution it received or to consider measure of its own that it could then hook up with the one received the easiest way for supporters of disapproval to deal with this difficulty however would be to forestall its arising by preventing or defeating any amendment that would have this effect

act also affords procedure pursuant to which either house could take up and adopt disapproval resolution from the other except after first considering one of its own therefore if disapproval resolution is submitted only in one house none can be enacted under the expedited procedure the house in which the resolution was submitted could adopt it and send it to the other the receiving house however could not act on the received resolution under the expedited procedure because that procedure provides for such action only after the receiving house first considers its own measure the same difficulty could arise when disapproval resolutions are introduced in both houses if in the house of representatives none is reported or one is reported but not considered on the floor because the congressional review act provides expedited committee or floor procedure in the house supporters of the disapproval resolution could not discharge the house committee or bring the measure to the house floor except under the general rules which normally leave control in the hands of the committee and leadership therefore the procedure in the act would still offer means to bring the house to the point at which it could consider companion resolution received from the senate this situation could be most readily forestalled if supporters of the disapproval effort ensure the submission as well as consideration and adoptio n of corresponding disapproval resolutions in both houses also however whether or not co mpanion measure had been submitted in the receiving house and whether or not the committee of referral in that house had reported the measure or had been discharged from considering it it would still be possible for the receiving house to act under its regular procedures on the measure received from the other and held at the desk in the 107 th congress the house of representatives took action in this way on sjres 6 disapproving the ergonomics rule while its companion measure hjres 35 remained in committee in the house nevertheless this end too could normally be achieved only with cooperation from the leadership in the senate considering the house measure without the constraints of the expedited procedure would mean that it could be filibustered finally the enactment of disapproval resolution would have the same effect whether it had been considered under the expedited procedure provided by the act or otherwise as long as the resolution had been submitted during the initiation period and satisfied the description provided
