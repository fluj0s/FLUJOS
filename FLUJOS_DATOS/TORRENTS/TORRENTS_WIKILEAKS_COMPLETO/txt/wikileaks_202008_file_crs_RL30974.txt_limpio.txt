already here updated august 19 2002 linda levine specialist in labor economics domestic social policy division congressional research service the library of congress shortage of registered nurses is it on the horizon or already here summary labor shortages in various occupations and industries were reported during the late stages of the nations longest economic expansion which ended in early 2001 the unemployment rate in some fields eg nursing has remained virtually unchanged despite the advent of the recession which suggests that there are factors unrelated to the business cycle affecting them for example the increasing longevity and wealth of the population combined with growing share of elderly persons are putting added pressure on the health care delivery system and these trends are expected to continue moreover although women continue to account for the majority of workers in many health care occupations their career opportunities have widened over time and among women who already are licensed rns many are expected to retire in the nottoodistant future while others have chosen to work in nonnursing occupations thus health care providers who previously might have thought their supply of labor was fairly well assured must now compete for the interest of students based on nursings attractiveness visavis other occupations they also could become more concerned about retaining their aging rn workforce and about appealing to licensed rns who are otherwise employed during the mid1990s however earnings growth among rns slowed compared to earlier in the decade and their wage increases were smaller than those of all professional workers this could partly explain the drop in nursing program graduates that began in the 19951996 academic year and the greater share of rns not employed in nursing in 2000 as compared to 1992 and 1996 trends such as these underlie the supply and demand projections for rns released by the us health resources and services administration hrsa while the agencys own 1996 projections and those of analysts based in part on them strongly suggested the likelihood of shortage of rns beginning in 2007 or shortly thereafter hrsas july 2002 projections push forward the overall rn shortage to 2000 if current trends continue and ameliorative actions are not taken hrsa projects that the aggregate shortfall could worsen at an accelerating rate from 6 in 2000 to 12 by 2010 then rising to 20 by 2015 and climbing to 29 by 2020 not all states currently are sharing in the rn shortage nor are those with shortages sharing equally according to hrsas latest projections thirty states were estimated to have shortfall of fulltime equivalent fte rns in 2000 and the severity of shortages varied widely from under 4 in iowa minnesota and oregon to at least 13 in arizona new jersey and tennessee by 2005 perhaps seven states alabama florida idaho maryland north dakota oklahoma and wyoming could experience shortage as well another three states by 2010 illinois michigan and south carolina and seven more by 2015 louisiana minnesota montana north carolina south dakota west virginia and wisconsin could have an inadequate supply if mississippi moves into shortage situation by 2020 just six states might remain with more fte rns than are demanded hawaii iowa kansas kentucky ohio and vermont contents who are we talking about 2

occupations eg computer systems analysts and in various industries eg construction were reported few years before recession began in march 2001 it is not unusual for employers to have difficulty hiring and retaining employees after the economy has been expanding for quite some time and the nation experienced the longest period without recession in us history from march 1991 to march 2001 what makes the current situation different however is that the unemployment rate at the peak of the latest economic expansion was lower than at many of the prior cyclical peaks and the rate since the recession began remains low compared to many other recessions1 in other words the labor market was and continues to be tight by historical standards in certain occupations and industries for example the unemployment rate in 2001 among workers who had been employed as registered nurses rns was 10 compared to the average for all professional workers of 222 perhaps not surprisingly then reports have continued to appear about hospitals and nursing homes in various areas of the country having difficulty hiring enough rns to fill their numerous vacant positions there thus appear to be factors unrelated to the business cycle that are affecting the labor markets of certain industries and occupations the increasing longevity of the population combined with growing share of elderly persons have been putting added pressure on the nations health care delivery system3 and the implications of inadequate staffing among health care workers differ from those of other workers in many industries for example dearth of bluecollar assemblers and fabricators might mean that consumers have fewer cars to choose from while scarcity of health 1 in march 2001 the unemployment rate was 43 the

opportunities have widened over the years thus health care providers who previously might have thought their supply of labor was fairly well assured must now compete with other fields for the interest of students the largest traditionally femaledominated health care occupation is registered nurses rns it has been asserted that there is an ongoing nationwide shortage of rns of various kinds ranging from new nursing program graduates to already employed rns with general skills to nurses with experience working in hospital specialty care units and in various sectors of the health care services industry including hospitals home health and nursing homes before the latest mid2002 release of supplydemand projections from the us health resources and services administration hrsa it was estimated based in whole or part on 1996 hrsa projections that there would likely be shortage of rns in 2007 or shortly thereafter this report first will analyze recent trends in the rn labor market and then examine hrsas new projections which moved up the date of an rn shortage to 2000 who are we talking about the exact nature of rns daily duties usually depends on the setting in which they work6 in hospitals staff rns typically provide bedside nursing care and carry out medical regimens they often supervise licensed practical nurses lpns and aides nurses who work in physicians offices usually prepare patients for exams and help doctors perform them give injections apply dressings and sometimes keep the offices records nursing home rns largely perform administrative and supervisory functions they also may evaluate the health of residents and work up treatment plans as well as perform difficult procedures home health nurses provide services in the homes of patients they often work independently but also supervise home health aides government and private agencies schools senior citizen centers and other communitybased organizations employ public health nurses 4 joint

industrial nurses work at firms that engage them to provide limited medical care in addition to providing emergency assistance and writing up accident reports these rns offer health counseling help with injections and assess work environments for potential healthsafety problems head nurses or nurse supervisors perform such administrative and supervisory functions as creating work schedules for and assigning duties to nurses and aides providing or arranging for training and visiting patients to observe nurses and to ensure the proper delivery of care nurse practitioners provide primary health care ie prescribe medication and otherwise diagnose and treat common acute illnesses and injuries other advanced practice nurses include clinical nurse specialists certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives they all must fulfill higher educational and clinical experience requirements than those established for the aforementioned groups basic nursing education in all states consists of graduation from nursing program and passing national licensing exam hospitals offer diploma programs which take 23 years to complete although 60 of rns in 1980 graduated from diploma programs the share who received their basic nursing education from this source was halved to 30 by 20007 community colleges offer associate degrees in nursing adns which take about 2 years to complete in 2000 they accounted for 40 of registered nurses about twice their share of 19 in 1980 colleges and universities offer bachelors degrees in nursing bsns which take 4 or 5 years to complete the share of rns who initially earned bsns also rose considerably from 17 in 1980 to 29 in 2000 in addition to classroom instruction nursing students must have supervised clinical experience in hospitals nursing homes home health agencies or other health care facilities trends in the rn labor market direct measure of occupational labor shortage exists analysts therefore use variety of indicators to assess supplydemand conditions the unemployment rate is perhaps the bestknown example of such an indicator but relying on just one indicator can still lead to an incorrect conclusion about the existence of labor shortage8 other often used indicators that the government has regularly collected 7 us department of health and human services health resources and services administration the registered nurse population findings from the national sample survey of registered nurses march 2000 july 2002 available at httpwwwbhpr hrsagovhealthworkforcereportsrnsurveydefaulthtm hereafter cited as hrsa the registered nurse population 8 cohen malcolm s labor shortages as america approaches the twentyfirst century continued crs4 and that have used consistent definitions over time include earnings and employment9 the experienced unemployment rate as shown in table 1 the share of experienced rns without jobs has been very low for quite some time and has remained below the rate for professional workers in general the larger occupational group in which rns are classified in the late stages of the economic expansion however the unemployment rate of rns dropped to levels last seen in the 19891992 period when there last was concern about nursing shortage at that time the situation prompted passage of the nursing shortage reduction and education extension act and implementation of the immigration nursing relief act of 1989 soon after reports of shortages however the overall economic picture began to change the hospital industry responded by increasing overtime work retention and recruitment efforts and nursing wages as well as restructuring work to utilize nursing aides and licensed practical nurses among others in lieu of rns10 these measures succeeded in increasing the supply of rns by among other things enticing more students to enter the field the number of graduates from nursing degree programs climbed sharply by 574 or 35392 graduates from the 1989 1990 academic year to the 19941995 academic year11 in addition the share of rns who maintained their licenses but were not employed in nursing dropped from 200 8 continued ann arbor university of michigan press 1995 p 25 9 the government does not have data series on occupational vacancies and like the other indicators vacancies in themselves are an insufficient measure of labor shortage an occupation could have both high unemployment rate which suggests excess supply and high vacancy rate which suggests excess demand if employers and workers find it difficult to make matches due to the different locations of job openings and of workers the same situation also could indicate skill mismatch rather than shortage per if for example hospitals want to fill vacancies with rns having experience in specialty care units rather than with new rn graduates high vacancy rate would be more suggestive of supply problem if employers could not fill openings quickly but surveys do not appear to always ask about the duration of openings high vacancy rate also would be more suggestive of shortage if information were provided showing that the unfilled jobs offered salaries that were sufficiently competitive to attract any available workers eg licensed rns employed in other occupations in addition as the us general accounting office nursing workforce emerging nurse shortages due to multiple factors gao01944 july 2001 noted one should be cautious when comparing different studies vacancy rates because they may not all calculate rates in the same way 10 veneri carolyn m can occupational

health workforce personnel factbook crs5 in 1988 to 173 in 1992 and remained at that level in 1996 which suggests that these measures prompted some rns to return to the occupation12 consequently reports of nursing shortage petered out early in the 1990s unlike the earlier episode of seeming shortage health care providers already have increased their use of overtime to the point where it has drawn the ire of many rns and their representatives some states have introduced or passed legislation to curb its use13 in addition the change in economic conditions between 2000 and 2001 does not appear to have improved the availability of rns relative to demand despite the advent of the latest recession in march 2001 the experienced unemployment rate among rns remained virtually unchanged from its 2000 level however employers seemingly have not raised rn earnings in the last few years to the same extent they did during the late 1980searly 1990s see below wage increases between 1989 and 1993 fulltime rns median weekly wages increased more than those of all professional employees 207 and 160 respectively as shown in table 1 hrsa estimated that fulltime rns increased their average annual earnings to an even greater degree namely by onethird from 28383 in 1988 to 37738 in 199214 the pattern reversed through 1997 as can be seen in the bls data contained in table 1 hrsas data also reveal slowdown in rn average earnings growth to 115 between 1992 37738 and 1996 42071 the reversal has been partly ascribed to the development and spread of managed care an arrangement used to control the use and hence the cost of health services provided to enrollees in many health plans15 12 hrsa preliminary findings from the national sample survey of registered nurses march 2000 february

earnings cover wage and salary workers employed fulltime the relatively slower wage growth among rns in the mid1990s could partly explain the drop in graduations from nursing degree programs that began in the 1995 1996 academic year16 it also could account for the increased share of rns not employed in nursing rns who were not employed in nursing rose from 173 in 1992 and 1996 to 183 in 200017

17 hrsa national sample survey of registered nurses crs7 compared to their own rate of increase during the 19931997 period 33 unlike the bls wage series shown in table 1 hrsas data do not show similar acceleration in wage growth from the mid1990s the average annual pay of fulltime rns increased by 112 between 1996 42071 and 2000 46782 or by virtually the same rate 115 as between 1992 and 1996 both wage series show smaller earnings increase in recent years compared to the last time their was tight labor market for rns as shown in table 1 employers raised rns wages in the 19972001 period 168 by less than they did in the 19891993 period 207 similarly hrsas surveys provide estimates of relatively smaller earnings growth between 1996 and 2000 112 than between 1988 and 1992 329 however some assert that as result of the introduction and spread of cost containment measures in the health care industry providers are less financially able today than they were in the past to deal with labor shortage by raising the wages of rns or by hiring more rns directly or through temporary agencies18 the efficacy of higher wages at increasing the supply of already employed rns relative to demand as measured by their number of work hours is open to question according to survey that was administered to nurses who became licensed in new york state in 1999 40 said they would be willing to work more hours if offered higher salary another 44 indicated that there were factors other than higher salaries that would motivate them to put in longer hours ie flexible hours speciality of choice different shift or hours and other conditions while 160 stated that they would not be willing to do so under any conditions19 the objection of nurse advocates to hospitals current use of mandatory overtime to cope with dearth of staff may reflect the unwillingness of arguably overburdened rns to work more hours or to continue in nursing under the present state of working conditions in part because fatigue might compromise the quality of care being rendered20 employment growth between 1989 and 1994 job growth among rns occurred much more rapidly than across all professionals 223 and 128 respectively see

federation of nurses and health professionals the nurse shortage perspectives from current direct care nurses and former direct care nurses april 2001 crs8 1995 and 2001 however relative employment growth among rns 94 lagged employment growth among all professionals 189 the slowdown in rn job growth in the last several years appears to be at least partly related to the spread of managed care across the nation21 the diminished rate of growth has been concentrated in hospitals although there are indications that the rn job creation rate in the home health industry has decreased as well medicares implementation of prospective payment system for the home health care industry places new economic pressure on providers and reinforces the slowing effect of managed care22 the nature of the demand for rns by work setting and by geographic area also could have tempered the occupations aggregate rate of employment growth accounts of an undersupply of rns often have related to particular settings eg hospital emergency rooms and to particular parts of the country in addition certain health care facilities eg nursing homes may be experiencing more difficulty than others in attracting adequate staff in part resulting from differences in the salaries offered to rns23 the labor market indicators just discussed do not conclusively support the existence of an acrosstheboard shortage of rns in the past few years however national data are not sufficiently sensitive to identify maldistribution of rns across geographic areas and by kinds of rns and health care workplaces eg new nursing school graduates versus nurses with experience in hospital emergency rooms or neonatal care units as opposed to shortage of labor per projected demand for rns the demand for labor can increase for two reasons when consumers want more of an industrys goods or services firms may add employees to their payrolls this is the job creation discussed immediately below hiring also may increase if firms employees leave to take positions at other employers or exit the labor force to return to school or due to retirement disability or death replacement needs discussed shortly may increase the demand for labor well beyond that induced by employment growth future rn job growth hospitals are likely to continue to employ the majority of rns in future years albeit decreasing share as hrsa reported in 2002 the number of fulltime equivalent fte rns estimated to have worked in hospitals in 2000 was 1242831 21 schumacher the earnings and employment of nurses 22 buerhaus and staiger trouble in the nurse labor market p 221 23 for more information see american health care association staffing of nursing services in long term care present issues and prospects for the future february 2001 crs9 the projection for 2010 is 145108324 according to the bls the number of rns employed parttime and fulltime in hospitals in 2000 was 1274031 the projection for 2010 is 146583125 see table 2 rn employment in hospitals is projected to grow slowly between 150 and 168 compared to rn employment in other settings because activities once performed on an inpatient basis increasingly are being performed on an outpatient basis either in hospitals or elsewhere and because patients are being discharged earlier despite the assumption that the number of inpatients will not grow much the intensity of nursing care is likely to increase requiring more nurses per patient26 the ranks of rns already employed in large numbers at other work settings are expected to expand substantially this appears to be particularly the case for rns employed in workplaces that largely serve the elderly for example employment of nurses in the home health sector is projected to increase by 363 between 2000 and 2010 from 130288 to 177583 ftes similarly rns employed at nursing homes are projected to increase by 324 from 168529 to 223193 ftes27 the preference of people to be cared for in their homes new technologies that permit complex treatments to be performed at home the growing number of older persons with functional disabilities many of whom will require longterm care and the financial pressure on hospitals to quickly discharge patients who may require further care in nursing homes or other treatment facilities contribute to these disparate projected trends in rn employment by work setting28 across the entire health care industry the rate of employment growth between 2000 and 2010 that bls projects among rns 256 is even greater than that of hrsa 172 see table 2 demand for rns through 2010

2010 monthly labor review november 2001 hereafter cited as hecker occupational employment projections crs11 employer of rns could be among the industries most affected by this demographic phenomenon because the proportion of nurses at least 45 years old is greater than the average proportion across all occupations30 the average age of rns employed in nursing in 2000 was 433 years with 455 age 45 and older31 of the one million total job openings projected for rns through 2010 44 could arise through the need to replace workers who exit the occupation rather than through employment growth32 not all job openings are created by individuals who leave an occupation for retirement however rns for example most frequently indicated in hrsa survey that they were employed in occupations other than nursing because the positions provided more convenient hours 457 were more rewarding professionally 449 or currently offered better salaries 35433 projected supply of rns it usually is more difficult to estimate occupational labor supply than demand the supply of new workers to nursing can be estimated more easily than the supply to many other occupations where college major is less determinative of the field into which the student will go or where formal education or training beyond high school typically is required by focusing just on graduations from programs that offer nursing degrees the supply of new rns could well be understated because the availability of nurses from abroad who can enter the country permanently or as temporary workers34 would be omitted in order to develop the best possible estimate of the prospective total supply of labor to rn jobs leavers ie rns who take jobs in other occupations or who exit the labor force for such reasons as retirement or disability also must be taken into account in addition to the previously described demand projections released in 2002 hrsa developed new supply projections they are the basis for much of the following discussion the

workforce in the shortrun baccalaureate enrollment did increase between 2000 and 2001 however it takes longer for these students to become licensed rns compared to those in diploma and associate degree programs if bsn graduates continue to account for growing share of all nursing graduates their lengthier preparation time effectively could dampen growth in the supply of rns36 the total supply of rns hrsa projected the supply of graduates from basic nursing education programs by taking into account such factors as job availability and the attractiveness of nursing as career both of which would likely influence students decisions about their choice of occupations in the future other variables included were the female population of nursing students by age and the share of female high school graduates enrolling in college in addition estimates of leavers were derived by taking into consideration such things as deaths among white women and nurses who fail to renew their licenses then to estimate the total supply of rns activity rates were developed based on the proportion of rns by age group that was employed in nursing in march 2000 according to the national sample of registered nurses finally the count of individuals was transformed into ftes based on data from the same source about the pattern of fulltime and parttime employment and the number of scheduled hours per nurse as shown in table 3 the total supply of fte rns is projected to increase between 2000 and 2011 the rate of growth is expected to fall off during this period with the decline particularly steep after 2005 when an especially large number of babyboom rns will start reaching 55 years of age an age at which rns have historically begun to reduce their labor participation37 the 36 projected decrease in the supply of rns from its peak in 2011 to 2020 might bring the total below its 2005 level 35 hrsa projected supply demand and shortages of registered nurses 36 ibid 37 minnick ann f

taken the number of states experiencing shortages is projected to increase and leave just few without an rn shortage by 2020 national projections as shown in table 4 nationwide demand for rns was estimated to have exceeded supply in 2000 the 55 shortfall is projected to worsen at an accelerating rate through 2020 by which time there might be 288 fewer fte rns than demanded by employers this

for rns throughout the 20 year projection period and decreasing supply during its latter half the estimated decline in rn supply distinguishes the current shortage from the tight rn labor market of the late 1980searly 1990s which was demandbased41 working women recently have had wider range of job opportunities open to them and consequently have been less prone to choose career in nursing for example women who graduated from high school in the 1990s were estimated to be 3040 less likely to enter the nursing profession than those who graduated 20 years earlier conversely women have shown an increased interest in traditionally maledominated occupations eg doctors or dentists42 because the supply side of the equation appears to be largely driving the shortage it may not be easily or quickly undone employers can be expected to try to correct the supplydemand imbalance by further increasing nurses wages assigning some duties now performed by rns to paraprofessional nursing personnel and utilizing additional productivityenhancing technology these remedies were used successfully in the past when rns were scarce relative to demand but the earlier situations were not marked by an aging rn labor force with the attendant need to replace many retiring nurses at about the same time older babyboomers will make greater demands on the nations health care delivery system43 while raising relative wages improving working conditions upgrading the occupations image and lowering education costs to promote recruitment may encourage more students to become rns these changes could take some time to make themselves felt and their effects could be dampened by the alternative career paths now open to women another means of bringing more workers into the field is through immigration however eliminating the shortage would require immigration on an unprecedented scale44 and as happened when the 105th and 106th congresses increased the number of h1b visas for professionalspecialty workers the policy could prove to be controversial one state projections not all states may now be experiencing shortage of rns according to hrsas latest projections the
