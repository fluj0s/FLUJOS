securing air cargo summary the air cargo system is complex multifaceted network that handles vast amount of freight express packages and ma il carried aboard pa ssenger and allcargo aircraft the air cargo system is vulnera ble to several security risks including potential plots to place explosives aboard aircraft illegal sh ipments of hazardous materials criminal activities such as smuggling and theft and potential hijackings and sabotage by persons with access to airc raft several proce dural and technology based initiatives to enhance air cargo security and deter terrorist and criminal threats have been put in place or are under cons ideration procedural initiatives include industrywide consolidation of the known shipper program increased cargo inspections increased physical security of air cargo facilities increased oversight of air cargo operations security training for cargo workers stricter controls over access to cargo aircraft and air cargo operations areas improved tracking of cargo shipments along the entire supply chain and expanded use of explosives tection canine teams for inspecting air cargo shipments technol ogy being considered to improve air cargo security includes tamperresi stant and tamperevident packaging and containers explosive detection technologies adapted fo r use in the air cargo environment blast resistant cargo containers and aircraft hardening and biometric systems for worker identification and access control the aviation and transportation securi ty act atsa pl 10771 contains general provisions for cargo screening inspection and security measures cargo carried in passenger airplanes must be screened or its security otherwise ensured in practice the transportation security ad ministration tsa has relied heavily on known shipper protocols to prevent sh ipments of cargo from unknown sources on passenger aircraft atsa so mandated development of security plan for allcargo operations the tsas air cargo security pl an has focused on riskbased methods for assessing cargo shipments and targe ting physical inspections the national intelligence reform act of 2004 pl 108458 included provisions establishing pilot program for evaluating the deployment of blastresistant cargo containers promoting the research development and ployment of enhanced air cargo security technology evaluating international air cargo threats and finalizing operational regulations of air cargo security those regulations finalized by the tsa in 2006 require use of an industrywide known sh ipper database back ground check s of air cargo workers and enhanced security m easures at air cargo operations areas in addition to these measures congress has pr ovided appropriations to hire more canine teams and cargo inspectors to step up cargo screening and regulatory inspections appropriations legislation over the past four years has called for continued increases to the amounts of air cargo placed on passenger airplanes that is physically screened the implementing recommenda tions of the 911 commission act of 2007 pl 11053 requires the dhs to establis h system to physically screen 100 of all air cargo within three years with

transportation aviation security background and policy options for screening and securing air cargo overview of the air cargo system the air cargo system is complex multifaceted network responsible for moving vast amount of freight express packages and mail carried aboard passenger and allcargo aircraft the air cargo system consists of large complex distribution network linking manufacturers and shippers to freight forwarders and then on to airport sorting and cargo handling facilities where shipments are loaded and unloaded from aircraft business and consumer demand for the fast and efficient shipment of goods has fueled rapid growth in the air cargo industry over the past 25 years in fy2006 about 105 million tons of freight cargo were shipped by air within the united states and another 85 million tons were shipped on in ternational flights to and from the united states on both passenger and allcargo aircraft1 in addition to this over half million tons of mail was carried on aircraft roughly 460000 tons on domestic flights and 140000 tons on intern ational flights to and from the united states the combined weight of freight and mail enplaned on domestic and international flights from 2003 through 2006 is shown in figure 1 since 1980 the growth in freight mileage for air cargo measured in terms of tonmiles transported on an annual basis has far outpaced growth in any other transportation mode2 while domestic growth in the volume of air cargo shipments has been relatively and somewhat unexpectedly flat over the past few years it is estimated that domestic air cargo shipments expressed in terms of revenue ton miles rtms will continue their historic growth trends and increase another 58 by fy2020 compared to fy2006 levels intern ationally cargo shipments have seen steady growth over the past few years and are anticipated to increase 135 by fy2020 compared to fy2006 levels the volume of air cargo shipments since fy1999 and the forecast volume of air cargo

schneider terror risk cited for ca rgo carried on passenger jets 2 reports list security gaps the washington post june 10 2002in 2005 air cargo comprised about 04 by weight of all fre ight movement in the united states3 while this percentage may seem small it is much greater than the 007 percent of freight that traveled by air in 1965 indicating that not only is the volume of air cargo increasing significantly but so is the percent of total freight movements that travel by air since 1980 the freight mileage of goods shipped by air has increased by 2404 air cargo shipments also make up significant percent of the total value of cargo shipments in 2002 while air freight movements accounted for only about 03 of total domes tic freight shipments by weight these shipments accounted for 43 of the total va lue of freight shipped within the united states5 in terms of global trade air cargo accounted for 253 of the value of goods shipped to and from the united states surpassed only by maritime shipping which accounted for 435 of the importexport value of cargo in 20056 however by weight nearly 78 of imports and exports travel by water compared to just 04 by air these statistics reflect the fact that international air cargo plays major role in the transport of highvalue timesensitive lightweight imports and exports such items include consumer electronics electronic component s for industry and manufacturing flowers and other highval ue perishable foods and goods to name few examples th speed of delivery afforded by air cargo support justintime demand for such goods in global mark etplace allowing faraway manufacturing and distribution sites to rapidly deliver items to businesse s and end customers worldwide these unique characteristic of the air cargo industry are important considerations for policymakers in addressing air cargo security needs without unduly impeding the flow of commerce that travels by air particularly as the size and complexity of the air cargo system continues to expand security screening and inspections of air cargo policy debate and operational challenges given the sheer volume of cargo that mu st be expediently processed and loaded on aircraft it has been generally argued that physical screening of all air cargo using explosives detection technologies as is now required of checked passenger baggage is likely to present significant logistic and operational challenges in 2002 it was reported that tsa computer models estimated that if full physical screening of cargo were implemented only 4 of the daily volume of freight at airports could be processed due to the time that would be required to break down shipments inspect them and reassemble them for transport7 since that time considerable progress has been made to increase the amount of car go placed on passenger airliners that is subject to physical screening and inspection also the dhs has invested in severalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34390crs4 research and development initiatives to ad apt explosives screening technologies for use in the air cargo environment the results of these efforts are best described as slow evolution of increasing inspections and screening of air cargo shipments placed on passenger aircraft since 2002 coupled with some promising opportunities to further increase cargo inspections and screening through an array of various techniques and technologies this is in c ontrast to baggage sc reening which relies predominantly on single technology expl osives detection system eds as was required under the aviation and transporta tion security act atsa pl 10771 over the next few years there is likely to be more intense focus on developing and tailoring technologies nd procedures for screening and inspecting air cargo to meet mandate in the implementing recommendations of the 911 commission act of 2007 pl 11053 that requires 100 sc reening of all cargo placed on passenger aircraft by august 2010 with an interim re quirement of screening 50 of such cargo by february 2009 unlike baggage screening operations which are for the most part conducted by tsa personnel cargo insp ections and screening operations are conducted largely by employees of the air lines and freight shippers with the tsa responsible for oversight of these func tions in 2004 the national intelligence reform act of 2004 pl 108458 requ ired the tsa to pursue screening technologies and enhance secu rity procedures to improve the inspection screening and tracking of air cargo on passenger aircraft as recommended by the 911 commission since then implementing increas ed oversight and inspections of air cargo operations coupled with more string ent regulations for air cargo carriers and freight forwarders has been priority for the tsa congressional appropriators have provided increased funding for inspections screening and tracking of air cargo and fo r research developmen t and pilot testing of various explosives screening techni ques and technologies to increase the amount of air cargo that undergoes physical inspec tion while the tsa does not divulge the percentage of cargo that undergoes phy sical inspection language in the fy2005 homeland security appropriati ons act pl 108334 called for at least tripling the amount of cargo placed on passenger aircraft that was inspected at that time fy2006 appropriations language pl 10990 directed the tsa to take all possible measures including the certification procurement and deployment of screening systems to inspect and screen air cargo on passenger aircraft and increase the percentage of cargo inspected beyond the level mandate d in the fy2005 appropriations measure fy2007 appropriations language pl 109295 directs the tsa to work with industry stakeholders to velop standards and protocol s to increase the use of explosives detection equipment for screening air cargo the fy2008 omnibus appropriations act pl 110161 directed the dhs to research develop and procure new technologies to sc reen and inspect air cargo loaded on passenger aircraft and utilize existing checked baggage explosives detection equipment and screeners to the greatest extent practicable to screen air cargo until dedicated air cargo screening technologies can be developed and deployed the act requires the dhs to work with air carriers and airports to ensure that the screening of cargo carried on passenger aircraft continually increases and requires the dhs to submit quarterly reports detailing the incremental progress being made toward achieving the mandated 100 screening of cargo pl aced on passenger aircraft httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34390crs5 8 house to consider bill today requiring additional cargo screening transportation weekly january 9 2007 p 7 the mandate for 100 screening contai ned in pl 11053 requires inspection of all air cargo placed on passenger aircraft in manner that provides level of security equivalent to the screening of passenger checked baggage the legislative language specifically defines screening in this context to mean physical examination or other nonintrusive methods of assessing whether cargo poses threat to transportation security the act identifie s specific methods of screening that would be acceptable in meeting this requirement including the use of xray systems explosives detection systems explosiv trace detection tsacertified explosives detection canine teams and physical searches conducted in conjunction with manifest verifications additional methods may be approved by the tsa however the provision specifically prohibits the use of cargo documents and known shipper verification by themselves as being accepta ble screening methods in other words the provision clarifies that the screening of car go is to involve some sort of inspection process that cannot be met solely by r ecords verification of shipment contents or shipper status the language does however leave open the possibility that the tsa could implement some other nonintrusiv methods for assessing whether cargo poses risk that would not necessarily involve the use of physical screening technologies it is at this point unclear what specific approach the tsa will take to meet this mandate the tsa is required to promulgate regulations to meet these requirements and must provide justification for any exemptions to these air cargo screening requirements it may grant als the gao would be required to assess the methods used by the tsa in granting m odifying or eliminating any exemptions to these requirements the measure was gene rally opposed by various stakeholders in the air cargo industry who believe that its requirements are overly burdensome and costly8 policy considerations for securing allcargo operations while the primary policy focus of legislation to date has been on cargo carried aboard passenger aircraft air cargo security also presents challenge for allcargo operators there is some concern that he ightened security measures for passenger aircraft may make all cargo aircraft more attractive target to terrorists however unlike passenger operations where the threat from explosives introduced in air cargo represents the greatest perceived risk the gr eatest perceived risk associated with air cargo operations is the potential for an individual or individuals with access to aircraft to hijack large transport category aircraft to carry out suicide attack against ground target looking beyond aviati on security there is also broader risk that terrorists may attempt to ship w eapons including possible weapons of mass destruction into and within the united st ates using the global cargo distribution network for example various law enfo rcement and counterterrorism operations have shown how illega l sales and shipment s of various weapons such as shoulder fired missiles may be facilitated by falsified shipping documents allowing such items to potentially wind up in international and domestic air cargo shipments homeland security policies and strategies may need to further consider the potential risks that air cargo operations as well as passenger ai rlines cargo operations may be exploited to facilitate the movement of terrorist weaponshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34390crs6 9 the worlds top 50 cargo airlines air cargo world september

specifically targeted or not the long term outlook points to continued shift toward increased reliance on allcargo aircraft both domestically and in inte rnational operations since september 11 2001 variety of ai r cargo security measures have been put in place or are under consideration the primary purpose of these security measures is to mitigate 1 the potential risks associated with the contents of cargo placed on passenger as well as allcargo aircraft and 2 the risks associated with individuals given high level of access to ai rcraft to carry out cargo operations this report will examine the key security risks associated with air cargo operations and options for mitigating these risks air cargo security risks potential risks associated with air cargo shipments and operations include the possible introduction of explosives and in cendiary devices in cargo placed aboard aircraft shipment of undeclared or undetect ed hazardous material s aboard aircraft cargo crime including theft and smuggling and aircraft hijackings and sabotage by individuals with access to aircraft as previously noted the security risk associated with air cargo is believed to be consid erably different for passenger airline operations where the greatest perceived thr eat is the introduction of an explosive device through an air cargo shipment and all cargo operations where the greatest perceived threat is the potential hijacking of large all cargo aircraft to carry out suicide attack against ground target explosives and incendiary devices undetected explosive or incendiary devices placed in air cargo are potential threats to aircraft particularly passenger aircraft that carry cargo consignments experts have warned that air cargo may be potential target for terrorists because screening and inspection of air cargo is currently not as extensive as required sc reening of passengers and checked baggage for this reason congress has pushed the ts to increase screening and inspections of air cargo and recently mandated 100 sc reening of all cargo placed on passenger aircraft by august 2010 see pl 11053 cargo carried aboard passenger aircraft ma be at particular risk since passenger aircraft are generally regarded as highly attractive targets to terrorists and have been attacked in the past however some av iation security and c ounterterrorism experts regard placing explosives in air cargo as less appealing option to terrorists because typically specific flight cannot be target ed without the assist ance of an individual with access to aircraft furthermore experts generally believe that allcargo aircraft are less appealing targets to terrorists because an attack against an allcargo aircraft is not likely to result in mass casualties nd

rather at present the specific aviation security focus has been in response to attempts to carry on or assemble improvise d explosives devices in the passenger cabin for exampl the december 22 2001 attempted shoe bombing aboard american airlines boeing 767 on tran satlantic paris to miami flight and the foiled plot to allegedl bomb usbound airliners from the united kingdom in august 2006 has heightened concerns over possible terrorist bombings of passenger aircraft historically bombings of us airlin ers have been rare and have mostly involved bombs placed in either the aircraft passenger cabin or in checked passenger baggage the most catastrophic bombing of us airliner was the december 21 1988 crash of pan am flight 103 boeing 747 over lockerbie scotland that was attributed to an explosive device placed in baggage container in the airplanes forward hold11 investigation of the deadliest bom bing of passenger aircraft the june 23 1985 downing of air india flight 182 off the coast of ireland s imilarly revealed evidence of an explosive device that was most likely introduced in checked baggage and placed in the aircrafts forward cargo hold12 while the historic risk has been tie d to passenger baggage and the current aviation security policy emphasis is on impr ovised explosives in the passenger cabin efforts to protect against these threats may make cargo more attractive option for terrorists the most notable event invol ving detonation of an explosive device transported as cargo aboard an airliner in the united states was the november 15 1979 expl osion

particular concern however as previously noted some terrorism experts believe that placing explosives or incendiary devices in cargo may be less appealing because it would be difficult to target specific flights without the cooperation of individuals with access to aircraft such as cargo workers t hus increased efforts to perform background checks of workers with access to aircraft and increased physical security around air cargo operations may further mitigate the threat of explosives and incendiary devices in 2006 the tsa finalized rules requiring fi ngerprintbased criminal history records checks chrcs and terrorist screening of individuals working in cargo operations areas and workers at freight forwarding companies that handle the routing of air cargo additionally the use of hardened cargo containers capable of withstanding internal bomb blasts are being evaluated and may also provide means of mitigating the risks of explosives and incendiary devices the 911 commission specifically recommended the deployment of at least one hardened cargo container in each passenger aircraft to mitigate the potentia lly catastrophic consequences of bomb carried in air cargo15 under provision in the national intelligence reform act of 2004 pl 108458 pilot program was estab lished to evaluate this concept provision in the implementing the 911 commission

measures may also improve air cargo safety by increasing the detection of undeclared hazardous materials through screening nd inspections of cargo shipments and related paperwork cargo crime cargo crimes include theft of goods transported as cargo and shipment and smuggling of contraband counterfe it and pirated goods through the cargo distribution network it has been estimated that direct losses due to cargo theft across all transportation mode s total between 15 and 30 b illion nnually in the united states20 the large range in this estimate reflects the fact that cargo theft and other cargo crime has not historically been specific designated crime category and therefore reliable statistics on cargo theft are not available provision in the usa patriot improvement and reauthoriza

crime identified six key issues regarding cargo security lack of effective cargo theft reporting systems weaknesses in current transporta tion crime laws and prosecution lack of understanding regardin g the nature of cargo crime by governments and industry inadequate support for cargo theft task forces need to improve local law enforcement expertise on cargo theft and the need for more effective car go security technology including cargo tracking systems tamperevi dent and tamperresistant seals highspeed screening devices and in tegration of security technology into supply chain management systems23 while some of these issues may be addre ssed through the depar tment of justices approach to meeting the mandate for unifo rmly reporting cargo crimes concerns over the adequacy of law enforcement appro aches to combating cargo crime and the implementation of cargo secu rity technologies remain addressing these issues specific to cargo crime may also improve overall cargo security and could deter terrorist threats to cargo shipments while these recommendations are directed toward cargo crime issues in all mode s of transportation they could also be particularly applicable to air cargo secur ity where other security concerns such as explosive and incendiary device detecti on hazardous materials detection and deterring hijackings and sabotage may also be addressed throug h the implementation of tighter controls to deter cargo crime aircraft hijacking and sabotage individuals with access to aircraft may pose risk of potential hijackings and aircra ft sabotage instances

the gao noted that the tsa lacked specific longterm goals and performance targets for cargo security28 in response the tsa has developed an air cargo s ecurity strategic plan and has proposed comprehensive regulations designed to enhance air cargo security the tsas strategy centers on riskbased assessments and targeted physical screening of cargo based on risk as well as increased random

through appropriations legisl ation congress has continually pressed the tsa to increase the percentage of cargo carried on passenger aircraft that is inspected and has directed the dhs to invest in the research development and deployment of explosives screening technologies tailored for air cargo as previously noted the implementing the 911 commission recommendations act of 2007 pl 11053 establishes specific requirements and timetable for implementing 100 physical screening or inspection of air cargo carried aboard passenger aircraft current aviation security regulations require each passenger aircraft operator and indirect air carrier29 to develop security program for acceptance and screening of cargo to prevent or deter the carriage of unauthorized explosives or incendiaries however the volume of air car go handled and the distribut ed nature of the air cargo system presents significant challenges for screening and inspecting air cargo presently in the united states about 50 ai r carriers transport air cargo on passenger aircraft handling cargo from nearly 2 million shippers per day30 about 80 of these shippers use freight forwarders w ho operate about 10000 facilities across the country31 since the air cargo industry has cont ended that 100 screening of all air cargo is not practical solution with currently available technology up until now security programs have relied primarily on prescreening of cargo to identify shipments for targeted physical screenin g and inspection the tsa has adopted riskbased strategy that relies heavily on the known shipper process the tsa had planned to include other factors in its car go risk assessment through the use of freight assessment system that it has b een developing base d in part on cbps targeting methods however given th new mandate for achieving 100 physical screening of passenger air cargo the future plans for the riskbased freight assessment system seem somewhat uncertain nonetheless riskbased approaches

it expected to fully deploy this system sometime in 2008 but as previously not ed the mandate for 100 screening of passenger air cargo may alter these plans33 the known shipper program the principal means for prescreening or profiling cargo has been through the use of air carrier and freight forwarder known shipper programs in may 2006 the tsa issued final rule establishing an industrywide known

programs were created to establish procedures for differentiating trusted shippers known to freight forwar der or air carrier through prior business dealings from unknown shippers who have conducted limited or prior business with freight forwarder or air carrier using this system packages from unknown shippers can then be identified for add itional screening and inspection currently shipments

weaknesses in faas policy for allowing cargo on passenger aircraft several loopholes have been noted including the relative ease of obtaining known shipper status and the relative ease with which

shipper programs have been the adequacy of pr ocedures for auditing and monitoring known shippers and consideration of the potentia l need for consolidated database of known shippers as has now been created critics of known shi pper programs have argued that relatively little i nvestigation of known shippers is required to demonstrate that these shippers are trustworthy and ve adequate security measures in place to ensure the integrity of their shipments41 freight forwarders and air carriers have also questioned why extensive background check s and established relations with particular customer are required to estab lish that the customer is known shipper when that customer is already considered known shipper to another air carrier or freight forwarder therefore some d suggested need for standardized centralized database of know n shippers as has now been created by the tsa to address these concerns the tsa initially in stituted an industrywide pilot program database of known shippers this initiative poised the ts to address congressional interest in establishing an industrywide known shipper database that was included in language passed by the senate during the 108th congress see s 165 s 2845 as passed by the senate the administrations subsequent initiatives in taking regulatory action to require an industry wide known shipper da tabase led congress to ultimately drop th senatepassed provision in the intelligence reform act of 2004 pl 108458 that would have blished statutory requirement for establishing standardized industrywi known shipper prog ram and

aircraft roughly in line with the estimate attributed to the tsa however additional complexities associated with air cargo such as large sized and irregular shaped shipments that were not taken into account in this analys is could further increase estimated costs by making the screening process more labor in tensive or by requiring the additional deployment of alternative t echnologies for screening these and other factors may explain the larger anticipated initial year costs estimated by the airforwarders association reflected in their estimate of 700 million in the first year of 100 screening while these factors have generally been acknowledged by industry experts it has not been fully determined how these unique factors may affect the overall cost of screening cargo on the other hand through leveraging technology development and applying operational efficiencies veloped from experience with baggage screening as well as the ongoing air cargo screening pilot tests the total cost of implementing cargo screening may be reduced to some degree the congressional budget office cbo nonetheless provided somewhat higher cost estimate indicating that it mig ht cost 250 million in the first year and 650 million per year for the following five years for total of 35 billion over six years to implement the manda for 100 baggage screening54 the cbo however did not provide any specific details regarding how it arrived at this estimate the cbo also noted that the insufficient information was available to determine whether this new mandate would impose costs on privatesector entities with regard to who will carry out the mandated cargo screen ing and who will pay pl 11053 does not provide clear guidance therefore it remains uncertain whether some or all of the costs for mandated cargo screening will be included in the tsa budget or how much will have to be covered by the air cargo industry regarding the costs for screening cargo the potential for additional fees is particular concern for air cargo industry stakeholders while pl 11053 included the mandate for 100 cargo screening it di d not include any provisions to establish air cargo security fees or identify any other new revenue sources to pay for this mandate during legislative debate house majority leadership has indicated that it would not propose new deficit spending to pay for cargo screening and that airlines would be expected to pay for air cargo inspections55 under such scheme it would be most likely that physical screening of air cargo would become an air carrier responsibility with tsa

associationbe government responsibility and that it wa s the intent of the legislation to have federal employees carrying out the cargo screening required under this mandate56 the act however does not specify who is to conduct the screening and the tsa has interpreted the language to allow air lines freight forwarders or even possibly shippers and manufacturers to conduct the screening so long as they can assure the security of the shipment through the suppl chain until it is loaded onto an aircraft57 the tsa maintains that this is the only viable means for meeting the mandate as the tsa does not currently have the resources to screen the volume of cargo placed on passenger aircraft and such an inflexible approach would slow the flow of air cargo the tsa remains confident that so long as flexible approach is permitted it will meet the august 2010 deadline for 100 scr eening noting that at several smaller airports the requirement is already being met58 under such an approach it is likely that much of the operational costs associated with cargo screening and inspection will be borne by industry including airlines fre ight forwarders and shippers the extent to which these screening costs can be absorbed by passing them along to shippers and consumers may be particular issue of interest particularly as airlines continue to deal with other rising costs especially increased fuel costs besides the impact of direct costs for screening passenger airlines may be competitively disadvantaged compared to allcargo airlines if these new mandates are implemented industry stakeholders have expressed concerns that add itional security screening requirements could slow ship ments on passenger ai rcraft and certain routes may longer be profitable if cargo revenues are reduced or eliminated as result of new scr eening requirements59 given that profit margins for most passenger airlines are relatively small and most large passenger airlines have failed to achieve any consistent profitability in recent years the additiona l burden of both direct and indirect costs associated with mandate to screen all cargo placed on passenger aircraft may present particular fiscal challenges to the airlines while estimated cargo revenues of about 47 billion60 annually make up only about 5 of total industrywide operating reve nues among passenger air ca rriers these additional

mail shipments regardless of weight are transported by either passenger or allcargo aircraft and the amount of mail transported on ai rcraft has declined considerably since the prohibitions followi ng the 911 terrorist attacks were put in place passenger air carriers have been pushing to have these restrictions lifted because of significant loss of revenue fro m us mail shipments federal express is

logistic challenges that are yet to be resolved physical security of air cargo facilities air cargo facilities present unique challenges for physical security the large physical size of these facilities and relatively continuous highvolume cargo operations introduce numerous individuals vehicles and shipments into secured access areas around aircraft key issues rega rding physical security of these air cargo facilities include the adequacy of inspections and oversight of air cargo facilities to ensure compliance with aviation security regulations and procedures established in the approved security programs of ai r carriers and freight forwarders training for air cargo personnel with regard to security procedures and guidelines and access control requirements for pe rsonnel with access to air cargo facilities and aircraft these issues are presently being addressed through newly implemented air cargo security regulations issued by the ts in may 2006 that are currently being implemented at air carrier and freight forwarder operations and logistics facilities67 congressional oversight of industry imple mentation and compliance with these regulations may therefore c ontinue to be an issue of pa rticular interest during the 110th congress inspection and oversight of air cargo facilities current regulations specify that all air carriers and freight forwarders must allow the tsa to conduct inspections and to review and copy records in order to determine compliance with applicable laws and regulations pertaining to aviation security the homeland security appropriations act for fy2005 provided the tsa with 40 million to hire an additional 100 inspectors to carry out ove rsight and enforcem ent activities related to air cargo security the tsa has resp

fy2006 congress again provided the tsa with 10 million setaside to hire 100 more air cargo inspect ors and for travel related to carrying out regulatory oversight and inspections of air cargo shipping and handling facilities but the tsa has been slow to obligate these funds for air cargo security for fy2007 appropriations report nguage directed the tsa to hi re additional permanent staff to enhance tsas analytic air cargo security capabilities68 in addition an fy2007 supplemental appropriation see pl 110 28 totaling 80 million was provided for air cargo security activities including th hiring of an additional 150 compliance inspectors and cargo vulnerability assessments at the nations busiest airports ie category x airports similarly increased funding for air cargo security in fy2008 appropriations was provided fo r the hiring of additional air cargo inspectors and reducing reliance on contractors to carry out regulatory compliance activities related to air cargo security increased oversight of air cargo facilities is likely to be highly dependent on the continued availability of resources and funding the effectiveness of this oversight will also likely be highly dependent on the adequacy of available tools and procedures to track needed corrective actions and ensure compliance among air carriers and freight forwarders therefore the adequacy of tsas oversight of air cargo security could be significant area of focus for congressional oversight during the 110th congress cargo security training currently air cargo handlers are not required to receive any specific or formal training on security procedures or identification of suspicious activities however air cargo handlers may be considered the front line in protecting against security threats by adhering to procedures that would mitigate physical security breaches at cargo operations facilities by increasing their awareness of suspicious activities and by following proper procedures for reporting their observations security training for cargo workers may focus on security procedures for ensuring cargo integrity protecting facilities reporting suspicious activities and so on under the tsa regulations impos ed in 2006 workers for allcargo carriers and for indirect air carriers with secu rityrelated duties such as carrying out security inspections of shipments are now required to

control systems these proposals are discussed in further tail below in the s ection titled biometric screening technology another concern has been raised over th use of identification checks in lieu of physical screening of airport workers including cargo handlers representative peter defazio for example has expressed concer n over this practice noting that workers who bypass physical screening could potentia lly carry threat objects into secured areas of the airport or on board aircraft69 these concerns were again raised in 2007 when airline workers in orlando were rrested after using their airport access credentials to bypass security checkpoints and smuggle weapons on flights to puerto rico70 congress may consider whether exis ting security procedures regarding airport worker access to secured airport areas meets the intent of atsa with regard to providing at least the same level of protection of secured airport areas and passenger aircraft as screening pa ssengers and their baggage

control to cargo operations areas and allcargo aircraft had not been held to the same standard as passenger airline operations prior to the implementation of tougher regulations for air cargo security proponents for arming allcargo pilots also point out that the lack of screening of individuals and property at air cargo facilities could offer the opportunity for terrorists plottin g to hijack an

similar to those used in th september 11 2001 terrorist attacks72 proponents for arming allcargo pilots contend that the provision in vision 100 that includes cargo pilots in the ffdo program will mitigate the risk of hijacking aboard all cargo aircraft they further argue that training for cargo pilots is needed expediently given the limited measures currently in place to mitigate this risk cargo airlines on the other hand had opposed allowing their pilots to join the ffdo program air carriers in general have been hesitant about the program because of liability concerns even though specific liability protections were extended to the airlines and pilot participants when the ffdo program was established under the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 proponents for the program

spurring increased developmen t and deployment of these devices the systems are also being utilized to screen for drugs and other contraband as well as explosives in cargo shipments in addition to traditional xray systems xray backscatter technology which measures the scatter or reflections of the xray beam the xray backscatter technology tends to do much better job of differentiating organic materials because different chemical elements in these materials scatter the xray in quite different patterns this makes xray backscatter well suited technology for detecting organic explosives in either solid or liquid form however like traditional xray technology current xray backscatter systems are extremely labor intensive and require considerable staffing and training requirements because these systems require human operators to control the system and interpret the backscatter images one of the most significant operational challenges in using xray screening devices whether they be traditional xray systems or newer xray backscatter technologies is the performan ce of the human operator variety of human factors considerations contribute to the operators ability to detect threat objects when viewing xray images these include the monotony of the task fatigue time pressure the adequacy of training and wo rking conditions these human factors are important to consider in fielding xray screening systems to ensure high detection rates of threat objects while minimizing fa lse alarm rates that would unnecessarily slow the cargo inspection and handling pro cess technologies such as threat image projection tip that superimpose stored images of threat objects on xray scans can help keep operators alert and may be ffective tools for training and performance monitoring additional technologies such as computer algorithms for highlighting potential threat objects may also be considered to aid human observers explosive detection systems eds currently eds technologies are being used extensively in the aviation secur ity environment par ticularly in response to the mandate in atsa requiring screen ing of all checked passenger baggage by eds these systems use xray computed tomography to scan objects and computational algorithms that assess the probability of threat object detection based on object density characteristics certified eds systems must meet acceptable detection and false alarm rates for bulk expl osives detection while most specific performance criteria of certified eds systems are classified eds systems used for passenger checked baggage must meet

operational challenges of applying largescale eds screening initiatives for air cargo operations efforts are also underway at tsa to improve the pe rformance of eds equipment and reduce its cost however air cargo operations are likely to present some of their own unique challenges for implementing large scale ed s screening of freight express packages and mail some of the potential operational challenges associated with effectively fielding existing eds equipment for screening air cargo include the limited size of objects that can be placed in eds machines which would require objects to be screened before being placed in containers or on pallets the distributed nature of the air cargo system often involves loading containers at remote sites and eds screening at these remote sites may leave the system vulnerabl to possible introduction of explosives or incendiary devices at points along the supply chain beyond the screening site reported high false alarm rates of current generation eds systems may lead to high levels of secondary screening and detailed inspections that could impact the ability to meet the schedule demands of cargo operations and the processing rate of eds equi pment may require the purchase of large numbers of eds machines and investment in the research and development of alternative technol ogies thus increasing program costs to minimize the impact on cargo operations scheduling and meet desired security program goals although the throughput of eds equipment has markedly imp roved over the last few years chemical trace detection systems chemical trace detection systems referred to commonly as etd devices are be ing widely used as secondary screening tools for passenger carryon and checked baggage items identified for closer scrutiny by initial screenin g methods or selected at random may undergo further examination using these systems these systems use variety of technical principles to analyze the chemical composition of sample residue wiped from suspect articles these systems compare the chemical composition of such sample to the signature of known explosive materials and signal an alarm to the operator if the probability of match exceeds specified threshold the use of chemical trace detection systems is now common practice in the screening of checked and carryon bags it has been reported that tsa is considering expanding the use of chemical trace detection systems for screening cargo carried aboard passenger aircraft76 however screening procedures using these systems are very labor intensive and time consuming like the manne r in which this technology is used to perform secondary screening of checked and carry on bags chemical trace detection may be employed in air cargo operations to perform detailed screening of suspicious packages identified through known shipper databases or can be used for detailed secondary screening in conjunction with primary screening performed by x ray and eds

these systems use pulsed neutron generator to probe an object initiating several low energy nuclear reactions with the chemical elements comprising the object detectors can then measure the nuclear signature of the transmitted neutrons andor the gammarays emitted from the reactions since neutrons and gammarays have the ability to penetrate through various materials to large depths in

very expensive and time consuming78 in addition to the cost and time factors associated with neutron beam technologies the national research counc il nrc has raised considerable doubts about

millimeter wave imaging systems for air cargo screening has been more limited at this point nonetheless commercial products using millimeter wave imaging are currently available for application in

currently available millimeter wave imaging systems are capable of generating relatively high detail images of items held inside cargo container however like xray screening technologies millimeter

laboratory these containers or hardened unitloading devices hulds are seen as potential means for mitigating the threat of explosives placed board passenger aircraft in either checked baggage or cargo these containers must withhold an explosiv blast of specified magnitude without any rupturing or fragment penetration of the c ontainer wall or the aircraft structure and must contain and selfextinguish any postblast fire in order to meet the faaestablished test criteria83 however the increased weight of thes containers could have significant operational impacts on airlines by increasing fuel costs and decreasing payload capacity for carrying revenue passengers nd cargo challenges associated with deploying hardened cargo containers include increased weight affecting aircraft range and payload capacity increased procurement cost for hardened containers potentially higher maintenance costs for hardened container materials potential reduction in cargo volume in addition to reduced payload weight due to thicke r container walls and possible design specifications such as door hinging and positioning that are not compatible with current airline baggage and cargo loading procedures and operations facilities84 the national research counc il nrc estimated that the per unit cost for acquiring hardened cargo containers would be 10000 and recommended that the

made the nrc pa nel estimated that the cost of deploying enough hulds for airlines to carry at least one huld per passenger flight would require an industrywide procurement cost of 125 milli on and w

and intrusion resistance with possible blastresistant capabilities the recommendation made by the 9 11 commission also called for the deployment of at least one hardened cargo container on every passenger aircraft for carrying any suspect cargo86 this recommendation implies that cargo pre screening or risk evaluation process ch as known shipper program or the proposed freight assessment system would be used to determine what cargo should be loaded into the hardened container presently atsa requires shipments from unknown sources to travel on allcargo aircra ft one strategic objective of the tsas air cargo strategic plan is to develop means for identifying elevated risk cargo through prescreening87 such tool would likely be needed to assess risk and determine what cargo should be placed in rdened container besides the need for prescreening process the use of harden ed cargo containers is likely to be opposed by the airline industry because of the direct costs of acquiring these units as well as the increased operational cost associated with increased fuel burn and lost payload capacity the benefits of using hardened cargo containers would likely be highly dependent on

protected by hardened containers any policy regarding the use of just one hardened c ontainer per aircraft will likely need to carefully evaluate the criteria and methods for vetting cargo to determine what cargo should be designated for carriage inside these hardened cargo containers in addition to hardened cargo containers the faa recently proposed rulemaking89 that would require newly certified ai rcraft type to have improved fire suppression capabilities in their cargo holds to withstand nd suppr ess sudden intensive fire from an explosive or incendi ary device additionally the proposed rule would require each newly certified aircraft type to include least risk bomb location an accessible location wher crewmembers could place suspected explosive device to minimize the potential fo r catastrophic damage to the aircraft if the item explodes the proposal would also re quire aircraft designers to isolate flight critical systems and maximize separation of systems to minimize the chances that bomb detonation would render the aircraft unflyable however because these proposals would only be app lied to newly certified aircraft types these changes would not have

it is likely that the implementation of biometric identifier technology will play an increasingly important role in air cargo security policy funding for air cargo security the cost of air cargo security options are significant to both the federal government and the air cargo industry fu rthermore the indir ect costs of air cargo security on air cargo operations may pose si gnificant longterm challenges on the other hand the potential costs of terrorist ttack both in terms of the loss of life and property and the long term economic impact s would also be significant but are difficult to predict and quantify an ongoi ng debate tied to ai r cargo appropriations and oversight of aviation security is the amount of physical screening and inspection of air cargo that is needed and achievable and whether riskbased prescreening tools can provide an adequate means to ensure the security of air cargo by identifying at risk cargo for targeted physical inspections besides the logistic complexities of inspecting large amounts or 100 of car go on passenger flights many are concerned that the cost of doing so ma impose significant burden on the aviation and air cargo industries while federal expenditures on air cargo s ecurity measures have been growing over the past two years these efforts ar relatively small element about 2 of tsas overall operating budget for aviati on security these expenditures could continue to grow however if additional technology and re sources are devoted to the tracking and screening of cargo shipments in contrast to passenger and baggage screening which are with few exceptions the operational responsibility of the tsa under the current scheme much of the cost of inspection and screening of cargo is borne by the airlines and shippers while tsa only maintains oversight responsibility as previously noted to meet the mandate of 100 inspections of air cargo the tsa estimates cost of more than 650 million in the first year of implementation and total co st of roughly 36 billion over 10 years while the cbo estimates these costs to total 35 billion over six year 250 million in the first year and 650 million for the next five years90 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34390crs40 options for imposing air cargo security fees pl 11053 does not include an aviation security fee in conn ection with its mandate for 100 screening of cargo placed on passenger aircraft th is leaves open funding questions regarding who would be responsible fo r operationally carrying out the screening the federal government or industry and how these screening functions would be funded as previously noted the tsa intends to rely on industry including the airlines freight forwarders and even shippers in some cases to carry out much of the physical screening of cargo required under this ma ndate the specific operational manner in which tsa technologies and canine explosiv detection teams will be integrated into this process relying primarily on industryoperate d cargo screening remains unclear and clouds the picture regarding funding requirements and funding sources for air cargo screening operations however some past legislative pr oposals calling for the tsa to physically screen all cargo shipments bound for passenger aircraft incorpor ated fee schedule for shippers to cover costs associated w ith screening cargo transported in passenger aircraft that is similar to the security fees imposed on airline passengers see hr 2455 and hr 3798 introduced in the 108th congress imposing fee on air cargo shipments for security could provide offsetting collections for air cargo security costs incurred by the government such as the cost of screening technology development and deployment and the trai ning and deployment of canine explosives detection teams regardless of how such fee might be collected either through fees assessed to air carriers or freight forwarders or through direct fees applied to each shipment the costs will ultimately be borne by shippers and ultimately passed on to the customers of their products the overall impact of such fees on air cargo would ultimately be dependent on the relative cost of the fee since air cargo shipments tend to consist of relatively high value goods it is likely that the relative cost of security fee in relation to the value of the shipment will be low which could minimize the economic impact of imposing such fee however if fees applied to air cargo carried on passenger aircraft are higher than fees for transporting that same cargo on allcargo aircraft significant negative impact on passenger air carrier revenues from cargo may result equity in fee collections will likely be an important consideration in assessing if and how air cargo security f ees should be collected potential impact on manufact urers and other shippers another possible concern over the increased cost of cargo security associated with screening operations and other security enhancements is the potential that these actions will result in increased shipment costs for manuf actured goods particul arly costs related to the distribution of timecritical parts if unit shipping costs rise enough because of securityrelated costs and fees it is possible that domestic manufacturing and assembly costs will not be able to remain competitive in global market for example if the costs of shipping timecritical parts from asia for final assembly in the united states rise because of secu rityrelated costs it may become cost advantageous to manufacture the entire produc t overseas or within the united states in the long term this could result in possible loss of manufacturing jobs in the united states or in some cases relocati on of certain manufacturing facilities to the united states to eliminate dependence on air cargo for this reason the economic implications of any proposal to impose secu rityrelated fees on air cargo or imposehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34390crs41 costly security requirements on air cargo operators and shippers will likely need to be carefully evaluated to avoid or minimize any unintended impacts on

in fy2003 the tsa received 20 million for cargo screening improvements in fy2004 the tsa was appropriated 30 million for air cargo security opera tions additionally research and development related to air cargo secur ity was provided an appropriation of 55 million for fy2005 the administration r ecommended flat funding for air cargo while the house and the senate agreed to increases to both the air cargo operations and air cargo research and developm ent accounts totaling 115 million in fy2006 there was shift in funding and for the first time larger proportion of air cargo security funding was allocated for us in air cargo operations 55 million as compared to research and development 30 million also as previously noted the fy2006 air cargo research and developmen t funding has been more specifically directed to focus on three pilot projects reflecting maturation of air cargo screening technologies and procedures and migra tion from purely research activity to testable operational concept in fy2007 base appropriations for air cargo security operations were again set at 55 million specific funding amount for air cargo securityrelated research nd development initiatives was not included in the fy2007 appropriations however the tsa and the dhs science and technology directorate are continuing their efforts to adopt eds technologies to the air cargo environment and the tsa was directed to work with in dustry stakeholders to develop standards and protocols to increase the use of explos ives detection equipment for screening air cargo with the start of the 110th congress congressional focus on improving air cargo security resulted in an 80 million supplemental appropriation for air cargo security this funding was made av ailable through fy2009 and was specifically designated for hiring additional ai r cargo inspectors conducting air cargo vulnerability assessments at all category x airports training and deploying additional canine teams pursuing new methods for
