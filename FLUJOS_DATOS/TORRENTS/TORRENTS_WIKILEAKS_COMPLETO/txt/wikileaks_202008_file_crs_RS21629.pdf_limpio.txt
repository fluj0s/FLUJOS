division summary the house and senate both require that c onference report be signed by majority of house conferees and majority of sena conferees when some conferees are appointed only for limited purposes the two cha mbers have different ways of counting to determine whether the conferees report carries sufficient signatures the senate asks whether the report is signed by majority of all the conferees from each house without regard to whether those conferees were ppointed for all or for limited purposes the house asks whether the report is signed by majority of all the conferees from each house who were appointed to consider each of the matters that were submitted to the conference committee this report will be upda ted if procedural changes warrant general and limited purpose

of the conferees of each house3 in most cases problems arise in determining whether this requirement has been met under certain circumstances howev er questions may arise about whether conference report carries sufficient signatures these questions may arise especially in the house and when one or both chambers appoint some of their conferees only for limited purposes usually each house authorizes at least some of its conferees to negotiate on all the matters in disagreemen t between the two houses conferees with this blanket authority may be calle d general conferees either house or both however also may authorize some of its conferees to negotiate only on certain of the matters committed to conference for example one chamber might appoint certain of its conferees only to consider title ii of the senate substitute and the corresponding provisions of the house bill conferees with this form of authority may be called limited purpose conferees many limited purpose conferees are named as additional conferees to negotiate along with the general conferees on the specified matters some however may be named as the sole conferees on the matters specified in which case the authority of all other conferees also must be limited so that they are not to negotiate on these matters when limited purpose conferees are present the ma tters before the conference may be thought of as divided into several portions on each of which different group of conferees is authorized to negotiate the memberships f these different panels of conferees of course may overlap validity of conference reports in house and senate when limited conferees are present the house and senate determine whether conference report carries sufficient number of signatures in different ways senate standard the senate does not often appoint conferees for limited purposes one reason may lie in how the senate counts to determine the sufficiency of signatures on conference reports in the senate valid conference report must carry the signatures of majority of the members from each chamber w ho were appointed as conferees without regard to whether or not any of those members were appointed as conferees only for limited purposes the house parliamentar ians handbook of current precedent house practice states that under senate practice signatures are counted strictly per capita4 house standard the house is more likely than t he senate to appoint conferees for limited purposes and the house has different standard for determining whether there is sufficient number of signatures on conference report in the house valid conference report must carry the signatures of majority of the members from each chamber who were appointed to consider each provision or amendment in conference in the house according to house practice guide to the rules precedents andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21629crs3 5ibid 6calendar of the united states house of represe ntatives and history of legislation final edition 106thcong p 188procedures of the house each provision must receive signatures of majority of the members appointed for that provision onlyin cluding general and additional conferees5 application each chamber uses its standard not only to determine whether majority of its own members have signed conference report but also to determine whether the report carries the re quisite number of signatures from members of the other chamber for example consider typical case in which the house appoints limited purpose conferees and the senate does not in the house whether sufficient numbe r of representatives have signed the conference report depends on separate determination for each portion of the bill and amendment or amendments committed to c onference for each portion of the matters in disagreement it will be necessary to c ount how many representatives were appointed to consider that portion and then to determin whether majority of that number signed the report if majority of those appointed to consider any one portion of the matters in disagreement fail to sign the report the report is not valid even if it carries the signatures of all the other house conferees in the senate however it is sufficient t count the number of representatives who were appointed as conferees for any purpose that is the total number of both general and limited purpose conferees and ascertain whether majority of that number signed the conference report illustrations recent instance to illustrate the application of the house and senate standards consider the rosters of representatives an d senators appointed as conferees on hr 1000 of the 106thcongress the wendell h ford aviatio n investment and reform act for the 21st century in this example both the hous and the senate appointed both general and limited purpose conferees6 the senate appointed 14 senators from two committees nine senators from the committee on commerce science and t ransportation were appointed for the consideration of the entire bill the senate also appointed five senators from the committee on the budget to consider only title ix of the bill the house appointed 29 representatives 20 of them for all purposes and nine for only limited purposes in addition to the 20 mana gers appointed to consider the entire bill the speaker appointed three conferees from the committee on the budget for the consideration of titles ix and x of the house bill three conferees from the committee on ways and means for the consideration of title xi of the house bill and three conferees from the committee on science for the cons ideration f title xiii of the senate amendment and modifications committed to conferencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21629crs4 in the senate the conference report would not be valid unless majority of all the conferees from each chamber signed it in other words if any eight senators and any 15 representatives signed the report then the report would have sufficient number of signatures for the senate to consider it the house however would determine w hether sufficient number of representatives signed the conference report according to its own standard in our example the signatures of majority of the nine senators appointed to consider the whole bill would be required for all titles except title ix in other words five senators would need to sign the report for those titles for the report to be valid in the house with respect to title ix however majority of the full 14 senators appointed would need to sign for the report or eight senators similarly for the report to be valid in the house 11 representatives or majority of the 20 general conferees appointed woul d need to sign the report for all the titles except ix x xi and xiii for titles ix and x signatures would have to be gathered from any 12 of the 23 representatives appointed fo r the consideration of those titles in other words majority of the 23 conferees 20 general conferees plus the three limited purpose conferees from the committee on the budget appointed to consider titles ix and x would need to sign the report in the same way majority of the 23 house conferees appointed to consider title xi and majority of the 23 house conferees appointed to consider title xiii would also need to sign the report table 1 graphically displays the information in the

senate standards for the sufficiency of signatures became an issue in the 106thcongress when s 900 the financial services modernization act of 1999 went to conference the senate appointed 20 conferees 11 republicans and nine demo crats all with restrictions on their authority the house initially appointed 42 conferees drawn from four different house committees each of which had jurisdiction over some provision or provisions of the senate bill or the house amendment in the nature of substitute of these 42 23 were appointed as general conferees to consider the entire senate bill and the entire house substitute all the other house conferees were appointed for limited purposes some much more limited than others7 the most complex appointments were f or members of the house committee on banking and financial services eight republicans and two democrats from that committee were appointed to the conference committee for all purposes eleven other democrats from the co mmittee were appoi nted in five overlapping groups each consisting of four limited purpose conferees authorized to consider one or more titles of the house and senate versions of the bill as result each group of conferees from the committee on banking and financial services consisted of eight republicans and six democrats republicans constituted majority of each panel of house conferees the way in which the separate panels of limited purpose democratic conferees from the committee on banking and financial services were ma up however meant that the total number of house members appointed as conferees in cluded 20 republicans and 22 democrats some senate conferees objected that this configuration opened up the possibility of conference report that could be held valid for consideration in the senate under the senate standard even though h ouse republicans had signed it8 subsequently the speaker appointed four additional republican members as limited purpose conferees and correspondingly restricted the role of four republicans initially appointed as general conferees the four ne w conferees were authorized to negotiate only on certain narrowly specified provisions of the bill the authority of the four initial appointees was restricted to the remaining portions of the bill so that they became limited purpose conferees as well this change reduced the total number of house general conferees from 23 to 19 more significantly however the four new appointments brought the total number of house conferees to 46 made up of 24 republicans and 22 democrats9 additional information for related information
