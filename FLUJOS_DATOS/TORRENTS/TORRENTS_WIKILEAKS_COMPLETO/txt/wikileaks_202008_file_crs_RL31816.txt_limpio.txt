temporary funding authority provided by house rules was set to expire on that date hres 148 an omnibus funding resolution was introduced by representative robert w ney the chairman of the house administration committee on march 18 2003 the resolution incorporates the amounts requested by each house committee into one resolution on march 26 2003 the house agreed by unanimous consent to hres

house agreed to hres77 authorizing temporary funding of 700000 for the newly created house select committee on homeland security up through march 31 2003 the two house temporary funding extensions applied to the select committee as well however on april 18 2003 the president signed into law pl 10811 the emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act fy2003 chapter 8 of that act provides 11 million for the homeland security committee to be available through december 31 2004 the effect of this action is to reduce the amount that must be provided later in the fy2004 and fy2005 legislative

authorizing funds for the homeland security committee in the wake of action in the supplemental appropriations act the senate agreed by unanimous consent to the omnibus funding resolution sres 66 for its covered committees on february 27 2003 on january 15 2003 the senate reached an agreement ending an impasse in electing committees by agreeing to allot committee staff proportionately between the two parties excluded from this allocation were administrative staff appointed by committee chair which both parties agreed served all members all standing and select committees of both chambers of congress except for both appropriations committees and the senate ethics committee obtain their operating budgets pursuant to biennial committee funding resolution often house action on these funding resolutions is controversial because of disputes over the allocation of staff positions on committees between the majority and minority parties senate action is normally less contentious because there are stronger guarantees in senate rules providing at least onethird of committee staff and funds to the minority many members in both chambers criticize funding recommendations that significantly exceed the rate of inflation some members may oppose providing funds to particular committees to support committee inquiries with which these members disagree committee funding in the 107th congress in the 107th congress the house reached an accommodation satisfactory to both parties which by 2002 gave minority members on nearly all panels financed through the house funding process onethird of the committee staff positions under house rules the minority is guaranteed onethird of the first 30 staff positions authorized for committee but is not entitled to such proportion of any additional staff positions on march 27 2001 the house adopted the biennial funding resolution hres 84 by vote of 35761 the largest margin of support for funding resolution since the chamber began to consider omnibus funding resolutions in 1981 senate action on its committee funding for the 107th congress was modified as result of the powersharing agreement established by sres 8 of january 5 2001 this agreement assures republicans and democrats of equal staffing resources on all committees excluded from this equal division of staff are administrative personnel who serve both parties and who are to be appointed by the committee chairman in consultation with the ranking minority member despite some delays in its normal timetable the senate on march 8 2001 agreed to biennial funding resolution by unanimous consent house floor action in 108th congress on may 6 2003 the house agreed to unanimous consent request by representative john linder to provide for the consideration of hres 148 the omnibus funding resolution at any time on may 7 2003 under the agreement the resolution will be considered for one hour with time equally divided between the crs3 chairman and ranking minority member and the committeereported amendment in the nature of substitute will be considered as adopted thereby simplifying house floor consideration as in previous congresses major concern in the house committee funding process will be whether each committee has provided its minority party members with least onethird of the committees staff and funds the continued bipartisan support for the funding process evident two years ago may hinge on whether all committees are now fully compliant with the twothirdsonethird allocation there may also be concern about the increasing costs of committee operations since 1995 when the house cuts its committee staff size by onethird the newly established select committee on homeland security has requested 11 million for its operations in the 108th congress and an 11 million appropriation for the select committee was provided in pl 10811 the emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act there has been concern about providing funds for this committee and for accommodating requested funding increases for other panels while retaining reasonable control over the rising costs of committee operations house committees have requested 252 million an increase of nearly 50 million from the amount approved in the 107th congress2 the house normally acts on committee funding resolutions during the last week of march in the first year of congress the committee funding resolution is normally called up as privileged business under the rules of the house allowing it to be called up and considered without the need for special rule from the rules committee privileged funding resolutions are considered in the house under the onehour rule and typically the majority party manager does not yield the floor to permit amendments to be offered the committeereported amendment is automatically laid before the house at the end of one hour of debate the majority party manager moves the previous question and if agreed to the house votes on final passage of the resolution before the vote on final passage it has become customary for the minority party to offer motion to recommit the funding resolution this motion normally permits the minority to offer an alternative funding proposal and to obtain house vote on it owing to the bipartisan consensus on the 107th congress funding resolution house democrats did not offer such motion in 2001 although house floor action on funding resolutions typically occur in the latter half of march unforeseen delays made it impossible for the house and the administration committee to complete action instead representative ney the chairman of the house administration committee introduced on march 26 2003 and obtained consideration and approval by unanimous consent of shortterm funding extension hres 163 continuing committee funding up through april 11 2003 the resolution was agreed to by unanimous consent when action could not be completed within that deadline the house by unanimous consent agreed on april 9 2003 to hres 185 continuing funding up through may 9 2003 2 suzanne nelson house admin to seek second cr to fund committees roll call internet edition apr 10 2003 httpwwwrollcallcomissues48_81news12221html crs4 house committee action each committee is encouraged to discuss its proposed budget and approve it at committee organization meeting although some committees do not prepare or approve their draft budgets this way each committee chair normally introduces house resolution to provide the committee with the requisite funds for the two years of the congress these individual resolutions are then referred to the house administration committee which holds public hearings on each committees request receiving testimony from committee chairs and the ranking minority members the house administration committee held hearings on committee requests on march 13 and 14 2003 the chair of the house administration committee then typically introduces an omnibus funding resolution which after its referral to the house administration committee generally serves as the legislative vehicle for full committee markup representative ney chairman of the house administration committee introduced such resolution hres 148 on march 18 20033 his resolution incorporates without change the amounts requested by each committee at the house administration committee markup the chair typically offers an amendment in the nature of substitute modifying usually reducing the amounts requested by each committee the markup may feature consideration of additional amendments concluded with vote to approve the resolution as amended the measure is then reported to the house and written report is issued to accompany the resolution depending upon the degree of controversy surrounding the funding process minority additional or supplemental written views may be included in the committee report on may 6 the house administration committee held markup session and agreed to an amendment in the nature of substitute submitted by chairman ney hres 148 was then reported to the house by voice vote house funding procedures and issues house rules establish guidelines for committees in drafting budget requests and in administering committee funds the authority of the house administration committee in reviewing budget requests and overseeing the disbursement of committee funds are also prescribed in house rules under house rule x clause 6 each standing and select committee of the house except the appropriations committee is required to submit an operating budget request for necessary expenses over the twoyear span of congress the budgetary requests include estimated salary needs for staff costs of consulting services printing costs office equipment and supply costs and travel costs for committee members and staff some costs such as pension and insurance contributions for committee employees are not directly billed to the committee and are paid from other 3 on mar 17 chairman ney had introduced an earlier omnibus funding resolution h res 146 the two resolutions are identical except that the latter resolution hres 148 provides an additional 153795 over two years for the small business committee which had requested the additional amount in revised request crs5 appropriated funds individual committee requests are then packaged by the house administration committee into an omnibus primary expense resolution clause 6c requires that the minority party be treated fairly in the appointment of committee staff employed pursuant to such expense resolutions prior to the 104th congress house rules provided base level of 30 socalled statutory staff positions for all house standing committees except the appropriations committee funds for these staff were provided through lineitem appropriation and were not included in the funding resolutions reported from the house administration committee in the 104th congress house rules were changed 1 to provide for biennial committee funding resolutions and 2 to include funding authorization for the baseline 30 staff positions now called professional staff in each committees funding authorization as before these provisions were not made applicable to the house appropriations committee twenty of these staff positions are allotted to the committee majority and 10 to the committee minority the house majority leadership has encouraged its committee leaders to move as quickly as possible to provide the minority with onethird of the remaining committee staff and resources authorized in the biennial funding resolutions previously there have been disputes about the interpretation of funding and staffing guidelines for the minority some committees have considered as equitable the apportionment of onethird of staff salary funds while others have considered the onethird standard to apply to the number of staff positions regardless of salary some committees have said that those administrative staff providing services to both parties should be excluded from the minoritymajority staff allocation although most such administrative staff may have been majority party staff designees there are also still disparities among committees on the allocation to the minority of office space travel funds and office equipment nevertheless both parties seem to agree that since the 103rd congress the minority party has been treated more equitably than before in the allocation of house committee staff and resources remaining disputes between the parties now focus on the speed with which all committees achieve or plan to achieve this onethird standard in recent congresses the house administration committee has sometimes included an authorization for reserve fund in its omnibus funding resolution with the approval of the house administration committee money in this fund could be released to committees that encountered unexpected funding needs during congress the use of the reserve fund was controversial because the house did not have to approve its use for the 107th congress however reserve fund was included in the funding resolution committee funding resolutions include requests from committees to employ consultants and to arrange for the services of executive branch staff detailed to the committee the house administration committee approves consulting contracts and staff details for all house committees except for the appropriations committee although consultant contract fees are paid from committee budgets house committees are not required to reimburse federal agency for the salary and benefits cost of detailed staff the house administration committee also has authority to approve socalled shared staffing arrangements except those involving the crs6 appropriations committee through which committee staffs are paid partly from committee funds and partly through members personal staffing funds senate committee funding action 108th congress the senate for the second congress in row adopted ad hoc procedures in approving committee operating budgets with the senate divided 51481 at the beginning of the 108th congress senate democrats argued for proportional allocation of committee staff between the parties democratic senators threatened to filibuster any resolution offered to elect senators to committees unless an agreement was reached first on the partisan allocation of committee staff on january 15 after weeklong delay in the appointment of senate committees unanimous consent agreement was reached providing for the proportional allocation of staff and office space between the parties on each committee with separate provision that allowed the committee chair the authority to control up to 10 of the committee budget for the employment of administrative staff serving both parties the full text of the joint leadership letter agreement signed by senators bill frist majority leader ted stevens trent lott thomas daschle democratic leader robert c byrd and christopher j dodd follows we mutually commit to the following for only the 108th congress the budgets of the committees of the senate including joint and special committees and all other subgroups shall be apportioned to reflect the ratio of the senate as of this date with up to an additional ten percent to be allocated to chairmen for administrative expenses to be determined by the rules committee sic with the total administrative expense allocation for all committees not to exceed historic levels the additional administrative expenses described above shall be available to be expended by committee chairman after consultation with the ranking member of the committee funds for committee expenses shall be available to chairmen consistent with senate rules and practices of the 107th congress committee budget shall be allocated to reduce the democratic sic staff salary baseline from that of fiscal year 2002 including cola as adjusted by approved colas for fiscal year 2003 and fiscal year 2004 the chairman and ranking member of any committee may by mutual agreement modify the apportionment of committee funding referenced in this letter the division of committee office space shall be commensurate with this funding agreement4 due to this formal agreement consideration of committee funding requests by the senate rules and administration committee was routine on february 26 senators lott and dodd the chair and ranking minority member of the senate rules and administration committee introduced s res 66 providing funds for senate committees except for the appropriations committee through february 28 2005 the next day the senate agreed to the resolution by unanimous consent 4 congressional record daily electronic edition vol 149 jan 15 2003 pp s842s843 crs7 sres 66 provided funds at the level requested by each senate committee except for the foreign relations committee the request of the foreign relations committee included funds for proposed policy advisory group the group is to be comprised largely of outside advisors who would be reimbursed for the cost of their periodic travel to washington dc it was the view of the rules and administration committee that waiver from the senate ethics committee would be necessary for this group to function but the ethics committee could not provide such waiver within the deadlines of the funding process consequently funds for this group were deleted from the foreign relations committee funds with the understanding that such funds might be provided later if the necessary waivers were obtained senate committee funding rules although the senate has for the second congress in row followed ad hoc procedures in determining committee operating budgets and the allocation of staff positions and other resources among its committees there are formal provisions in senate rules governing the funding process this section describes these rules that will apply in future congresses unless the rules are amended or again set aside by unanimous consent the senate biennial committee funding process applies to all senate committees except appropriations and ethics which have permanent authorizations for their staff and operating expenses the senate committee on rules and administration has jurisdiction over committee funding resolutions and also issues directives governing committee funding and staff committee funding and staff are also regulated by senate rules especially rule xxvi paragraph 9 and rule xxvii as well as by statute the funds authorized by resolution are appropriated in legislative branch appropriations acts soon after new congress convenes generally by january 31 of the first session each senate committee except appropriations and ethics requests funds for two years the formal request comes as senate resolution introduced by the chair of each committee after formal review of the request by all committee members the various resolutions are referred to the rules and administration committee each committee supports its request by submitting supplementary materials including those specified by the rules and administration committee in recent congresses that panel has advised committees on the permissible increase or required decrease it hopes to impose on senate committees compared to the funding level in the previous congress committees requesting funds in excess of these guidelines have been asked to include justification in their budget submissions the rules and administration committee may then hold hearings during which committee leaders testify on their budget requests although in recent congresses testimony from some or all committees has been omitted in the interest of time the rules and administration committee chair will normally introduce an omnibus resolution incorporating the amounts requested by each of the senate committees in their individual resolutions the rules and administration committee will then usually meet to markup the resolution and after final approval by the committee report it to the senate and issue an accompanying written report on occasions when crs8 both parties have been in agreement on the funding resolution it has been discharged by unanimous consent from the committee without formal markup or written report this was the case in the 107th and 108th congresses the senate then considers the funding resolution under normal senate rules and procedures although in recent congresses the senate has agreed to the funding resolution by unanimous consent without much if any floor discussion if committee requires additional funds after the omnibus resolution has been adopted it may request these funds in the same way it did for its twoyear budget the senate has minimized the need for supplemental funding however by allowing committees to use unspent funds from one period specified in the omnibus resolution during the next funding period5 since 1999 the omnibus funding resolution has contained special reserve from which unexpected funding needs by any senate committee could be met upon the request of its chair and ranking member and with the approval of the chair and ranking member of the rules and administration committee senate rule xxvii requires that each committees staff should reflect the relative number of majority and minority members of committees and that the minority receive fair consideration in the appointment of staff majority of the minority party members of committee may request at least onethird of the personnel funds for hiring minority staff this ratio is calculated after excluding funds for staff if any who perform administrative and clerical functions for the committee as whole as agreed to by the chair and ranking minority member in the 107th and 108th congresses the senate set aside these provisions authorizing an equal allocation of staff between the parties in the 107th congress and proportional allocation of staff in the 108th congress in both instances the agreements were entered into only for the congress then underway in both instances as well the agreement authorized the exclusion from the partisan staff calculations of administrative staff performing services for the committee as whole committee staff may also be supplemented by consultants and staff detailed to the committee from federal agencies such staff arrangements are subject to regulations that may be imposed by the committee on rules and administration 5 the senate funding resolutions provide funds for three specific calendar periodsfrom mar 1 to sept 30 of the first year of congress from oct 1 to sept 30 of the following year and from oct 1 to the following feb 28 this permits the senate to identify more precisely the amounts authorized for each fiscal year and the subsequent appropriations required crs9 table 1 house committee funding committee requests and house
