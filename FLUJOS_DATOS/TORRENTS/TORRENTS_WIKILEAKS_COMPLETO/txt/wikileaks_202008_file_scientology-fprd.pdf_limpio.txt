note neglect of this pol ltr has caused great hardship on staffs has cost countless millions and made it necessary in 1970 to engage in an all out international effort to restore basic scientology over the world within 5 years after the issue of this pl with off the lines violation had almost destroyed orgs quickie grades entered in and denied gain to tens of thousands of cases therefore actions which neglect or violate this policy letter are high crimes resulting in comm evs on administrators and executives it is not entirely tech matter as its neglect destroys orgs and caused 2 year slump it is the business of every staff member to enforce it all levels keeping scientology working hco sec or communicator hat check on all personnel and new personnel as taken on we have some time since passed the point of achieving uniformly workable technology the only thing now is getting the technology applied if you cant get the technology applied then you cant deliver whats promised its as simple as that if you can get the technology applied you can deliver whats promised the only thing you can be upbraided for by students or pcs is results trouble spots occur only where there are results attacks from governments or monopolies occur only where there are results or bad results therefore the road before scientology is clear and its ultimate success is assured if the technology is applied so it is the task of the assn or org sec the hco sec the case supervisor the d of p the d of t and all staff members to get the correct technology applied getting the correct technology applied consists of one having the correct technology two knowing the technology three knowing it is correctfour teaching correctly the correct technology five applying the technology six seeing that the technology is correctly applied seven hammering out of existence incorrect technology eight knocking out incorrect applications nine closing the door on any possibility of incorrect technology ten closing the door on incorrect application one above has been done two has been achieved by many three is achieved by the individual applying the correct technology in proper manner and observing that it works that way four is being done daily successfully in most parts of the world five is consistently accomplished daily six is achieved by instructors and supervisors consistently seven is done by few but is weak point eight is not worked on hard enough nine is impeded by the reasonable attitude of the not quite bright ten is seldom done with enough ferocity seven eight nine and ten are the only places scientology can bog down in any area the reasons for this are not hard to find weak certainty that it works in three above can lead to weakness in seven eight nine and ten b further the nottoobright have bad point on the button selfimportance c the lower the iq the more the individual is shut off from the fruits of observation d the service facs of people make them defend themselves against anything they confront good or bad and seek to make it wrong the bank seeks to knock out the good and perpetuate the bad thus we as scientologists and as an organization must be very alert to seven eight nine and ten in all the years i have been engaged in research i have kept my comm lines wide open for research data i once had the idea that group could evolve truth third of century has thoroughly disabused of that idea willing as i was to accept suggestions and data only handful of suggestions less than twenty had long run value and none were major or basic and when i did accept major or basic suggestions and used them we went astray and i repented and eventually had to eat crow on the other hand there have been thousands and thousands of suggestions and writings which if accepted and acted upon would have resulted in the complete destruction of all our work as well as the sanity of pcs so i know what group of people will do and how insane they will go in accepting unworkable technology by actual record the percentages areabout twenty to 100000 that group of human beings will dream up bad technology to destroy good technology as we could have gotten along without suggestions then we had better steel ourselves to continue to do so now that we have made it this point will of course be attacked as unpopular egotistical and undemocratic it very well may be but it is also survival point and i dont see that popular measures self abnegation and democracy have done anything for man but push him further into the mud currently popularity endorse degraded novels self abnegation has filled the south east asian jungles with stone idols and corpses and democracy has given us inflation and income tax our technology has not been discovered by group true if the group had supported in many ways i could not have discovered it either but it remains that in its formative stages it was not discovered by group then group efforts one can safely assume will not add to it or successfully alter it in the future i can only say this now that it is done there remains of course group tabulation or coordination of what has been done which will be valuableonly so long as it does not seek to alter basic principles and successful applications the contributions that were worth while in this period of forming the technology were help in the form of friendship of defence of organization of dissemination of application of advices on results and of finance these were great contributions and were and are appreciated many thousands contributed in this way and made us what we are discovery contribution was not however part of the broad picture we will not speculate here on why this was so or how i came to rise above the bank we are dealing only in facts and the above is factthe group left to its own devices would not have evolved scientology but with wild dramatization of the bank called new ideas would have wiped it out supporting this is the fact that man has never before evolved workable mental technology and emphasizing it is the vicious technology he did evolvepsychiatry psychology surgery shock treatment whips duress punishment etc ad infinitum so realize that we have climbed out of the mud by whatever good luck and good sense and refuse to sink back into it again see that seven eight nine and ten above are ruthlessly followed and we will never be stopped relax them get reasonable about it and we will perish so far while keeping myself in complete communication with all suggestions i have not failed on seven eight nine and ten in areas i could supervise closely but its not good enough for just myself and few others to work at this whenever this control as per seven eight nine and ten has been relaxed the whole organizational area has failed witness elizabeth ny wichita the early organizations and groups they crashed only because i longer did seven eight nine and ten then when they were all messed up you saw the obvious reasons for failure but ahead of that they ceased to deliver and that involved them in other reasons the common denominator of group is the reactive bank thetans without banks have different responses they only have their banks in common they agree then only on bank principles person to person the bank is identical so constructive ideas are individual and seldom get broad agreement in human group an individual must rise above an avid craving for agreement from humanoid group to get anything decent done the bankagreement has been what has made earth helland if you were looking for hell and found earth it would certainly serve war famine agony and disease has been the lot of man right now the great governments of earth have developed the means of frying every man woman and child on the planet that is bank that is the result of collective thought agreement the decent pleasant things on this planet come from individual actions and ideas that have somehow gotten by the group idea for that matter look how we ourselves are attacked by public opinion media yet there is more ethical group on this planet than ourselvesthus each one of us can rise above the domination of the bank and then as group of freed beings achieve freedom and reason it is only the aberrated group the mob that is destructive when you dont do seven eight nine and ten actively you are working for the bank dominated mob for it will surely surely introduce incorrect technology and swear by it b apply technology as incorrectly as possible c open the door to any destructive idea and d encourage incorrect application its the bank that says the group is all and the individual nothing its the bank that says we must fail so just dont play that tune do seven eight nine and ten and you will knock out of your road all the future thorns heres an actual example in which senior executive had to interfere because of pc spin case supervisor told instructor to have auditor b run process x on preclear c auditor b afterwards told instructor that it didnt work instructor was weak on three above and didnt really believe in seven eight nine and ten so instructor told the case supervisor process x didnt work on preclear c now this strikes directly at each of one to six above in preclear c auditor b instructor and the case supervisor it opens the door to the introduction of new technology and to failure what happened here instructor didnt jump down auditor bs throat thats all that happened this is what he should have done grabbed the auditors report and looked it over when higher executive on this case did so she found what the case supervisor and the rest missed that process x increased preclear cs ta to 25 ta divisions for the session but that near session end auditor b qed and aed with cognition and abandoned process x while it still gave high ta and went off running one of auditor bs own manufacture which nearly spun preclear c auditor bs iq on examination turned out to be about 75 instructor was found to have huge ideas of how you must never invalidate anyone even lunatic the case supervisor was found to be too busy with admin to have any time for actual cases all right theres an all too typical example the instructor should have done seven eight nine and ten this would have begun this way auditor b that process x didnt work instructor what exactly did you do wrong instant attack wheres your auditors report for the session good look here you were getting lot of ta when you stopped process x what did you do then the pc wouldnt have come close to spin and all four of these would have retained certainty in year i had four instances in one small group where the correct process recommended was reported not to have worked but on review found that each one had increased the ta b had been abandoned and c had been falsely reported as unworkable also despite this abuse in each of these four cases the recommended correct process cracked the case yet they were reported as not having worked similar examples exist in instruction and these are all the more deadly as every time instruction in correct technology is flubbed then the resulting error uncorrected in the auditor is perpetuated on every pc that auditor audits thereafter so seven eight nine and ten are even more important in course than in supervision of cases heres an example rave recommendation is given graduating student because he gets more ta on pcs than any other student on the course figures of 435 ta divisions session are reported of course his model session is poor but its just knack he has is also included in the recommendation careful review is undertake because nobody at levels to iv is going to get that much ta on pcs it is found that this student was never taught to read an emeter dial and instructor observed his handling of meter and it was not discovered that he overcompensated nervously swinging the ta 2 or 3 divisions beyond where it needed togo to place the needle at set so everyone was about to throw away standard processes and model session because this one student got such remarkable ta they only read the reports and listened to the brags and never looked at this student the pcs in actual fact were making slightly less than average gain impeded by rough model session and misworded processes thus what was making the pcs win actual scientology was hidden under lot of departures and errors i recall one student who was squirreling on an academy course and running lot of offbeat whole track on other students after course hours the academy students were in state of electrification on all these new experiences and werent quickly brought under control and the student himself never was given the works on seven eight nine and ten so they stuck subsequently this student prevented another squirrel from being straightened out and his wife died of cancer resulting from physical abuse hard tough instructor at that moment could have salvaged two squirrels and saved the life of girl but students had right to do whatever they pleased squirreling going off into weird practices or altering scientology only comes about from noncomprehension usually the noncomprehension is not of scientology but some earlier contact with an offbeat humanoid practice which in its turn was not understood when people cant get results from what they think is standard practice they can be counted upon to squirrel to some degree the most trouble in the past two years came from orgs where an executive in each could not assimilate straight scientology under instruction in scientology they were unable to define terms or demonstrate examples of principles and the orgs where they were got into plenty of trouble and worse it could not be straightened out easily because neither one of these people could or would duplicate instructions hence debacle resulted in two places directly traced to failures of instruction earlier so proper instruction is vital the d of t and his instructors and all scientology instructors must be merciless in getting four seven eight nine and ten into effective action that one student dumb and impossible though he may seem and of use to anyone may yet some day be the cause of untold upset because nobody was interested enough to make sure scientology got home to him with what we know now there is student we enrol who cannot be properly trained as an instructor one should be very alert to slow progress and should turn the sluggards inside out personally system will do it only you or with our sleeve rolled up can crack the back of bad studenting and we can only do it on an individual student never on whole class only hes slow something is awful wrong take fast action to correct it dont wait until next week by then hes got other messes stuck to him if you cant graduate them with their good sense appealed to and wisdom shining graduate them in such state of shock theyll have nightmares if they contemplate squirreling then experience will gradually bring about three in them and theyll know better than to chase butterflies when they should be auditing when somebody enrols consider he or she has joined up for the duration of the universe never permit an openminded approach if theyre going to quit let then quit fast if they enroled theyre aboard and if theyre aboard theyre here on the same terms as the rest of us win or die in the attempt never let them be halfminded about being scientologists the finest organizations in history have been tough dedicated organizations not one nambypamby bunch of pantywaist dilettantes have ever made anything its tough universe the social veneer makes it seem mild but only the tigers surviveand even they have hard time well survive because we are tough and are dedicated when we do instruct somebody properly he becomes more and more tiger when we instruct halfmindedly and are afraid to offend scared to enforce we dont make students into good scientologists and that lets everybody down when mrs pattycake comes to us to be taught turn that wandering doubt in he eye into fixed dedicated glare and shell win and well all win humour her and we all die little the proper instruction attitude is youre here so youre scientologist now were going to make you into an expert auditor matter what happens wed rather have you dead that incapablefitting that into the economics of the situation and lack of adequate time and you see the cross we have to bear but we wont have to bear it forever the bigger we get the more economics and time we will have to do our job and the only things which can prevent us from getting that big fast are areas in from one to ten keep those in mind and well be able to grow fast and as we grow our shackles will be less and less failing to keep one to ten will make us grow less so the ogre which might eat us up is not the government or the high priests its our possible failure to retain and practise our technology an instructor or supervisor or executive must challenge with ferocity instances of unworkability they must uncover what did happen what was run and what was done or not done if you have one and two you can only acquire three for all by making sure of all the rest were not playing some minor game in scientology it isnt cute or something to do for lack of something better the whole agonized future of this planet every man woman and child on it and your own destiny for the next endless trillions of years depends on what you do here and now with and in scientology this is deadly serious activity and if we miss getting out of the trap now we may never again have another chance remember this is our first chance to do so in all the endless trillions of years of the past dont muff it now because it seems unpleasant or unsocial to do seven eight nine and ten do them and well win l ron hubbard founder lrhntrd copyright 1965 1970 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office

broke the field and downgraded the academy and sh courses condition of treason or cancellation of certificates or dismissal and full investigation of the background of any person found guilty will be activated in the case of anyone committing the following high crimes 1 abbreviating an official course in dianetics and scientology so as to lose the full theory processes and effectiveness of the subjects 2 adding comments to checksheets or instructions labelling any material background or not used now or old or any similar action which will result in the student not knowing using and applying

remaining in use meanwhile any such comments as historical background not used old etc or verbally stating it to students 5 permitting pc to attest to more than one grade at time on the pcs own determinism without hint or evaluation 6 running only one process for grade between 0 to iv 7 failing to use all processes for level8 boasting as to speed of delivery in session such as i put in grade zero in 3 minutes etc 9 shortening time of application of auditing for financial or laborsaving considerations 10 acting in any way calculated to lose the technology of dianetics and scientology to use or impede its use or shorten its materials or its application reason the effort to get students through courses and get pcs processed in orgs was considered best handled by reducing materials or deleting processes from grades the pressure exerted to speed up student completions and auditing completions was mistakenly answered by just not delivering the correct way to speed up students progress is by using 2 way comm and applying the study materials to students the best way to really handle pcs is to ensure they make each level fully before going on to the next and repairing them when they do not the puzzle of the decline of the entire scientology network in the late 60s is entirely answered by the actions taken to shorten time in study and in processing by deleting materials and actions reinstituting full use and delivery of dianetics and scientology is the answer to any recovery the product of an org is well taught students and thoroughly audited pcs when the product vanishes so does the org the orgs must survive for the sake of this planet l ron hubbard founder lrhntrd copyright 1970 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill

have had word squirreling it means altering scientology offbeat practices it is bad thing i have found way to explain why scientology is workable system this does not mean it is the best possible system or perfect system remember and use that definition scientology is workable system in fifty thousand years of history on this planet alone man never evolved workable system it is doubtful if in foreseeable history he will ever evolve another man is caught in huge and complex labyrinth to get out of it requires that he follow the closely taped path of scientology scientology will take him out of the labyrinth but only if he follows the exact markings in the tunnels it has taken third of century in this lifetime to tape this route out it has been proven that efforts by man to find different routes came to nothing it is also clear fact that the route called scientology does lead out of the labyrinth therefore it is workable system route that can be travelled what would you think of guide who because his party said it was dark and the road rough and who said another tunnel looked better abandoned the route he knew would lead out and led his party to lost nowhere in the dark youd think he was pretty wishywashy guide what would you think of supervisor who let student depart from procedure the supervisor knew worked youd think he was pretty wishywashy supervisor what would happen in labyrinth if the guide let some girl stop in pretty canyon and left her there forever to contemplate the rocks youd think he was pretty heartless guide youd expect him to say at least miss those rocks may be pretty but the road out doesnt go that way all right how about an auditor who abandons the procedure which will make his preclear eventually clear just because the preclear had cognition people have following the route mixed up with the right to have their own ideas anyone is certainly entitled to have opinions and ideas and cognitionsso long as these do not bar the route out for self and others scientology is workable system it white tapes the road out of the labyrinth if there were white tapes marking the right tunnels man would just go on wandering around and around the way he has for eons darting off on wrong roads going in circles ending up in the sticky dark alonescientology exactly and correctly followed takes the person up and out of the mess so when you see somebody having ball getting everyone to take peyote because it restimulates prenatals know he is pulling people off the route realize he is squirreling he isnt following the route scientology is new thing it is road out there has not been one not all the salesmanship in the world can make bad route proper route and an awful lot of bad routes are being sold their end product is further slavery more darkness more misery scientology is the only workable system man has it has already taken people toward higher iq better lives and all that other system has so realize that it has competitor scientology is workable system it has the route taped the search is done now the route only needs to be walked so put the feet of students and preclears on that route dont let them off of it matter how fascinating the side roads seem to them and move them on up and out squirreling is today destructive of workable system dont let your party down by whatever means keep them on the route and theyll be free if you dont they wont l ron hubbard founder lrhntrd copyright 1965 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 15

list and hco b list of level ii page 4 hco pl 26172 issue vi concerning withholds and overts 2 admin knowhowalteris and degraded beings hco b 22 mar 67 there are two special cases of withholds and overts they do not occur in all cases by long ways but they do occur on few cases these are continuous missed withholds and continuous overts this is not quite the same as the continuing overt act hco b 29 september 65 in that type the person is repeating overt acts against something usually named the continuous missed wh continuous missed withhold occurs when person feels some way and anyone who sees him misses it example doctor feels very unconfident of his skill every patient who sees him misses the fact that he is not confident this reacts as missed withhold it is of course based upon some bad incident that destroyed his confidence usually of an engramic intensity but as the person actively withholds this then those seeing him miss the withhold this could work in thousands of variations woman feels continuous disdain for her child but withholds it the child therefore continuously misses withhold all the phenomena of the missed wh would continuously react against the child probably all dishonest social conduct brings about continuous missed withhold the politician who hates people the minister who longer believes in god the mechanic who privately believes he is jinx on machinery these all then set up the phenomena of missed withholds on themselves and can dramatize it in their conduct the continuous overt person who believes he is harmful to others may also believe that many of his common ordinary actions are harmful he may feel he is committing continuous overt on others example clothing model believes she is committing fraud on older women by displaying clothing to them in which they will look poorly in her estimation this is continuous overt act of course all older women miss it on herappearance just being alive can be considered by some as an overt missed withhold phenomena will result degraded beings the continuous withhold and continuous overt are probably basis of feeling degraded degraded beings as described in admin knowhowalteris and degraded beings hco b 22 mar 67 are that way at least in part because they have some continuous missed withhold or fancied continuous overt act this makes them feel degraded and act that way handling one can add to any program check for continuous missed withhold or continuous overt as an additional version of rudiments master question which could be broken down into three lists which would have to be done by the laws of ln would be when anyone looks at you what feeling action attitude of yours do they miss then when was it missed who missed it and what did he do that made you believe it had been missed another approach less dangerous in that lists arent made would be for continuous missed withhold the question could be is there some way you feel that others dont realize and with 2wc uncover it then ask who misses this with answer followed by when has someone missed it with to an earlier time followed by what did he or she do that made you think he or she knew this will key it out and can change behavior for continuous overt act it would be is there something you do that others do not know about with 2wc to cover it and get what it is then ask who has not found out about it with an answer and then when did someone almost find out what did he or she do that made you think he or she knew each of the above questions should be fned motion people who have continuous withholds or overts tend to be very slow flubby and impositive they have to be very careful and they make mistakes slowness or robotness are keys to the presence of continuous missed withholds or overts pts quite often case is falsely labeled pts when in fact it is really matter of continuous missed withholds and continuous overts when pts person does not respond to pts handling easily then you know you are dealing with continuous missed withholds andor continuous overtssummary these conditions are not present in all cases when they are you have degraded being when pts person does not respond to pts handling try

pts handlings that didnt work or still pts or some such or ill come across such extremes as pts is virtually an incurable leper to be shunned and kept isolated or almost everyone is pts to some degree so what can you really do about it the basic thing to realize is that ptsness like any other case condition afflicting man responds to plain old standard tech but one has to have studied and understood that tech to apply it naturally i recall years ago in handling ptses that none of them at first knew what pts really meant or what it was all about even when they used the term freely so i recently called for pilot to see what would be the effect of study method of curing ptses first pilot before the final pilot was done an earlier pilot was attempted by an aide which was not conducted as laid down cs5 reviewed the failed pilot to find why so many failed on it 4 out of 6 were never completed and the 2 that did failed cs5 reported what i found on these was that they uniformly were not pts in the first place or were pts but that was not the major trouble with the person three of the cases 2 on auditing and i on study were outethics rsing exp dn cases who were trying to use pts as the reason for their behavior thus handling their ptsness would not resolve anything the most interesting case here was the study one who realized that he was not pts and that that had been wrong indication and that what was really wrong with him was that he had bad intentions and was committing overts one of the audited cases had similar realization but has not done as well on post and did get very sick 2 months or so later of the other 3 pilot cases in this first batch one could only come up with intheorg terminals so is another exp dn case and the other 2 assigned to study were severely bugged students so never got off the ground one has now finished the course 4 months later so thats what happened to the original pilot the second pilot was then ordered to determine the original possibility that people could study their way out of being pts second pilot three were put onto the ptssp checksheet to study and three were handled by internes who had done the ptssp checksheet themselves the cases handled by auditinginterview steps completed their handlings within 10 hours the study cases averaged 46 weeks of parttime study two studiers from the original pilot also completed the course all were then watched for bad originations to the examiner medical reports ethics trouble or trouble on post in all cases including those not yet complete on study none of these indicators showed up one case originated case troubles but this turned out to be one of the exp dn cases not ptsness on the study pilot the daily reports and success stories on completion uniformly mention more certainty more stability and being more at cause with the data of particular interest is that three of the participants cogged they were not actually pts yet evidence of real pts sits hadgotten them on the project but while they were studying they would align past pts handlings they didnt fully understand at the time spot why past pts terminals were correct or incorrect spot terminals who gave them hard time in the past and see why certain people behaved the way they did in short it appears the studiers were blowing charge on their past pts handlings and on terminals in their life almost like an auditing session and while they were saying not pts longer pts now that they had the data is probably closer to the truth all are reported to be doing well on post with illness rollercoaster or ethics trouble the pts handlers who had done the ptssp pack were of particular use where the person had study bug that needed handling before study could be done and assisting in working out the handlings for pts sits that were uncovered also sds and 10 aug hcob handlings and pts interviews are not solo actions and it takes hours not intensives to handle false pts as noted from the first pilot false ptsness must be watched for as unhattedness ignorance of scientology basics for handling life past bad auditing uncorrected as well as unhandled bad intentions and personal outethics can be mistaken for ptsness and wont resolve as ptsness this should be suspected when your ptses start going above 20 of staff and public summary we have had the tech of ptsness for years but it wasnt being fully used and then got mixed in with exp dn ptsness can be handled routinely when the tech is fully known and applied pts person can be brought to cause over his situation through study of the pts tech this is vitally important for staff we can handle and the person himself can handle there is substitute for understanding lrhjent l ron hubbard copyright 1976 founder by l ron

that asking directly for evil purposes as part of sec checking has been knocked out of use over the years by sps it recently occurred that in using sec checking to clean up several persons who had gotten into ethics trouble on their posts peculiar phenomenon and pattern came to light the persons being handled had been asked for overts before and had gotten them off but would continue committing the overts in each case they had blamed their difficulty on having been the effect of false data and black pr fed them by bad hats long since detected and removed from the area however these particular cases did not straighten out with deptsing actions these persons were then asked directly for evil purposes and this action finally got to the root of the matter apparent sequence apparently the sequence with such persons is they get off overts but then continue committing them b when overt products and flaps in their areas get investigated they palm it off as having gone effect of others black pr or false data in other words the person appears to be ptsc they manage to convince those doing the investigating that thats the end of the investigation d if something flaps they get off some overts and start the cycle again at in other words they were actively committing suppressive actions while pretending to be pts and were busy making people around them feel pts while apparently the effect of suppression or black pr they were actually generating it themselves originating black pr to cover their own overt acts what had been omitted in the handlings these persons had gotten previously was the full followthrough because routine pts tech would of course not handle someone who was on the other side of the coinand by pursuing it all the way through it would have exposed the pretense we have in the through d sequence above the exact mechanism by which such people skid through the lines undetected this may explain great deal to many executives who have ordered staff handled and then have had to conclude that the tech didnt work because the staff wasnt handled what had actually occurred is that evil purposes had been omitted from sec checking tech with malice aforethought and that pts checks did not include checks for evil purposes this sequence shows the exact failure to handle people in rpfs etc handling in handling pts the cs must monitor the persons progress closely this means inspection of all interviews and session worksheets observing the results of each pts handling action his change of position or lack of on the chart of human evaluation as evident from the pc folder and so forth also it is important that the ethics officer advise the d of p when staff or public person is undergoing an ethics or justice action so that this can be noted in the persons pc folder in this way the cs can also find out if the pc has landed in ethics trouble ref hcob 13 oct 82 cs series 116 ethics and the cs if the person is not making change or repeatedly slipping into further outethics behavior the cs must recognize this it is possibly the to d sequence above in action if the cs suspects this to be the case his action is to begin to handle the case with sec checking by competent sec checker and such sec checking must include questions about the persons purposes and intentions instead of only sec checking on for example have you committed an overt on the org one would also ask have you had an evil purpose regarding the org handled standardly in this way the person can be expected to experience tremendous relief and case change caution if person is progressing well on deptsing program such as pts interview pts rd suppressed person rd is making change keeping his personal ethics in and moving up the chart of human evaluation then it would be cs error to suddenly interject sec check into his programethics none of this sets aside standard ethics and justice procedures such person as would be found with pretendedpts situation is quite likely already under some justice action and in fact doesnt deserve immediate handling other than what hco deals out summary some executives have gotten in the frame of mind that it is waste of time trying to handle bad hat it is true the bad hat probably doesnt deserve to be handled but it is nevertheless true that we do have the tools to handle one were not out to handle the insane but whether we like it or not we live in pretty insane civilization any data which handles that or amplifies it technically or solves it is of course extremely vital l ron hubbard

class viiis class viii chksheet cs series 22 psychosis through slight change of procedure on certain preclears i have been able to view the underlying motives and mechanisms of psychosis very possibly this is the first time the mechanisms which bring about insanity have been fully viewed i must say that it requires bit of confronting the alleviation of the condition of insanity has also been accomplished now and the footnote in dianetics the modern science of mental health concerning future research into this field can be considered fulfilled the things cs should know about insanity are as follows higher percent about 15 to 20 of the human race apparently is insane or certainly much higher percent than was estimated the truly insane do not necessarily act insane visibly they are not the psychiatric obvious cases who go rigid for years or scream for days this is observed only in the last stages or during temporary stress under apparent social behavior the continual crimes knowingly committed by the insane are much more vicious than ever has been catalogued in psychiatric texts the actions of the insane are not unconscious they are completely aware of what they are doing all insane actions are entirely justified and seem wholly rational to them as they have reality on the harmful and irrational nature of their conduct it does not often register on an meter the product of their post duties is destructive but is excused as ignorance or errors as cases in normal processing they roller coaster continually they nearly always have fixed emotional tone it does not vary in nearly all insane people in very few it is cyclic high then low all characteristics classified as those of the suppressive person are in fact those of an insane person the easiest ways for cs to detect the insane are1 pretending to do post or duties the real consistent result is destructive to the group in terms of breakage lost items injured business etc 2 the case is case gain or roller coaster and is covered under pts symptoms 3 they are usually chronically physically ill 4 they have deep but carefully masked hatred of anyone who seeks to help them 5 the result of their help is actually injurious 6 they often seek transfers or wish to leave 7 they are involved in warfare with conflicts around them which are invisible to others one wonders how they can be so involved or get so involved in so much hostility types the german psychiatric 1500 or so different types of insanity are just different symptoms of the same cause there is only one insanity and from it springs different manifestations psychiatry erred in calling these different types and trying to invent different treatments definition insanity can now be precisely defined the definition is insanity is the overt or covert but always complex and continuous determination to harm or destroy possibly the only frightening thing about it is the cleverness with which it can be hidden whereas sane person can become angry or upset and bit destructive for short periods he or she recovers the insane mask it are misemotional continuously and do not recover except by modern processing the nature of man man is basically good this is obvious for when he begins to do evil he seeks to destroy his memory in order to change and seeks to destroy his body he seeks to check his evil impulses by inhibiting his own skill and strength he can act in very evil fashion but his basic nature then makes it mandatory that he lessens himself in many ways the towering strength of madman is rarity and is compensated by efforts at self destruction mans mortality his one life fixation all stem from his efforts to check himself obliterate his memory in fruitless effort to change his conduct and his selfdestructive habits and impulses and losses of skills and abilities as this rationale proves out completely in processing and fits all cases observed we have for the first time proof of his actual natureas only around 20 are insane and as those who previously worked in the mental field were themselves mainly insane man as whole has been assigned an evil repute govemments where such personalities exist listen to the opinion of the insane and apply the characteristic of 20 to the entire hundred percent this gives an 80 wrong diagnosis which is why mental science itself was destructive when used by states techniques the only technique available at this writing which will benefit the insane is contained in all the overtmotivator sequences and grade ii technology at flag at this writing new improvement on this exists but it is so powerful that slight errors in use can cause psychotic break in the insane it therefore will only be exported for use by specially trained persons and this programming will require quite while meanwhile it helps the cs to know and use these firm rules always run dianetic triples never run singles the overt side flow 2 is vital if you only run flow 1 motivators the pc will not recover fully further running flow 1 motivator only any psychotic being processed will not recover but may even trigger into psychotic break if one never ran anything but motivators psychotic manifestations would not erase depend on expanded grade ii technology to ease off or handle the insane dont keep asking whats been done to him as hell trigger new discovery on this is that when you run out the motivator the person gets higher reality on his overts if you ran out all his motivators he would have reason for his overts if these are not then run out he might cave himself in pattern of behavior the apparent pattern of insane behavior is to come in ask for processing go on staff etc with the advertised intention of being helped or helping then mess up either as pc or on post then state how bad it all is and leave it looks obvious enough he came found it bad left that is only the apparent behavior apparent reasons based on numerous cases this is the real cycle hearing of something good that might help these hateful awful rotten nasty people the psycho comes in wrecks this upsets that caves in this one chops up that one and when somebody says the psychotic either caves himself in physically or b runs away the psychotic is motivated by intent to harm if he realizes he is harming things he shouldnt he caves himself in if he is afraid he will be found out he runsin the psychotic the impulse is quite conscious conclusion none of this is very nice it is hard to confront even i find it so freud thought all men had hidden monster in them for he dealt mainly with the psychotic and their behavior was what he saw all men are not like this the percentage that are is greater than i supposed but is long way from all men sometimes one only becomes aware of these when things are getting worked on and improved they stay on as long as it can be made bad or there is hope it can be destroyed then when attention is given to improvement they blow artists writers often have these types hanging around them as there is someone or something there to be destroyed when success or failure to destroy or possible detection appears on the scene they blow often as destructively as possible orgs are subjected to lot of this psychotic sometimes succeeds in blowing off good staff and then sooner or later realizes how evil he is acting and sickens or leaves the society is not geared to any of this at all the insane walk around wrecking the place and decent people think its human nature or inevitable or bad childhood as of this writing the insane can be handled the proof of any pudding is the processing and this is successful it is also rather swift but as i say it is so swift the special technique has to be done by the specially trained flubless auditor for long while ive realized that we would have to be able to handle insane people as the psychiatrist is fading i have had opportunity to work on the problem and have it handled until it is fully released the cs will benefit greatly from knowing the above as these come on his lines far more often than he has suspected the insane can be helped they are not hopeless i trust this data will

major aberrations is to have new life to understand this one must understand the most severe aberration which is psychosis the actual basis of all psychosis is motive it is not competence or incompetence below all psychotic conduct lies an evil purpose because psychiatry and psychology did not have this single technical fact they defined psychosis as incompetence had the wrong target and so could not and never did understand psychosis and were thereby led into atrocities such as shocks and brain surgery and in the country where these subjects originated germany slaughtered 300000 insane in gas chambers some time before hitler came to power true psychotic can be brilliant or stupid competent or incompetent it is his general motive or purpose that determines whether or not he is insane or sane famous psychotics like napoleon ivan the terrible stalin and hitler were all quite brilliant yet wound up destroying everything in sight including their own people they had destructive basic purpose every psychotic has one it is usually covert hidden but in full play against his unsuspecting friends the sole difference in motive is whether it is destructive or constructive everyone has basic purpose the psychotic has destructive one the test of personality then is whether the result of persons activity is destructive or constructive man is basically good when he finds he is being too destructive he recognizes he is bad for others and seeks to leave he will also try to become less powerful ill or to kill himself the progress of psychosis then begins with belief something is evil this is followed with an effort to stop it this stop becomes general basic purpose is then formed which contains an evil intentthe being then goes on from disaster to disaster seeking overtly or covertly to destroy everything around him at guess about 15 to 25 of living human beings are psychotic and bring covert disaster to those around them and themselves the evil purpose is expressed by committing harmful acts and withholding them ordinary overtwithhold processes as in grade ii expanded can handle this condition providing the person can be audited and providing the evil purpose is also brought to view about 13rd of the psychotics handled in this way recover their sanity fully and lead constructive decent lives twothirds are either so far gone or irresponsible hard to audit that they improve but are of little use those already subjected to the brutalities of psychiatric treatment or psychological counseling are the most difficult those who have been on drugs particularly lsd

criminal is one who is motivated by evil intentions and who has committed so many harmful overt acts that he considers such activities ordinary there is datum of value in detecting overts and withholds in criminal individuals the criminal accuses others of things which he himself is doing as an example the psychiatrist accuses others engaged in mental practice of harming others or worsening their condition yet the majority of psychiatrists maim and kill their patients and by record in all history have only worsened mental conditions after all thats what they seem to be paid to do by the government the psychologist accuses others of misrepresenting what they do and lobbies in legislature continually to outlaw others on the accusation of misrepresenting but there is psychologist who doesnt know that he himself is fake can accomplish nothing of value and that his certificates arent even worth the printing ink the psychologist goes further he educates little children in all the schools to believe all men are soulless animals and criminals so that when the possible day of reckoning comes and the psychologist is exposed for what he is the population will not be the least bit surprised and will consider the psychologist is normal the psychologist accuses others of sexual irregularities when this is actually his entire profession jack the ripper of english fame who gruesomely murdered prostitutes now turns out to have been medical doctor and was undoubtedly of enormous assistance to the police in pointing out the real murderer the fbi agent or executive accuses others of graft and even sets up abscams to manufacture the crime but an fbi agent regularly pockets money supposed to be paid to informers and then screams to protect informer sources that do not exist the fbi agent is terrified of being infiltrated and accuses others of it when as standard practice he infiltrates groups manufactures evidence and then gets others charged for crimes his own plants have committed the fbi acts like terrorist group posing as law enforcement officers their targets seem to be legislators and congress and public individuals who might someday have power over public opinion such as martin luther king jr from all this we get another datum the criminal mind relentlessly seeks to destroy anyone it imagines might expose it you have to be very alert when criminals are around j edgar hoover who organized the present fbi and is still deified by it they have his name in huge brass letters on washington dcs biggest thoroughfareand that town doesnteven have the names of former presidents up in lightshas been shown by subsequent records to have been blackmailer and traitor to his country he carefully personally sat on the information for four months that pearl harbor was going to happen right up to the us entrance into world war ii he was autographing his photo for pals in the deadly german ss he even sacked an fbi agent tureau who dared to catch some german spies doctors psychologists psychiatrists and the government form tight clique only the government would support such people as the public hates them from all this we get another datum individuals with criminal minds tend to band together since the presence of other criminals about them tends to prove their own distorted ideas of man in general it is not true that where any person accuses another of crime the accuser is always guilty of the crime or that type of cri tme but it is true that when criminal is doing the accusing it is more than probable that the criminal is disclosing his own type of crime apparently they add it up this way if i accuse him of robbing then it would be assumed by others that i have not robbed bank by loudly voicing condemnation of crime the criminal with crooked think supposes people will now suppose he is above bank robbery and wont suspect him groups like psychologists who declare as fact that all men are criminals are of course just dramatizing their own inclinations people assume that others have their own case the psychologist pushes his own case off on the whole world anyone researching in the mind should be very aware of this point and be sure not to do it subjective reality seems to them to be the only reality there is for such people are too introverted to really know the minds and motivations of others when working with the criminal one can get very good idea of that persons own mental state by getting him to say what other people want and do or are guilty of it is inconceivable to the criminal that anyone could possibly be decent or honest or do selfless act it would do good whatever to try to convince him for he knows all men are like himself thus one gets another datum of value the criminal only sees others as he himself is one of the reasons he does this of course is to justify injuring others because everyone else is useless worthless criminal an animal and insane why then he reasons it is perfectly all right to injure them thus we come to another datum the criminal is not much benefited by the giving off of current withholds and is not likely to reform because of this one therefore has to get down to the basic evil intentions as in expanded dianetics there is another approach in that same area of technology which is finding what act the person really can take responsibility for it is gradient approach the criminal is basically so subjective that an auditor will find in the short run that improving the reality of such person is needful before any effective overall improvement is obtained through pulling withholdsthus trs and 8c and even arc straightwire are indicated as first steps if these are done and as responsibility rises expect that overts could begin to pop up almost of their own accord it is interesting that if criminal were to face up suddenly to the enormity of his crimes he would go into degradation and selfdestruction thus gradient scale is definitely indicated as the person has more r reality he can take more responsibility and only then with pulling withholds can he have any real benefit this hcob is simply some data on the criminal mind that might help at the very least it should give some understanding of why some individuals insist with such apparent conviction that all men are evil why all men are insane why all men are criminals and it also tells you how silly it is to try to argue with them whos there the criminal mind is bitter and unsavory subject the percentage of criminals is relatively small but the majority of grief and turmoil in the world caused by criminals is majority percent thus the criminal mind is subject one cannot avoid in research as it is major factor in the distortion of culture it is mind like any other mind but it has gone wrong it is motivated by evil intentions which even if idiotic are greater than the possessors ability to reason the criminal even when he seems most clever is really very very stupid the evil intentions get dramatized by senseless overt acts which are then withheld and the final result is person who is more dead than alive and who faces future so agonizing that any person would shudder at it the criminal in fact has forfeited his life and any meaning to it even when he remains uncaught and unpunished for in the long run he has caught himself and punishes himself for all eternity common judge can give sentence as stiff as that they know down deep that this is true and that is why they scream with such ferocity that men have souls they cant confront the smallest part of what awaits them when you understand what the criminal mind consists of you can also understand how ghastly must be the feelings or lack of them with which the criminal has to live within himself and for all his days forever he is more to be pitied than punished neither bold nor brave for all his pretense he is really just panicky whimpering coward inside when he bares his breast against the bullets he does so with the actual hope that he will be killed but of course that doesnt save him hes got an eternity of it left to go and his scoff of any such data hides the whimper for he knows deep down its true thus we have another datum the criminal matter what harm he is doing to others is also seeking to destroy himself he is in protest against his own survival if you have to work with criminals in pastoring recognize what you are working with he can be helpedif he will let you near him fortunately there are still lot of decent people left in the world l ron hubbard founderhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 26 april 1982 remimeo the criminal mind and the psychs it has often been noted and reported routinely in the papers that criminals treated by psychologists and psychiatrists go out and commit crimes it could be suspected that these practitioners used paindrughypnosis and other means under the guise of treatment to induce the criminal to go out and commit more crimes and possibly they do but i have just made discovery that sheds some light on this scene morality and good conduct are sensible that is the theme of the way to happiness it follows and can be proven that immorality and bad conduct are stupid this bears out under further investigation one could lay aside the ancient greek speculations of good and bad and go on an easier and less contentious logic of bright and stupid anything that criminal seeks to obtain can be obtained without crime if one is bright enough criminals as police can tell you are usually very very stupid the things they do and clues they leave around are hallmarks of very low iq the bright criminal is found only in fiction now and then hitler comes along and begins myth that the highly positioned are criminalbut hitler and napoleon and all their ilk were stupid beyond belief hitler destroyed himself and germany didnt he and napoleon destroyed himself and france so not even the highly placed criminals are bright had they really been bright they could have accomplished successful reign without crime the bones of old civilizations are signboards of stupidity the jails are bursting with people so stupid they did bad things and even did those uncleverly so let us look at psychs againwhat they call treatment is suppression by shocks drugs etc of the ability to think they are not honest enough these psychs being just dramatizing psychotics themselves for the most part to publish the fact that all their treatments mayhem really when it is not murder make people more stupid these actions of shock and crazy evaluative counseling etc lower iq like an express elevator going down to the basement they do not tell legislators this or put it in their books this is why they say one can change iq they are hiding the fact that they ruin it so the psych in prisons is engaging in an action shocking or whatever that makes people who are already criminal even stupider although they obviously tell their victims to go out and commit more crimes the psychoanalysts urge wives to commit adultery for instance they would not have to do this at all to manufacture more crime their treatments make the criminals more stupid the stupid commit more crimes it is pretty simple really when you look at itwhy does the state support psychiatrists and psychologists because the state is stupid or does it want more citizens robbed and killed its one or the other take your choice one is bright and is moral and honest and does well or one is stupid and does badly the answer to crime is raising iq but only the scientologist can do that l ron hubbard founderhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex

would have solved crime all these remedies have proven blatantly false in very poor countries there is little crime the improving education it was tailored to social reform not teaching skills and it is total failure the fact that rewarding the underprivileged has simply wrecked schools and neighborhoods and cost billions is missing so who is they the psychologist and psychiatrist of course these were their crackpot remedies for crime and its wrecked civilization so what is the cause of crime the treatment of course electric shocks behavior modification abuse of the soul these are the causes of crime there would be criminals at all if the psychs had not begun to oppress beings into vengeance against society theres only one remedy for crimeget rid of the psychs they are causing it ah yes its true on cases and cases of research on criminals and whats it all go back to the psychs their brutality and heartlessness is renowned the data is rolling in any more you pick up off criminal or anyone send it in on crime we have an epidemic running on this planet the wrong causes psychs assign for crime plus their own treatments make them deadly virus the psychs should not be let to get away with treatment which amounts to criminal acts mayhem and murder they are not above the law in fact there are laws at all which protect them for what sane society would sanction crime against its citizens even as science they should be handled like any other criminals they are at best dramatizing psychotics and dangerous but more dangerous to society at large than the psychotics they keep in

hat the basis of insanity the suppressive person whom weve called merchant of fear or chaos merchant and which we can now technically call the suppressive person cant stand the idea of scientology if people became better the suppressive person would have lost the suppressive person answers this by attacking covertly or overtly scientology this thing is he thinks his mortal enemy since it undoes his or her good work in putting people down where they should be there are three operations such case seeks to engage upon regarding scientology to disperse it b to try to crush it and c to pretend it didnt exist dispersal would consist of several things such as attributing its source to others and altering its processes or structure if you feel bit dispersed reading this policy letter then realize it is about being whose whole protective colouration is to disperse others and so remain invisible such people generalize all entheta and create arc breaks madly the second b is done by covert or overt means covertly suppressive person leaves the org door unlocked loses the emeters runs up fantastic bills and energetically and unseen seeks to pull out the plug and get scientology poured down the drain we poor fools consider all this just human error or stupidity we rarely realize that such actions far from being accidents are carefully thought out the proof that this is so is simply if we fun down the source of these errors we wind up with only one or two people in the whole group now isnt it odd that the majorfry of errors that kept the group enturbulated were attributable to minority of peons present even very reasonable person could not make anything else out of that except that it was very odd and indicated that the minority mentioned were interested in smiashing the group and that the behaviour was not common to the whole groupmeaning it isnt normal behaviour these people arent communists or fascists or any other ists they are just very sick people they easily become parts of suppressive groups such as communists or fascists because these groups like criminals are suppressive the suppressive person is hard to spot because of the dispersal factor mentioned above one looks at them and has his attention dispersed by their everybody is bad the suppressive person who is vfsfbly seeking to knock out people or scientology is easy to see he or she is making such fuss about it the attacks are quite vicious and full of lies but even here when the suppressive person exists on the other side of potential trouble source visibility is not good one sees case going up and down on the other side of that case out of the auditors view is the suppressive person the whole trick they use is to generalize entheta everybody is bad the russians are all bad everybody hates you the people versus john doe on warrants the masses the secret police will get you suppressive groups use the arc break mechanisms of generalizing entheta so it seems everywherethe suppressive person is specialist in making others arc break with generalized entheta that is mostly lies he or she is also nogaincase so avid are such for the smashing of others by covert or overt means that their case is bogged and won it move under routfne processing the technical fact is that they have huge problem long gone and longer known even to themselves which they use hidden or forthright vicious acts continually to handle they do not act to solve the environment they are in they are solving one environment yesterdays in which they are stuck the only reason the insane were hard to understand is that they are handling situations which longer exist the situation probably existed at one time they think they have to hold their own with overts against nonexistent enemy to solve nonexistont problem because their overts are continuous they have withholds since such person has withholds he or she cant communicate freely to asis the block on the track that keeps them in some yesterday hence nocasegain that alone is the way to locate suppressive person by viewing the case never judge such person by their conduct that is too difficult judge by nocasegains dont even use tests one asks these questions 1 will the person permit auditing at all or 2 does their history of routine auditing reveal any gains if 1 is present one is safe to treat the person as suppressive it is not always correct but it is always safe some errors will be made but it is better to make them than to take chance on it when people refuse auditing they are potential trouble source connected to suppressive person b person with big discreditable withhold c suppressive person or d have had the bad luck to be audited too often by suppressive person or hare been audited by an untrained auditor or one trained by suppressive person the last category untrained auditor is rather slight but d audited by suppressive person can have been pretty serious resulting in continual arc breaks during which auditing was pressed on without regard to the arc break thus there are several possibilities where somebody refuses auditing one has to sort them out in an hgc and handle the right one but hco by policy simply treats the person with the same admin policy procedure as that used on suppressive personand lets hgc sort it out get that differenceits with the same admin policy procedure ash not the same as for treating person the same as suppressive person when he or she is not only adds to the confusion one treats real suppressive person pretty rough one has tohandle the bank as to 2 here is the real test and the only valid test does their history of routine auditing reveal any gains if the answer is then there is your suppressive persons loud and very unclear that is the testthere are several ways of detecting when fair auditors or good ones have had to vary routine procedure or do unusual things on this case in an effort to make it gain when there are lots of notes from ds of p in the folder saying do thisdo thatyou know that this case was trouble this means it was one of three things 1 potential trouble source 2 person with big withhold 3 suppressive person if despite all that trouble and care the case did not gainor if the case simply didnt gain despite auditing matter how many years or intensives then youve caught your suppressive person thats the boy or the girl this case performs continual calculating covert hostile acts damaging to otllers this case puts the enturbulence and upset into the environment breaks the chairs messes up the rugs and spoils the traffic flow with goofs done intentionally one should lock criminals out of the environment if one wants security but one first has to locate the criminal dont lock everybody out because you cant find the criminal the cyclic case gains and collapses routinely is connected to suppressive person we have policy on that the case that continually pleads hold my hand i am so arc broken is just somebody with big withhold not an arc break the suppressive person just gets nocasegain on routine student auditing this person is actively suppressing scientology if such will sit still and pretend to be audited the suppression is by hidden hostile acts which includes 1 chopping up auditors 2 pretendmg withholds which are actually criticisms 3 giving out data about their past lives andor whole track that really holds such subjects up to scorn and makes people who do remember wince 4 chopping up orgs 5 alterising technology to mess it up 6 spreading rumours about prominent persons in scientology 7 attributing scientology to other source 8 criticizing auditors as group 9 rolling up devt off policy off origin off line 10 giving fragmentary or generalized reports about entheta that cave people inand isnt actual 11 refusing to repair arc breaks 12 engaging in discreditable sexual acts also true of potential trouble sources 13 reporting session good when the pc went bad 14 reporting session bad when the pc went up in tone 15 snapping terminals with lecturers and executives to make critical remarks or spread arc break type news to them 16failing to relay comm or report 17 making an org go to pieces note one uses making not letting 18 committing small criminal acts around the org 19 making mistakes which get their seniors in trouble 20 refusing to abide by policy 21 noncompliance with instructions 22 alteris of instructions or orders so that the programme fouls up 23hiding data that is vital to prevent upsets24 altering orders to make senior look bad 25 organizing revolts or mass protest meetings 26 snarling about justice and so on one does not up the catalogue however one only uses this one factno case gain by routine auditing over longish period this is the fellow that makes life miserable for the rest of us this is the one who overworks executives this is the auditor killer this is the course enturbulator or pc killer theres the cancer burn it out in short you begin to see that its this one who is the only one who makes harsh discipline seem necessary the rest of the staff suffers when one or two of these is present one hears whine about process didnt work or sees an alteris of tech go look youd find it now and then leads to suppressive person inside or outside the org now that one knows who it is one can handle it but more than that i can now crack this case the technology is useful in all cases of course but only this cracks the nogaincase the person is in mad howling situation of some yesteryear and is handling it by committing overt acts today i say condition of yesteryear but the case thinks its today yes youre right they are nuts the spin bins are full of either them or their victims theres other real psycho in spin bin what that means weve cracked insanity itself thats right and its given us the key to the suppressive person and his or her effect on the environment this is the multitude of types of insanity of the 19th century psychiatrist all in one schizophrenia paranoia fancy names galore only one other type existsthe person the suppressive person got at this is the manicdepressive type who is up one day and down the next this is the potential trouble source gone mad but them are in minority in the spin bin usually put there by suppressive persons and not crazy at all the real mad ones are the suppressive persons they are the only psychos over simplification indeed i can prove it we could empty the spin bins now if we want to but we have better uses for technology than saving lot of suppressive persons who themselves ant only to scuttle the rest of us you see when they get down to nocasegain where routine process wont bite they can longer asis their daily life so it all starts to stack up into horror they solve this horror by continuous covert acts against their surroundings and associates after while the covert ones dont seem to hold off the fancied horror and they commit some senseless violence in broad daylightor collapseand so they can get identified as insane and are lugged off to the spin bin anybody can get mad and bust few chairs when suppressive person goes too far but theres traceable sense to it getting mad doesnt make madman its damaging actions that have sensible detectable reasons thats the trail of madness any thetan can get angry only madman damages without reason all actions have them lower scale discreditable mockery the difference is does one get over his angers the nocasesin of course cant he or she stays misemotional and adds eachnew burst to the flre it never gets less it grows and long way from all suppressive persons are violent they are more likely to look resentful suppressive person can get to one solid dispassionate state of damaging things here is the accident prone the home wrecker the group wrecker now here one must realize something the suppressive person finds outlet for his or her unexpressed rage by carefully needling those they are connected with into howling anger you see the people around them get dragged into this long gone incident by mistaken identity and it is maddening situation to be continually misidentified accused worked on double crossed for one is not the being the suppressive person supposes the suppressive persons world is pretty hard to live around and even ordinarily cheerful people often blow up under the strain so be careful who you call the suppressive person the person connected with suppressive person is liable to be only visible rage in sight you have some experience of thisthe mousey little woman who rarely changes expression and is so righteous connected to somebody who now and then yes into frenzy policy when an academy finds it has potential trouble source withholdy case that arc breaks easily or suppressive person enrolled on course or blow the academy must call for hco department of inspection reports justice section this can be any hco personnel available even the hco sec the hco representative must wear some readily identified hco symbol and must take report sheet with carbon copy on clip board hco must have present other staff adequate to handle possible physical violence the student if still present must be taken to place where an interview will not stop or enturbulate class by tech division personnel this can be any tech division office empty auditing room or empty classroom the point is to localize the commotion and not star up the whole tech division if tech drvision personnel is not available hco can recruit other staff anywhere by simply saying hco requires you and taking them into the interview place hco has report sheet for such matters original and one copy for justice files the hco representative calls for the sfudents folder and looks it over quickly for ta action if there is none less than 10 divssess thats it it is marked on the report sheet ta actions in auditing or little ta hco is not interested in what processes were run or why there is ta if the course requires meters the folder is inspected for alteris which denotes rough pc or case changes if there are ta notations in the folder hco should put the person on mater making sure the person is not wearing ring one asks questions merely reads the ta portion and notes the needle and marks these in the report sheet the tone arm will be very high 5 or above or very low 2 or less or dead thetan 2 or 3 and the needle would be an occasional rs or stuck or sticky if the person is suppressive person this is noted in the report sheet if the folder or the student in question says he has had case gain this is again confirming of suppressive personif two of these three points folders meters statement indicate suppressive person hco is looking for two possible students when so called inthe one who caused the upset and that students coach or students auditor there very likely may be suppressive person on the course that is not this student therefore one looks for that one too the second one if bit of questioning seems to reveal that the students auditor was responsible test that student too and enter it on second hco report form and order the other one to auditing at the students own expense in short be alert theres been an upset there may be other persons about who caused it dont just concentrate on the student there is condition on the course that causes upsets that is really all one knows when one walks in on it find out why and what if the hco tests indicate some doubt about either student being suppressive person hco asks about possible withhold and enters any result on the sheet and sends the students and sheet separately to the tech division dept of estimation the procedure is the same for suppresswef person but is withholdy pc who arc breaks easily or simply withholdy pc if arc breaks are noted auditing recommended but there is third category for which hco is very alert in this interview and that is the potential trouble source for this person may only be audited further if he or she disconnects or handles the suppressive person or group to which he or she is connected and cant be sent to the hgc or back to the course either until the status is cleared up how to tell them apart easy just ask this question which gets case gain easily well its even simpler than that put the two on an emeter dont do anything but read the dial and needle the suppressive one has the high stuck ta the other has lower ta simple not all suppressive persons have high ta the ta can be anywhere especially very low 10 but the needle is weird it is stuck tight or it rses without reason the pc wearing rings to cause an rs suppressive persons also can have the dead thetan clear read you see people around suppressive person q and and disperse they seek to get even with the suppressive person and often exhibit the same symptoms temporarily sometimes two suppressive persons are found together so one cant always say which is the suppressive person in pair the usual combination is the suppressive person and the potential trouble source however you dont neat to guess about it or observe their conduct for this poor soul can longer asis easily too many overts too many withholds stuck in an incident that they call present time handling problem that does not exist supposing those around are the personnel in their own delirium they look all right they sound reasonable they are often clever but they are solid poison they cant asks anything day by day their pile grows day by day their new overts and withholds pin them down tighter they arent here but they sure can wreck the placethere is the true psycho and he or she is dying before your very eyes kind of horrible the resolution of the case is clever application of problems processes never ow what was the condition how did you handle it is the key type of process i dont know what the percentage of these are in society i know only that they make up about 10 of any group so far observed the data is obscured by the fact that they arc break others and make them misemotionalthus one of them seems to be by contagion half dozen such therefore simple inspection of conduct does not reveal the suppressive person only case folder puts the seal on it case gain by routine processes however this test too may soon become untrustworthy for now we can crack them by special approach however we will also generally use the same approach on routine cases as it maka cases go upward fast and we may catch the suppressive person accidentally and cure him or her before we are aware of it and that would be wonderful but still well have such on our lines in justice matters from now on so its good to know ad about them how they are identified how to handle hco must handle such cases as per the hco justice codes on suppressive acts when they blow scientology or seek to suppress scientologists or orgy one should study up on these the academy should be careful of this and report them to hco promptly gas they would potential trouble sources or withholds that wont be delivered the academy must nor fool about with suppressive persons its sure way to deteriorate course and cave in students if this seems the case there is point in continuing the person in the tech division and hco takes over fully applying the policy related to potential trouble sources this type of case will probably not be dangerous but quite cooperative and probably dazed by having to do something about his situation he or she has been hammered with invalidation by suppressive person and may be rather wobbly but if the justice steps are taken exactly on policy there should be trouble hco can take potential trouble source but never suppressive person out of the tech division premises and back to hco to complete such briefing remember it is all one to us if the potential trouble source handles it or not until its handled or disconnected we dont want it around as its just more trouble and the person will cave in if audited under those conditions connected to suppressive person or group suppressive person found in an academy is ordered to hc processing always and always at hit or her own expense if the suppressive person wont buy auditing or cooperate hco follows steps to in policy on suppressive persons in the justice codes hco may be assisted in this by tech personnel the point is the situation must be handled fully there and then the student buys his auditing or gets to or both there is well put you on probation in the course and if because ive not fount it to work auditing or suppressive person to or boththe blown student the student however may have blown off the premises or he has gone entirely on minor momentary blow where all it took was the students auditor and few words to get the student back the matter is not real blow but where the student leaves the premises in blow or doesnt turn up for class the tech division must send an instructor and the students auditor over to hco department of inspection and reports an hco representative should go with them at once to pick up the student the student is brought back with as little public commotion as possible and the procedure of hco checkout ctc is followed as above the gone student where the student cant be gotten back or in all such cases the real cause may be suppressive person in the course itself not the blown student or the upset student if the suppressive person is on the course and is not the blown student hco will want to know this in all such cases the one who caused the environment may not be the culprit the hco representative calls for the blown students case folder and looks for ta if there is none or for some reason the student wasnt audited or if meters were used on that course hco seeks to find out what the cases responses were to processing if the case seemed to change or improve yet the student is gone hco looks over the blown students exauditor for suppressive characteristics such as satisfaction the pc blew critical statements about tech or instructors case rough or difficult lies about the circumstances eta and if such signs are present hco orders the blown students exauditor to the hgc at the students own expense if this interview with the blown students auditor seems to indicate suppressive person beyond any doubt hco orders the student to the hgc at the students own expense the blown students course auditor will not be found usually to be potential trouble source as these are seldom bad or rough auditors so questions about this possibility dont really apply but if this student the blown students auditor is suppressive its hgc or to if the student gives on to he or she may be returned to course or to the hgc as hco deems best in all such cases where suppressive person is found watch out for legal repercussions by having reliable witnesses present during such negotiations or upsets and take liberal notes for possible comm ev this is why there also must be an hco representative handling it if there is agreement to be audited and the student who is found to be suppressive person will not respond to to because student has blown and cant be found or because the student flatly refuses the student is considered terminated waiver or quit claim is given or sent the student stating date placei having refused to abide by the codes of name and place of org do hereby waive any further rights i may have as scientologist and in return for my course fee ofi do hereby quit any claim i may have on name or org or any scientologist personnel or any person or group or organization of scientology signed witnesses only when this is signed the student may have his course fee returned but other fees as he accepted that service the exstudent should realize this makes him fair game and outside our justice codes he may not have recourse of any kind beyond refund and after signing can only return to scientology as per policy on fair game the hgc audits such suppressive person sent to it on special processes specially issued by hco b for suppressive persons it will be found that adherence to these policies will make in academies very calm note nothing in this policy letter waives or sets aside any policy concerning the auditing of known institutional cases in an hgc persons with histories of institutionalized insanity may not be audited in hgc l ron hubbard ps if youve wondered if you are suppressive person while reading thisyou arent suppressive person never does wonder not for moment they know theyre sane lrhwmccden copyright 1965 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 10 august 1976r revised 5 september 1978 only revision is the correction of the definition of rock slam revisions in this type style remimeo all sec checkers all hco ref hcob 3 sep 78 all meter definition of rock slam operators rses what they mean handling of confessionals checksheets pts processing checksheets expanded dianetics checksheets meter operation checksheets various rundown checksheets the crazy irregular leftright slashing motion of the needle in the emeter dial is called rock slam or rs it repeats left and right slashes unevenly and savagely faster than the eye easily follows the needle is frantic the width of an rs depends largely on sensitivity setting it goes from onefourth inch to whole dial but it slams back and forth the term was taken from process in the 50s which sought to locate rock on the pcs early time track the slam is description of the needle violence meaning it slams back and forth for time all leftright motions of the needle were considered and called rock slams until it was found that smooth leftright flow was symptom of release or keyout and this became the floating needle there is yet another leftright motion of the needle called the theta bop this occurs when the person has or is trying to exteriorize theta is the symbol for the person as spirit or goodness bop is an electronic term for slight hitch in the sweep of needle theta bop hitches evenly at each end of the sweep left and right and is very even in the middle of the sweep neither the floating needle nor the theta bop can be confused with rock slam the difference of the rock slam is uneven frantic slashing left and right even the distances traveled left and right are likely to be different in each swing from the last rock slam can be caused sometimes by leaving rings on the pcs fingers or by short circuit in the meter or by the cans electrodes touching something like dress these are the mechanical considerations and must be ruled out before the pc can be considered to have rock slammed if the pc is not wearing rings and if the meter needle is calm with the lead unplugged if the lead is okay and if the pc is not jiggling the ends of the cans against his clothes then the pcs rock slam is caused by the pcs bank one has to be very careful about the correctness of the pc actually having rock slammed while on the meter that it was actually observed that it was not mechanically caused as above one puts the rs down on the worksheet and also gives exactly what was asked and also that the mechanical points were checked without distracting the pc one must always report rock slam in the auditing report note it with session date and page inside the left cover of the pcsfolder and report it to ethics including the question or subject which rock slammed phrased exactly why because the rock slam is the most important needle manifestation it gives the clue to the pcs case in 1970 i began fullscale research project into the subject of insanity and its relationship to cases and case gains and suppression it was only then that the full significance of the rock slam was unearthed this research developed into what is now called expanded dianetics series of special processes and actions with their drills and training which permits the auditor to handle specific case type this was by the way mans first system of positive detection and handling of psychosis and the first full understanding of what psychosis is while this bulletin is not in any way twominute course in or substitute for full training in expanded dianetics any auditor who audits sec checks or handles people on meter has to know what rock slam is and how it behaves and what he should do about it the first thing is to be able to recognize one and to quickly with the scan of the eye and unplug of the meter cord without any distraction of or notice by the pc make the checks for mechanical rock slam as given above you can make meter rock slam with pc or cord connected to it by turning it on b put the sensitivity at perhaps 2 put the needle at set d rapidly very rapidly move the ta back and forth maybe quarter of an inch and do it unevenly that if you did it very fast and unevenly would be something that resembled rock slam but matter how fast you made your fingers move real rs is trifle faster if you do that you will see what an rs looks like the needle in this experiment is not made to hit the sides of the meter now if you take the same setup and smoothly slowly move the tone arm back and forth about 2 times second without any roughness and the same distance right and left you will have floating needle note it very well as this comes at time of release and is the thing good auditor hopes to see and gives him the endoff signal for process it has to be well known as you never bypass one in session and to do so makes an uncomfortable pc the pc will often cogniteget realization about himself or life at this point and one does not stop him from doing this this is the thing you indicate to the pc you dont ever indicate rock slams or theta bops when you see it and without stopping or interrupting the pcs cognition you always say your needle is floating now the theta bop can also be shown to yourself by you set up the meter as above only this time you smoothly swing it to the right and give it tiny twitch in the same direction then you smoothly at once swing it to the left and give it tiny twitch in the same direction then do it to the right and so on this is theta bop it is different than floating needle only in that it hitches at each end of the swing so learn to recognize it there is vicious smooth right direction slash that occurs when pc hits certain area of the bank that is called rocket read and there is of course the small fall long fall which both go to the right and indicate charged question or reaction and there is the gradual rise to the left but these do not repeat back and forth which is the characteristic of the rock slam floating needle and theta bop all right so we know exactly what it looks like when we talk about rock slam as read of the meter we know how it can be mechanically caused and we know what we have to record and report when it is seen but exactly what does rock slam mean with regards to the pc if you dont know this you can miss on the pc on the case on the org and humanitya rock slam means hidden evil intention on the subject or question under discussion or auditing two things underlie insanity or to be more specific there are two causes and conditions both of which have been lumped together by man and called insanity he could not of course define it as he didnt know what caused it the first of these two things does not concern us overly much here and is the subject of separate checksheet and training and is called pts or potential trouble source handling pts is person who has been or is connected with somebody who has evil intentions pts can feel uncomfortable in life or be neurotic or go insane because of the actions upon him of person with evil intentions most of the people in institutions are probable ptses the second of these two things is insanity caused to the individual himself let alone others by hidden evil intentions the extent of these intentions and what the person will do and hide in order to carry them out is quite shocking these people are covert or overt criminals and many of them are insanemeaning beyond all rationality in their acts because their evil intentions are hidden and because they are often very plausible such individuals are what make behavior so mysterious and man look so evil when you see what mankind does and all sorts of fallacies it is this last type the chronic heavy rock slammer which expanded dianetics handles one rock slam doesnt make psychotic or total menace to everyone but it does mean there could be more and it might in rare cases mean you have seeing enough of these rses very dangerous person on your hands and in your vicinity and that person must be handled by expanded dianetics you wont see great many rock slams in auditing people so you could be totally thrown off by surprise when you see one and mess it all up because you are surprised so know what it is and dont get all quivery and make mistakes and blow your confront just carry on if you dont note the exact question that was asked and the exactly worded statement the pc made when the rs was seen you can muck it up for the expanded dianetics guys they wont be able to get it turned back on again easily and will lose lot of time so you have to be sure your auditing report is accurate that the rs is written big on the column and circled and matter what else you do in the session you have to get it recorded in the left front cover of the folder giving the date and page of the session and you have to report it to ethics and also you dont third party the pc and give him bad time in the session because of it now rses most easily turn on during sec checks or integrity processing or when pulling withholds or trying to investigate something so the people who see these most often are those engaged in that activity and not routine auditing when they can also but more rarely turn on further the most likely person to collide with needing to be sec checked is an rser which again increases the numbers of rses seen in these activities compared to routine auditing but very heavy rser will also turn them on in routine auditing it is the exact point of the rs in the session the exact question that was asked and the exact subject or phrase where the rs turned on that are important and these are very important as then the person can be fully handled with full expanded dianetics rundown by qualified expanded dianetics specialist when of course the person gets to that point on his grade chart the grade chart points are after dianetics like drug rds etc but before grades after grades but before power after power but before solo and after ot iii or after any single grade above ot iii these are the only points where expanded dianetics can be delivered and the rs fully and completely handlednow here is how you can turn off an rs and mistakenly think it is handled 1 the overtmotivator sequence has two sides one is what the person has done overt and what is done to the person motivator you can ask when the person rses on something if anyone has ever invalidated him on that subject or action he will find some and the rs will turn off and wont even be faintly handled but only submerged one can believe he has handled the rs not true he has just turned it off and maybe made it harder to find next time one can ask what the person has done to the subject mentioned and while this may unburden the case and make the person bit better the rs is not handled only turned off or submerged its almost as if there are so many overts and motivators on this subject or in this area that the pushpull of it makes the needle go wild rs and indeed this may be the energy cause in the bank of the needle reaction but neither overt nor motivator handles an rs finally because the cause of the rs is an intention to harm and it isnt all that likely the basic intention will be reached 2 another apparent way the rs can get handled and isnt is to take the rser earlier similar on the subject of the rs the rs will probably cease go clean but in actual fact it is still there hidden 3 the third way an rs can be falsely handled is to direct the persons attention to something else if when this is done the exact subject of the rs is not noted by the auditor it will be difficult to find it again when the person goes into expanded dianetic auditing 4 yet another and probably the last way to falsely handle an rs is to abuse the person about his conduct or behavior or the rs or to educate him to do better or to modify his behavior with shocks or surgery or other tortures like the psychiatrists do in other words one can seek to suppress the rs in numerous ways maybe the rs wont occur being too overburdened now but it is still there buried very deep and possibly beyond reach now so if you understand the above four points you will see that although you can ease off the rs you have not handled it it has merely gone out of sight all right what then does handle an rs i warned you that this isnt twominute course on expanded dianetics and it isnt an rs is handled by fully qualified expanded dianetics auditor delivering full expanded dianetics to the person at that point on the grade chart where expanded dianetics is supposed to be delivered if anyone thinks it can be done effectively any other way or if he cses it to be done and the auditor is stupid enough to try to do that cs then its committees of evidence and suspended certificates all around with that warning and only with that warning i can briefly state what has to be done with the case this is not what you do if you are not delivering full expanded dianetics at the right point on the grade chart it is brief statement so that you can understand what lies under that rs the pc with an rs on any given subject and who rses while discussing that or related subjects has an evil intention toward the subject discussed or some closely related subject the pc intends that subject or area of life nothing but calculating covert underhanded harm which will be at all times carefully hidden from that subject thus the expanded dianetics specialist in handling that case at the proper point on the grade chart has to be able to locate each and every subject and question and rs in that persons folder as noted by sec checkers and previous auditors or cramming officers or whyfinders he has to have the complete list of rs subjects if they are noted as to session date and page and if all sec checking papers and cramming papers are in that persons folder then the expanded dianetics specialist can do full and complete job otherwise he has to do lot of other time wasting actions to get the rses found and turned on again what the expanded dianetics specialist actually does is locate exactly the actual evil intention for every rs on the case and handle each one to total conclusion when he is finished if he has done his job well the persons behavior will be magically improved and as to his social presence menace and conduct well that will be toward survival when you see an rs if you are not an expanded dianetic specialist doing expanded dianetics at the correct point on the grade chart you dont say hey youve got an evil intention and you dont ask say whats that evil intention or do corny things like that because youll get the pc selflisting you may get wrong item you wont know what to do with it and youre just likely to get the auditing room wrapped around your neck right there you quietly note it make sure it isnt mechanical fault write it big on the worksheet write down everything the pc is saying swiftly note what question you were asking and let the pc talk and ack him and go on with what you are doing with the pc at the time and after session you note it in the lefthand cover of the folder and send report to ethics and some day when hes done his drug rundown or gotten to one of the points on the grade chart where full xdn can be done why then it will be handled and good cs will program or tip the case for that to be done so thats the knowhow you have to know about rses to really help the guy and the society and your group were not in the business of curing psychos the governments at this writing pay the psychiatrists billions year to torture and kill because of rses they dont know anything about the crime in the society out there is caused by people who rs stalin hitler napoleon and caesar were probably the most loaded rsers of all time unless it was jack the ripper or your local friendly psychiatrist so know what you are seeing when you see it and know what to do about it and dont kid yourself or vilify or mow down people who rs were not in that business and the expanded dianetic specialist and the pc someday will love you dearly for knowing your job and doing it right l ron hubbard founder lrhntdr

1959 breakthrough on the meter checks sec checking following it further since 1959 i have finally amassed enough histories to state the person who is not getting case gains is committing continuing overts while this sounds like very good out for us we assume that the auditor at least tried something sensible todaythe running of pc by grades is saving grace for merely tough cases directors of processing are doing well with the modern graded process approach level by level and the d of p washington has just told they were cracking cases with the lowest grade processes dc had never been able to handle well before so given processing by grades the best case approach weve ever had we crack the rough ones but will that be all cases theres still one the case who continually commits overts before during and after processing he wont make it one thing helps this however you have seen the ethics codes appearby putting bit of control in the scientology environment we have enough threat to restrain dramatization the phenomena is this the reactive bank can exert stress on the pc if it is not obeyed discipline must exert just shade more stress against dramatization than the bank does this checks the performance of the continual overt long enough to let processing bite not everyone is continuous overt committer by thousand to one but this phenomenon is not confined to the nogain case the slow gain case is also committing overts the auditor doesnt see therefore little discipline in the environment speeds the slow gain case the one were more interested in the nogain case frankly is one i am not panting to solve if fellow wants to sell his next hundred trillion for the sake of the broken toy he stole im afraid i cant be bothered i have contract with any big thetan to save the world complete it is enough for to know 1 where bottom is and 2 how to help speed slow gain cases bottom is the chap who eats your lunch apple and says the children did it bottom is the fellow who sows the environment with secret suppressive acts and vicious generalities the slow gain case responds to bit of keep your nose clean please while i apply the thetanbooster the fast gain case does his job and doesnt give hoot about threatened discipline if its fair and the fast gain case helps out and the fast gain case can be helped by more orderly environment the good worker works more happily when bad workers see the pitfalls and desist from distracting him so we all win the nogain case well he sure doesnt deserve any gain one pc in thousand and he yaps and groans and says prove it works and blames us and raises hell he makes us think we fail look down in our sthil files there are actually thousands upon thousands of scientologists there who each one comment on how wonderful it is and how good they feel there are few dozen or so who howl they havent been helped what ratio yet i believe some on staff think we have lot of dissatisfied people these nogain characters strew so much entheta around that we think we fail look in the saint hill files sometime those many thousands of reports continue to pour in from around the world with hurrah only the few dozen groan but long ago i closed my book on the nogain case each of those few dozen nogains tell frightening lies to little children pour ink on shoes say how abused they are while tearing the guts out of those unlucky enough to be around them they are suppressive persons every one i know ive seen them all the way down to the little clinker they call their soul and i dont like what i saw the people who come to you with wild discreditable rumours who seek to tear peoples attention off scientology who chew up orgs are suppressive personswell give them good rock and let them suppress it i cant end this hco b without confession i know how to cure them rather easily maybe ill never let it be done for had they had their way we would have lost our chance its too near to think about after all we have to earn our freedom i dont care much for those who didnt help the rest of us had to sweat lot harder than was necessary to make it come true l ron hubbard lrh mlrd copyright 1965 by l ron hubbard all rights

made in relation to the inactivity slowness or incompetence of human beings this discovery proceeds from two and half year intense study of aberration as it affects the ability to function as group member the ideal group member is capable of working causatively in full cooperation with his fellows in the achievement of group goals and the realization of his own happiness the primary human failing is an inability to function as himself or contribute to group achievements wars political upsets organizational duress growing crime rates increasingly heavy justice growing demands for excessive welfare economic failure and other age long and repeating conditions find common denominator in the inability of human beings to coordinate the current political answer in vogue in this century and growing is totalitarianism where the state orders the whole life of the individual the production figures of such states are very low and their crimes against the individual are numerous discovery therefore of what this factor is that makes the humanoid the victim of oppression would be valuable one the opening lines of dianetics the modern science of mental health comment on mans lack of an answer for himself the group needs such an answer in order to survive and for its individual members to be happy scale pandetermined selfdetermined otherdetermined oblivious insanerobot band needing orders the exact mechanism of needing orders is to be found as an outgrowth of the mental condition outlined in hcob 28 nov 1970 psychosisthe individual with an evil purpose has to withhold himself because he may do destructive things when he fails to withhold himself he commits overt acts on his fellows or other dynamics and occasionally loses control and does so this of course makes him quite inactive to overcome this he refuses any responsibility for his own actions any motion he makes must be on the responsibility of others he operates then only when given orders thus he must have orders to operate therefore one could term such person robot and the malady could be called robotism perception studies of perception undertaken since hcob 28 nov 70 reveal that sight hearing and other channels of awareness decrease in proportion to the number of overt actsand therefore withholdswhich the person has committed on the whole track by relieving these sight has been remarkably brightened therefore person who is withholding himself from committing overt acts because of his own undesired purposes has very poor perception he does not see the environment around him thus combined with his unwillingness to act on his own initiative there is blindness to the environment overt products see pl 14 nov 70 org series 14 since he does not act upon orders he is taking responsibility for he executes orders without fully understanding them further he executes them in an environment he does not see thus when forced to produce he will produce overt products these are called so because they are not in actual fact useful products but something one wants and are overt acts in themselvessuch as inedible biscuits or repair that is just further breakage slowness the person is slow because he is moving on otherdeterminism is carefully withholding himself and cannot see anyway thus he feels lost confused or unsafe and cannot move positively because he produces overt products he gets slapped around or goes unthanked and so begins declinehe cannot move swiftly and if he does has accidents so he teaches himself to be careful and cautious justice group justice is of some use but all it really does is make the person withhold himself even harder and while necessary restraint nevertheless does not itself bring lasting improvement threats and heads on pike meaning examples of discipline do however jar the person into giving his attention and channeling his actions into more desirable path from the group viewpoint justice is necessary in society of such people but it is not remedy for improvement malice despite the viciousness of the truly insane there is little or real malice in the robot the truly insane cannot control or withhold their evil purposes and dramatize them at least covertly the insane are not always visible but they are visible enough and they are malicious the robot on the other hand does control his evil impulses to great extent he is not malicious his danger mainly stems from the incompetent things he does the time of others he consumes the waste of time and material and the brakes he puts on the general group endeavor he does not do all these things intentionally he does not really know he is doing them he looks in wounded surprise at the wrath he generates when he breaks things wrecks programs and gets in the way he does not know he is doing these things for he cannot see that he is he may go along for some time doing slowly wasteful well and then carelessly smashes the exact thing that wrecks the whole activity people suppose he cunningly intended to do so he seldom does he winds up even more convinced he cant be trusted and that he should withhold harder false reports the robot gives many false reports unable to see how can he know what is true he seeks to fend off wrath and attract good will by pr public relations boasts without realizing he is giving false reports morale the robot goes into morale declines easily since production is the basis of morale and since he does not really produce much left to his own devices his morale sags heavilyphysical inertia the body is physical object it is not the being himself as body has mass it tends to remain motionless unless moved and tends to keep going in certain direction unless steered as he is not really running his body the robot has to be moved when not moving or diverted if moving on wrong course thus anyone with one or more of such beings around him tends to get exhausted with shoving them into motion or halting them when they go wrong exhaustion only occurs when one does not understand the robot it is the exasperation that exhausts one with understanding one is not exasperated because he can handle the situation but only if he knows what it is pts potential trouble sources are not necessarily robots pts person generally is withholding himself from suppressive person or group or thing toward that sp person or group or thing he is robot he takes orders from them if only in opposites his overts on the sp person make him blind and nonselfdetermined basic why the basic reason behind persons who cannot function are slow or inactive or incompetent and who do not produce is withholding self from doing destructive things and thus unwilling to take responsibility and therefore needing orders the exact wording of this why must be done by the individual himself after examining and grasping this principle if one writes this principle down on the top of sheet and then asks the person to word it exactly as it applies to himself one will attain the individual why for inaction and incompetence it will produce gis and fn at the examiner processing physical work in the physical universe general confronting reach and withdraw and objective processes go far in remedying this condition touch assists regularly and correctly given to proper end phenomena will handle illnesses of such persons word clearing is vital tech to open the persons comm lines wipe out earlier misunderstoods and increase his understandingpts tech will handle the persons robotism toward sp individuals groups or things to this and the

formula and hco pl 3 may 72 ethics and executives other individual whys can exist in these instances expanded dianetics the miracle of well done perfectly executed expanded dianetics eradicates both insanity and robotism drug handling and other actions may be necessary end product the end product when one has fully handled robotism is not person who cannot follow orders or who operates solely on his own totalitarian states fear any relief of the condition as they foolishly actively promote and hope for such beings but this is only deficiency in their own causes and their lack of experience with fully selfdetermined beings yet education advertising and amusements have been designed only for robots even religions existed to suppress mans evil nature lacking any examples or understanding many have feared to free the robot to his own control and think even with horror on it but you see beings are not basically robots they are miserable when they are basically they prosper only when

officers jokers and degraders it is an old principle that people who do not understand something occasionally make fun of it recent investigation however into the backgrounds and case condition of small handful of people who were joking about their posts and those around them showed somewhat more sinister scene each of these persons fell into one or more of the following categories 1 were rock slammers some list 1 2 were institutional type cases 3 were ncg meaning case gain the only cause of which is continuous present time overts 4 were severely pts potential trouble source connected to rock slammers it might be supposed that misunderstood word phenomena could also be part of this the rebellious student in universities is usually handled by clearing up his misunderstoods or curing his hopelessness for his future however the investigation did not find that any of these jokers or degraders were acting that way solely because of misunderstood words but the possibility cannot be ruled out the four categories above were however fully verified all the persons investigated were found to be the subject of declining statistics both having them and causing them their areas were enturbulated at least one of the jokers was physically driving basic course students out of an org in some cultural areas wit and humor are looked upon as healthy release however in the case of orgs this was not found to be the case intentional destruction of the org or fellow staff members was the direct purpose therefore all executives hco personnel and case supervisors as well as qual personnel and staff section officers have valuable indicator where they have joker or degrader on their hands they also have one or more of the above four conditions in that person this opens the door to handling such people properly assigned and then fully done conditions are the correct ethics handlingscorrectly done expanded dianetics which includes confessionals and fully done pts handlings are the case remedies where ethics tech itself is not known or neglected and where there are hcos one can of course not expect the matter to be handled and this would be too bad because the case gain and life improvement available in proper ethics handlings when fully followed through can be quite miraculous where rock slammers have been undermining the tech and it is not fully known or used or is altered into unworkability one cannot expect confessionals to be properly done or expanded dianetics to be known and properly applied the joker is advertising his symptoms he is also advertising an area of the org where there is enturbulation and down statistics as well as staff members being victimized therefore this is an administrative and technical indicator which cannot be overlooked and should be followed up spotted investigated and handled this can be the beginning of an upward spiral for an organization where someone is driving ethics out tech is not likely to go in you have to get in ethics and tech before you can begin to get in admin the next time you as an executive wonder why you are working so hard look for the joker in the deck humor is one thing destroyed orgs and human

that route or who is progressing on the route between ot i and ot iii and doing well they should not be interfered with by sec checking or anything else reallybut where the person in this zone is moving slowly or stalled there is technical factor which must be known and taken into consideration dianetic clears who do not go up the bridge are still subject to the vagaries and pressures of life therefore to handle any of the points of possible hang up the following are included as allowed handlings on dianetic clear pts handlings but dianetics confessionals including sec checking on evil purposes the handling of postulates considerations attitudes evil purposes or evil intentions false purpose checks ows disagreement checks black pr handling service fac handling by the bracket method

product debug checklist etc postulates the fact that one can sec check dianetic clear and can locate purposes and nonsurvival considerations does not in the least make less of the state of clear it is simply matter of different case phenomena on clear than on preclear the definition of clear is being who longer has his own reactive mindpostulates and considerations can stand independently of mental mass therefore if anybody said you couldnt find postulates or try to spot them on dianetic clears then that is false data one can locate all the postulates one wants on dianetic clear so long as he doesnt go into running engrams finding postulates and considerations is free field on dianetic clear there is slightest prevention of it finding and handling evil purposes is also in the area of postulates and dianetic clear can also be black pred and go pts because someone is dianetic clear is reason he does not still have postulates in place or countersurvival considerations which cleared up could improve his power as being you will find that people who are not burdened with overts and black pr and evil purposes are going on up the route to the top what stalls the person is lack of sec checking and discovery of any ptsness or black pr or evil purposes and the likeall of them counter survival the technical fact is that if the person is not getting on up the levels if he is clear andor is in the noninterference zone and is moving slowly or stalled he is candidate for handling of these factors the handling of dianetic clear on these is the same as for any preclear with the proviso that engram running may be attempted one can handle postulates purposes considerations attitudes evil purposes or intentions and ows one can do false purpose checks disagreement checks black pr handlings service fac handling without running engrams and rudiments on dianetic clear and one can also do all types of pts handling that do not call for running engrams and one had better get the appropriate handling done in such cases youll find the person experiences huge relief from being rid of these nonsurvival factors and he can then move on up to his next level and get the gains that are there to be achieved summary it is expected that responsible technical terminals will ensure the needed handling gets done where dianetic clear is not progressing well person at the point of clear should take effective measures to get himself up the bridge but where this is not occurring he needs help in the form of the exact technical action that will enable him to progress we are in the business of making beings more able here we have restored to use powerful tools with which to do it l ron hubbard founderexpanded dianetics lecture 1 lecture given to the flag dianetic auditing team on the 30 march 1972 7203c30 so expanded dianetics all right this is 30th of march 72 and im about to roll up your misunderstood word record we have here the ed 149 flag cheer up it doesnt look that bad it isnt that bad really honest could be much worse they might not be getting any help at all they might just be thrown away in garbage can someplace all right this is this was dianetic project and this is ed 149 flag that were activating and the situation was we have too many chronic sickies and the probable why is quickie dianetics and the auditing stats are low dianetic auditors cannot find pcs and the ideal scene is dianetics working to proper pc completion on each case and the program with this was leading auditor to be appointed from interns and that was done and the leading auditor to the leading auditor to select four auditors one to fly ruds and three dianetics to make teamby the leading auditor thats been done threeteam to be fully cleared on what really is dianetic completion director of personnel enhancement was that done all right now fourfolders of the mos chronic sickies list furnished by the mo to be assembled you did that he had already gotten his list which was really what prompted the program and five feses done on their cases now youve done that and sixfolders brought to lrh and lrh to gen in the team and were at that stage right now and then weve got programs to be written for each case to briefly repair and do real dianetics on all right now hand that first folder that i had there moment ago all right now lets take lets take look at this pc and youve done folder error summary on this pc of some kind or another here and heres an oca in here someplace this isnt the one i was looking at but that doesnt matter and theres excuse for an auditor not knowing about ocas just excuse at all he should of course be able to give one he should be able to grade one and so forth but read one that is where the auditor comes in now all of this stuff they write on the back of the oca means nothing that is for the graduation of somebody from pe over to auditing or something and they can tell them things like this and theyre all perfectly true but that is not in actual fact what an auditor does with one of these the first thing an auditor does one of these things is look to see whether or not there is any point below the center line now what in actual fact is the center line the american apa has center line which is zero above which we get plus and below which we get minus youve seen those havent you all right well this is essentially the same thing except the oca has better center graph now the center line here of 00 is the critical point of the graph now just little bit into this lower gray shaded area is not too bad but when they go down into the white like minus 62 or minus 76 or minus 26 or something like that theyre said to be in the white so thered be two conditions here is below the center line which would mean any negative and in the white now this is such gross thing that an auditor does that it is hardly worth writing text books about and people will tell you theres much more to know about this there isntwhen theyre in the white on the left theyre out of valence i dont care where on the left or at what point we call the middle left or right of the graph its when theyre low on the left in the white on the left theyre out of valence when theyre low on the right theyre crazy and im just using that advisedly this happens to be fact see its not the usual social statement oh oh hes crazy see this guy is psychotic so low on the left out of valence low on the right crazy when theyre low on the left it means the case is too heavily charged it is very very very heavily charged so the person cannot even come to the center of his bank he cant be in the middle of his bank and look at it he has been living for eons watching himself so that the pictures he takes are outside now you can get that kind of condition from somebody whos exterior but theres two conditions of exteriorization one is looking at oneself and one is making pictures of oneself over there so when you have that condition you know that if you have low on the left its very heavily charged case on running such case you have to be very careful only to run things that read very well prefer to run secondaries now when you do narrative running on such case cs thats your health form and so forth you bleed that in other words you just get all you can out of that on the subject of emotional stresses on low on the leftdeaths losses of brothers and sisters and dogs and cats see you bleed that for emotional stress situations now there are three lists and its perfectly legitimate for you to use these lists all of your tools havent been assembled in dianetics or the dianetic auditor has not fully used his tools theres lx3 lx2 and lx1 now because those are listed in the class 8 materials the dianetic auditor never seems to know about them now when youve bled the white form of emotional situations you do not now bleed the white form of painful situations noooo you get an lx3 lx2 lx1 and you take the best reads that you can get and you run that and they will come snap into valence providing youve done it more or less in that sequence youve bled the deaths off the case or something like that now you go into your lx3 lx2 lx1 thing now youre going to get some more emotions off the case now youre still running secondaries now secondaries will very often drop through into engrams all right so they drop through into engrams run the chain but be careful you havent jumped chains all right so much for the left side of the graph you will find out if you do what ive just told you it will suddenly come up and it will be above the center line now when you think of all of the difficulty people have in trying to raise one of these graphs now the instructions im giving you are simply to bleed the case for any charge now if it doesnt come up above the center line at that point more lx3 21 try to get them to fning lists now maybe hes remembered whole bunch of horrible experiences hes had and you might be able to do lx3 lx2 lx1 and go back now and do new white form and find out you have an entirely new white form on the subject of horrible experiences that were terribly emotional and losses of business and things like that now what will happen at the same time is the fellows memory will push back now person who is very low on the left side does very very well if he can remember back to the time when he was 1 or the 16yearold will do he can remember back to she can remember back when she was twelve or something like this now you start pushing back his memory without treating this at all his memory will simply go back his memory will go back to extreme youth now youre not paying much attention to that but its just one of the things that comes up the fellow can remember better youre not even running recall processes dont you see but then youll get somebody telling you you know why thats funny thing i just never remember that old house and so forth and start waf waf waf waffle waffle waffleall right now that bleeds the case of the emotional charge so if youve got low on the left this is how you enter the case all right so much for that you as i say you could probably do your lxes you could probably come back and bleed it and youd finally find some more deaths and you might even go back and find new reads on the lxes who knows he might even find by this time and volunteer theres an emotion that isnt on the lx list or something of this sort you see who knows what that happens but your end phenomena as far as youre concerned is this thing up above the center line on the left side soon as you got that up above the center line on that side great three cheers youre away because the fellowll be in valence now hell be able to confront something all right so now lets take it low on the right now this persons crazy now when theyre low on the left and low on the right you handle the left side and it will come up and then you handle the right side when theyre only low on the right and slightly low on the left you still handle them from the left in other words its left to right got it now this person whos low on the right research on this this person opened the door to the human mind what the psychiatrists and psychologist should have been doing the alienists and the aesculapians and everybody who worked in this particular field only the aesculapian was working in both mental and physical healing back at greek times this solving this solved the human mind for its first time in history that is an evil purpose and that is all it is now by evil purpose we mean the fellow has destructive intentions and hed be very difficult to audit sometimes sometimes hes very smooth to audit but this case will roller coaster you audit him today and hes fine and tomorrow hes complaining you at first you let him out of the session and oh feeling fine you know ive never felt so good in my life and he walks right straight to the examiner had an awful session he roller coastered just in that distance because you see hes trying to do himself in on all dynamics even though he says to do others in he is still doing himself in because an evil purpose makes him restrain himself thetan is basically good so he knows hes being evil so therefore he had better put on his brakes so this includes never under any circumstances letting himself go and that includes the fellow who is committing evil acts all the time hes still got the brakes on but cant put them on hard enough brakes are burned out but hes still trying just as that driver would be stamping his foot through the floor board hes still trying it gives him very heavy massive bank very heavy youll run in them black few masses and youll run into this and invisibilities and so forth now great many people cant go into dianetics at all they cant run an engram at all that is uniformly one of two things it is drills or the commands have not been cleared so the second you start running one of these fellows and he says well you know i really dont like dianetics now youre in cleft stick now what do you do down on the left down on the right and doesnt know how to doesnt like to run dianetics well now youve had it but fortunately for us why there is remedy to itis he will be able to run the drugs because thats what hes stuck in hell run those automatically so if you run into that condition you are one more step away from home youve got to handle the drugs handle the emotions handle the engrams see now theres some areas that can he worked on here by other auditors and by that is to say by people with upper scale auditing but let tell you something here all these postulates evil purposes and everything else are stuck in an engram now there are other phenomena in the bank than this but theyre all stuck in that heavy energy and if you pull too many thoughts one after the other out of the bank which has not been properly discharged on the left side here of its emotional charge and of the right side of its pain and heavy energy mass if you just kept running pull the postulate out get the goals out of it get the this out of it get something else out of it youre just leaving that stuff there actually its starting to group and if it has been misrun in any way it will groupso lets go one step further away from home now somebody started drug rundown but botched it up now were way away from home now if any of these cases are in this condition you run out the auditing and then you run out the drugs and then you run out the emotions and then you run out the pain now you got it now there are fast ways to run out auditing by an assessment but auditing actually also can be run out by straight dianetics and you will get all of it out do you see where were going here in other words if you approach what youre doing here from totally dianetic viewpoint and do it in the sequence that it can be done in dianetics youre away now there are other ways to shortcircuit these other things that is to say bring them up get them done fast pull the evil purpose out of the bank do this do that do the other thing you see you understand you can do tremendous job of x or xi class dating and locating and blow that stuff and you can do these other things the only one i know of that you get hung up on is where rudiments are out long duration now did it ever occur to you that you could run rudiments with engrams did it ever occur to you the way youd run an arc break you would simply assess affinity reality communication and understanding and you would run time that you did not and what do you knowitll run only this time youll really run it so if person wont talk to you you could actually list list of which way he was withholding like false withholds suppressed withholds run it with r3r now you would find very very interesting thing happening here youll find out this would go all the way back to china and off the planet and into outer space see so you dont necessarily have to have an upper scale auditor hanging over you all the time now when you bung one up in the session you can still do an l1c if the guys bunged up in the session and so forth if the case has to be generally repaired there could be something very wrong with the ease and you can do gf gf5 can be done on the case so there is review action can be done for the dianetic auditor somebody can do an l1c somebody can fly his ruds somebody can something or other dont you see your 0 to vi but you actually could im just trying to tell you you could do any of these ruds with dianetics so lets go back all the way now you could run out the auditing and then you found out that the person was arc broken and had been for long time with something you could even assess that youd have to find out if it was break in affinity reality or communication or understanding you could even run that out and run it out triple and it would go back on dianetic chain just like anything else thats well within the skill of dianetic auditor alright you could get the auditing out you could get the ruds in you could get the charge off the case you could get the pain off the case and what do you know you could also get the evil purposes off the case without even asking direct for it youd be looking for the rs chain the evil purpose guys all rs sooner or later down on the right will rs and you want to list that loud and clear when you did now in l9s in some other ways these chaps with working with that actually can pull that out from underneath it and do this that and the other thing with it dont you see they can do these things but lets say you have dianetic listi dont want to lose you anyplace youve got youve done something with either youve had vi fly the ruds which is perfectly all right see or youve had somebody do an l1c or something like that perfectly all right and maybe somebodys even prepchecked past auditing for you which is perfectly all right youve got this think somebodys done gfcase has always been resistive so they do gf40 in other words somebody can do setup for you or somebody can do repair for you but that doesnt stop you utterly just because youre only auditing dianetics im trying to change your frame of reference so you shouldnt be saying well nobody or we cant find any class vis to you get the point of view in other words youre not blockednow dianetic auditors these days are being taught to fly rudsperfectly legitimate only dont be knuckle headed and try to get high ta down with an arc break it wont come down if youre going to start into the scientology side of auditing you had better just roll up your sleeves and abide by its rules it does have rules ive seen several cases absolutely butchered high ta and they try to get it down with arc breaks or something like that or theyve got high ta that is high on some other factor see so your high ta person the high ta person is more of puzzle to scientology auditor than he is to dianetic auditor because dianetic auditor just keeps on auditing if he only takes bd items will day by day by clay bring the ta down and stay within range he doesnt even have to run exteriorization as such it will come down it will come down and this is little more painful to the person it lasts longer you dont get as many fns at the examiner but it will come down weve had cases right here on flag dont know why anybody was worried about them we just ran dianetics and so on you have to be careful when their ta is high to take bd item that is what you have to be careful of very often you could use two way comm and get bd item and then phrase that as an r3r and the case will come down this is all this is all possible another way to do it turn it over to scientology auditor and get cs 53rrr and they will probably find what it is so theres lots of tools the case can be repaired it is question whether or not it is worth wasting time running ruds by dianetics it might be much more swift dont you see to get somebody to patch it up but remember this it would really be patched up if you ran it it would really be patched up if you ran it it will never see the light of day again now i am just trying to give you the breath of what you can do now you can take any of these feses here we have here we have person who is wildly down on the righthand side now that persons going to rockslam but how would we approach this case do you see that it is slightly down on the left aaahso so somebody sailed into this case for quick completion didnt run out all the available emotion and so it stayed down on he left hand side somebody bypassed the death of her cat or her mother or something you got it now if you were to do white form brand new and just stress this loss little section on the white form yeah well who else did you lose and what else is it to this and so on and etcetera the next thing you know why you will get hot one run it run it just narrative and that left hand side will go up zoom and then your next procedure and so forth would be to start working on the engram side of it now possibly you think this case might need great deal of repair maybe the case does need repair if its indicated the case needs repair nobody knows how to repairthe thing or something or else turn it over to vi by all means but if youre going to dump everything you do on vi youre going to feel very limited youre going to feel very very limited right you sort of feel like youre dependent on some line actually youre not and we get august 68 we get white form done and we get under treatment the pc 53ys psychotherapy 1966 and under interest and hobby pc says psychic phenomena and drugs and drugs were not handled until much later now you get an oddily here that you could audit at once if it appeared on the case and if it read those are always the thingsdid it read now she was audited all that time then over outdrugs outpsychic phenomena and out psychotherapy the auditing itself might very well be charged do you see how you could approach this you could simply ask her in auditing something or other something or other something or other list list list list list did you ever feel emotionally upset in any way or something like that youll hit the emotional bing right there and you can lift it on the left hand side do i make myself clearall right now the ruds were begun with ta high and fn gottenwell of course not and the gf were done in review and it reads on the pc told lie and she was in horrible state she had an infection of some sort and when they did an l1b and they got fn and nothing was flown that would be an interesting one right there when you look over folder error summaries like that shes probably had an l1b since now an l1c but if you were to dig up that l1b as vi and just fly each one of those they would either longer he there or they would fn and the case would have resurge but you would have to say were you ever audited over that oh yes the case has been audited over all those so the case is emotionally charged in auditing so looking at this now as all investigation one of your best chances of straightening out this case is just handle the subject of auditing bleed it of its emotional content run it r3r and you would find your left hand side would rise and you will run into all of this sort of thing now it goes on and on and on and on and on here now this is an awful lot of auditing now even power is out in other words the person has had power with fn so you will run into this and later on somebody fooled around with it so lord knows what you will run into running this but thats the way id approach the case i would bleed the persons auditing of all of its emotion now if you get inventivenow all im doing is trying to show you how you can bleed the whole subject of dianetics for practically all of your auditing and if you ever got very inventive you could actually take an lx list and assess it on auditing while you were being audited did you have you see were you i think it would be phrased do you follow and then you just run them as secondaries secondaries secondaries so you would do that however if she wouldnt couldnt really come up with anything you would say what emotions did you have during auditing all right and then having done that you would run that out you would find this case came up pretty bright and shiny when you get over into your painful emotion sides remember that you are dealing with somebody who has been on the track very destructive and without even knowing what that is you will eventually run the incident where it comes off now right down here at the end of the seaway right at the end of the breakwater down here there was young fellow who had just come out to the ship and he let go at the top of the ladder and fell backwards about 20 feet onto the rocks and he hit his head and he was pretty bad off for while hes all right now but the thing that was holding it in place was he had decided to just he decided to knock himself off just before he let go therefore his dianetic assist is very much in question he was given dianetic assistmust be very much in question if anybody were to look into his folder nobody said eb it may not even have fned but somebody auditing him out at aolahe was in pretty sad shape to auditbut somebody auditing him out at aola apparently collided with this in dianetics and he decided to do it now that was held in place against himself as self overt he didnt recover now theres data like thiswhat where do these evil purposes come from they come just before or just after an engram an engram dont conceive the bank as something that sits out here with the purposes over here in this column and all of the energy and pain over in this column now some future time you will be busy running some chain and you will probably run into the arc break with dianetics youll run into the arc break that occurred before that time while youre busy running some other chain now the primary mistake that an auditor in dianetics does that gives him quickie dianetics is he assesses pain sensation emotions and attitudes in one sentence now i know it doesnt break it down materially in hcobs but im trying to teach the old dogs new tricks now so look at this by doing that all in one lump sum you could miss on the left side and the right side couldnt you so during this whole project i dont want to see you ever assess in one sentence do you have any pain sensations emotions or attitudes connected with this something or other as matter of fact the sentence is even slightly backwards because the emotions come after the pain so you do your assessments singly you can just go backwards on thisyou can assess for attitudes now were really going downstairs now this would be person on the left hand side the right hand side both on the bottom of the graph now the only thing youre going to get out of this person is attitudes not even emotions look at it and then you might get some emotions out of them but one of the things that person like that complains about is he doesnt have any emotions so remember that each one of these pain sensations emotions and attitudes has negative and dont sit there sometimes with bd on attitude and not recognize that you have an incident because i see that perpetually on dianetic lists emotion at alllong fall bd well list was clean zzzzzzzz list was clean hell it hadnt even been started do you see so it shouldso theres negative aspect to all these things now you can get some kind of thing like an attitude of purposelessness or something like that that is perfectly valid attitude but god help you when you start running that because that is going to chunk right straight along cross to the other side fast you can get him into more pain and more this and more that and more something or other than you can shake slick at because of course its on that buttonevil purpose intention and so forth so when you get those recognize now that you do know about insanity now im not telling you necessarily to avoid them but just make sure youve got an awful good read make sure you got an awful good read before you run anything with regard to purposesfor two reasons these reasons are very very big reasons it will he imbedded in an incident either just at the beginning of it or just after it now you can pluck it out of the incident and cause the incident to sort of fade out and so forth but now youre gelling into the vi level of action and its not necessarily the best level of action see its faster but its not necessarily more thorough so purposelessness or purposes and so on is something you dont list if the pc says it put it on the list unless it gives you one hell of good read leave it alone but just to recapitulate to go back over what i was just saying now dont use this standard pardon formerly standard line dont dont use thisdo you have any pains somatics emotions mumble attitudes and so on bla dib daa daa dont use that break it clown break it down now theres two ways you can break it down and this is clever way to break it down you write down here on little slip or you get yourself some mimeographed slips and you say this guys got chronic stomach ache you say about stomach ache what is it is it the pain or is it the emotion its the sensations the attitude zoooo now the emeter tells you what is real to the pc that is why it doesnt work as lie detector because it never reads on real criminal because crime isnt real to real criminal so it wont read on the meter and the only people you ever catch with sec checking are honest people because dishonesty is real to them do you follow the reason why you only read items that read the only the only items you use are those that read well and the only reason that you do that is to make sure that its real to the pc now you could break down this pain what is this stomach thing youre talking about is it the pain is it the sensation is it the emotion in it is it the attitude in it zoom give some attitudes about this now you could work that persons somatic over on that same list reassessing and making new lists and reassessing and making new lists and reassessing you see pain sensations emotions making new list until it would just fn all over the place its gone do you follow now so lets lets not lets just abandon that portmanteau that everything in the same grip approach because it is very unthorough now here we have somebody who is shes had gf with reads taken to fn in july 69 and shes had way to waste money with ep now you right you know right now that you theres from dianetic auditors viewpoint we have two potential chains there was something read on that gf now its either since been handled or its there but there is an auditing chain there now you could say in former auditing did you have any did you have any pain or and so on you could look on this gf and lets say it said invalidated long read and it was never taken to an fn well lets see do you have anything about being invalidated something like that see wham you get yourself read its now hot its still hot you could run it in other words you could bleed this fes even off an old list but the test would be would it read again now to get something toread again you often have to say on this item has anything been suppressed on this item has anything been invalidated voom voom if you get read on either suppressed or invalidated the item is valid you dont have to go back and ask the item itself because invalidated transfers the read from the item to invalidated you can be if you ask it again you would now get read on what the item was but the read transfers but youre looking for something that moves the meter see it moves that needle good and that is within the reality of the pc and if it doesnt move it good it isnt in the reality of the person now the only real thing you got this now on assessing your pains emotions and so forth right all right now theres this there is line of country here in the running of any pc if the person has had read on the list and then the read disappears and then you come back and call the read again and you can t get read and the pc is upset always use the suppress invalidated and sometimes the word abandoned will work has this item been abandoned oh yes read got it so its your job to make an old list like this if youre doing repeat or an old dianetic list and it didnt seem to be handled to make it to make it come live again if you cant make it come live skip it because its probably gone its probably this probably that now its important to you that the most chronic hideous unbelievable conditions will in actual fact surrender to dianetics if you know how to play this piano this persons practically got hidden standard lets say this person has terrible eczema some psoriasis or something skin all turned into scale now you can start hitting away at this as your only target in the first place this persons got failed help all over this thing in trying to do something about it for years so you have to approach this with good sense it isnt just condition which just occurred and you are now just going to audit it thats not so now that is comparable to an oca it s down on the left and down on the right physically so you can shake out of that attitude for which youll probably get nothing can be done about it good it reads well r3r run it now after you knock this down for while this seems to be what the pcs interest is in after youve knocked this thing down for while all of sudden some computation will come out of all this you figure it out itll be some big cognition come out of this of some kind or another well that is the idea which is held in place by the energy the energy is so ferocious hes never been able to look at the idea before now youre actually taking the energy off so the idea will come out in scientology they take the idea out you get the reversed angle so in other words youve got this thing and now it gets little better and the most serious thing that you can do now at this time is to figure you have failed do you know that one of those engrams that you ran in connection with this first you got off some attitudes you got off some emotion shame and then you got off this and that and so forth and it seemed to run whole bunch of disrelated things and they somehow or another always seem to come up with this arm and eventually theres some sort of an incident there where the person was scalded to death or somethingand there youve got this youve obviously run the incident this is where the person got it you run the incident out and the things still there its not as bad as it was its still there thats what we call quickie dianetics too brushed off and so forth youve got to work on it now you just start running general things you go on and you keep on auditing the person youve got to bleed this case down for things to run i dont care how many ways you bleed it down for things to run and do you know that something very remarkable will happen when you least expect somewhere up along the line whole interior section of the engram you thought was totally run will suddenly appear on another chain and that will be the end of his psoriasis it was in there with mental image picture but piece of the picture was so submerged and out of the persons reality that it was never touchedive seen some of the most remarkable things with regard to this persons goiter persons this persons that tabulous numbers of odds and ends dont you see theyre always the medico is always talking about rushing them right into the ambulance and getting them out or well well have to have an operation that failed and all that sort of thing well the operation just gives you another engram now the reason hes got it will also audit out now you recognize that if you continue to get the mental energy off the case the ideas will then fly off this is the reverse mirror view of scientology so its fn gis cog cog fn cog vgis cog cog now the reason person does not cognite is he is being run against reality and his reality might be included in his attitudes and he might run beautifully on attitudes he might run beautifully on ideas now you couldnt imagine somebody running engrams on ideas but the think he has thought maybe in the last 24 hours is about as heavily as he can get into engrams basic might only lie three days ago on having thought that he might someday be hungry now as soon as you include r3r on attitudes and that line of country as soon as you include that you are actually running r3r out on recall basis but youre getting what went with it youre really doing recall but youre running it r3r its perfectly legitimate now heres the 62 question about all this this is very interesting to you the failure to clear up all the words in the commands with the pc and the failure to clear every isolated different word in the list including the tiny screwball little english words of is the from such can cause you to get reads on the items the pc himself has given you that arent valid and where ever youve seen small fall that didnt read then the auditor has skipped out the idea of interest he hasnt consulted that and youll find the lxs somebody will tell you oh well you neverwe had this here the other dayyou never consult whether or not the pc is interested on an lx item because it doesnt say so on the viii tapes you see because it says it on the viii tapes that changes the whole business of dianetics huh quite remarkable so somebodys not checked interest or hes disregard the pcs statement of interest and what do you know both of those things have occurred in the last 48 hours ah little bit more than thatin the last 5 days the auditor auditing somebody on misunderstood word in the middle of phrase that was picked off list and swearing up and down that it was perfectly valid item because it gave small fall even while it was checked but the item wouldnt run and the ta went right straight on up to 5 while the auditor ground on and on and on and on the auditor had never bothered to say very much about interest it was read on misunderstood word it was misunderstood word it was off of the canned list horrible huh now weve just taken somebody who has been trained all the way up the line and never understood any words in the english language before she was trained you hear it wasnt that she didnt understand the words in scientology and dianetics its she just never understood the english language been speaking it all her life been speaking it all her life but never bothered to find out what the words meant now the most remarkable program is on the front of that case because it says in each case clear up each word on list the person supposedly had had drug rundown now how could the person have had drug rundown the person didnt know 5 or 6 of the words in r3r the dianetic cs 1 was brush off this is one of these persons oh yes i know what all that means yes yes yes yes yes while knowing none of them clearing the command is what is out so this program is quite remarkable because it says very carefully i wrote it up for this one girl and boy did she come up shining wow from the bottom of the pit clear each word on the list then assess the list now ive got to tell you how to do that you do not at any time read them the question you just start in on the list and you take every word do you see and now if you really want to avoid stirring up the bank and getting the question you clear them the list backwards or thequestions backwards clear them all isolatedly now you know youve already cleared that word so you dont clear it again you see when it occurs someplace else now its quite stunt and i would advise you before you go into this very much that you get little hit of drill on asking them that now it is not do you know what this word means the graveyard is full on that one room for any more corpses you ask what is the definition of they cant give it to you have your stuff right to hand look it up clear whole l3b all 80 questions backwards with each of the things backwards the pc by the way youd think would be bored stiff and all confused and so forth they get quite excited about it but you got to have dictionary you got to have dictionary stand every one of these sickies youve got has never understood the words in the commands nor the list to repair them the communication has never occurred now you say its the auditors trs its this its that its the other thing well have all those perfect have your metering perfect and all the rest of that but clear up those words and youll get the pcs that fail so the content of the bank could make it fail by being run backwards run out all the pain you got it that can be run backwards and then you never got communication see your trs are perfect but you never got communication and then the drugs drugs can prevent you right now from getting the person to look at anything because they hallucinated hallucination it means bugginess it means seeing things that arent there good hallucination would be lion sitting in the middle of the floor that nobody else could see and there has never been lion in the middle of the floor so it doesnt run well as an engram but what really happens to them is the r6 stuff and lower bank stuff kicks in on them while theyre on drugs and scares them to death and then they dont ever bother to tell even themselves about this they had that horrible day when took this poor little innocent pot that everybody was smoking and oh my god and these spiders started leaping out of the walls and jumping all over them you know something happened now if you ran the spiders make sure that its spider chain and not drug chain otherwise youll be running what they call dubin now dubin is normally heavily charged case and if your pcs ever see the dubin to run it youve already entered the case too deeply so your dubin case is solved with attitudes emotions or sensations then pain dubin case is so out of valence that it is amazing so these dubin cases is some thing you dont need to worry about you dont have to have any special solution for dubin case just run the case right side to run the case against the oca or apa and youll be all right you got it now but your job basically is to bleed them down give another one of these things oh theres this one this one has got very sour oca and youll see that this case has been they plucked the ideas out of the case with upper level auditing here and theyve left all the energy on the case so this case is going to require that auditing be run you see what case that is now somewhere in here theres heres aaah here if you look at this oca youll see it was down on the left and is very down on the right now this case has had every upper level rundown that you can think of practically without ever having been set up by dianetics the case has body inflammation skin inflammations these are just psychosomatic illnesses now your other index is your chart of human evaluation of science of survival now if you trace out one of these characters give another one and you find them down some place on the chart of human evaluation youve got parallel comparison to your ocaapa and the chart of human evaluations is more valid now so this person has had their graph raised theyve had graph rise fine but they still have psoriasis now what is all that about well their attitudes and ideas and so forth have shifted but the body has been left there now when they dont do good solid beginningpreparation with dianetics then when they start to pull these idea out of the engrams they will tend to group so that when case is not thoroughly run on dianetics when you have quicky dianetics you can expect some case that had very bad psychosomatic difficulties you could expect that case to hang fire and that is why we dont let anybody on advanced courses now with low oca do you follow it so these cases that youre auditing in many many instances have gone onto advanced courses without having been set up heres one here now this case had what she called clear cognition and im sure that was the case and etceteras but for some reason best known to man or beast it left all of her attitudes in place which have never been run out so her attitudes are very poor indeed and theyre kicking her brains out right now its interesting that this case is apparently being not been run against an oca i dont see any oca now ill tell you whyah heres an oca ill tell you why the chart of attitudes is more valid because an oca or an apa can be all along the top and then in auditing sink and it will go down either on the left or the right and it will come back up again now person who is terribly out of valence can be very theetiewheetie and this is what you call theetie wheetie its person with terribly high oca who is absolutely for the birds you got it your chart of attitudes will tell you the truth the ocaapa or any other test will not because the person has various characteristics which youll find on the chart of attitudes i mean the chart of human evaluation pardon theyll have communication twists and they will have psychosomatic illnesses and they will have this and they will have that and you look along here and you will see that that case is reading at about 18 or about you know 21 or 03 you can imagine some pcs say oh i just adore death yes funerals i just cant stay away from funerals they are so nice you give them message to give down at the corner and that message never arrives or you tell them tell joe i thought that was nice of him joe comes along and hits you in the nose why well they said bessie ann said you were dirty stinker twisted communications and there you are there you are its down on the right now this person had very interesting quick fast dianetic run with super cognition had clear cognition and that was thatpersons very sick why is the person sick i dont know why the persons sick her auditing is all for the birds so the attitudes in auditing the persons an auditor also so the attitude in auditing is of interest to you as an auditor theres an evil purpose sitting there never been hit never been touched persons going to go on and do themselves in now some of these people are on ot grades and somebodys going to tell you that its impossible for you to run these so i hope that there are amongst you somebody who is at least in the middle band of the advanced courses to run such case as that because you will run into some ot phenomena trying to run it out is that true you got that pretty well taped all right you ought to watch it because you could blow your own head off its not that its terribly dangerous but its very restimulative now this poor guy is in constant ethics trouble all he has to do is sit down and hes immediately in ethics trouble i mean hes got some kind of magnet on him that drags in ethics officers like he had chain on them and he was running huge car salvage winch he roller coasters he went uptone he went very uptone briefly and then he went downtone again when life became just little bit too thick i dont see his oca i dont see an oca now this guy had an improvement of skin he had an improvement in skin you dont even need an ocaall you had to do was look at him joking about it i mean hes visually visibly psychosomatic ill its sitting right there and it roller coasters and he feels very bad indeed now i cant find an oca and its quite remarkable that this person has been audited without one what the hell did they think they were doing thats great now theres another one you make sure you get ocas on these characters before you start auditing them where they dont have them i cant find one here you get him an ocanow once more hes probably being audited over his head in some fashion or another first dianetics single grades and not apparently on board and record of them in the tank well that is very helpful youre running into missing folders doesnt matter much in your case mo report pc wants dianetics sores on knuckles and he actually has gotten up to point where he did lose some of his skin difficulties but theres plenty more there to be done now you start bringing this case down on the basis of what is it his attitudes or his thisas or his thatas or the other thing you start breaking that down on that type of assessment which i gave you and youll get something and i would take it first and foremost immediately straight off in auditing you see and hes such an ethics magnet that you probably would get it in ethics see so you could do little assessment or some kind or another now that brings you up to how you could double or treble assess you can say you can take all the areas where the guy is you know like ethics post flag so on so on so on assess that down you see you got former folders you dont know what hes been run on you assess that down one way or the other and you get nice read there and you take your nice read and you bring it over here to pain you know sensation emotion attitude which one is that by saying on flag has there been pain theres been and so forth take your best read as that get your then immediately draw up your r3r list what attitudes see what emotions you bring it right across actually this is the trick of restimulating guy or putting his attention on something so you can run it out pinpointing you dont necessarily take flag you see and just run flag thats narrative see now lets look at this prize now this guy is prize because he has been sick sick sick sick see now look at that way down on the left way down twice on the right see hes trying to do himself in and do other people in but he isnt really even there to do himself in you get the idea see hes out of valence so he wouldnt be doing himself in all right heres two right here disgust and depressed and theres ep on either in 69an incorrect r3r wanting to cry and nervousness eps somebody really had ball so you obviously you would take his present time environment then you could take his auditingnow you get into life see how this works gives you adequate stuff here hes obviously supermisemotional and couldnt run it therefore an attitude is an engram nobodys ever noticed it so they ask him in auditing for an engram pardon they ask him in auditing for an arc break and it just pulls an engram right up with it you see so that you give an emotion and where people would just normally blow the emotion and that would be that you know something like that he couldnt apparently the auditordont always blame the auditorhe couldnt get down the bank on emotions in general so that shows you the case has been utterly missed now somewhere hell read on meter be some current zone of his life or current zone of his own activity and that will have pains sensations emotions or attitudes and that will match up and all of suddenboom and then that will read well and you do r3r on that and all of sudden why he will have an interesting win now some of these people some of these people cant get an engram to erase now that is peculiar thing that is very peculiar and that is too much auditing and that is just l3b and that normally would be an l3b cleared now in doing this project there are certain things you will do youre not going to clear an l3b twice so you want to mark it over here on your folder summary when youve done one of these things loud and clear so that it can be csed do you see that so what have you got here youve got there are certain things you have to do on all of these cases because theyre just theyre just missed the skipped gradient dianetics now youve done somebody was doing l well heres one thats really cogs on arc straightwire f1 only secondaries and engrams run in 66 both with pc surprised at the fnpc very nervous of auditing ah thats itself its just the same thing im telling you over and over and over probably present time environment what is it whats the pain sensation emotion run it something like that whats been your at whos been auditing and get that run oh ive had so much trouble running engrams and its this and that and the other thing well take an l3b now the l3b can be itself rundown it can he rundown all by itself you just do l3b general and you just r3r on doing l3b all 80 and you just keep on doing l3b and the normal way you do it is to do l3b method 5 just the whole thing and then you take up these various well what you do ill you clear the l3b even though theyve been around and then you do an l3b method 5 and then you take the best reads off it now you can take up if you want to and fly them small falls but you never take up ticks or stops never take up rise that is the reverse that is the guy going into restimulation and then you handle those things the way youre supposed to handle it and then you assess it again but you dont get an fn all the way through and you get another read and you hit that one and you assess it all the way through again and you get another read and you assess that one and what youre working for is method 5 that fns just from the beginning to the end now the way you can cheat on this is to give the guy one hell of win now you really got quickie auditing you give the guy hell of win and hes got persistent fn and so very very hastily call off the whole list rapidly while hes not listening to you at all and you will get it every time so you dont reassess after the persistent win wait until tomorrow so that is letting the pc have his win right now you can get pc protesting just because he feels so good about everything that he doesnt want to look at his bank anymore and hes all extroverted and that sort of thing well thats the time to know off and find another pc jesus god has this person had auditing wow wow wow now you re right away going to ask what about tripling what about tripling up somatics and that sort of thing actually i regard this as little bit dicey definitely dicey now quad is perfectly ok except its dicey theres something i got to mention to you if you run quad after person has been run triple you leave bypassed charge and the only thing about tripling up is just so that you wont leave bypassed charge because if you run triple after the person has been run single without bringing it up he gets bypassed charge got it and hell feel all arc broken and hell want to know how or why or anything else well thats just keyed in the bypassed charge that had been left sitting there quad is been really unnecessarily maligned but trying to quad the guy up after he has been singled or tripled is so difficult and you get so many flubs on it and so on that you could only start brand new person out on dianetics on quad four flow adding the zero but theres sort of lie about the zero anyhow and theres lie about flows anyhow because theyre to marked degree theyre all his own flows so i do not i do noti think you will probably have to bring some of these cases up to triple but that will be difficult because the case isnt ready to run on that sort of thing the way to do it in actual fact just thinking on my feet how to get over this bridge because this is tough one i would try to just triple it and if the person felt arc breaky or that sort of thing then go back i mean just run it triple you assess something run it triple and if hes too chopped up or something like that or starts getting arc breaky or something like that then go back and assess your former single list and finish up its triples dont try to put in every one of them put in only those that read you wont find many or them that do triple up its difficult for an auditor to do this you know run two and three as flows and so on and ive had lot of students when ive been csing ive had lot of trouble with this so its sort or would might make more trouble for the pc by trying to triple it up than just trying to now run it triple do you see what i mean so i think you should meet the trouble after you getto it rather than try to superprevent the trouble because weve got one guy with singles but we dont have any lists so well have to do that anyway there is oca youll have to get an oca out of this one i know that it is probably way up at the top of the graph had false ta check and list corrected and va corrected and int was corrected and lot of things were corrected here jeeesus god drug rundown not complete single actions been completed on this pc except recent correction lists ad course review i feel like its new beginning oh good now you want to look and see if shes got an l3b and shed be very suspect as having been run over misunderstood words anybodys had that much trouble they didnt understand what the auditor was talking about anyhow it must be very very rough case i dont see that this case has run up championship number of devt chits i am absolutely amazed that some of these havent had ocas you get ocas on these things i wont cs without one of these things and you shouldnt either you shouldnt be running them you should know what you are running not trace of one that funny because ottos been auditing this case ottos been auditing this case and hes been auditing this case without an oca student we usually put them in scientology folder huh student we usually put them in scientology folder you dont tell that you guys have changed the folders oh of all the people not to have an oca that ones for the birds it will fall under the same category this person tends to be theetiewheetie and so forth youd address it in just the same way and this one oh my god yes this one oh my god i would absolutely insist that this person had primary rundown before i would touch it hco b 30 march dont for gods sakes go near it without primary rundown you got it you dont see the persons name here because this person has cognitions which are very strange cognitions you know about tech and things like that you know almost as bad as i just realized that the command has something to do with what the pc is doing on his bank its far out and shes probably had some piece of primary rundown see but i would clear this case like mad i havent seen this cases oca theres an oca oooooh now they claim theyve done great here and maybe they have done great but look where this case was the case has probably had some very nice xii auditing something like that see but look at thaton the bottom on the left and almost on the bottom on the rlaht and now has come up into different range but your point here would be to look at this person from the viewpoint of psychosomatic illness on the chart of human evaluation person still got some or these still got bad eyesight still got this still got that ooh now here is bunch of folder errors thats really corny grade iv rehabbed but never run previously i think thats marvelous white form done but not handled scatter brain stuff and it normally will show up i dont see an oca here either so this personwhere were you just make it rule wherever you havent got one of these ocas and you cant find one or it isnt recent why chase one up you merely want it for improvement now ill tell you something if the oca has ever been down expect that its all there always choose your lowest oca the one i just showed you down on the left down on the right you treat that that way in dianetics treat that that way well what theyve done is pull the ideas out of the bank rather than otherwiseall right now heres guy now hes way down over there but i dare say that is probably thats 311071 that that one was taken and thats all the ones theyve done now hes hes not making it because of here you see thats bit low it probably has been lower but this would be case of misunderstood words on all these cats you understand youve got sort of rundown on all these people youve got problem in misunderstood words or it would have communicated youve got problem as there was engrams there and they didnt get run you normally because of chronic this long and been audited this long and so forth youve got problem that the auditing itself formed engrams you have problem that their present time environment must seem very dangerous or charged to them so you can almost work out as just from the principles im telling you you can almost work out very standard treatment of this particular lot of pcsall of whom are chronically ill see that it makes difference so youve got rundown of find out what charged in the present time environment transfer that over into your psea list you know shake it out run it and so forth with regard to the present time environment and run it with regard to auditing and so on now one or two or three of them will be pts or upset so pts rundown the dianetic pts rundown has to come up but dont get too enthusiastic because pts rundown doesnt matter how pts you think the person is or how sick you think the person is you dont run what the auditor thinks the pc is you got it you dont quite have it its what reads on the meter that is real to the pc now when you say this persons got to have pts rundown well youll get away with it lot of times dont you see youll get away with it because the persons normal running case but on none of these cases could you run pts rundown that would immediately and directly violate everything im telling you about these cases theyre chronic sick people you would be running somebody over on the right in pain or something or something or something on very specialized narrative sort of rundown that they might not have any clue of you see whatd be wrong with it when you say this person must have pts rundown youre saying this person has people next to him who are antipathetic to or antagonistic towards scientology so therefore he should have pts rundown perfectly true is the pc ready for the pts rundown usually not in none of these cases would he be now thats why you the auditor knowing what is wrong with the pc see can make hell of mistake so the pc is limping around on 3 canes and hes got loss of missing leg and you can say right away well the guy s got missing leg so therefore he must have engrams of all of that so lets just run oh boy you say whats wrong with you and he says my nose itches see thats the only thing you can get to read now for instance weve got case in washington louie belucci would solve up on this he would solve up immediately on this if you just did this same rundown to his environment and then took and shook it down for his broke down your pain and so forth and ran that and then ran down new his auditing ran that out because lot of it has been over his head hes got steel shaft in his leg so everybody he included comes around and keeps presenting presenting presenting this as the problem see and auditors either do or dont run it or something of that sort but it still remains problem to him he actually probably isnt having problem with his leg at all hes probably having problem with the body see maybe that leg is just his revenge on bodies in general who knows what this is its what would read whats the pc worried about now he isnt worried about these people who are antagonistic to him yet you know they exist so you say well hes got to have pts rundown pts rundown would come around when it came up be alright so that but what part of it can run so dont try to wish off on the pc something that hes not ready to get you got it so its what reads and as long as youre there youre safe youre safe and everythings greatbd item oh thatll run like bomb bd item that fned when he said it oh thats great thats marvelous run it because it fned has nothing whatsotver to do thats just there its keyed out for moment itll key back in ten minutes or six months who knows lets immediately lets grab it lets run that thing see but is he in state that runs what whats he going to run with regard to this the pc half the time hes so afraid of running pain that his mind concentrates on pain it doesnt occur to him that theres any emotion connected with the fact that he hasnt got any left ear do you see so the question actually doesnt communicate this person has had rough time from time to time this person is in ethics trouble from time to time and i imagine there should be an oca here yup here we are see down on the left somewhat down on the right more than somewhat see same treatment all right thats good enough ive shown you enough of these things you know what the general theory of it is now you start running out psychiatry as narrative item that doesnt read well and youre going to be in trouble pcs going to be in trouble theyve been practicing psychiatry as long as thereve been implanters and he can go right back into the bank so thats why i give you this other gradient scale gradient scale of running yes itd be very nice psychiatry would have to read like mad it would have to be really real to this guy before you start running something like that now you run all the attitudes out of it or you run all of the emotions out of it or all of this out of it or that out of it or something like that and then after youre running it for long time you run an entirely different chain and you find suddenly find yourself the guys blowing psychiatric engrams that he didnt even know he had do you see whats the difference so youre actually you run down run little bit deeper run little bit heavier more more you finally get there got it now you in running this sort of thing are the person who will be with the pc so therefore it is very difficult for cs to see what would be available with the pc so therefore your cses as auditors must take into consideration what ive been telling you you have to take into consideration whats sitting there in front of you how does this guy react how does he respond guys that are very slow and have awfully slow comm lags and dont cognite very much and so forth youre running them too deep theyre just running too deep you better find something feather you better find featherweight something for that person to run thats all and you can fish him out of it you see actually if you choose the depth at which youre running the person that fits the person all pcs are easy pianola cases which fn cog vgis see it is you regulating what you ask him and put his attention on its what youre you regulate that you dont say the trouble with this fellow is and then sort of hit him with it see you got it you sort of ask him what he thinks is the trouble with him and then you take it at by test at what depth is good and youll hell do nothing but run that there isnt any reason the only reason the only reason under the sun anybody for instance would be having skin trouble inflammation breakouts anything like that any of those things and so forth is simply engrams theyre all engrams now im talking to you by the way on material research up to about ot oh i dont know 20 it would be so difficult to run some of this stuff engramically the person would never go near it probably and when theyre not thoroughly prepared with dianetics and when they dont have all of their drugs off or anything else they could never really come within it so then they dont get much benefit out of it and it really they can restimulate themselves see but im telling you that all of them are engrams it doesnt matter what level youre running youre still running dianetics and i was busy researching the other day and this is one of the things that caused this project to come aboutis i was busy researching and i looked this thing over from one end to theother and i looked over anything i had run into on the back track were still running engrams and just exactly what happens theres one more caution id like to give you is the sequence or person getting injured is he decides to and his purposes very often come after an injury now let show you how this works he gets motivator so he says im going to ruin those people see the motivator ruin those people etc but now this thing will operate as prior decision and it will even operate as prior decision to injure himself so when youre busy running this when youre busy running these things and so forth remember not to skimp your eb also dont overdo your eb but dont skimp it when you start grinding its either eb or earlier beginning or earlier similar dont grind find that out right away about the third or fourth time that youve undone abcd something like that boy if you havent got on that basic if you havent got an erasure youve got an eb well dont be dilatory in asking for it dont slow down in asking for it dilatoryslow down loaf you got it all right so all this really amounts to all this really amounts to when you look it all over from one end to the other all it really amounts to is bleeding the case of every single piece of dianetics that you can get to readanything that you can get to read well on the person thats whats important about the whole thing and the way to get the person winning all the way and not bogging down all the way is uniformly to choose from the light to the heavy and after youve run them while and run pain you may find you have whole new bank area by the way it was very amusing on this pc who didnt understand any words it was interesting i mean this persons very glib they said oh yes yes they knew what cant and is and so on it isnt the hard words you see its the stupid ones you know the little ones and this persons glib as hell and oh she knew all those things but drugs hadnt run and she couldnt go back track and it was all very difficult and all bogged down and so on the commands were all out but she couldnt be corrected because the words in the correction lists were all out but the correction lists had been used on her and the commands had all been used on her and it was these things which had prevented her from going back track she didnt even know what she was supposed to do now and auditor just with intention can run the pc up and down the track but imagine trying to get erasures or something like that when the pc didnt know what case meant or something of this sort see nonsense now going back to really when i was really knocking around dianetics in 69 i mean i was doing lot of csing on the line there was one mistake that was very often made which i want to call to attention so that it wont get made again and that is the one more time through would have brought the ta down the picture disappeared it was erased but the energy was still there and that is rather constant error was in those days it took the one more time through and sometimes what the guys would get would be high ta with person saying that it had erased they just missed the one time through or the eb postulate on the beginning of the thing the ta would have come right on down boom of they wouldnt get cognition because they didnt run it that one more time through they pack it up they chop it so if you re running at the level of depth which im describing to you you should get cognition so dont cut it off at the end of the line all right so your needle started to fn the pc hasnt had cognition yet and so forth dont give him thats an fn thats it so forth because now hell be sitting there with the decision he made at that time still on the bank that funny things happen about something like this hell come up maybe days later and say he just had an idea that something or other see sometimes they write up like you get it on daily report i had good session and im still cogniting oh brother auditor cut the fn see hes still in session now be perfectly frank to ask questions along in this line ill keep an idea on the thing i wont ask do you have any questions right nowstudent some of these people are already on rundowns are already student on the rundowns like the ones that otto has gotten and davids got one yeah alright so let them finish the rundown you dont need them all at once its matter of scheduling its all right good i dont say they wont make it but i wont say they will not about the people whove been around this long you see because theyre still pulling this of pulling the idea out of the bank getting the person to change his mind you know click click some of your ot iii ot phenomena and so forth will get in your road but it isnt you neednt pay too much attention to it you neednt pay too much attention to it itll handle anyhow so the guy s clear and he doesnt have any more engrams and the body seems to be putting engrams run em see all right any other questions student just one in one of the cases shes in the middle of the clearing course one of these in the middle of the clearing course thats in interference area never should have gotten onto the clearing course must have come aboard right student oh shes been aboard for while but she never have been on the clearing course oh never should have been on the clearing course thats some that was gross error gross error she been on it for some time student she been auditing another student yeah shes been soloing for quite while ah its too bad its too bad youre gonna mess em up thats bum there is way you could handle it if she isnt coming through and she isnt finishing up the clearing course she could run out her auditing that is that is feasible dont try to run out anything else and get her back on the clearing course its about all you could do you could try to run you maybe could run environment and auditing you wouldnt dare go any deeper just the way i told you you see an assessment of the environment what read assessment of persons sensation emotions and attitudes and what those read in auditing you run the environment that way and then take auditing the same way you could run auditor auditing you know the old viii list you look into the viii materials and so forth theres whole list of the standard one dianetics scientology auditors auditing you know that list you can go down that list and instead of using it as prepcheck just use it just as detector list of what in auditing to hit perfectly ok i heard the other day these were all confidential actually theres only few things in viii that are confidential its those that apply to the ot levels thats confidential just to keep from knocking peoples heads off all right any other questions ok now i want to be very close on this line so whos going to do this csing we havent decided whos going to do this csing it isnt on this is it student was going to be david meyers huh student david meyerswell he would have to check out very heavily yeah such is to be csed with lrh as senior cs that might or might not occur that there is bug here i havent in actually the least aversion to csing thats something im perfectly happy to do and the probability is that the output of three or four dianetic auditors see takes about as long to cs as it does to eat dinner i mean theres nothing much to that if the auditors are doing good job if the auditors are doing good job piece of cake if the auditors are not doing smooth standard job are running into trouble of one kind or another its rough thats very rough csing can take you quite while so ill do the csing on this perfectly alright with in spite of the fact that my own hats are kind of pushed off but ive got this sort of cooled off bit crossing my fingers getting the system is working and thats going in better and im suddenly finding out that there were certain camouflaged holes on the line so im getting those adjusted and there were certain missings when we we came off momentarily just because of the system we came off the org productorg officer system and when the org officers were forgottenand by the way they came they went off before the system came in boy didnt that throw the cat amongst the pigeons because it leaves product officer busy getting hold of all of his programs he cant run them down it cant be done as result the missing org officers on this ship are being made up by therere several org officers i dont mind displacing two or three hundred people but sometimes it gets little bit thickwhen i cant also wear my own hats that is so i will cs this line but cases to be lined up and so forth the d of p dianetics hcc now youve got some d of p people and so on the programs to be written for each case to briefly repair and do real dianetics on you got that one all right well that one you can get busy on and when it gets down here to the csing when youve got one of these cases fully programmed and so forth send it up to ill give you an ok and send it on down all right my csing for you sometimes has the disadvantage that im not on deck instantly available on something like that but the way to get around that is to dont get in that much trouble all right thank you very much students thank you sir end of tapeexpanded dianetics lecture no2 lecture given to the flag dianetic auditing team on 7 april 1972 c7204c07 so expanded dianetics and word clearing all right this is the 7th april 72 and have you got your misunderstood words cleaned up from the last lecture are you sure all right well thats fine then we can proceed with this one and this is specialist dianetics lecture which is the graduate dianetics course actually the first thing i want to talk to you about little bit is word clearing its obvious that dianetic specialist would really have to know his business on the subject of word clearing and thats interesting because word clearing then also contains if youre going to correct it you have to know what rudiment actions in order to pick the ruds out bit by bit and run those with r3r and so its quite obvious that word clearing is necessary action its interesting that you and the team are doing very well and that your word clearing is very good if they dont have uniform success with word clearing the auditors trs leave something to be desired or his metering or something and they every once in while why will have catastrophe on the subject of word clearing which occurs in the middle of rundown and then they really have catastrophe and the main difficulty with that is they dont clear the word clearing correction list and we already have taken this up on the folder line but if you dont clear the word clearing correction list at the time when there are flubs in word clearing then when you get flub in word clearing you have lost your correction tool but this clear the list first can go little bit too far let us get situation where pc is in screaming arc break and somebody clears the l1c before he handles the arc break now that came up on the line the other day and i thought well if that pc had really been arc broken it turned out that the pc had withhold or something but if the pc had really had an arc break that would have been it because of course auditing over the top of an arc break just pushes person down and they get sadder and sadder and sadder and sadder but in general he got away with it but if pc has serious arc break in the last session why your best bet if you do not have word cleared l1c you best bet would be adrift if you had never cleared the word arc break so to protect the pc it is quite obvious that at the beginning of his auditing we had better clear this word arc break and we had better clear this word present time problem and we had better clear this word withhold otherwise well find ourselves somewhere along the line adrift and then we would have the proposition of having to spend two hours clearing list while the pc was nattering about how bad the auditor was i dont think it would be very easy to do so the rudiments would probably be the first thing you would clear we can make rule about that and so on not that he has one its just lets do it just in case so that he suddenly recognizes when you say it what you are asking for so word clearing here is of considerable interest and it is of course just itself as technology and that can be studied in its own frame of reference but where it comes in in this particular field of specialist dianetics is you will find the bulk of the people who have had any difficulty whatsoever have been audited over misunderstood words and there are two big things that give people very bad start on auditing if they dont know the meaning of how do you do and is and what and did and few words likethat and then hes had it because axiom 28 is violated you dont have communication so you wont get duplication so therefore they cant do what you said and so on now this is considerable breakthrough in its own right because i never realized that auditors stopped clearing words in the commands and i understand now that it dropped out to marked degree where the auditor would read the command and ask the pc if he understood that or not even ask the pc that just read the command take word and sail off into the wide blue horizon he would think he had reading item when he didnt he would have reading misunderstood word and that in itself would make great deal of difficulty theres probably many drug addict who does not know the meaning of the word amphetamine which is the commoner drug which of course they call speed and somebody told the other day that it was benzedrine which is one of the keep awake drugs of yesteryear and that say that is an amphetamine i dont believe that but in any event you understand just with the words i was using these are just the names of drugs well you can imagine this 10 year old kid i think thats when they start on drugs now or is it 8 this 10 year old kid or 8 year old kid you ask him now when were you on amphetamines or were you on benadryl or benzedrine now which were you on and you get read and you say ah but hes never heard of this stuff see actually he was on lsd but hes never heard of it as lsd anyhow thats acid and actually not even the news papers reporters know the name of the stuff because they keep calling it lsd and lsd isnt isnt its name its lsd 25 if you want to be very purist about it so you can imagine taking this drug addict whos already all fogged up on drugs should carry little foghorn on his shoulder when hes walking down the street and what do you find you wouldnt know anything about it because he didnt know anything about it now how you would get over that point is you would have to clear up with him what drugs he was on you couldnt take canned list of drugs and expect very much action because he would require some sort of an education on the subject of chemistry so what did they call these things you can probably identify them from such things as acid i was on acid kid you know i was on acid you know they dont even know what the hell you talk about the stupidity of things its absolutely marvelous you know i was tracing this back intelligence wise and it is the perfect intelligence drugvery very simple to make few kitchen utensils and probably originated in germany and it is probably an intelligence drug of some type or other terribly cheap and then drives person stark staring mad and these dumb yips are actually taking this stuff girl was gruesome tales occur on that drug very gruesome girl got scratch on the back of her hand wasnt bleeding very much took it to doctor ah it was all right he let her go and it hand got to swelling up but it was just little scratch and all of sudden her hand swelled up and she got gangrene which is just rotting flesh and they had to amputate her hand and arm she was on lsd which basically is drug called ergo or ergot which is used to constrict the blood vessels so that blood wont circulate and if anybody gets any kind of whee out of lsd that would be quite remarkable because it is simply they dont get any blood in their brain and that must be the whole kick its pretty marvelous see so now youre busy auditing somebody who doesnt really know he has been on this and you ask him if hes ever been on that you might get read on it but hes liable to run something else or not know what youre talking about i probably should clarify something here little bit the reason why the scratch infected is all the time when she scratched her hand and all the time she was on lsd which contains ergot which is the constriction lysergic acid it constricts all the blood vessels and the arteries and so on so there couldnt be any blood get to it and it wouldnt circulate blood circulate and it wouldnt heal so the doctor took his finger off his number on that oneso this would make quite an interesting engram of some kind or another if you were to run it on somebody she wouldnt know the word ergot she wouldnt know the word lsd 25 she wouldnt know lsd she wouldnt know lysergic acid and maybe they called it something locally maybe they didnt even call it acid so it is the pcs nomenclature now the pc isnt really likely to use words he doesnt know the meaning of when hes giving you some kind of an item he isnt likely to it would be possible but not necessarily true so you dont have to clear the item list i noticed there was somebody clearing an item list and this useless why clear the item list now it would work the same way with drug list so that you wouldnt really want canned list or you need to know what i mean by canned listone that has been preprepared and issued you really wouldnt want that but he might not know the meaning of the word drug and i notice that people occasionally will have been on some awful medicine of some kind or another you know like there is medicine puts people to sleep called bromine and this doctor was simply giving her these tranquilizers and it was just bromine and they dont give it to you as drug and then people who have epilepsy which is type of disease which gives them seizures are almost always found on some minor drug that prevents them from getting thesethey call them petit mal seizures thats epilepsy i dont care how they call it sometimes they really seize and sometimes its just slight one of those if an epileptic ever took you by the hand and so forth hes liable to break every bone in your hand if he suddenly had seizure but the doctors keep them on something to prevent this its just tranquilizer and they keep them on that one year year in and year out and then you come along as an auditor and you try to audit the pc and you tell the pc that hell have to go off that drug and then all of sudden why something will happen from someplace or another that the pc will tell the doctor that they have been taken off the drug by the auditor and the doctor will call up plaintively asking you to please put her back on the drug because she needs this and you get into collision between medical treatment and so on now ive been using lot of medical words here or chemical words really just dont pay any attention to them because theyre mostly gobbledygook and theres an awful lot of gobbledygook words gobbledygook just means nonsense chatter you see theres an awful lot of them i remember in ancient greece trying to disentangle latin names for diseases into the greek and greeks names for the same diseases and then the greeks telling you they had certain diseases when they were speaking dialect nobody else spoke and it gets pretty gobbledygook so actually then what do you clear do you see you could find yourself starting to give somebody total college education in chemistry or medicine now mary sues brother who is radiologist an xray doctor he actually was in the navy and he specialized in this field and he came out and hes down in texas or someplace now he was talking to mary sue not too long ago when she was over in the states and he said but you cant gethes very disgusted with the patients hes done his internship and all that but hes very disgusted with patients because they cant tell you whats wrong and you ask them and you ask them and you ask them and they cant tell you whats wrong and they come in and they cant tell you whats wrong and they tell you some of the they just dont talk to you see and so on and ive been on the verge of sending him one of these little puttogether dolls which is plastic you know theyre about 11 tall something like that and they have all the organs inside of them so that his patients could point to them and say this is where i hurt you know and he would get someplace with it but you cannot expect somebody to say to you well i have been taking 2cc of morphine ive been using dirty needle and originally i was being given an injection in the gluteus maximusmeaning his butt but now it is all in the biceps he comes in and he says i gota concrete arm see it means hes injected himself so much in the arm that the arm has gone solid to the touch or something like that you might expect him to say something like that but the chances are he wont and the chances are he will just simply sit there and expect you to do something magical without his volunteering thing but what he will volunteer he has tremendous interest on and that is technical datum now what blows down is what is really real to him and what he volunteers will usually read and blow down so that although you have to word clear correction lists clearing the pcs own list is not necessary but that isnt the real problem the real problem is getting him to make one there is person on these lines who has had murder rape death who has been audited for years and has never mentioned these death of people around her perversion in the family the wildest family background you ever heard of the pcs not been intensively on my lines in other words i havent been csing this pc or i would have but this person was sort of going downhill and so i got interested in this folder and i took look at it and the information isnt there the information is on rumor line l started getting it into the folder but that information came in on rumor line this pc as far as i know it could be wrong maybe that i didnt check the folder i havent gone exhaustively through the folderbut just looking at the pcs condition this hairraising existence she led is not part of any list not part of any white form not part of any record and 1100th of it would be enough to send somebody around the bend now hold your hatshe was also psychiatric nurse suffering god and youve been trying to audit that with all kinds of upper level processes and everything else but nobody ever got to the nittygritty meaning the important core of the case so therefore your success will enormously depend upon your ability to sniff out the real hot dope if the medical doctor thinks he has trouble on this think of trying to pull withhold on somebody who was cheating on her husband for 39 years and keeping him from ever knowing anything about itwith his best friend now ive mentioned the case before is the dear little old lady that would never give up any withholds and had never done anything until we suddenly started going at it this way did you murder somebody did you poison people have you robbed banks shes sitting there with little flower in her hat dear little person with mittens on dont you see and thats really taking the long way around and of course it came up oh i didnt do any of those things all i did was and there it was and that was that now youre not necessarily going to be running much in the way of ruds but im giving you the basis of why people dont talk so therefore chains of things they have withheld that is to say times of withholding and so forth will get you quite bit of information but it will also pull out from underneath the case one of the basic the basic chains that are keeping them very pinned down so the case that doesnt talk to you is normally speaking the normal case i mean the case that you bring on off the street why he has all kinds of ideas like certain people shouldnt inquire into certain privacies and nobody should know anything about anybody in fact here is book that was just put out and one of our people just sent it in to and its just been published by the university of michigan press and the name of it isits pocketbook probably all over the us newsstands right nowand its the assault on privacy computers data banks and dossiers quote what misuse of computers is doing and can do to individual freedomsa warning of new form of human slavery unquote now thats by ralph nader by the way so if smart guy like that can propagandize against the exchange of information why then there must be something wrong with giving up information now to run consequences in dianetics would find you doing what running the back end of the engram you would neverget the beginning of the engram if you cant get to the beginning of the engram you wont get to the beginning of the chain and the ta will go up like mad so lets have an itembeing scared after battles now thats pretty obvious that every one of those you ran see thats pretty obvious isnt it every one of those you ran of course has got battle as the beginning of it there he is hes got he says i have this somatic in my shoulder and so on and you say what is the item well its being scared after battle youre going to grind long long time and youre not going to get that somatic in his shoulder or anything else because it didnt occur there was such an item run year or so ago and it was running away from battle thats marvelous when you come right down to it see now that is an invitation to run the back end of the engram and i must warn you about this because it will give you sudden and then weird high tas so you actually shouldnt run withhold as chain why its after the incident but you could run all the overts you wanted to and all the motivators you wanted to because you would get the withhold but he isnt going to tell you the overt because hes withholding it do you see what goes on here so you can get an out of communicationness with the pc and thered be certain chains will remain seized up in the bank which nobody has touched so this person has gone on for long time and he has all these chains that have never been touched and never been run and by preference he runs other chains and that is just case of the pc who wont talk you have such pc youre auditing him right now hes on the lines hes run the same thing seven times he said i mean well hes an engram specialist do you follow he specializes in one chain you got it why because theres something very wrong with the way hes been audited and the way hes been talking to auditors and theres something very wrong with his track and theres something very wrong in all directions and whenever you see this kind of thing you say there is something very wrong and the first thing you can select out is there may be something wrong with his pt environment and the next thing you can select out is maybe there was something wrong with his auditing and the next thing you can select out is maybe he has just been avoiding running because when fellow tells you hes run the same thing seven times and it isnt gone yet well hes certainly avoiding something now you could say right away well you could run avoiding you know now i do want to call to your attentionthats not the right answer i do want to call to your ill give it to you in minute but i do want to call to your attention just to close off this other subjectwatch these after the fact things because youll be sitting there help the ta has now gone to 65 and then all of sudden the wrong time to realize that is youre running finished seemed like good item at the time time you were finished that was pretty good it comes under the same rules as interiorization and you should have familiarity with interiorization processing and the thing which cracks the back of interiorization is when the fellow goes out of something he must have gone into it so you have to run going into it now the interiorization rundown has been under overhaul and i should give you this one too because youre doing word clearing interiorization rundown youll find yourself being called upon to do an intext correction list every time you see interiorization read on word clearing correction form now its there for purpose but it worries people because it reads now it can go out from day to day and some people particularly cses become frantic and they handle it and handle it and handle it and handle it and they worry and worry and worry now there was something wrong with the original interiorization rundown flow 1 was what you call permissive or general it permitted the pc to go in any direction so flow 1 was often some other kind of flow so the flow situation is put in flow 0 is went in so youcan run the flows wrong and if youre correcting one of these things the fastest thing to do is just to if the guys in heck of lot of mass and all that sort of thing and youre trying to straighten it out is this wrong flow situation because there was missing flow put in time you were put in and thats what theyre all afraid ofgoing to jail do you see it now you can even figure out they were put in this universe so theres missing flow that is actually the flow 1 so the original issues on the thing was perfectly valid and it works but sometimes when it has to be corrected and corrected and corrected and corrected nobody really asks this burning question this really can be missing chain called put in and it will probably be corrected and the int pack will he corrected and so forth on this we usually dont correct things unless were having lot of trouble with them theyre having little trouble with this in the field but that isnt the trouble with it the trouble is they just dont run 1 to 9 to d and they say now heres the main trouble with it is theyve never got the word defined its brain cracking word so if the word has never been well cleared on word clearing correction list it will continue to read now you just had one come through where it did read and you were going to do an intext well now the test is simply this ta was not misbehaving only do an int ext correction list when youve got ta misbehaviortoo high or really too low you see that now you call separate out tremendous amount if you just recognize and remember dont go panic on interiorization read dont panic on it the hell with it ta wasnt high now interiorization is only run to cure high ta it is not run to exteriorize somebody so therefore if the ta wasnt high you have situation so int read two way comm so forth how do you feel about interiorization do you understand what the word means you dont ask them one after the other how do you feel about interiorization yap yap yap yap yap yap yap yap yap yap yap fn so that s it that takes weight off of your shoulders and the other one is if just waffle waffleetc give definition for it and hell say well i just never knew that and get him to define it and itll stop reading so those those that point is something you should know something about thank you very much end of tapeexpanded dianetics lecture 3 to the flag dianetic auditing team on 7 april 1972 7204c07 soii auditor administration all right now actually your auditing has been very good its been very very good and the only thing im picking you up on is just on i havent picked you up as hard as i could on it is just the common old garden variety form of the administrative actions so ill go over those the form of folder it is folder and it does have the consecutive sessions and examiner reports and cses page by page from way back at the bottom up to the top of it the folder mustnt get too fat the program is on the lefthand inside cover the pcs name is on the edge of the back the pcs name is on the top face of the folder its on the edge so that you can pull it out of stack when theyre lying in packs now you know all that sort of thing but theres little bit more to know about it and that is you always check off the step on the program that you have done that doesnt seem like much but actually that gives it gives another terminal in the org the information he looks for he wants to know how far the program is done so he knows when this guy will be finished thats the host he wants to know when this person will be finished and he can estimate in some very very odd fashion if he looks at the date of the last session or the last cs which is uppermost and then looks over on the red program sheet the ink written program sheet and he looks and sees thats checked off and theres just two more steps to do now he does have enough sense to know about how long it takes to do whats left but he is not technical terminal so therefore the folder summary would be meaningless to him its usually abbreviated and its this and that but all he wants to know is how far does that program got to go now thats all actually d of p wants to know he isnt paying any attention to the folder summary either but he is paying attention to that program sheet now that program sheet was laid out by the cs as hopeful action now youve just been doing lot of these but its the hopeful action that these steps will bring this case back to battery back to battery artillery term gun after it fires is said out of battery which is to say it recoils and then after it fires is supposed to go back to battery which is sitting the way you see them in photographs and they use the term in slang to indicate somebody who is now fixed up so this guy will be all right for something or what he has had will now be over most of the time when you read these things the cs i could give you purer definition and say it is completed case for that level but the cs normally doesnt think like that hes looking through there and he sees all of these mistakes in the fes and he sees all of this and that and something or other has happened with the case and this or that is wrong with the case and he really doesnt even think most of the time of what hes trying to make right with the case but he knows these things have to be handled so therefore he writes this program down and the end of that program should be well this guy is safe to go off on mission hes all right to go home he will do all right on his post thats the way they normally think of this and so on and your point of view it would be well person something of that sort for such program now technically speaking when you are doing something to bring case back up to where the case ought to he on his grade chart that is to say the big grade chart that is progress program youre not putting him through another grade now weve got little split in specialist dianetics because actually were writing these things up on red sheet when theyre really expanded dianetics and are grade really in themselves so weve written all those on red sheets but actually they ought to be two sheets they ought to be the actionsnecessary to get them up to expanded dianetics would be the repair and then when you start running expanded dianetics it should be on green sheet because in actual fact is grade now it wouldnt much matter where this fellow was he is still getting grade it doesnt matter whether this grade fits on his grade chart now its going to fit clear up there after ot iii it doesnt matter if it fits before hes going to have more or any dianetics at all it doesnt matter if it fits after dianetics its an entirely separate grade and what its going is fix him up as grade to make well person out of him now you will find then that these sheets will start and they look like repair of dianetics but it isnt really repair of dianetics he just couldnt run it so they didnt run dianetics he didnt like engrams or something he didnt understand the words so therefore youre really doing specialist action which would permit him to run dianetics but in doing that youre going to cure him now you see dianetics isnt just health action it can do two more things one of those products is person who will continue to be well for long time and the other one is it will increase his abilities now when you bridge over to the point where hes well youre really just doing dianetics so what youre really working is for well person not person who will continue to he physically well for long time because that would be dianetics so youll find out that interns others will say well this expanded dianetics that were running actually is just like dianetics and weve got to clear the lists anyhow and so on well the trouble with that is the length of time it would take to make dianetic auditor who was capable of doing expanded dianetics would interrupt the whole show right there because there are lot of people that can run dianetics its quite successful in lots of peoples hands on lots of pcs so now were going to teach him all of dianetics and with experience with running dianetics whatsoever were going to launch him off into very being very fancy at handling dianetics oh yeah oh we wont make it so this influences your programming so you really have two green sheets youve got your repair to get him up there now where you have drawn line here and there and have marked in printed in expanded dianetics if you want to he very stylized about it all that is over that repair is over that is it thats the red sheet finished were going to give him let us say primary rundown and were going to and so on were going to send him to the doctor to get his epiglottis cured thats fictitious term and so youve probably noticed it that your people are sort of out of phase you dont know quite where youre starting on them and where youre not starting on them and so forth because there are some beginning steps every now and then theyre supposed to get word clearing number one and that sort of thing theyre supposed to get this that or the other thing and then theyre going to have so on well now if they bog down on word clearing youre going to have to handle that and finish up their word clearing number one right thats repair you shouldnt start out and pick up somebody and do word clearing number one and say that youre starting expanded dianetics theres nothing wrong with his word clearing youre just going to clear give him word clearing number one and then youre going to start expanded dianetics its actually the waste of specialist so all of these prior actions that you have to take to get the person up there might or might not be by the dianetic specialist but certainly expanded dianetics will be by the dianetic specialist and it would be up to judgment on whod repair it well frequent change of auditors upsets people like mad so if these are not very extensive well id go ahead and do word clearing correction list or something like that but particularly if its word clearing correction list or something like that yeah well youd want to do that yourself but youre going to start this fellow out and youre going to give him word clearing number one and then youre going to take all the things that he has ever read up to date and youre going to clear those with word clearing number two and then youre going to get him entirely through the primary correction rundown of study tapes and finding his why and youre going to do all this huh wrong hatnow if you start adding those things in and if you dont have good idea of exactly where you belong on the grade chart or your action then youre going to go adrift because all of sudden youll start inheriting all the bits and pieces and odds and ends that nobody can figure out where to go now you just inherited one girl came in here auditing her i just had her folder you did word clearing correction list on her something like that and wham she was incomplete middle of the rundown read like mad on advanced courses she had more business under gods earth being any place but over on advanced courses because if you ran anything else on her until she finished that up she would still he getting audited in the middle of another rundown you cant perpetuate the error that is continue the error forever she didnt belong to you at all they goofed and what do you know just got through goofing again the auditor looked over the list after the session found out she still had reading item on the list shed forgotten to handle so decided she would get her back into session next time handle that the time the person got ill she was rather chronically ill for long period of time but the time the person really got ill currently is she was declared complete on an ao rundown promptly got ill the a0 the advanced courses unit lost the pc off the lines that is all it didnt call the pc back in didnt review the pc didnt at that time which is why that was reorganized at that time early february had slightest idea of who was on the lines just let them just lost them all over the place so guy would go out and give himself solo session fall on his head red tabbed never be called back into the advanced courses didnt have review auditor so it was an untidy scene to say the least and here all of sudden youve got this folder now you want to know what to do with this so routing you see is important to you what do you do with this guy all right youre perfectly willing to go on and do it i marked it because i didnt know whether advanced courses would repair the person or not i marked it that you could do it if you wanted to if they didnt reason to just stall the pc and again lose the pc off the lines but it s just been done and what happened was is repair actions continuously were taking place on this pc in the middle of an ao rundown since 1968 and its now 72 and then the person finally said in some off hand way that she thought she was finished they put another cs in that folder and it might have been there in the review folder where it shouldnt have been but i dont think there was any declare they then lost the folder and she promptly afterwards got sick and the ao didnt route any exam report into the folder and they never kept track in advanced course line of their preots what business have you got to do with that none none whatsoever now if at some time when that action which is red red sheet action dont you see but advanced courses when they finish that up and the person is still falling on their head and that sort of thing and etcetera but when that level is completed why that is the time to come over actually the review auditor at this particular time doesnt want to be there you normally find people who were doing bad job arent quite on the post they either haven gotten onto the post not that they arent hatted they just dont havent gotten onto the post yet or theyre leaving the post or they want to leave the post or they are somebody else while holding that title or they have wrong product which is changing their post hat but they dont ever notice it which can be very interesting you know that the d of p can have completed programs as his product and hes of course the cs i want you to take look at that now lets exaggerate it lets exaggerate it so you can really see it supposing the folder page had well pcs as product now the folder page of course is not even in connection with the pcs or the auditors but is only with the cs it was interesting i had couple of my messengers the other day trying to work out their product on folder paging we found out that it didnt really describe it i think they came up with finally the action was feeding folders to the senior cs and routing them to tech which have of course the product should he folder fed to the senior cs and routed to tech and that was what these messengers were doing up there by fed we mean put on the deck opened so that it could be handled and taken off the deck and routed and so on soon as we cleared thatthey went whizzwhizzwhizzwhizzwhizzwhizzwhizzwhizz whole great big stack of folders went down bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzmmm up to that time i would have them i was having to yell for them for each folder they didnt have product so product can be very very very important it can be so important that the slowness that you are trying to get handled can simply be something is wrong about the product they either dont have one at all they havent named the product theyre really mentally working for the wrong product never having straightened it out am i making my point now so that if you as dianetic specialist are working for an ao productahhh the bell begins to toll huh so the second that you find yourself off product by reason of programs you know youre handling something that doesnt belong to you now ill tell you something very funny the pending basket the center pending basket of the three tiers of baskets top is the in center is pendlng bottom out all right very good or they were reversed if i remember rightly the stuff in that center basket if you go into an executives office will be found not to belong to him and thats why its in pending and you can go into that middle pending basket and just take all the stuff out and sit down with the executive if youre communicator and you can just take them one by one and say who does this belong to and all of sudden the bulk of all that stuff hes been holding onto one belongs to address somebody else belongs to something else somebody belongs to something else and so on theyre all parts of the see not the wrong parts of the theyre all in the parts of the that he isnt having anything to do with so this tells you just on that example that you could accumulate tremendous number of pcs that nothing would happen with if you continued to work on the wrong product and that they belong to somebody else for some reason and when you get backlogs let give you this very sound advice look over and see that those pcs belong to you now that is why you have the programs very very well sharply done particularly as the dianetics specialist that top one is red you dont have to change all of your stuff making you redo your programs youre going on down through the line fine you did very good programs that top one that top red one thats to get him up to place where you can work on him now it might be that the repairs are so slight or something like that like word clearing so on well fine correction list got to correct his word clearing nobody else is going to but you should realize at that moment that youre really working on another product see its almost worth chit fmaa person word cleared such and such time place according to the folder such and such an auditor found out now we sent one out the other day we sent one to the aola rapraprap couple of nice juicy conditions they sent guy in here after his word clearing he had horrible headache so they ran couple of class vi processes that have very little to do with headaches and it didnt occur to single soul that he had just had word clearing and he should have word clearing correction list run on him hes running like hot bomb now because we ran word clearing correction list on him but we also sent chit and that isnt being mean thats just trying to keep the lines policed if you dont ever make any effort to keep the lines policed theyll cave in on you it isnt even of great concern to you that this gets handled by the maa or something you just write it down who it was and where and what you got and you can go ahead and handle it but that makes you aware of the fact that youre handling somebody elses product of one kind or another and keeps you from scrambling up your products and thats the only thing im trying to ask you not to do now if youre going to make this person well and youre going to use expanded dianetics on well you have to do little bit of repair to get him up to that point but your expanded dianetics is an action and it is grade in its own right really the ama would jump for saying it and i think california has laws that nobody can cure cancer and theyve just disobeyed that law in england because doctor up there who is dianetic auditor has just cured somebody of totally proven cancer has taken him over to the medical association and big conference and so on and displayed him complete with the xrays and so forth so gee its good thing he didnt do that in californiawe had all auditor in 1950s who was actually arrested for the fact of proven conclusively because hed audited somebody and they had gotten well and it was against the law to cure that disease he got off there wasnt anything happened to him at all somebody was just making push on it locally pretty crazy huh proved it conclusively against the law to heal it and hed done it man man unaimed sometimes is idiocy anyway im not warning you not to cure things but saying that this product of cured person cant be stated that way it has to be stated as well person illegal ive worked it out one time i think its because the undertakers percentage to the ama and so forth would lose and drop as stat if you thats the only reason i could find for it im sure they get ten or twenty percent of all the funeral fees anyhow it must be but in this field in this field thats the product thats your product its well person all right fine but if the other actions have to be taken like sending him to medical doctor or getting their head sewn up or something like this why that is quite another action that is quite another action than what youre supposed to be doing well you can send him to the medical doctor thats beside the point but its another its not the product you are working for they wont get well anyhow but its not what youre working for but there has to he certain number of actions that bring you up to where you are going to do this expanded dianetics and then that should be on green sheet and then if youre going to do dianetics why that ought to be included that is sooner or later this guy is going to be well see well youre not going to audit him forever thats it turn him over to the hsdc you get the point so that has lot to do with what it is all right now always mark in folder summary mark in your session and your admin time and approximately whether it ran and what approximately what was run and what happened with the exam report now you know all those things but do you know they get omitted and all you got to do is omit one of those things and youve had it now theres something else it sounds so petty and so little and so tiny number your pages back and front the first page of the work sheet is number one and the second page of the work sheet is number two and the third page of the work sheet is the next sheet now why all that well youve possibly havent been working with meticulous meaning very precise cs and it makes difference you want to be able to say its page twentysix or page twentyfive now the rs which occurred on page twentyfive in writing this your cs up and it just saves more time than you ever cared to look at and furthermore it gives you the proper number of pages that the session went it doesnt matter whether you write big or small now if you write big thats fine but write legibly i mean readable so work sheet is fixed up at the end of the session go through it and glance through it and see whether or not there are any words that nobody could make out and if they are put it in block print now you can overdo this to an extent that its almost sarcasm at the most itd just run one or two corrections to page or something like that but if youre having to correct 3 pages like that then the auditor should learn how to write rapidly legibly and people can do that newspaper reporter by the way of 1898 could write faster than man could talk longhand beautifully and i have seen notes taken by the columbian college association george washington university i wrote their historical supplement i didnt go there by the way you know i merely was thats what they tell people thats very funny before they lie like that they ought to go in and look at some of their things i used to i used to write their supplements like their magazine supplements and that sort of thing i always was on the front page and you go in and find out who was the president of the american society of civil engineers and that sort of thing in such and such year and i got my name up in gold on the wall theyre not clever and so on but actually that is an organization that was dominated by fellow named oberholzer they were dominated there through their psychology department and hes world federation of mental health smersh i shouldnt speak harshly of the world federation of mental healthat this particular time because you never speak of those that are dying but thats where all that came from hasnt anything to do with anything else i expect in another 50 years theyll probably have gold plaque out in front of the building you know so i tell everybody i didnt go there that fixes them well now when you find an ethics situation in folder you mark it you dont necessarily turn it in because you cant try guy on his work sheets in his auditing its illegal but you for heavens sakes at least make mention of it on your auditors cs and if he rses you make mention of it rs on page 21 and when youre doing that and youre doing your administration you pick up that rs circle it with red pencil now if an evil purpose suddenly leaps into view with crash and bang or very very juicy item leaps up with crash and bang its little bit dramatic to pick up red pencil in the session and circle it but you can put bar along side of it to be circled now when an evil purpose jumps up you mark it over on the side of the program and when this person is suddenly found to be rsing you mark it over on the edge the lefthand edge of the program the topmost program rses thats all you have to say but on your work sheet and so on why you should say what page its on now if you wanted to be very fancy on the thing you would say date and work sheet page on the program and you should do that for an evil purpose because somebody up the line is going to want to date and locate that thing and he doesnt want to go through seventeen feet of folders just to find one lousy evil purpose you got it so the upshot of this is that its information now that for sure is marked on your folder summary and its usually marked in red and the evil purpose is similarly marked your dianetic items are for sure marked ran so and so and so and so well you know that and youre doing that but that evil purpose there mark that in red with bit of circle on it also back there on the folder summary because somebody else up the line is going to mark i hate everybody or whatever the evil purpose is that isnt one hes going to mark that that it was dated and located so you can check folder summary and find out whether things were handled lot of things wrong with an fes is that theyve already been handled and its very very difficult to track whether or not theyve been handled so the mark down of handling and so forth is correct now when you correct list list is brought forward and corrected and so on why it should be marked as corrected otherwise somebody will be correcting it again somebodys ta will go up and theyll wonder what in the hell is going on now were just talking about common little old garden variety admin that makes the lines flow smoothly they are otherwise the auditor writes out his cs and the cs gives the session grade and all that you know these things these are fine but im just giving you just these little tiny fine points that make it lot easier to run now when you get those things in youll find it is now i notice youre putting slip on the outside of your folder totally unnecessary but you could put some christmas tape on it that marks the folder as being on expanded dianetics i dont care what color tape you use usually theyre marked when youre marking folder mark it around the back that is from the cover around the back of the bind so it can be picked out of folder stack now they use green as advanced courses but weve more of less ceased to use red so you might as well use red and that is enough now they know those folders are coming up and theres reason to mark routing slip on them it is that stack and you should have place to put that stack of folders go to or you bring them up and then there is should be an arrangement of that stack of folders goes back and appears in this place and then you wont be into horrible scramble the folder completely aside from the pc has its own routing lines and people sometimes dont recognize that theyre routing folder theyre routing an auditor theyre routing pc and thats why they have scramble and confusion because theyve just got one of the items like the auditorthey dont get the auditor something its one of these things thats left out and you get an omitted datum continuously and that messes up the scene all right now all of thats well and good how many misunderstood words have you picked up now have you picked up any or anything speak up if you have all right thank you very much end of tapeexpanded dianetics lecture 4 to the flag dianetic auditing team on 7 april 1972 illness breakthrough i have been researching very very hard i have been researching very very very hard actually to find out why they kick in bad pictures and why they kick in pictures at all and well its been very long time ive been looking at this long time and i finally unraveled it so it is one hell of breakthrough ive been interested in it because were working with expanded dianetics and it is one hell of breakthrough it is actually why people get sick pasteur came along in the last part of the 19th century and he invented germs and it gave everyone and his brother an awful curve because they do exist but in the practice there is thing called predisposition heres some marvelous words for you predisposition in other words before the fact the guy is disposed to get sick and then theres precipitation and that means what precipitates this illness now hes already predisposed this guys going to get sick now hes suddenly sick thats precipitated the illness precipitated and then he doesnt get well and thats called prolongation in other words its just continuously gone on with theres these three factors predisposition precipitation prolongation now in most of these cases you were handling prolongation but you also could be handling preventive dianeticsprecipitation now those facts are merely academic and they have been known to medical professions on this and other planets for very long time theyve never known how anybody got sick now why do you get sick well actually body is made sick or is given accidents by the being who is running it now fellow can be standing in the wrong place at the wrong time and be hit by an artillery shell that is the only one fired in this century in central park well thats not necessarily his fault so barring that accident which is sort of the thing that triggers it in the first place he predisposes himself to very marked degree to become ill if hes going to become ill he predisposes himself to becoming ill how does he do that well he misses the boat he takes his finger off his number other clichés of this character he forgets to eat his wheeties for two months you know something like this you see he does something he knows this babe hes going with is outethics and yet he goes on going with her that sort of thing she knows this guy has already had 115 girlfriends but she thinks shes going to be permanent in other words she predisposes herself you got the idea now the precipitation is exactly at this point exactly at this point the threat of loss any inkling or belief or idea that the person is going to be unsafe or insecure or is going to lose and go little bit further south and little less viable if you want to use such word it would be innumerable absolutely innumerable reasons why person believes that this is going to occur but that is what is going to occur its going to be some loss his existence is threatened his positions or possessions are threatened or somebody around him is threatened it could he on the other two flows it could also be on flow 0 in other words hes going to become less secure because hes going to lose body something happens to his friends therefore hes not going to have any friends so not going to have any friends why that will make him stand alone he knows he cant quote unquotethat he cant stand alone so therefore it is inevitable that then something will happento him and then he wont be able to support the body and then do you get the chain the chain think and that will come down to his loss of body and that will come down to loss all right well we know people get sick when theyre threatened with loss we have known this for long time as matter of fact on tv in front of half of san francisco that was at their tv sets one time i took the announcer or the girl who was showing this she was on before the camera she had cold and she was before the camera with cold she went off the camera i saw her in the waiting room i had just given talk by the way on tv saw her in the outside vestibule waiting to go on again saw that she had cold just gave her couple of commands of straightwire ping ping and that was the end of her cold i just asked her who shed lost lately or something like this and got the exact person and that was it and she all of sudden brightened up madly terrific terrific pr and she walks back in the room to announce her next product and instead of announcing what shes selling she says you know that fellow who was just on here you know i had cold when i was talking to you before and he said couple of things to and its gone very good pr i used to do this occasionally almost parlor trick and i tried to teach the mos to do it down here and so on they kept it up for little while but because trs are not you know just not not being swift about the thing they dropped it out but it probably would he bunged up anyway but there you have an interesting display on minor recall basis of somebody getting well by having threatened loss spotted or loss spotted see you can actually take somebody who looks about 49 or something some girl maybe about 30 and she looks about 49 shes lost her husband you erase it just as narrative it might take you hours and hours and hours and all of sudden have her again looking good and if you carried it up and did the whole chain and that sort of thing why youd have somebody looking about 25 see well weve done that sort of thing we know about that but whats the mechanism why does this exact thing happen we know that it happens but why it happens now if you knew why it happened boy could you do something with it well ill tell you why it happens the thetan promptly and immediately mocks up mass to substitute for the loss instantly and that is exactly what he does and if his acceptance level or he is feeling goofgoof his acceptance level you know what he really could have is low that is he couldnt have very much he will mock up pretty bad things because nobody else wants those and now hold your hat one of the basic uses of mockups was magic curing curing by magic now the way the magician works in even primitive tribes like in the philippines is woman has horrible pain in her stomach and the magician with sleight of hands will lie clown and groan and so forth and produce brightly red painted stone from his own stomach at which moment she gets well and walks away well that would he very difficult to understand if you didnt know old time match terminaling you can actually get two things to discharge one against the other if they are the same or very similar so shes got pain in her stomach and shes told him that it just feels like red hot stone is in there and shes chattered along so he goes out and he gets his boy to paint stone red in hurry and he comes back in he lies there and he got rid of it and so therefore she would get rid of it and hes given her matched terminal theres lot of technical stuff that we used to have about this this is all out of creative processing but the way thetan cured himselfquote unquotewas if he body got bashed in he mocked up the incident so that the body would recover from itlets say his face was bashed in so if he mocked up bashed in faceim really giving you stuff way the hell and gone out of levels to end off the thing but if he got bashed in face the body got bashed in face then if he mocked up that bashed in face then the bashed inness of the bodys face would of course discharge against his mockup and theoretically the bodys face would get all right well what do you know it works once in while what an idiot trick and thats why he has mockups of all his accidents and all of his illnesses and because he did this urgently when loss is suddenly threatened and he urgently mocks up he tricks the other mechanism he tricks the cure mechanism curing by mocking up bashed in faces so hes about to lose the body so the thing to do is to suddenly mock up and his impulse to mock up will unfortunately trigger the fact that he has mocked up in the past bashed in faces gutted stomach half eaten by lion but that was loss too so its sympathetic note in it you see one incidents similar to the other incident he didnt mock up bashed in face excerpt hes might going to lose his body so his impulse to mock up is just shout word see and he just hits he doesnt say now im going to mock up about 8 witches nice you see he doesnt do that its pung so bessie ann standing there you suddenly say your father was just killed and she goes pow and she turns white and she does this or she does that and she has horrible pain in her stomach you got it but because hes now lost she will continue to mock that up and youll get prolongation now she either ceases to mock it up and she gets well or she continues to mock it up and will feel sick and i dont care how many gallons of antibiotics you pour into this girl if this happened to also result in stomach somatic or an infectious type of wound or something its not going to recover its just not going to recover you can pump the penicillin to him just left and right and any other antibiotic or drug that you can think of and you could make them more comfortable but thats about all and then they suddenly break out with it again and the trick is its just whether or not they cease to mock up now when they first were working with penicillin it they thought prevented inhibited suppressed the reproduction of the disease cell the disease couldnt breed anymore in other words couldnt mock up that was one of the first theories on it i dont know what theory theyre operating on now but that was one of the first theoriesthat it prevented mockup and i think it does just that only i dont think it had anything to do with the bugs if you can restore circulation to an area the body itself is perfectly capable of healing up almost anything except maybe having lost both legs but there are some animals which even grow new tails i remember bunch of little lizards that i had terrible overts on in my teens because lizard would be sitting there and so forth and you put your finger on his tail and hed walk off and separate from his tail that was it hed just leave his tail sitting right there and so forth and you watch him few days later if he crawled around on screens and that sort of thing hed just grow new tail so lord knows what bodies will or wont do because they are so considerably interfered with im not saying that bodies will grow new bodies and all that sort of thing so what is this cycle see threat of loss mock up mock up what mock up having matched terminals something to cure it hed double terminalled the thing if i remember rightly matched terminals was four but hed just bang so you tell this fellow that he has lost all of his money in the bank you cant say now that he will always get tuberculosis you cant say hes going to get cold you cant say hes going to get pneumonia you cant say hes going to come down with nervous breakdown you cant tell what the hell hes going to do do you follow because its only what he has in the past mocked up to match what things have happened in the past so the skys the limitso youve got this terrific variation see you got almost infinite variation so nobody could get down to the bottom of the mechanism because they just ran into pieces of the mechanism threat of loss pong now we already have had people running secondaries of loss and all that and theres lot of technology about that were not necessarily talking about that now now i could give you more i could go on talking about this in its theory but im sure you grasp it there are various reasons why they do this that and the other thing but the main point that weve got here is that expanded dianetics has just moved into the realm of havingness now we used to run havingness for few months and then we would forget it for six months and then i would say to people i dont know why this works but its good thing to run havingness if you listen to old tapes and that sort of thing you will find that was the case see its the discussion of the thing puzzled how come how come look around here and find something you can have good look around here and find something you can have good and the guy feels better you say all right all right but the physical universe isnt necessarily his friend now yes by observation running havingness in any one of its hundreds of different processes or forms would do some remarkable things it often did very remarkable things objective processes like the cchs they do remarkable things you know this is command control havingness whatever this line is havingness is all im giving you the point on havingness see was part of the cchs it gave people havingness and what is havingness is that is simply the idea that they can have something its changing their mind and basically you could put it down to reassurance so theyre sick so the cycle goes this way pardon theyre threatened with loss they mock up something obsessively that they used to cure themselves with bang and then you come along with havingness and you show them they still have something and so they cease to mock these pictures up now as you run these things out you are also performing very remarkable thing because they did those obsessively and they really dont know theyre doing them and they appear so magically and there are some other factors involved which you neednt pay much attention to but there they are so the next time they lose something they dont mock up that chain now this can go so far that person knows that hes losing and hes got to keep it mocked up all the time and you try to audit him and hes rather resistive he isnt quite sure that he wants to what do you mean so it looks like he wants his stomach ache he doesnt know where his stomach ache comes from he just knows above all other things that he had better continue to mock up as solidly as possible because hes had it now if you run out the shocks of loss his fathers death you run out these various things any somatic chain do down the chain any emotion any attitude you are in to some degree or another straightening out this threat but the fellow who will only run one chain and i told you earlier that i was going to tell you some more about that now what hes really withholding is the fact that hes not about to give up any mass because boy has he had it now the acceptance level of people is what gets in your road in havingness they have the idea that if theyve lost something they cant have and havingness is just an idea like money money is just an idea backed up by confidence but dont try to tell pawnbroker that its terribly real to him if you tried to tell somebody in one of these international bankers and so forth that or not they know money isnt anything they just throw it around in scoop shovelfuls but you try to tell the local small town rich man who counts on his cash as the totality of his power otherwise very nasty character you take this guy and now you try to tell him and educate him into the idea that money is not that important youre going to loseand youre going to lose that argument as matter of fact hes going to think youre silly ass he knows whats important now thats what youre doing when youre talking to some pc and he just runs one chain after another chain now there can be something very bugged in this pcs auditing that causes him loss now the strange part of it is that person cant exteriorize and apparently not have anything and he perfectly happy now theres an oddity but they didnt at that moment really lose anything now why is it that after theyve been exteriorized their ta goes up if they accidentally exteriorized and werent smoothed out in any way what would happen to them you hang him out of his head all of sudden he said ive lost mock up boommass high ta if he accidentally startles himself half to death as having exteriorized or something ive had pc stuck on the ceiling that was begging for christs sakes to do something ive had phone calls in the middle of the nights from auditors and so forth what do we do she is in the attic and we cant get her out thats right fact five auditors sitting around one of them had exteriorized and he couldnt get her back in her head and dumped her body and there she lies nobody could the funniest tale of all of that is weve never had catastrophe with it but the funniest tale of all of that is the auditor who all of sudden had pcthe english slang term was do bunk which meant run away or desertand they started calling this do bunk actually this auditor had pc and the pc did bunk well when they really do bunk boy they do bunk theyre going past arcturus as ive said before at 90 miles an hour or two light years second and really did bunk when they do that the whole body collapses and their arms will hang down and they look like an old rag doll that somebody has just grabbed half the stuffings out of they really bzuhhhh thats it they dont roll up on the floor in prenatal or something like that they just go thats it you know boom and this auditor talked and talked because theyre still in dim communication you see and he talked and talked to herthink of your husband think of your children think of and so on and he talked and talked to her he couldnt get her to come back and pick up the body at all till all of sudden he happened to think think of your poor auditor and she came back and picked up the body i was just couple of minutes late state cops were in my way but negro had been drowned and i was just they were in my road to point where i couldnt get to the guy and tell him to pick up the body again where he would have dont you see and they were busy resuscitating him and that was the end of that it was too late he really had done bunk he finished weve actually brought little kids back to life and that sort of thingjust tell them pick up the body you know now you just tell them with tone 40 just say it around the vicinity theyre still around and back they come again as matter of fact washington dc got very mad at scientologist one time he decided he was going to do bunk and he was going to drop the body and he did he just had an unpleasant afternoon with irs and he came back and he just kicked the bucket that was it colder than ice and he just wouldnt pick up the body again and they told him and they told him and they told him and he wouldnt that was it he by the way has shown up again calling for his favorite cigars at two years old but anyhow the upshot of all of this is is this opens the door to fabulous amount of action on your part which will sometimes look very magical because remedy of havingness in various ways now the only thing that gets wrong with the thing is what can the guy haveand you will find that i have just given demonstration here to the flag medical officers which is hco b 7 apr 1972 touch assists correct ones which i call your attention to now whats that all about yes well this is all about equalizing and it says at the beginning that this is how you tell medical doctor about it on assists when you are speaking with medicos you talk to them in terms of restoring comm in blood and nerve channels notice that is in there because that isnt what youre doing youre giving him back the havingness of his body and if he finds he can occupy this body and he call have it back he will start turning off the obsessive mock it up guy runs into wall with car first thoughtlose the body mock it up so hes got nice engram sitting there and he will let go of it when you run touch assist because he becomes aware of the fact that he still has the body it might be in little second hand shape but hes still got one and if you remind him of this today and the other thing that people dont do with touch assist is they dont give them the next day i dont know what the hell we got quickie touch assists of all other things sure its short sessions you just run it to cognition but wheres the touch assist the next day and wheres the touch assist the day after that and wheres the touch assist the next day oh the guy didnt get totally well so there must be something still there the bodys ability to recover is phenomenal why wont it recover well he gets to thinking it over and he meets friend and he says and the friend says to him boy you sure were lucky i had my brother was killed in an accident like that yeah its little loss you see and he goes out and sees his wrecked car loss you give him another touch assist the guy says well i still got body you get the idea now that could keep up you could also run out the incident which is fine and what you should do but the touch assist will go all the way down to somebody who was very unconscious and you tell them to they can say yes by squeezing your hand once and say by squeezing it twice and theyre unconscious and theyve been in coma for weeks and you come in and you start picking up their hand and making them touch the bed and make them touch the pillow and thats another type of touch assist now all of sudden they come out of the coma but its sort of little by little theyre just mocking up being awful dead thats the only thing theyre doing they got loss so well im dead now so theyre just mocking it up so thoroughly and its too horrible facing life is just too horrible for words so that on gradient why they come up the line gradually and come out it looks quite magical well what are you really doing youre restoring their havingness in other words you are bringing about again higher state of security youll find out that every person you are operating with at this particular moment and anyone who will be run on dianetics on expanded dianetics is suffering if because theyre in and not doing well theyre suffering from threat of loss their security is bad youll find out that youll pick up people after their comm evs or before their comm evs or something or theyre about to be off loaded or shot or demoted or this goes hand in glove with it what is that security now their security is so had that nothing will restore this security apparently if you just go on auditing out those pictures they themselves are the last thing theyve got in spite of the fact theyre killing them john mcmasters after he got tagged and so forth the poor guy let himself in for hell of blackmail lineup and this guy however afterwards began to go around and say well now ron should let people have their pictures but he said that after he himself got into severe trouble he actually apparently got across the lines of the mafia they really set him up to fall on his face and the loss was great and then he was busy trying to compensate for this one way or the other which he easily could have done but he was finding some fault about it and the though you know well ron ought to let people have their pictures well what the hell it says clear can mock anything up but you dont have to do it unknowingly it says it in book 1 you want to know how far clear can go the ability to mock up is an ability but ifit is done unconsciously its hell of liability but nobody says people shouldnt have pictures only lets be little selective about it now if the guy was good enough he could mock up another body so he dimly recalls that this is true and that probably is what gives him this sudden impulse to mock it up but he knows he cant have and knows he cant mock up another body so hes got to repair the one hes got so the first thing he does is send for doctor because the doctor comes in he himself is engaged in curing himself now how is he engaged in curing himself now hes engaged in curing himself by mocking up the terminal which matches the condition of his body when it was killed in the roman army in only that isnt whats wrong with him so anyhow the doctor comes in he instantly keys in but he still has some reassurance so the bedside manner is very very important to doctor because because hes there reassuring the guy hes trying to reassure the guy the guy will at least still go on having this body so actually if his bedside manner was good enough the guy would get well now i mention to you and have mentioned in lectures guy who treated tb could always detect tb just by laying his hands on persons chest now the people got well because he expected them to just as simple as that and that was all there was to it it sounds too simple but he was very hes person that you would be very aware of so they expected him to he expected the patient to get well the patient had other choice to get well he was down there just south of pasadena in california he had hospital down there for long time he was very famous hes probably the most famous name in tb and his work was so whats this whats this well actually if you run out the bad pictures now the guy has an explanation for what has been worrying him because each time do you see he was about to lose something and then he mocked something up and so forth he was worrying about whether or not he was doing to lose it and this problem and so forth so hes still got the problem of how he might have lost it and hes still trying to answer that and when you pull the engram chain you erase that and then you erase his overts on the things and you erase few other things and what have you got well he is relieved now because he isnt obsessively mocking this up but he will only be relieved if at the same time you havent overwhelmed him by trying to take too much away now if you suddenly go down the track and try to run pain out of this character and try to run heavy engrams out of this character thats too much loss so he doesnt do that so he will come back and not respond hell natter at you and so forth and he sounds like hes got withholds well yes he does have withholds and the main withhold that hes got is hes just not about to give up any mass thank you hes finished it only he doesnt even really know that he himself has the withhold so hes very uncommunicative so therefore we have two things that dianetic specialist would have to be able to do and one of those things would be to run touch assist sounds remarkable and then run touch assist sufficiently well that you remember to run it the next day and the next day and the next day and really run proper touch assist and we have this 7 april hco b i did this quite little time ago it is not the date of the touch assist its the date of the hco b just to keep the time track straight but this gives an explanation that will pass most anything and it does respond like that standing waves and the thing youre liable to come up against is the standing wave is not necessarily described in basic elementary physics now youre talking about nuclear physics and so forth and that is wave form comes up and either because it meets another wave form or for some other reason it just becomes rigid form and if you can imagine an ocean wave not any longer rolling but just sitting there all peaked well electricity strangely enough will dothis and thetan is very good at this because hes trying to stop further injury so when he mocks up at that point he mocks it up with stop and hes got the standing wave stuck in his spine and his arms legs theyre all through the body hell just be mass of standing waves as you do touch assist two things happen it smooths those out because his intention is attentions going down the line but thats just the mechanical action the truth of the matter is youre making him aware of the fact that hes still got bodysmoothly smoothly smoothly now if you add to this good bedside manner and you expect that he will recover he is reassured and his reassurance is such that hes willing to have another go at it without keeping it all so muddily mocked up theres some hope now the medical profession and other the drug professions and so forth talk about hope thats all they talk abouthope hope hope hope so it must be somewhat interesting thing but its rather pathetic thing to read medical conference where theyve talked for 7 days and its all about some miracle drug that somebody someday might develop its really remarkable we have series of two cases we have tried this on and there is much hope for it and we expect and of course we must be conservative in it these wild wild imaginative something or others they dont read their last decades minutes they had the same number of drugs for which they had great hope ten years ago but most of them are gone most of them are gone now its not that they cant do job its not that they arent needed nobodys saying anything about this at all when you get broken leg you had certainly better have somebody who could put the leg back together again but now to get it healed because the guy has got broken leg over this broken leg and now were into the whole explanation of what is psychosomatic medicine that is the whole explanation of it now latter on if somebody said to him youre dog at the moment he got his leg broken he will think of himself as dog while he limps perhaps and there we get mental aberration this strange thought that keeps occurring to him you got it so there really isnt anything else to it but the fact that you by reassuranceyouve got hope factor there you can imagine running touch assist now well feel my finger thank you very good well theres probably not much chance for him so i feel my finger you know ok fine you could say well that matches his tone but it doesnt match whats wrong with him now sometimes hell tell you oh there just isnt any hope for it anyhow and so forth hes just chattering he was responding to the same mechanism but his havingness is so low that he doesnt think its possible but at the same time he doesnt think its possible and hes given up and practically quit and so forth why he is still accepting to some degree or another his havingness so therefore your first level of entrance which you can pick them up from from all the way into total unconsciousness coma for three months m hospital on up through to doing touch assist to do something or other the guy is really quite hes quite ill he has pneumonia or something hes quite ill theyve come in pumped him full of antibiotics fine alright touch assist is about all you can do to him he cant even he cant even concentrate long enough to talk to you high temperature something like that it makes him aware of the fact hes got it you say yeah well its sick body so whod want it well once in while you run into somebody who says i dont want this body anymore its too old and too messed up and i dont want this body anymore and i dont want this body anymore and so forth and theyre going on and on and on youre just talking to somebody at the lowest rungs of havingness their idea of loss is fabulousso person who is very very ill you could pick them up the line with techniques like touch assist of which there are several i wont even try to catalog them at this particular time theres an awful lot of literature on this i did this basically because theres some errors in the literature other people have written them theyve never seen do one so i did one so let somebody write it up you call actually make an unconscious person touch blanket touch that blanket you know touch that blanket still talking still communicating touch that blanket thank you moving their hand and so forth you can do touch assist on them and so forth hold onto their hand and say when you have felt my finger squeeze your hand the guys totally unconscious you wouldnt believe that he would but he will hell give you little pulse little pulse and so on touch at the knees thighs and the feet the head and the ears and so forth each time and hell start picking up on it after while hes getting what medical care he can fine thats all part of the same thing now where does havingness come in well now youve got the session and you had certainly better learn how to run havingness and if youre going to do anything at all with specialist dianetics you better learn something about using havingness and im not going to tell you all there is to know about havingness in this particular lecture because theres lot to know about it but pab 72 page 25 gives you material about havingness now you realize of course that all of this material is giving you by observation and experimentation is giving you the observation experimentation and so forth that went on about the subject of havingness it isnt until now that you have the exact reason it works now in the tapes on the subject in lectures and in this literature itselfi havent read it allit maybe i said i do not know how it works or why it works so just ignore that in the literature this just tells you how to do some of these things we also have pab 23 2nd april 54 and its an itemhavingness starvation for energy is the keynote of any case that maintains facsimiles in restimulation now as you read all this you will say well he knew all this all the time why are we talking about this now thats an observation i didnt know why see i didnt know how its true starvation for energy yeah but starvation for energy thats saying something else so the guys energy starved so hell maintain facsimile and so forth what what see thats not quite on the groove you got it but again it is perfectly honest because i did not know exactly why it worked but i knew its starvation for energy guys starved for energy hell maintain facsimile why all right theres professional auditors bulletin number 49 the remedy of havingness just why thetan should let himself so completely snarled up in energy might be an entire mystery to anyone who did not realize that thetan has to cut down his knowingness and his total presence in order to have game true perfectly true but it is not the basic reason all this however is material which you should know now its not for release hco training bulletin june 11th 1957 training and cch processes not to be copied the variations in some of the most potent processes are not included in this training bulletin but will appear in the student manual when published in september 57 now this was labeled that way simply because it was experimental at that time you find out this is all standard now what are you looking at youre looking at the trs but they basically were havingness process now we have cch 88 enforced nothingness hco b april 11th 58 now youd say well the easy way out of this is just to cure him of mocking up these facsimiles and take away this automaticity this automatic mockitup the second hes going to lose something thatd be easy noooooo nooo im afraid that isnt true and thats why you saw creative havingness the creative processing laid away in mothballs its not in its grave because he can restimulate moments of loss and think he is losing harder and therefore mock up harder and they get solid you can shoot ta up every now and then on pcs you could do remarkablethings with creative processing but it has limited action in that every few pcs you really lay an egg so its too limited see hco b of september 12th 58 gives havingness new commands factual havingness look around here and find something you have look around here and find something that you would continue look around here and find something that you would permit to vanish now that isnt one two three because they cant do the third one usually until youve done the first one but sometimes theyll obsessively do the third one permit to vanish and so forth now that opens up process which i dont know if we have on record here that opens up process which is fabulous its absolutely fabulous its the weirdest process that anybody ever had anything do to with and you know the process but it may not he expressed in these issues which im giving you here and that is what will be here in what around here will be here in one minute now thats right on the button because thats continuum into the future and thats why it was so weird the reactions to that process look around here and find something that will be here in and you keep extending the time span and sometimes you the guy is says he cant find anything you see for minute you know well its too bad because youve given him lose so you always cut it early you know whatll be here in one half second one second something like that oh yeah he can find things that will be here in second then you can build him up to minute whatll be here in ten minutes uhhhhhh but you keep building him up you see what youre doing youre giving him future which is right on the groove of this loss he thinks hes going to lose it forever all right now were really getting down someplace here heres april 21 hco b april 21 60 presession processes hco b 1 september 1960 presession ii hco b of september 8th 1960 which is the presession of the first saint hill acc and it gives commands for presession iixthats experimental and by the time that had been grooved in we then got 20hco b 22 september 1960 presessions and regimens regimen would be certain settled schedule of things now strangely enough this regimen onesix in here is ask the pc whats wrong with him and we will run something else sounds like if you read it fast and if an auditor just did it time and time again itd be perfect q so its things like that that laid some of these so that the auditor starts going something like this what do you think is wrong with you my wife ok well run wife all right what about your wife good all right whats wrong with you it wont work youd have to flatten what you ran you had to know something about fns and so forth all right and then weve got 29 september 1960 hco b havingness and duplication and then weve got 6 october 1960 thirtysix new presessions got such things on it as point out something in this room you could confront and what this did would be have and confront which merely asked the fellow to go slightly toward something when you said confront you know there it is dont run away and have would be an actual flow of some kind or another but actually these are not necessarily run have and confront you can still do this these things are all runnable but it isnt necessarily true that you would have to run an alternate side the only youre not worried about flows most of these things were put out on the basis that there were flows and there could be stuck flow and the fellow would boil off and so on so there had to be balanced flow of some kind boil off is usually flow running too long in one direction is the datum back of that so you broke the command to get the flow going the other way and heres october 271960 revised case entrance and it gives you failed help which of course is reassurance did you ever think of help as havingness process yeah well thats the bedside manner of the doctor if youre confident sounding and looking auditor why you will find out there is great difficulty in getting pc up the line well so if you ran out all the time he wasnt helped he might have some and hes sure been trying to help himself now this gives you 14 september 61 is new rudiments commands but we wouldnt be too interested in that at this time and cch data i remember when i really ran some cchs atsaint hill on tv demonstration and all of the all of the auditors in the lecture hall groaned and reg sharpe was terribly disappointed and people were actually quite upset because it was quite obvious that i didnt know how to run cchs the way you ran the cchs is you acted like you were mad as hell and overran each process and i was just going to change or change on the pc from one to the next to the next to the next to the next the pc felt great but that was beside the point you could have knocked down with feather they were all very polite about it of course i had to reteach everybody how to run cchs and they started getting some results hco b 9 february 69 heres some havingness and so on and then there is scientology 8 8008 and in this edition at least there is expanded gita now this was mockup process positive gain and this is mockup process but this all of sudden opens the door to something with you because this is marvelous list of items what gorgeous list of items youre gonna half kill pc if you ran some of these i mean ran them as engrams im just looking men stopping all motion changing motion women changing motion and so forth things god the devil spirits bacteria glory dependence responsibility wrongness rightness insanity and so on lot of those items though are very hot attitudes very very hot attitudes when you ask pc to give you his altitudes youre really leaving him in the dark the guy has got 1665 misunderstood words just on the morning papers hes read much less anything sensible you expect this guy to say something to you he isnt going to say anything to you say what attitude do you have they dont know the word for it see but if you did this sort of thing youd have to clear words see if youre giving him the words they have to be cleared if hes giving them to you why you usually dont but this is interesting because it gives you really whats going on person can waste something before they can have it and you can actually watch somebody walking around and working and you can tell after little while exactly what he has to waste thats the funniest thing you ever saw in your life you know what he can have but youll be able to youll be able to spot finally what he can have but you can spot what hell have to waste one of the tricks well one guy he could waste file cards i was watching somebody work one day and boy could he waste file cards wow he actually needed about four file cards so he wasted about 50 to get about 4 i was watching all this proceeding and so on that was all he was wasting around there he was wasting file cards he really could waste them gave him great deal of pleasure too now by the simple action of just handing him file cards and which file card did he have so on and throw them away dramatically not covertly and put hundred file cards in the waist basket one at time and so forth why the guy finally got reluctant to do this whats the matter well they might have some value you know i used to wonder if sometime some persons werent wasting if some persons actually werent wasting processing or wasting something like that they couldnt have it and so on and ive never found anything to support this really but i know they will waste things in an organization like machines and things like that and they will sometimes say they dont want to be audited or something like that but it usually has another explanation processing is terribly valuable page 120 of scientology 88008 and then we have pabs book 4 pab 50 remedy of havingness the process it says when in doubt remedy havingness this was motto which can well be followed by an auditor doing any process on the preclear thats so true now what does this do what does this do to your expanded dianetics im going to tell you everything you do with havingness because as you see theres quite few references there and theres probably quite few tapes on the subject if theyre still around well it means you can start session with havingness and it means you could end one with havingness and it would be something like putting high speed zip onto your line upweve got one case right now who always runs the same thing hes not about to run anything it doesnt handle whats wrong with him too he said i think its remarkable been audited all over the place and now hes telling us he has hidden standard hes sort of fending off the auditor hes being rather contemptuous sneering snide is the term being used and so on but hes here he is now telling us that he never made any case gain or words to that effect or something of that sort and he always runs the same thing and we havent handled what he did well hes had xii auditing and everything else now whats the matter with this guy from what ive told you in this lecture it should be rather obvious he is on his last thetan penny boy if you made him spend that he would be bankrupt thetan so now i cant tell you precisely whether this is true or not whether he would best respond to some touch assists or to some havingness but that would depend on how sick he is that would depend on how sick he is if hes so sick that its difficult for him to sit in the chair it certainly would be touch assists where the touch assist might have some slight advantage over trying to talk to him because hes very withholdy if you can get him to answer you on touch assist you could at least get him into communication now insessionness could always be increased with touch assist now i find out touch assists have normally been thrown intorelegated i was going to say which means put over intothe category of the guy has banged his hand or burned his wrist and they think that is it otherwise if hes just got slow pain in the back or something like this or constant earache or all infected boil or something you wouldnt use touch assist well i dont know where that think would come from you see it was never there to begin with its just that they get used for that so people think they are for that somebody has tremendous amount of stomach upset well if you gave him touch assist you couldnt audit him maybe too much but you could give him touch assist every day you would find until all of sudden hed start improving as matter of fact if you gave touch assists long enough you can get rid of warts hes probably weeks and weeks of five or ten minutes of touch assists day weeks see two things have happened nobody has continued the process to find out what it could do and its just been relegated to quickie emergency on little local injury well it has much wider application because youre giving the guy body he knows he hasnt got one so he can only waste one or something but you can change his orientation now you leave touch assist flat or you overrun one or something like that and you mess it up one way or the other and then of course youre in trouble but its pretty hard to mess one up unless you get very absentminded the guy has the faintest of cognitions and so forth come off the thing where he has surge of pain and so on that was jolt somatic you say well thats good thats fine if the person was in very good condition it would be fine too it wouldnt be needed the next day but youre dealing with sick people theyre going to be sick the next day and do you follow theyve been knocking themselves off for the last many quadrillion so theyre expected to get sick in split instant i mean get well in split instant when they been sick so long it isnt going to be done there is magic button because thetan doesnt convince that fast so the long and the short of it is that you could take that case that we were just discussing and you might find out just experimentally just run him on bit of touch assist or something like that you could also find his hidden standard because theres computation sitting there someplace or another but it would be very very smart before you began that session to find out anything about hidden standard or something like that is find havingness process that worked run that briefly at the beginning of the session if you can get havingness process to run to an fn why great then if you get the right one why itll produce an fn and at the end of the session why finish him off so as to make up for the mass youve taken away thats whats important now what youre doing is straightening up his obsessive cockeyed mockingupedness so you see as youre running it out youre straightening up the bank well thats important to do that because thats whats making him goofy but at the same time you give him back some physical universenow youre going to find some guys who wont want anything to do with this physical universe now theyre not about to have anything to do with it and so forth but they will take some reassurance and thats havingness too so in such case they will respond to one or another havingness process and the test of havingness process is to go way the hell and gone back ill give you thing is you get can squeeze run couple of commands of the thing and if it broadens the command squeeze youve got his havingness process now it might be of interest to you on this case we were just discussing that if we simply gave him little bit of can squeeze you might find that he had very very small movement now as long as then person on can squeeze has short movement you know youre up against havingness that is it doesnt give you much of surge when the cans get squeezed so you just better make it the standard operating procedure pick up the cans and hes comfortable and youve got the session all going and so forth give it can squeeze now if hes got whole dial wham and that sort of thing youre just going to be wasting your time running any havingness go ahead and run what youre going to run but if this person was ill you would still follow it up with some havingness at the end of the session now you say well but he had this terrific win and hes fn cog vgis and he just feels marvelous and something changed then and boy thats great well let him tell you all about that and so forth and run some havingness because hes been sick now whats the test hes been sick thats the test he wouldnt be getting expanded dianetics unless he were running bit sick do you follow well why is he sick because he is mocking up obsessively trying to make up for his great loss thats all there is to it thats why hes sick and its as simple as that so now if you weave havingness into it by can squeeze test if you dont get much surge you better find his havingness process right away and it doesnt matter you dont wear one out today and never use it again tomorrow and that sort of thing they run for long time eventually theyll run out and then you find new havingness process youre alerted by the fact that the fact this guy isnt doing too well on this havingness process now he was but he isnt now and its not precise action but it is precise action to get can squeeze find out how long it goes if it isnt going to go very much hes not going to give you any engram also he isnt going to erase his pictures and you have somebody who will not erase picture who does not get an erasure now you can straighten it out with an l3b and you should but you will find magically that the individual will all of sudden begin to erase pictures when his havingness is up enough to make up for the fact that he is certain that he has lost all its certain hes losing losing all mocking up obsessively and so forth well you show him hes still got something left now theres probably more that can be worked out on this subject because you make breakthrough like this theres more can be worked out but theres sure plenty of material here to work with and if you do that and you make that your standard operating procedure on the thing well i can assure you you will have some remarkable changes of case not only will the guy then straighten out his bank but then he gets into the reassurance that its okay now those incidents then which have to do with threat and loss and that sort of thing are of great interest to you theyre of considerable interest to you and when he gives one of those let us say you had long fall on mothers death and you had longfall on exhilaration i am sure that you would take mothers death youre not going to push the whole subject over into running nothing but losses because theres many covert ways to lose things now do these guys make sense to you that youre auditing right now they make more sense all right well im sure we can make some fast headway on the thing and theres one or two or three of these cases you would find yourself grinding bit on otherwise but the thing to do with them the thing to do with them is to restore their havingness those that are chronically ill and are gimping around and falling on their heads of course hard to get into an auditing chair and talk that sort of thing well youve still got touch assists that you can work on them so just as standard action you can add it in the programone more thing i want to tell you about program is every time you add something onto cs except rudiments you put it over on the margin in the program in other words you dont write cs something or other something or other without putting it over on

the development of new rundown designed to slash straight through to the root of such false purposes and unwanted intentions and blow them the name of this new rundown is the false purpose rundown research the tech research done was quite extensive and involves several major discoveries but ill let you in on one thing there were psychiatrists who existed ways way back on the track it was the aim of these psychs back on the whole track to very carefully push in people s anchor points to prevent them from reaching the psychs were themselves bunch of terrified cowards and the prevention of reaching was one facet of their operation handling overts withholds and nonsurvival purposes with the false purpose rundown has proven highly effective in undoing the effects of the work of psychs on

cases ive unearthed some vital tech in the fields of pulling overts and handling evil purposes that had been lost buried by certain sps whove long since departed this tech has now been put fully back into use andwith the addition of totally new breakthroughs on the handling of evil purposesis more powerful than ever history in early days i developed security checking to high skill whereby the meter was used to get the exact time place form and event nailed down on every overt in later years in rundowns such as expanded dianetics sec checking was covertly knocked out of use through verbal tech this got to the point where some cases not having been unburdened of later overts and withholds with sec checking were sent off down the track in search of early overts and evil purposes well beyond the confront and reality of the preclear attempts were sometimes made to use highpowered ln questions on such pcs to locate evil purposes and intentions to run burdened with unpulled overts the pcs had hard time answering such questions few unscrupulous persons who themselves were strenuously avoiding being sec checked put this tech out in issues it of course threw wrench into the works and was one of the main tricks they pulled in an effort to undermine the workability of expanded dianetics sec checking tech was some years later put back into use with vengeance and many pcs gotexcellent gains from it but not all of the tech was restored the tech of handling evil purposes had been omitted what happened was that pendulum swing effect had occurred at one extreme only straight pulling of overts and withholds close to present time was stressed and at the other extreme scant attention was paid to skilled sec checking of the pcs current or recent withholds and instead auditors were guiding pcs in search for whole track incidents and evil purposes exclusively success the fact is that any auditing aimed at handling the basic factors that can stall case cannot succeed up to its full potential unless it includes both thorough vigorous pulling of the pcs overts and b tracing the overt back to overts on that chain and back to the underlying evil purpose and carrying it through to full blow i have since restored the tech of sec checking to full use and it is working very well in the hands of skilled auditors but now we have the brandnew startlingly direct and powerful tech of the false purpose rundown based on discoveries made in upper level research this new rundown has produced spectacular results including the undoing of psychs suppressive actions of long long ago but for an auditor to be able to use this new tech he must first be skilled sec checker this does not mean that the technology of sec checking cannot be used nor is this hcob intended to prevent people from being sec checked as part of hco investigatory or justice actions sec checking is vital tool in its own right ethics if in the future any person is found to be omitting or refusing to deliver the false purpose rd or related rds when needed or doing something else and calling it false purpose rd he may be called before committee of evidence on charge of attempting to undermine or advising or encouraging or condoning the abandonment or reduction of use of the full technology of locating and handling overts evil purposes destructive intentions and nonsurvival considerations this offense is classified as high crime and if proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt by committee of evidence the offender may be declared suppressive and expelled from the church summary in this technology lies the key to sanity certainty reach and ability only the truly suppressive would wish to see it neglected or abandoned with this tech in your good hands and well applied their wish will fade away as they do l ron hubbard founderhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 2 november 1961 franchise the prior confusion recent discovery i have made may well do away with the need to directly run problems particularly on people who find them hard to confront the mechanism is this all problems are preceded by prior confusion the handling consists of locating the problem then locating the prior confusion and then sec checking that prior confusion the preclear tends to edge forward in time to the problem continuously and to bounce out of the prior confusion once located the remedy is to locate the ows in the prior confusion and keep the preclear out of the moment of the problem all somatics circuits problems and difficulties including arc breaks are all preceded by prior confusion therefore it is possible but not always feasible at the moment to eradicate somatics by sec checking the area of confusion which occurred just before the pc noticed the somatic for the first time this is part of class ii auditors skills problem could be regarded as mechanism by which to locate hidden areas of confusion in pcs life all hidden standards are the result of prior confusion the mechanism is extremely valuable all rudiments could be run by finding the rudiment out getting the difficulty expressed locating the prior confusion and then finding the pcs ows in that area of confusion problems intensive based on this mechanism is under design and i will release it for class ii use when i am satisfied the form is complete l ron

intensive here is the pattern for new problems intensive that can be given by hgc or field auditors and which will get them marvellous results on new or old pcs this arrangement makes prepchecking come into its own for if it is well done then the pc is fairly well set up for having his goal found this intensive is amazingly easy to run providing that the auditor does it pretty well muzzled and does not violate repetitive prepchecking drill of course if the auditors meter reading is not perfect and if the auditor is not cognizant of recent hco bulletins on the meter and if the auditor misses as many as two reads in session this whole result can wind up in fiasco if the pc doesnt feel better on this one then the auditor just didnt read the meter or miserably flubbed current drill of these two the d of p had better suspect the meter readings if anything goes wrong the first thing to do is complete the old case assessment form we do this in model session and check after each small section of it as to whether weve missed withhold on the pc we then assess the selfdetermined change list and dont goof and put other determined changes on the pcs change list or well be assessing engrams we find the most important most reacting change in the pcs life by the largest read this can also be done by elimination we then locate the prior confusion to that change in case will it be earlier than two weeks from the incident these confusions so often missed by the auditor take place from two weeks to five minutes before the actual decision to change having located the time of the prior confusion but not done anything else about it lists of names or anything like that we then go one month earlier in date this gives us an exact date for our questions let us say the selfdetermined change was june 1 1955 the prior confusion was may 20 1955 and the arbitrary month earlier was april 20 1955 we get the pc to spot this arbitrary date more or less to his own satisfaction we now form question as follows since date is there anything you have the endings are in this order suppressed suggested been careful of invalidated and failed to reveal the question with one end is completely cleaned by repetitive prepchecking one asks it off the meter until the pc says there is more then one checks it on the meter and steers the pc with any read and then continues the question off the meter etc etcin turn we clean each one of the buttons above this will take many hours in most cases it is vital not to clean anything thats clean or to miss cleaning read that reacts in other words do clean meter job of it all the way at sensitivity 16 when we have in turn cleaned each of the buttons above we do new assessment of the change list and get us new time just as before and handle that just as before when the second area is clean we assess for third frequently particularly if the needle gets dirty we ask for missed withholds indeed one can use all the middle rudiments at least once each session with expert needle reading that intensive will give the pc more gain per hour of auditing than anything else short of routine 3ga i wish you lots of success with it remember the more variables you introduce into such system the less confidence the pc will have in you good hunting l ron hubbard lrh drrd copyright 1962 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedthe prior confusion lecture given on 3 october 1961 thank you okay this is one of those days whats the date 3rd of october audience thats right yes and my watch stopped last night how would i know and 1961 special briefing course saint hill now suzie has been giving you an explanation up here as to the prior confusion and id better give you some material on this and some other things i could give you lecture on brandnew series of discoveries but you havent caught up with these ill mention these in passing just to get them as matter of record however there is great deal to be known about mutual motion mutual motion is terribly interesting subject its the motion of two generating sources this has something to do with problems and mutual motion runs with great rapidity and so on theres lot more about that but i just wanted to get this little slight note on record youre interested in the prior confusion the hidden standard because this puts into your hands what the hakim the witch doctor the bone rattler the medical doctor and all such ilk have been trying to do something with here now for good many thousands of years this puts something into your hands and if you grasp this youve grasped something and if you havent grasped it youre stuck in one chronic somatic is stuck moment on time track which is the stable datum of prior confusion hidden standard is the stable datum of prior confusion prior confusion now in trying to explain this to you you take look at chronic somatic you try to look at the prior confusion and you swing back up into the chronic somatic again and you dont even know that you looked at the prior confusion this is very very easy one to forget its very easy one to slip on because it is actually the basic anatomy of how pictures and illnesses and concepts of one kind or another get very very stuck the way they get stuck is the confusion and the stable datum now that confusion and the stable datum has been known to us for mans many years and what weve done to it is add time to the span the confusion is in one place and the stable datum at later place so in all timetrack plotting you get the confusion and then you get after that the stable datum so actually theyre linear in time in other words you dont have the stable datum and the confusion occurring necessarilyand certainly not very aberratedlyyou dont have these two things occurring simultaneously in time in other words the stable datum and the confusion do not occur in time if theyre going to become aberrative which is the same timeyou dont have the stable datum and the confusion in the same instant of time now by that we mean twelve oclock second of october 1961 theres confusion while person is sitting at table well the confusion doesnt make the person necessarily sit more solidly at the table thats not the kind of stuck that were mixed up with this is the way we get the person if the person is going to be stuck at the table at eleven oclock there was hell of confusion and the person had an upset and had an upset stomach at twelve oclock and sat down in the table at the table to ease their upset stomach and somehow or another it didnt ease well there was confusion at twelve oclock the confusion was at eleven oclock just an hour before do you see this nowin other words the confusion is at an earlier instant of time than the stable datum that the person adopted afterwards but we find that the stable datum which is adopted afterwards is the sticker of course you can always adopt stable datum in the middle of confusion this is it but that isnt the one that sticks the one that sticks is where you have stable datum adopted after the fact of the confusion the united states goes to war with japan nothing much occurs as result of the war perhaps and then we all of sudden have president eisenhower talking about loss of face well its very interesting to have an american president use japanese term we give the wehrmacht hell of shellacking and during the war nobody is being the wehrmacht thats for sure the 88s are going on one side and the 22s are going on the other side and we have good solid flatout knockdowndragout war and nothing happens during this period of time that is at all upsetting except people getting killed and buildings blown down and so forth but everybody is too interested to have any stable data to amount to anything and then after the war theres discussion about should american troops goosestep there was you know now we add in world war i to it and we find american troops wearing german helmets its fascinating this gets more and more fascinating now we can understand the confederacy all wearing federal uniforms during the civil war because they didnt have any but there were lots of federal dead to take them off of that wasnt much of stable datum but today we find the confederacy is very stuck in the confederacy now we think that something happened like the assassination of lincoln or something and all of this well we certainly know all about lincolns assassination well how about lot of the other people who got assassinated by bullets in that war you see were not worried about them that stable datum isnt sticking but something that happened after the action is sticking like mad this is peculiarity and its not necessarily sensible it doesnt necessarily follow any logic this is an empirical fact by empirical fact i mean one that is established by observation not established by theory or reason this is true only because its observed to be true now you can develop lot of theories about why water doesnt flow uphill there could be lots of theories developed about it but you stand alongside of river and then you go find another river and then you go find another river and then you go find another river and you observe all of these rivers and you find out finally that the common denominator of all rivers was that water was flowing downhill the points downstream are at less altitude than the points upstream and we establish the fact then that water flows downhill we dont have to have the theory of gravity we dont have to have any other theory connected with it at all all we have to have is the observation that all rivers we are able to contact are flowing downhill thats an empirical datum all right now this prior confusion is an empirical datum and that is all it is its empirical its just observed that this is the case that the person is not stuck in the marriage that they are complaining about but are stuck in the marriage because of the confusion that existed before the marriage theyre not stuck in the marriage because of the confusion of the marriage now youve always been assuming that the marriage got stuck because of the confusion of the marriage all right now lets get down to workability solid sound workability how many marriages have you squared sup by knocking all the confusion out of the marriage well its sort of lot of little failed lines on that weve straightened up lot about marriages and so forth by knocking out their confusion weve done lot about marriages by knocking out the confusion of the marriage but the reason we couldnt do it rapidly and the reason we gotbored stiff trying to do something about it is if person is stuck on the subject of marriage the reason they are stuck has nothing to do with that period of time but has to do with the prior period of time that predated the marriage and if you free up that prior period of time to the marriage the difficulties of the marriage blow now this is an empirical oddity an oddity of magnitude weve got somebody who has got to have their liver operated on something wrong with their liver we find them stuck in an operation on liver theyve got to have another operation on liver they know its their liver their attention is stuck solidly on the liver and so we go ahead and process the liver but we never find the basicbasic on the chain of when their attention got stuck on the liver when did their attention get stuck on the liver actually it got stuck on the liver immediately after confusion immediately after confusion so the way to blow this operation on the liver is to blow the confusion which preceded the difficulty with the liver its so peculiar its sufficiently peculiar that this occurs when you try to learn it you immediately think of your own chronic somatic you try to swing your attention before you had the chronic somatic and you wind up with the chronic somatic and you say well there is the chronic somatic and of course that is all there is to it and then one tells you again right away now look lets look before you had that chronic somatic and you say yes chronic somatic its just as though were trying to put your attention on top of spring and as you put your attention on the spring it rebounds and blows you back into the chronic somatic do you see and your attention just doesnt go on to the prior confusion its quite remarkable you say to somebody all rightyoull do this as an auditor now many times youll say put your attention now on the periodor what happened you say in some other fashionwhat happened just before you got all upset with this marriage and they say well i got all upset with the marriage and you say well what happened just before you met this person and so forth oh well just before i met this person um uh yeah well we certainly had hell of time in that marriage and you say well now lookahere were talking about just before you met the person what was the date before you met the person well theyre liable to do something like well i had an awful lot of trouble when i was little child you say yeah but just before this marriage just before the marriage and they say yeah well i had an awful lot of trouble in that marriage whats happening is is the pcs attention bounces to later periods of time chronic somatics are always the result and solution of an unconfrontable disturbance which occurred immediately before them hidden standards and present time problems are always the result of confusion which immediately preceded the difficulty and when you get the pc to put his attention on the confusion you are asking him to do what he couldnt do and why he pinned his attention just after the confusion you see he looks at the confusion and then his attention without his recognizing anything bounces straight into the stable datum man has broken leg and this broken leg has just been going on and on and on for years and years and years he doesnt recognize it as broken leg the medicos say its tibiosis of the filamoriasis and that hes suffering from decay of the tendonwell he busted his leg sometime or another lets get it down to simple language us folks can understand andyou see if you dont know anything about subject you can get awfully fancy as matter of fact the more fanciness and the more oddball opinion and crosscurrent of opinion you find in subject you can assume that that is in direct relation to the amount known about the subject the more confusion in the subject the more crisscross the more learnedness the more pretended knowingness there is in the subject the less is actually known about it you can get terribly complicated idea about life and the mind from fields where it isnt known you understand theres lot of invented pretended knowingness on the thing for instance i dont know how many medical terms there are for leg and yet this leg wont heal and they cant make it heal fast but they can sure call it by lots of names and have lots of opinions on it dont you see well theyre sort of bouncing off the confusion all right so the person has got busted leg well the leg should have healed up in five or six weeks and that should have been all there was to it and thats itfinished but it isnt seven years later like the childrens doctor the fellow is still limpingi think two years ago he kids every time he sees you know he comes in limp limp masking the limp very consciously as soon as hes on the premises trying very hard not to limp he was in skiing accident 8 couple of years ago and i told him i was going to process him and it scared him within an inch of his life and so he always has some kidding remark to make to when he comes in to look at the childrens tongues about whether or not im going to process him but look its been two years and hes still limping ah well then this isnt just skiing accident because theres nothing really in bad shape about the bones they were all put together by the very best orthopedic surgeons he had the best of care hes doctor so what must have happened well he busted his leg in skiing accident and two years later it has yet to heal really oh well the bones are grown together and it isnt bleeding anymore but it isnt operating all right now lets take look at that was it the instant of the accident ah well we know more about the mind than they do we know very well that before some fellow does practiced action if hes in smooth frame of mind hes used to doing this action he goes down the slope and slaloms like mad and everything is just dandy and he winds up at the bottom upright and saying whee but if fellow is in disturbed frame of mind and his attention is on many other thingshe just received letter from his wife or his girl saying well ive just gone out again with pete dont you see and theres nothing he can do anything to but himself he cant do anything to anybody but himself theres nobody else around or hes powerless or something like that then this practiced skier starts at the top of the slope and he goes halfway down and he says this is good place and wraps himself around tree then they put him pathetically in the hospital and bring him home by ambulance plane and so on and it goes on for years dont you see so the high probability is that the accident had nothing to do with the motions of skiing skiing probably has nothing to do with the confusion which resulted in broken leg mentally because we have to ask the question how did he get himself bunged up and why now fellow doesnt get himself bunged up by accident see its not by accident thats the first thing you have to recognizethat theres some kind of postulate in there to bung himself up and hell manage it every timeall right so this medico all right we ask him now what happened just before you broke your leg and hell say well the snow was flying all around and the wind was going whee and and so forth and then there was this condemned switzerland pine tree and it pulled itself up by the roots and moved over in the middle of the ski track and you say good and we keep on running this and at the end of many hours we actually do get the thing to remove to marked degree we get an abatement of the chronic somatic yes we can do that we have done that many times well how would you like to see that chronic somatic vanish well that would be much better procedure and much faster than that ah well wed have to find out what went on before he went skiing that day well he was on vacation we know and we know that he felt he needed vacation why did he feel he needed vacation an odd thing to need particularly i never get one so i dont dare need one he needed vacation well what was the randomity that preceded that what was his mail like while he was on vacation lets search in this area lets find out anywhere in the last six months what had been going on and all of sudden we wind up with the damnedest knockdowndragout confusion if it was enough to make him break his leg it will be sufficient to bar out his inspection of it and at first he wont be able to inspect the prior confusion it takes an auditor sitting across from him to chonk his attention into that period and do an assessment of it and all of sudden he finds out that he thought the broken leg happened last year when it happened two years ago and hes completely forgotten that he broke the same leg when he was five and all kinds of oddball forgettingnesses turn up now what causes forgettingness its the inability to confront motion the inability to confront motion brings about an occlusion of that area of time now youve got postulate the first second third fourthpostulate theory the first postulate is notknow the second postulate is know all right so youve got big notknow you see he had big lot of mysteries and lot of confusions he couldnt confront and nothing he could do anything about of any kind whatsoever and he got himself know which immediately succeeded it in time in other words this notknow area this confusion area is followed by know area later in time now this is quite interesting because he follows notknow by know and the know might be quite stupid and it might be quite painful and it might be quite destructive but nevertheless its knowingness some fellow who is gimping around with bad leg certainly knows something he knows hes got bad leg you might say all psychosomatics and hidden standards are cures for mystery they give themself knowingness following period of notknowingness now people can get stuck in relief and very often when your pc feels better he will feel better momentarily and quite artificially and not feel better at all now for instance supposing we were all sitting here and we heard high whine and dull thud out in the park and an airplane full of screaming passengers had apparently just crashed you know and we could hear the whole works sitting here and so we in big flurry crowd out the door and rush outside to see this airplane thats crashed and so on and its just peter left one of his record players on see quite feeling of relief but the relief followed period of confusion now im not saying this is very aberrative this would be so light that its very easy to face indeed thenyou see wed have little period of relief and it actually would stick slightly on the track see its period of relief its period of know now you see at the moment we heard it crash we didnt know what was happening so weve got notknow and then we go out and we find out what happened we find out nothing happened and that its all all right so we know you get this this is just in vignette what im talking about is not at all aberrative it takes much greater volume of magnitude to make one of these things all right now lets go into what mary sue was showing you here just before i came in and we have ourselves period there which we see as big white chalk mark up at the top and then theres little chalk mark down the line and weve got vertical time track here and its got big blob of white chalk at the up part and little blob and then below that big blob and then below that little blob and some more little blobs all right now im not making fun of her cartooning here but anyway taking look at this now we see the time track plots linearly now shes got herself plotted from zero at the top to 1961 at the bottom well all right well take it that way because time tracks dont run in any direction all right now we take that little tiny last bottom white blob and thats chronic somatic the person has chest wheeze and every time you process them they look at their chest to find out if theyre still wheezing and they know the auditing command worked because the wheeze is less or they think the auditing command didnt work because the wheeze is more this is how they know you see this is how they know well isnt it interesting that this know would occur in connection with chronic somatic now person must have hell of an avidity for knowingness if they have to find out if their back is still broke or their chest is still caved in or if their rib cage is squashed what kind of knowingness is this well it must have followed one godawful confusion man if thats the acceptable level of knowingnesswowwhat must have happened before that so we take this pc and we say to this pc pointing to that last white blob there yell what was going on in your life immediately before you noticed this difficulty with your chest and your first usual immediate response if this is hot subject is well my chest has always hurt itll be something intelligible like this they havent answered the question at all you say just before you noticed thisbefore you noticed thiswhat happened in your life and they say well um i dont know thats right there you got it hot thats hot and heavy and boy they neverthey never spake more sooth than that they were spaking sooth with all front teeth they didnt know thats for sure or they wouldnt have this chest difficulty all right so we punch it little harderyou see its the auditor compelling the pcs attention into that areaand we say well when did it turn on what period of time was it when it turned on well he said well it must have beenmust have been the summer of 59 or something like that i know i had it then you see they havent said anything before yet you see they know they had it in the summer of 59 you say now thats good now just what happened just before the summer of 59 well i had it in the spring of 59 too see they havent answered your question yet you know all right but you see whats happening here youre plowing their attention back toward an unconfrontable area so yousay well all right what happened before that well what was going on before you noticed this chest somatic and so forth and they say well oh well uh yeah well it uh and we notice this little upper white blob here see they say yeah well it turned off for long time havent answered your question yet see its off from the first white blob to the second white blob see well its off yeah well i wasnt troubled with it then and uh i rememberoh yes yes thats right i recall in 56 i had medical treatment for this see theyve told you nothing about before yet but theyve got it stretched back in time and then all of sudden theyll come up and say well lets see 56 and well call that earlier blob there 1956 theyll say well lets see you say what were you doing in 56 well i 55 that was when i was down at camp in cornwall come to think about it that was 52 and theyre liable to come up with the adjudication that they dont know what happened from 1952 to 1956 this is curious blank period and they figure it all out and they say well it must have been this and it must have been that and it might have been this and might have been that and then all of sudden they say well the truth of the matter is i was well im not sure im not sure but do you know i had this when i was child see way back now way way back boom yes i had this when i was child they thought that i had consumption and so forth and i actually i hadnt remembered that but i had lot of consumption and i remember 1 was living with my grandmother and so forth and uh theythey had to the doctor lot of times and that sort of thing and i just had overlooked this fact now were up at the first white blob up there see you say well what happened just before you were living with your grandmother well i wouldnt know i was awfully young i was eleven well yeah well where were your parents at that time well lets see and brother weve got another blank spot and weve got nice big juicy blank spot now we keep plowing into this blank spot and we finally find out that mother and father had agreed to separate just before this and there had been lot of domestic difficulties and we think weve got it now and were trying to really pin it down we think weve got it and they were trying to separate and this was happening and that was happening it was all very clouded up and it was all very this and that and were just about to get touching short story about this whole thing when suddenly the pc remembers that he burned down the house and that will be the end of that chronic somatic just by assessment only see thats just by assessment but your assessment is doggedly to find out what happened before they noticed this now perhaps its bad thing to say for the first time because this is always lie one of the stable data of auditing is always make your auditing question as truthful and as factual as possible dont make auditing questions that are nonfactual so you say well what is the first time you remembered this or what is the first time you noticed this of course the pc cannot answer this because hes going to give you fifty more first times after hes given you thefirst time so its much cleverer to say what is time that you noticed this when did you notice this what happened before you noticed this and then just keep chugging it in now its not repetitive command and this is actually getting rid of chronic somatics by assessment if you are very clever at assessing you can just go on and assess and assess and assess and you finally find out the confusion and you pin the confusion down to such degree that youve made the pc confront the confusion the confusion will asis right there bang and everything else will blow after it and that is it you can do it by assessment only with an emeter that requires rather clever auditor to do the whole job by assessment only now heres an easier way to do it we finally spot the area of confusion by assessment and then we put together security checks to fit that area we find out that this person had this when they were eleven well its some kind of childhood activity that is all messed up well you can actually take the childs security check and bend it around one way or the other question by question and add your own questions to it and so on and youre going to get yourself some interesting data that this pc has never seen before and youre going to blow out those zones of confusion and youre going to find the dissipation of the hidden standard of the chronic somatic that is more standardized method of going about one of these things all right lets take another example this girl finds that she has headaches she finds she has lots of headaches and in auditing shes always sort of aware of this headache and she knows the auditing process is working because the headache turns on or turns off and if nothing affects the headache she of course doesnt think the auditing process is working thats her hidden standardthat by which she finds out whether or not auditing is working that is the definition of hidden standard well naturally your rudiments are out as long as the pc has this condition why well the pc is viaing the auditing command now in all cases where pc is not making progress on routine 3 you can bet your bottom peseta that the pc has not and is not doing the auditing command they might be doing the auditing command plus plus plus see or they might not be doing it at all i do remember back in wichita long long ago pc coming around to after twentyfive hour intensive and bragging to that they had succeeded in not answering an auditing command once and they thought this was awfully clever of them yes sir the pc was really bragging about it what was the matter with the auditor that he didnt find it out now here is the more usual thing the pc does the auditing command and applies it to certain area of the mind or body in order to find out if it has affected something else and they do the auditing command by applying the auditing command to something in the mind and then they look over here to see what is going on and if anything happened and they do this continually theyre not just doing the auditing command they are doing something else now they know they did the auditing command right or they know they did it wrong or they know the command is right or wrong in direct comparison to how much happens to alleviate this difficulty you are auditing pc who has an attention fixed not on the bank in general but on some particular peculiar activity and theyre doing something peculiar with every auditing command you feed them the auditing command they do something peculiar with it even though they verbally answer it and so on and apparently have executed it they do something else with it and when pc is not making progress you can say his attention is stuck someplace well thats shortened form of saying the rudiments are out one of the rudiments are out the pc is not really in session the pc is on auto the pc is not under the auditing control the pc isunder his own control hes under his own control to this degree you say something then the pc takes over as auditor and executes the auditing command and then gives the session back to you and you ask the next question and when you ask the question then the pc takes the auditing command goes on auto audits the auditing command on himself and then gives the auditing session back to you have you got the idea and the pc during the entire period of execution of the auditing command is not in session any pc who hasnt gone clear in 150 hours is doing it pc has got hidden standard what is this hidden standard maybe hes got six hidden standards well every one of those hidden standards is totally this stable datum stuck after the fact of the confusion they all have the same anatomy pc takes the session away from you does the auditing command finds out whether or not it moves this electronic then sees whether or not the electronic is affecting whether or not hes boy or girl thats right that was how we moved into this with just that action on the part of pc we knew about this for long time but weve never really seen it in action to this flagrant degree this pc had been audited for about thousand hours and had applied every single auditing command ever given to the pc to the resolution of an electronic incident which the pc was convinced if it were run out he would turn from man to woman thousand hoursno progress well why the pc was never in session so the rudiments are out the basic rudiment that is out is present time problem of long duration where you have hidden standard all right very good now if we take ourselves pc and we audit along with routine 3 we can find the pcs goal we can find the pcs terminal oh yes with some difficulty but we can find them in relatively short order certainly under twentyfive hours of auditing if were really in there we keep the most flagrant rudiments in dont you see but we havent noticed this hidden standard yet nowand then we assess the pc on the prehav scale and we run the pc on the prehav scale and we run the pc and we run the pc and we run the pc and nothing happens well theres where itll show up see we can do the action of finding goal because the pcs attentions are very very solidly on goals we can certainly find the action of terminal we can find this terminal because we actually havent really asked the pc to do an auditing command its all between you and the meter see we can find the assessed level of the prehav scale very easily but now we go into the repetitive auditing command and the pc goes on auto why does the pc go on auto well the pc has got hidden standard the pc is auditing himself on making his nose well pc is not runningnot at all runningthe terminal of railroad engineer hes running nose and so he doesnt go clear now very often in worse cases the pc will be very resistive toward an auditors inquiring questions the auditor says what are you doing what did you do with that auditing command youve all of sudden got knockdowndragout fight on our hands pc does not like you inquiring into it the first time you ever notice anything like that you say to yourself this pc has hidden standard lets find out what it is now although you can find the persons goal terminal and level you actually cant run the pc on that in the presence of hidden standards it is waste of time now theres one earlier action that can be taken with the pc that the pc will do and that will produce results but there is only one earlier action can be taken before routine 3 assessment and that is security check this can be done without knowing the pcs terminal and will produce lasting excellent results there is other processnow we have all the facts in overthe yearswill produce easy and lasting gains on pc other process will produce easy good solid lasting positive gains on pc you have security check and youve got the assessment and youve got the running of the assessment so this leaves us with security check as very powerful auditing weapon because it will operate whether youre running the goals terminal or not the security check will operate and those gains you make with security check will be lasting gains hence we divide up auditors into class irun any process on which they have certainty this will probably be some kind of control process by the way itll be some cousin to the cchs if the auditor is wise because that at least works out the control factors of the pc and you do make sort of gain youre running in order and something is going to happen with this pc and it doesnt come under the heading however of fast easy gain it is not fast easy gain it is lasting gain but it is hard long gain and thats all you can say for it thats the cchs scsall these various things they are long hard arduous things to handle and they do produce lasting gain but at what cost so it doesnt come under the heading of nice easy stable gain achieved by the auditor at all but class i auditors had better be employed even though it is very hard to achieve long lasting proposition matter how arduously they had better be put to work doing some auditing because any auditing is better than auditing and this type of gain will be quite beneficial in the long run and so forth and this argues that class i auditor is doing something as long as hes doing one of these types of processes all right we move up to class ii auditor and class ii auditor can security check all right security checking produces lasting gain and it is very easy it is very easy to do it is very nice it is very very fast and it is lasting result so we have the class ii auditor doing security checks and actually when were talking about the hidden standard and that sort of thing we can envision that class ii auditor would have set up pc on the basis of having gotten rid of all of his hidden standards and thats what we look go class ii auditor to do not just to sit there and prate off sec check 3 were asking him to do something else were asking him to sec check in the direction of getting rid of all of the stuck points in this lifetime were asking him to get rid of the confusions of the first second third fourth fifth and sixth marriages were asking all of the were asking him to get rid of that crooked neck were asking him to get rid of the odd habit he has that every time you say something to him he goes drvvvvvkh it seems rather odd this person would do that you know because you havent asked him to smell thing in other words these things all surrender to security checking all of them now the lot but what kind of security checking does it take well it takes standard security check that is always good thing to bang into case the first and foremost thing you do thats good thingjust go on and pick out the probable security check lets take an oldtime auditor hes been knocking around and into god knows what well the first security check we want to shove into him is the last two pages of sec 3 plus sec check 6 theres reason to do the first many many pages of 3 or do anything very fancy because hes not going to get any benefit of something that he has overts on and so on so lets get that out of the road and now having done this let us get clever and apply this data about the stable datum and the prior confusion now this is different than the stable datum and the confusionthe idea that we get all of the stablewe get all the confusions off the case and we will of course knock out at once all of the persons activities and so forth that isnt quite true we have to knock them out selectivelyhas to be very selectiveso after you got the last two pages of form 3 and all of 6 done you should roll up your sleeves at about that point and lets go for the hidden standards lets find out if there is anything by which this person measures gain or gain what would have to happen for you to know that scientology works thats the clue question and you get these things and sometimes these things are detached things sometime these things are well my mother would have to get well well he doesnt really meanperhaps he does but he really probably doesnt meanthat his mother would have to be sold on scientology and brought to an auditor the auditing command which he is doing if applied to himself would have to cure his mother you see he often means that too so this idea thishe says well my mother would have to get well well this is marvelous it means his mother is stuck stuck chronic somatic now the way you would have handled this in the pastthe way you would have handled this in the pastis not the fastest way to handle it you could have handled it in the past and it would have worked out all right in the past but that is not the fastest way to handle it im just giving you much faster method when did this occur that mother became stable datum and what confusion preceded it ahhh in other words we dont run ow on mama and we dont security check mama and we dont have very much to do with mama we want to find out what happened before mama became chronic somatic because mama is stable datum for confusion before the fact of accepting mama as stable datum theres some confusion prior remember its always prior lets reorient your thinking on this now the fellow says well uhhh i just have to get over hating my father thats what would have to happen yes sir to know scientology worked id have to get over hating my father well you say thats good so obviously you can do something about that you do security check about his father thats obvious isnt it this is past thinking on it and you get all of his overts against his father and all of his withholds from his father and you clean up father and what do you know you could do it i mean you could have gotten long way in this direction ahha theres much faster method lets find out what happened before hating father became his stable data in life hating father must be an activity he can confront as retreat from earlier activities he cant confront and they probably have nothing to do with his father hatred of father was much more acceptable to him than the tremendous confusion he had with who knows probably not father who knows who it is lord knows so what do you do you assess and you find the area of prior confusion to the hatred of father now at first the pc is going to tell you its something that father did and its something that had to do with father but remember it cant have anything to do with father if father is the stuck somatic cant have anything to do with father you see if father is the stuck personnel if father is the broken leg on this case it hasnt anything to do with father because he can confront father well if he can confront father and hes spent all these years confronting father and so forthit hasnt got him well why do you in an auditing session put in more hours confronting father waste of time see lets find out what happened before this occurred so youd want to know when did you notice that you hated your father and what happened before that first answer well inevitably my father did this my father did thatand you say good fine give him cheery old acknowledgment and then find out what happened before that with other people oh you find out his old man hasnt been anybody man his old man has been nobody in this fellows life there is some kind of person on broomstick that has been flying around in this persons belfry you know as child why this person would seewell maybe it was his fathers mother or something you know and the child would see her sitting there quietly knitting and rocking in the rocking chair or something and he absolutely just couldnt resist you see spilling the cat on her or you know or pulling up the ball of yarn or somehow or another stealing all of the bread dough or putting salt in the plum puddingjust anything see anything and youll find that these are overts but they wont come through that way at all he will finally recover the character on the broomstick see total occlusion recover this character on the broomstick and you will try to do security check on this and she beat and she socked and she used to hold over the well and say she was going to drop and hell just go motivator motivator motivator motivator motivator see of course why because he can observe the inflow but he cant observe his outflow yeah but what did he do thats whats getting interesting here what did he do did he steal her broom because youll find inevitably that this is what happened so you make up some kind of roster of the personnel involved prior to the stuck personnel and you make roster of the missing persons bureau and your little list is missing persons bureau and boy youre really going to find missing people pc doesnt even know they exist theres going to be sections out of his life he dont know are gone and youre going to find those sections and find out who is in them and then write up security check any old kind of security check to find out what he did to themthese other people not father skip father he was confrontable character why bother with father just waste of time thats what the pc is complaining about now whatever the pc complains about do something earlier there is your stable datum whatever the pc complains about you do something earlier and dont pay any attention to handling the object about which he is complaining you pay attention to his complaint but if you continue to handle the object about which hes complaining such as his big ears why youre not going to get anyplace hes complaining about big ears well im seeing every time i you find out every time he answers an auditing command that he finds out if his ears shrunk you find stuff weird like this man well did his ears shrink okay when is the first time you ever noticethat would be wrong now when did you notice that you had big ears when did you notice this oh well i have had big ears for some time you see thats your inevitable reply now if you get reply of this character which is non sequitur you know you are on to hot area of disturbance because the pcs attention went onto it and then flickcame right up the track to the big ears your effort to put his attention on the area of confusion results in putting his area attention on the object whenever you try to put his area attention on the confusion and then you only succeed in putting his areaattention on the object you know youve got it made you know youre looking at one godawful area of occlusion you say to him when did you first notice that you had big ears now what happened before you first noticed you had big ears any such question and he says well ive just worried about it for yearsmy big ears well now you see the mechanism at work you asked him about time before big ears and he answered big ears so its obvious that his attention deflected from the area you tried toput his attention on you have located hidden springboard he doesnt know its there but you now do he coasts right up the track to it every time you put that hull in the water it goes straight to that particular dock with crash it wont head out to sea it wont go anyplace you see you just put it in the water and it hits this dock father or ears or something see bang and there it is you say well now in yourin your early life what went on there what went on in your early life now this would be just asking for whole bunch of balderdash now it would take an awful lot of millions of words for the pc to tell you every single horrible thing thats been done to him in his early life theres sense in having much of synopsis on it its up to the auditor to continue to direct the pcs attention where he wants the pcs attention directed not to listen to recounta blowbyblow recountof all the beatings the dock gave him see thats silly because thats all hes going to tell you he hates his fatherthis is his hidden standardhe doesnt feel better yet about his father so not feeling better yet about his father he knows the auditing isnt working and you say well tell about your early life so he says well my father and he used to take out in the woodshed and then he did this to and he did that to and he did this and he did that and my father this and my father that well are you doing anything for this pc youre not doing anything for him at all because youre leaving his attention stuck on refuge any chronic somatic any stuck personnel anything of that nature is refuge on which the pc can put his attention and you are not doing your job as an auditor unless you get his attention eased over on to what makes him stick his attention on it and you do that by gradient scale and the pc can get very restive if you jump your gradient too hard so you say all right big ears now lets see what happened just before you noticed that or when did you notice that you had big ears tell time you noticed you had big ears whats some early period when you noticed that and the pc says well well well well well well i was working in london for an attorneys firm i used to notice it good you say is there any earlier time than that oh well in the attorneys firm oh well hell you got his attention stuck there and you say earlierearlier than the attorneys firm whatd you do earlier than that oh oh well what did i do earlier than that uh i dont know what did i do earlier lets see now i went to prep school and then i went to college and thenso on and that was 1952 and i got out of there and then 52 and then 1955 1955 and i went to work yes it must have been 55 i went to worki remember that yes it was 55 went to work for the attorneys firm in 1955 and i got out of college in 1952 oh good you say well what did you do between 52 and 55 i just dont know now lets see what did i do ii met girl ah yes i remember now i met girl and she uh yeah i met this girl and she had boyfriend and we had an awful that was 58 let see iill get it in minute its 1952 1955 now theres period of three years now lets see after i got out of college i must have gorse home for little while and then i must have done this and then i must have done that and i must have done something or otherprobably yeah im sure i must have donesomething like this because you see you just wouldnt ordinarily just go from college to an attorneys firm now let see oh i know i had an awful fight with fellow yeah oh that was pretty terrible we met down in this bar and he had some kind of criticism of one way or the other and we had this hor that was 57 that wasnt 55 that was 57 and thats the way hell go on you understand and you say well what happened in this period ofanything that might have occurred between 1952 and 1955 oh uhhuh ruh ruh ruh ruhruh ruh ruhruh well did you ever think about big ears before 1952 i didnt think about that before 1952 and so forth well did you think about big ears after 1955 well yes oh yes oh yes all the time used to sit there at my desk with ink all over and i used to sometimes get it on my ears and they used to call ink ears sometimes and so on that was probably it actually the firm really hated and the senior partners this and that and you say thats good thanks good good good fine thank you thanks good all right now good now we want 52 to 55 now who did you know in that period well i must have known my father and mother all right well who introduced you to get work at the attorneys firm uh must have been some connection with my father and you know youre liable to find some damnfool thing like marriage youre liable to man youre liable to find anything but you will find something and itll be period there of total occlusion what youre trying to do is not necessarily solve the big mystery of it all if you were very clever you could do the whole thing by assessment on the meter one of the ways you do it by assessment is well 54 did you have long vacation there after you left college was it two years one year six months oh i went to work something of the sort i was doing something im sure i was doing something i must have been doing something over period of three years young man doesnt do anything you see and i went up im sure yes yeah im absolutely sure you finally dredge up name agnes ohhhh agnes ahhhh all right now in essenceas much as you can find out about agnesyou just do it on an interrogation basis and assess the worst confusion you ever had with agnes when is the worst time you ever had with agnes and so forth and this finally peters out and you find agnes is just red herring shes hardly girl at all and in actual fact it was isabel isabel turns up along about this time and now we have got honey by the ear and we find out that she used to stand there constantly and say what she said and she used to do this and do that and she was the one who got him arrested arrested where the hell did this come from dont you see we dont find out usually anything about big ears agnes never said anything about big ears nothing of this sort but she went off with boy who had big ears and isabel isabel she went off with boy who had big ears something stupid like this so big ears got tobe something in here and in some of the wild devious way that all of sudden works out and becomes completely sensible we find out how he wound up with stable datum of big ears this person says well i have ball of light and it is just back of my eyeballs and when the ball of light glows then i know the auditing question worked and when it doesnt glow it didnt work you want to find out when did you notice this and then you want to find out what happened before that now what happened before that and the person said iwell i havent got the faintest idea im lets see now what happened before that and we run into some kind of blank period then all of sudden marvel of marvels we find out that between 1945 and 1948 the person was deeply immersed in the temple of black magic someplace or another and all this seems to have dropped out of sight and what they did really there was see the light and hes been seeing the light ever since but it was one awful confusion because after the police raided the joint you see it wasnt so much that it was being sued for being the father of the child that was what got him but all of this has been fantastically occluded you see and all of these stable data that the person has lead back to prior unknown and its just the notknow followed by the know its the confusion followed by the stillness the confusion then the stillness all right now ill give you something ive got some kind of reality on it works like this you find the bird this works out on broader track basis you find this pc standing on rock in the middle of the sea waiting for somebody to pick him up and he has this pain in his stomach and he had that pain in his stomach for many lifetimes many many lifetimes hes had the pain in his stomach and you say all right lets run this out so we run him standing on the rock in the middle of the sea and we i guarantee youwe can run it and we can run it and we can run it and we can run it and we can run it and he will still have pain in his stomach and still be standing on rock in the middle of the sea and this is the old engram that wouldnt resolve and this is why finding the earlier on the chain resolved the later engrams the engrams that wouldnt erase because of course in finding the earlier engram you accidentally went across the confusion and you got the confusion knocked out well theres nothing precedes that incident thats hardly worth recounting except mutiny shipwreck sudden disaster half drowning seven times and theres something kind of strange and spooky about the whole thing and then we finally find out that hes standing on the rock without body and hasnt noticed hes dead and this finally resolves the whole thing up to that time he knew all about it but trying to get his attention immediately before the incident when this occurred will be one of the tougher jobs because you say all right how did you get on the rock and he says i was just standing there well i must have gotten there some way uh oh i get picture now of the surf i must have come to the rock through the surf well any fool could tell that man he didnt land there by helicopter thats for sure but hell make these suppositional actions now person trying to do this all by himself begins after while to appreciate an auditor because his attention is pinned in certain category and as it tries to go back to areas that are unknown to him it of course deflects onto the chronic somatics so he tries to put his attention back on this and then comes up into thechronic somatic and then hes stuck with the chronic somatic his attention is on it so he starts auditing the chronic somatic and he never does put his attention back on the earlier incident see so he leaves himself stuck with chronic somatics see his attention goes back up and he needs an auditor sitting there to tell him to put his attention back again you know what happened before that whats the worst kind of motion you possibly could experience on ship well it wouldnt be ship itd be submarine i dont know why i said that well whats the worse kind of motion you could experience on ship well being torpedoed by submarine lets see or torpedoing ship by submarine being torpedoed by submarine lets see torpedoing ship or ship torpedoing you ship wouldnt torpedo you you see and the ship its the worst kind of motion worst kind of motion be standing on rock waiting for ship to come in you see exactly where the attention goes then hell get all interested in the thing worst kind of motion lets see well what might have preceded that must be some kind of bad motion what kind of bad action could person perform that that would pay for you know asking him for direct overtjust suppositional oh oh oh well youve really asked one now you know i get picture of foredeck of galley and all the galley slaves are there and theyre all chained and their blood is running down underneath the fetters and the overseers walk up and down the ramp and the whips go wham you see and so forth and in battle in battle when they start throwing greek fire in amongst the galley slaves that was much earlier that isnt the same period at all i got that that was much earlier much earlier and you say well how much earlier was that well that was another lifetime thats completely different lifetime i dont know what i was doing in this thing it just seems kind of blank the whole thing seems sort of blank theres this sailing ship you see and its sailing along and i think i actually stood on the rock and i managed to coerce ship to come in and wreck itself on the rocks or maybe or maybe and we finally find out that it wasnt very dramatic he just got dead drunk as captain of ship and ran it square aground on the rocks and killed off all the crew and they all died in the jagged reef and they were all screaming around him and so forth but it wasnt so much that he had stolen the ship and was guilty of barratry oh were getting someplace now yes actually he had murdered the owners agent the second day out of port now were getting someplace and the next thing you know he isnt standing on the rock anymore see what happens you get the overts and that sort of thing off on the prior confusion and it blows and that is the end of standing on the rock but the more you qanda with the pc and let him stand there on the rock the less youre going to get done it get pretty obvious the less youre going to get done now you can keep chasing pcs attention back back back back back back back and wind him up at the beginning of track probably of course thats kind of q and too because thats method of not confronting he puts his attention on an incident much earlier that he can confront rather than confront the incident immediately before were much more interested in that span of time just before that seems so mysterious and that keeps landing him back on the rock thats the period were interested in were not necessarily interested in his whole career as space commander were not interested in that period because space commanders very seldom take ships to sea all right so what were interested in is the period which we have encounterednow youre going to find this technique very interesting in the handling of engrams just to branch off on to something else youre going to find this very very interesting when youve got persons hidden standards and hes been running well and hes running his goals terminal on the prehav scale and you get up to class ivtype auditing and youre going to run some engrams you find these are usually very easy engrams and you havent got to resort to very much trickery to run them because the pc with the rudiments in hes in valence hes already contacted these pictures many times as he runs up and down the track and you find out they kind of run like hot butter take about half an hour to run one of the things an hour and half three hours is the longest ive had so far and they run very easily but lets suppose in some peculiar way that we didnt really get this thing wheeling and the person seems to be stuck in it and theres hell of burp someplace in this engram were running you see and the person goesevery time they go through this area they go burp and every time they go through the area they go burp and were having trouble running the engram we should assume that something confusing happened just before that and try to get that up rather than try to knock the burp out get the incident just before and he will blow whatever is hanging now of course the whole engram is hanging up isnt it now how does person get stuck on the track in the first place oh lets ask much more important question than that how does person get on time track in the first place and what are you doing on the time track in this universe thats an interesting question why are you plodding along the time track with such orderliness could it be that theres confusion at the beginning of track that you cant face i find that very fascinating question i wont bother to give you any answers to that particularly but what is time time very possibly could be retreat from confusion we cared not to confront so we retreated masse and have been going ever since but that gives you now basic rundown on the prior confusiontrying to find the prior confusion to find the stuck datum persons ability to confront confusions improved of course will blow lot of chronic somatics but i wouldnt count on it i wouldnt count on just improving their ability to confront and then having it all work out magically i would much rather that you just sawed into it from the word go and picked up these things and blew them selectively one by one and very intelligently because goals terminal run on the prehav scale will give them lots of confrontingness and itll give them lots of changes and that sort of thing and youre much more interested in that trying to run person though with present time problem of long durationone special kind of which is hidden standardtrying to run person on the prehav scale with five sixway brackets and that sort of thing is highly profitless because the pc never does the auditing command when analyzing whether or not case is running look to find out whether or not the pc is materially advancing the sensitivity is coming down and the needle is getting progressively looser all right that all betokens advance of the case now we go just little bit further than that and we say if the case has not gone clear in 150 hours of routine 3 which includes of course security checks and assessment and runs wed better say to ourselves right about there this case has never done an auditing command this case has done something else too or has done something else or has not done it at all and that would be the ne plus ultra of being kind of stupid to wait that long now that we know this but if it did reach that time then we would say well theres hidden standards here and we would determine what they are and determining what they are we would get rid of them on this basis of prior confusion or any refinement thereof wed blow these hidden standards wed straighten out these things wereturn to goals run if the case still hung up we would suspect another hidden standard we would blow that and go on so it might be very good idea to blow all the hidden standards that you could blow on case before you do very much worrying about the case getting on the way with goals run in other words by all means get their goal by all means get their terminal by all means assess level on the prehav scale by all means give them some running on this sort of thing but on security check angle first lets get off those last two pages of form 3 and lets get off all of form 6 on an old auditor on new people lets straighten up security check in general lets get this pretty well ironed out and then lets find out if the person has any hidden standards and then lets undercut those by finding the prior confusions lets fill in these blank spots at least in this lifetime lets get them sailing so that they can actually do straight auditing command and then doing that youll find you make very rapid progress with clearing all summer and all last spring ive just been working on speed of clearing that is all ive been working on and this is another sevenleagueboot stride in that particular direction

the problem and pulling ows in that area has been in use since its discovery in the early 60s the theory of this is that any fixed idea or condition is the result of postulate made by the thetan just prior to that postulate there was confusion an unconfrontable disturbance the postulate is stable datum adopted in an attempt to solve that confusion by getting off the pcs ows in the area of the confusion one can key out the postulate and fixed condition breakthrough i have just made breakthrough of magnitude on the subject of the prior confusion while engaged in whole track research this tech has broader application than was originally envisioned what has actually been spotted here is that the psychs on the whole track created confusion originally and used the overwhelm of that as the knockout for the implant they didnt at that stage of the track have any other tools to knock beings out so the mechanism of prior confusion is very early and very dominant this breakthrough on the prior confusion comes from spotting the first moment of the confusion this does not mean that pc in running back an evil purpose is necessarily going to contact an incident containing psychiatrist but you as the auditor should know that that is what this tech discovery is based uponhandling evil purposes this has immediate application in auditing addressed to the locating and handling of pcs accumulated evil purposes and nonsurvival considerations once such purpose or consideration is found one locates the confusion which occurred just before it if there is blow of the purpose or visible reaction then one gets an earlier time for the same evil purpose and an earlier confusion to that when one finds the first moment of the first confusion which led to that evil purpose one can blow the whole thing once the first moment of that first confusion on that chain is found you will normally get blowdown of the tone arm cognition vvgis in the pc and persistent fn if not floating ta getting the first moment of the confusion is crucial this follows the fundamental auditing principle of the earlier beginning as described in the basic books and in new era dianetics tech by locating the earliest moment when the pc had an awareness of the confusion it can be blown source the false purpose or evil intention may have been generated by the person himself or directly implanted by another this new application of prior confusion tech as given in the false purpose rundown has been shown to be highly effective regardless of the source of the purpose or intention errors on the false purpose rd if one gets the prior confusion but the evil purpose doesnt spectacularly blow it could be due to number of reasons but it is primarily one of these two things 1 the auditor failed to get the earlier time the pc had that same purpose and then get the prior confusion beneath it or 2 the auditor did get the basic prior confusion on that evil purpose but failed to get the first moment of that confusion l ron hubbard founderhubbard communications office saint hill manor east grinstead sussex hco bulletin of 8 june 1984 remimeo false purpose rd auditors and cses cramming officers all

successful auditor is the technique of getting off the pcs justifications when pulling overts and withholds when this tech has fallen out of use auditing has been less effective therefore in auditing the false purpose rd it is mandatory that on each overt pulled the pcs justifications of that overt must be cleared additionally step is added to sec checking procedure of getting the pcs justifications off on each overt that is found theory where the pc is justifying he is in nonconfront of his own causation by justifying he is lessening the severity of the overt and as long as he has an overt justified he hasnt taken responsibility for it and it will still be charged thus pulling off the pcs justifications is invaluable in raising his cause and responsibility level procedure justifications are asked for after the time place form and event of the overt have been gotten and before asking for who missed it and the pcs justifications can be gotten by asking have you justified that overt or why wasnt that an overt getting that answered and asking for any more justifications until all are gotten quite often they will come off in torrent to the great relief of the pc example auditor is running the confessional question have you ever stolen an apple after getting the pc to answer and give the what when and so forth of the overt the auditor asks auditor have you justified that overt pc yes i decided it was okay to steal the apples because i was hungry auditor thank you how else did you justify it pc well the store had so many apples in stock that i knew it wouldnt hurt them to lose few and after all theyve overcharged before so they actually sort of owed it to and i always shop there so theyre still making plenty of money from auditor okay how else did you justify it pc that covers it boy i really had that one loaded up with reasons for its being all right auditor thanks very much who missed it auditor continues on with the missed step and then if ep goes on

77 ii confessional forms the false purpose rundown is brandnew development in the handling of overts withholds evil purposes and destructive intentions using this new technique they are traced straight down to their origins and blown evil purposes an evil purpose is destructive purpose intention or postulate i discovered in 1970 that evil purposes are the basis of insanity person who continuously commits harmful acts has evil purposes he is prompted by these purposes to commit overts such person often tries to keep these overts carefully hidden while continuing to commit them this does not mean that every pc who gives off an evil purpose is raving psychotic or john dillinger or is bent only on destruction it does not mean that any pc who discovers he has been dramatizing destructive intention is an sp what it does mean is that this is an area that will cause or more likely has already caused great deal of difficulty or conflict not only for the pc himself but for those around himpostulates evil purposes are in effect postulates research on purposes and postulates and their role in the general aberration of case goes back as early as 1950 and lot of material exists on this in hcobs and in basic dianetics and scientology books in dealing with this subject we are in reality dealing with whole spectrum of what are actually postulates considerations intentions purposes service facsimiles and computations these are all postulates such false purposes false considerations quasievil purposes and the like can sit squarely in the road of attempts to hat or train or get case gain on person new tech breakthrough underlying an overt chain you will very often find an evil purpose or destructive intention in other words when you start tracking down ows with eses keeping on certain type of ow you will very likely run into an evil purpose on case the underlying evil purpose prompts the person to commit and continue committing harmful acts the breakthrough that i have made on this line is in the application of prior confusion tech to the handling of overts and evil purposes just as an evil purpose can be found at the bottom of chain of overts so can confusion be found just prior to an evil purpose once the first underlying prior confusion on that chain is located it is only necessary to have the pc spot the first moment of it to cause it to blow auditor requirements false purpose rd auditor must be graduate of the new hubbard false purpose rundown auditor course and provenly competent in handling the high precision tech of the rundown prerequisite to this course is the hubbard senior security checker course where one becomes highly skilled sec checker one who has not successfully completed these two courses may audit the false purpose rundown the exact requirements to deliver the false purpose rd are 1 student hat 2 pro tr course 3 class iv auditor 4 upper indoc tr course or upper indoc trs previously drilled on any training course 5 hubbard senior security checker course 6 hubbard false purpose rundown auditor course provisional until interned to deliver the false purpose rundown to an ot iii or new ot iv which would only be done in an ao or at the fso one must have done 16 above plus 7 qualified to audit ot iii reviewsto deliver the false purpose rundown to nots preot one must have done all of 17 above plus 8 full training as class ix auditor hubbard advanced courses specialist false purpose rundown forms the false purpose rundown procedure utilizes form that consists of series of questions related to specific subject or area there are different false purpose rd forms which the cs may include in the pcs program whatever form is used the auditor does the whole form on the pc every question is cleared and checked on the meter as per basic sec checking tech some of the questions on the form ask for overts eg have you ever stolen materials from school and other questions ask directly for evil purposes and destructive intentions eg have you had an evil purpose towards school teacher form questions which simply ask for overts are taken to basic and usually lead right to an evil purpose see steps to g below on questions which directly ask for evil purposes the auditor takes up the procedure from step c and carries through to ep the whole aim in doing this rundown is to locate overts and evil purposes on the case and fully blow them these two types of sec check questions simply give two different approaches to one thing getting onto the trail that leads to an evil purpose and once found blowing the evil purpose auditing procedure important before the rundown is started the pc must have clear understanding of what is meant by an evil or destructive intention and what confusion and prior confusion are as per the technical dictionary the commands themselves must also be thoroughly cleared ref hcob 9 aug 78 ii clearing commands step auditor clears and asks the question from the false purpose rd form example do you have an overt on cats on each reading sec check question get the question answered fully and the overt pulled with time place form and event and pull any justifications of the overt as part of this this is done with full sec checking tech if persistent fn or spectacular release on getting off the overt go on the overt chain with each overt question being taken to basic just pulling an overt might result in huge release and persistent fn which would be the ep for that chain you may get an fn accompanied by cog and vgis while going down an overt chain an fn indicates release point what occurs in case when you get an fn on going down an overt chain is keyout by pursuing it you resume the chain and can pull it down to its underlying evil purpose it is very important in running down these overt chains that the auditor keeps the pc on the same chain should the pc offer up some other overt or even an evil purpose disrelated to the chain being run it is just noted in the worksheet for later reference it would be an auditor error of magnitude to qanda with such an origination and pursue it in the middle of handling the overt chain that was started with ref hcob 21 mar 62 prepchecking data when to do whatnote in running an overt chain the pc may spot the evil purpose that prompted the overts on that chain if this occurs ie the pc without prompting volunteers the evil purpose or intention that underlies that overt chain and it is reading on the meter the auditor goes straight to step c step b if running the overt to the point where there is apparently earlier overt does not result in spectacular release and persistent fn the auditor asks was there some evil purpose or destructive intention that prompted you to commit that overt and if this reads he pulls the evil purpose or destructive intention the auditor is expected to put in suppress and invalidate if this question is not reading an fn and vgis is not the ep being sought in false purpose rundown procedure the ep is spectacular release anp persistent fn the pc should fn on the overt chain itself and the fn should be indicated but the procedure is continued until the full ep is reached if this question was there an evil purpose does not read this puts one back at step the original question one started with eg do you have an overt on cats is rechecked as per standard confessional procedure once that original question fns on being checked carry on with the next question listed on the false purpose rd form the purpose or intention should read when the pc gives it if it isnt reading do not pursue the item with steps c1 c2 etc step c if there is great relief and persistent fn from the pc on finding the evil purpose get the prior confusion which occurred just before that evil purpose then ask for and find the first moment of that prior confusion which led to that evil purpose this is done as follows c1 the auditor asks was there confusion that occurred just before you had the purpose the wording of the evil purpose given by the pc example was there confusion that occurred just before you had the purpose to kill cats and by using the meter the auditor finds this confusion c2 the auditor then asks when was the first moment of that confusion and gets the pc to find this step d if there is spectacular release and persistent fn on finding the first moment of that prior confusion ask the pc was there an earlier time you had the purpose the wording of the evil purpose given by the pc example was there an earlier time you had the purpose to kill cats and find this earlier time the pc had that purpose what is being looked for is not an earliersimilar purpose but an earlier time the pc had that same exact purposestep if there is spectacular release or persistent fn on finding the earlier time find the confusion prior to that time as per steps cl and c2 above and proceed to step d step f the auditor continues going earlier as per steps d and until the pc has found the first moment of the first confusion which led to that evil purpose step g if all steps through f have been done yet there is still spectacular release and persistent fn assess and handle false purpose rd correction list style of auditing the style of auditing used on the false purpose rd is level ii guiding style the auditor must be well drilled in this style of auditing to be successful with the rundown good intentions only evil or destructive intentions are picked up and handled in this auditing do not run good intentions past track do not limit the pc to this lifetime when going on overts or when asking for an earlier time he had that evil purpose these chains very often go whole track listing by following the false purpose rd procedure exactly the auditor should be able to easily find and pull the pcs evil purposes the pc is not asked listing questions nor is ln any part of the procedure but it is possible that pc could start listing and the auditor must be able to recognize and handle such situation per standard listing tech the auditor would handle an outlist per hcob 11 apr 77 list errors correction of and hcob 17 mar 74 twoway comm using wrong questions additional note on service facs upon reviewing the session worksheets the cs may find that service fac was found and fned but not fully blown in such an instance the cs can order the service fac run in the r3sc brackets in later session to fully blow it it is the auditors responsibility to ensure the item reads if it isnt reading it is not run however if one is doing false purpose rd correction list and in doing so locates reading service fac the auditor should run it out with r3sc in that session repair during chain if the auditor hits an impasse it is expected that he would apply the appropriate sec checking tools right then and there to handle murder routine checking for missed withhold use of buttons etc if there is some bog that the auditor is unable to rapidly handle using the routine sec check debug tools false purpose rundown correction list should be assessed and handledending the session when at some point in doing these steps the pc has spectacular release and persistent fn end off the session at that point and turn the folder in to the cs that would be the ep for that chain and that session in the next session the auditor rechecks the last question run on the false purpose rd form and if reading repeats steps to g on it when that question longer reads on checking one proceeds on to the next question on the form summary the importance of using this tech of purposes and considerations is immeasurable it can make the difference between complete failure and successful hatting between hellbound existence and pleasurable

prompted the overt cs requirements in order to cs the false purpose rundown one must have successfully completed the hubbard false purpose rundown auditor course and internship and must have graduated the hubbard false purpose rd cs course who can receive the rundown case prerequisites for the rundown are purification rundown and objectives the only exception would be pc who is in case category 4 per hcob 12 nov 81rd grade chart streamlined for lower grades oca all in the upper half of graph heavy drug history such pc could be put straight onto the rundown provided he had been fully educated as pc with scientology cs1 but the false purpose rd is not an introductorytype action and would not ordinarily be programed on raw meat case it would also be mistake to program someone for the false purpose rd whose track was heavily blocked off with drugs as the pc needs to be able to go if the cs has such case on his hands despite the person having completed standard purif and battery of objectives then drug rd must be done the false purpose rundown is primarily used to unstick stalled case and get it moving up the grade chart again it is not grade or level in itself where dianetic clear or any preot has stalled in his progress up the bridge the false purpose rundown can give him tremendous boost in blasting through the barriers he is faced with and make it possible for him to make it on up the line to full ot as an example pc receiving hrd auditing might plow into an inability to free up on something and not come around with handlings specific to the hrd if through folder study and assessment of prepared lists the cs discovers that the primary factor holding the pc back lies in the area of evil purposes in conflict with one or more of the precepts of the way to happiness such pc would need to be shifted over to the false purpose rdand completed on specific false purpose rd formand then returned to the hrd and the hrd carried through to completion another example would be pc receiving pts handling should it become evident that the pc is actually pretended pts per hcob 28 feb 84 cs series 118 pretended pts he can be smoothly moved over onto the false purpose rd the false purpose rd is not panacea to be used in place of other standard case debug and repair tools such as drug handlings or the expanded gf 40 it is used when the cs has determined that what is stalling case is evil purposes it is programed so as to locate and handle the evil purposes and false purposes and nonsurvival considerations after which the pc is returned to and moved on up the grade chart some repair lists such as the gf 40x contain questions which can detect evil purposes on case such questions reading would alert the cs to the need to ensure that the false purpose rd was included in the pcs future programing programing though the false purpose rundown reaches more deeply into the heart of pcs case than sec checking and incorporates brandnew tech discoveries from whole track research its csing and programing follow the same basic csing and programing rules applicable to sec checking one could for example have case that is in the middle of grade or level not in any sort of ethics trouble and running fine in session who simply originates to reg that he would like to receive the false purpose rd the reg and cs would handle this as they would any pc request for particular rundown as per hcob 12 nov 81rd grade chart streamlined for lower grades section programing the cs would not interrupt the grade the pc was in the middle of and interject the false purpose rd on the other hand one could have pc who is very evidently in need of this rd right nownot later in all such cases the cs follows hcob 28 sept 82 cs series 115 mixing rundowns and repairs and hcob 13 oct 82 cs series 116 ethics and the cs which give the rules setups before pc is begun on the false purpose rundown he must be properly set up with an fn and vgisclearing words the preclear must have full understanding of the words and commands of the false purpose rundown the pc has to have very clear understanding of what is an overt withhold an evil purpose confusion and so on beginning the rundown pc or preot beginning the rundown is first put onto the false purpose rundown basic form hcob 14 june 84 false purpose rundown series 10a other forms may be used in addition to the basic form for example pc might be field auditor in for some case cleanup and tech update he could be programed for the false purpose rundown using an auditor form if additional forms are used the questions are handled per the ag steps of the false purpose rundown procedure in any case questions are not deleted from the form any form may have questions added to it by the cs that pertain to the individual persons background and occupations and current scene ref hcob 1 mar 77 ii confessional forms ethics the false purpose rd does not take the place of standard ethics if person is currently involved in an outethics situation and is thereby harming the org or those around him in some fashion or has gross downtrending statistics as group member that person should be hauled into ethics and sorted out such handling might even include rapid hco sec check as means of getting to the root of some pt situation so that ethics can be gotten in example correct sum of money has been reported missing from the treasury cash box at the same time staff member pete begins insisting he must leave staff for one reason or another well here is an obvious candidate for some pointed investigatory questioning by skilled sec checker the cs in this case needs to get certain set of sec check questions answered fast in this illustration it would be incorrect to embark on the false purpose rd as the auditor would be bound by the hcobs to take the first question all the way through the rundown steps to persistent fn end session start another session later and take up question number two and so on it is simply matter for straight hco confessional get the questions answered and the overts pulled each to fn and thats it the false purpose rundown is tech handling handling tech before ethics is incorrect sequence once the person has been interviewed or sec checked by an maa or been before court or committee and physical universe handlings for any pt outethics have been done or are at least in progress with the persons ethics going in the false purpose rd can be used as tool to assist him to handle the situation terminatedly as long as ethics has gone in on the person one can safely start him on the false purpose rd example incorrect course supervisor elliot is found to be crashing the academy stats giving out verbal tech and caving in students with invalidation exec asks the cs to please get elliot audited on the false purpose rd right away as we must handle his destructiveness the cs goes along with this elliot isnt commeved or put through lower ethics conditions or otherwise given any ethics handling he gets several sessions but doesnt make any real case change the academy empties out reason they are trying to get tech in when he is still in the ethics band the handling is not double the number of sessions per day hes getting that would be outsequenceexample correct betsy damaged org property and falsified an fsm commission turns herself in to the ethics officer who has her write up her ows and do ethics condition formulas starting at confusion she works up through the conditions to liability and writes up overts and confronts the fact that she has been outethics she is at this point started on the false purpose rd between sessions she carries on with the rest of the condition formulas amends work studying an ethics course etc the rundown is very successful and it was successful because the sequence applied was ethics and then tech ep of single false purpose rd form the false purpose rundown similar to sec checking is an unlimited process ref hcob 2 nov 68r case supervisor class viii the basic processes in other words person could receive false purpose rd auditing any number of times with an ep achieved for each false purpose rd form done example pc has had some auditing some grades then is inactive for while falls off the bridge he is involved in outethics etc he is recovered and given false purpose rundown series 10a the basic form on completion of his auditing on this form he is doing extremely well and is ready to continue up the bridge he is sent to attest to completion of false purpose rd basic form example pc is having trouble with her marriage she is audited on the false purpose rd basic form attests to it and is then run on false purpose rd 2d form on completion of the 2d form she is doing very well and her 2d situation is fully and happily resolved she is sent to attest to completion of false purpose rd second dynamic form when the person being audited on the false purpose rundown has been successfully completed on the last question of particular form the following indicators should be present 1 the tone arm action has flattened off 2 marked shift of viewpoint accompanied by cognition about the subject that was being sec checked such as now being free from having to restrain oneself from committing harmful acts etc this would be very big embracive cognition or number of them with these phenomena present the pc may be sent to declare completion of that form if they are not present have the auditor assess false purpose rundown correction list and handle it m3 to an fning list if the ep as above is still not present the case needs to be fesed and taking care to use the data obtained from the correction list assessment programed for any needed repair and then to complete that false purpose rundown form ep of program completing whole program is different matter than completing one form stalled dianetic clear might for example have case program that consists of several false purpose rundown forms each carried to ep followed by false data stripping and then method one word clearing the overall program would be ended and the pc sent to declare to the program when the end phenomena of that program had been attained this would mean achieving the end product that program was intended to achieve as per the cs series hcobs and would include marked rise in the persons oca from the range it was in before the program was begunauditor handling the cs must ensure that his false purpose rundown auditors are well trained and interned to begin with and effectively crammed on any goofs of the procedure point which must be particularly watched for is the auditors handling of fns that occur before the full ep of chain is reached some auditors accustomed to ending off an action at the first fn cog vgis will tend to end off at an fn rather than carrying through to the full ep persistent fn cog vvgis evil purpose blown summary with this new rundown and its direct address to factors that underlie nonsurvival conduct the cs is equipped to dramatically boost pc or preot on his way up the bridge to full restoration of his power as being l ron hubbard founderhubbard communications office saint

november ad14 remimeo franchise sthil students styles of auditing note 1 most oldtime auditors particularly saint hill graduates have been trained at one time or another in these auditing styles here they are given names and assigned to levels so that they can be taught more easily and so that general auditing can be improved note 2 these have not been written before because i had not determined the results vital to each level there is style of auditing for each class by style is meant method or custom of performing actions style is not really determined by the process being run so much style is how the auditor addresses his task different processes carry different style requirements perhaps but that is not the point clay table healing at level iii can be run with level i style and still have some gains but an auditor trained up to the style required at level iii would do better job not only of ct healing but of any repetitive process style is how the auditor audits the real expert can do them all but only after he can do each one style is mark of class it is not individual in our meaning it is distinct way to handle the tools of auditing level zero listen style at level 0 the style is listen style auditing here the auditor is expected to listen to the pc the only skill necessary is listening to another as soon as it is ascertained that the auditor is listening not just confronting or ignoring the auditor can be checked out the length of time an auditor can listen without tension or strain showing could be factor what the pc does is not factor considered in judging this style pcs however talk to an auditor who is really listening here we have the highest point that oldtime mental therapies reached when they did reach it such as psychoanalysis when they helped anyone mostly they were well below this evaluating invalidating interrupting these three things are what the instructor in this style should try to put across to the has student listen style should not be complicated by expecting more of the auditor than just this listen to the pc without evaluating invalidating or interrupting adding on higher skills like is the pc talking interestingly or even is the pc talking is part of this style when this auditor gets in trouble and the pc wont talk or isnt interested higher classed auditor is called in new question given by the supervisor etcit really isnt itsa to be very technical itsa is the action of the pc saying its this or its that getting the pc to itsa is quite beyond listen style auditors where the pc wont its the supervisor or the question on the blackboard that gets the pc to itsa the ability to listen learned well stays with the auditor up through the grades one doesnt cease to use it even at level vi but one has to learn it somewhere and thats at level zero so listen style auditing is just listening it thereafter adds into the other styles level one muzzled auditing this could also be called rote style auditing muzzled auditing has been with us many years it is the stark total of trs 0 to 4 and not anything else added it is called so because auditors too often added in comments qed and aed deviated discussed and otherwise messed up session muzzle meant muzzle was put on them figuratively speaking so they would only state the auditing command and ack repetitive command auditing using trs 0 to 4 at level one is done completely muzzled this could be called muzzled repetitive auditing style but will be called muzzled style for the sake of brevity it has been matter of long experience that pcs who didnt make gains with the partially trained auditor permitted to twoway comm did make gains the instant the auditor was muzzled to wit not permitted to do thing but run the process permitted to say nothing but the commands and acknowledge them and handle pc originations by simple acknowledgment without any other question or comment at level one we dont expect the auditor to do anything but state the command or ask the question with variation acknowledge the pcs answer and handle the pc origins by understanding and acknowledging what the pc said those processes used at level one actually respond best to muzzled auditing and worst to misguided efforts to twoway comm listen style combines with muzzled style easily but watch out that level one sessions dont disintegrate to level zero crisp clean repetitive commands muzzled given and answered often are the road out not pc wanderings pc at this level is instructed in exactly what is expected of him exactly what the auditor will do the pc is even put through few do birds fly cycles until the pc gets the idea then the processing works an auditor trying to do muzzled repetitive auditing on pc who through past therapy experience is rambling on and on is sad sight it means that control is out or that the pc never got above level zero its the number of commands given and answered in unit of auditing time that gets gains to that add the correctly chosen repetitive process and you have release in short order using the processes of this levelto follow limp listen style with crisp controlled muzzled style may be shock but they are each the lowest of the two families of auditing stylestotally permissive and totally controlled and they are so different each is easy to learn with confusion its been the lack of difference amongst styles that confuses the student into slopping about well these two are different enoughlisten style and muzzled styleto set anybody straight level two guiding style auditing an oldtime auditor would have recognized this style under two separate names two way comm and b formal auditing we condense these two old styles under one new name guiding style auditing one first guides the pc by twoway comm into some subject that has to be handled or into revealing what should be handled and then the auditor handles it with formal repetitive commands guiding style auditing becomes feasible only when student can do listen style and muzzled style auditing well formerly the student who couldnt confront or duplicate command took refuge in sloppy discussions with the pc and called it auditing or twoway comm the first thing to know about guiding style is that one lets the pc talk and itsa without chop but also gets the pc steered into the proper subject and gets the job done with repetitive commands we presuppose the auditor at this level has had enough case gain to be able to occupy the viewpoint of the auditor and therefore to be able to observe the pc we also presuppose at this level that the auditor being able to occupy viewpoint is therefore more selfdetermined the two things being related one can only be selfdetermined when one can observe the actual situation before one otherwise being is delusiondetermined or otherdetermined thus in guiding style auditing the auditor is there to find out whats what from the pc and then apply the needful remedy most of the processes in the book of remedies are included in this level ii to use those one has to observe the pc discover what the pc is doing and remedy the pcs case accordingly the result for the pc is farreaching reorientation in life thus the essentials of guiding style auditing consist of twoway comm that steers the pc into revealing difficulty followed by repetitive process to handle what has been revealed one does expert trs but one may discuss things with the pc let the pc talk and in general one audits the pc before one establishing what that pc needs and then doing it with crisp repetitive auditing but all the while alert to changes in the pc one runs at this level against tone arm action paying little or heed to the needle except as centering device for ta position one even establishes whats to be done by the action of the tone arm the process of storing up things to run on the pc by seeing what fell when he was running whats being run now belongs at this level ii and will be renumbered accordinglyat ii one expects to handle lot of chronic ptps overts arc breaks with life but not session arc breaks that being needle action session arc breaks being sorted out by higher classed auditor if they occur to get such things done ptps overts and other remedies in the session the auditor must have pc willing to talk to the auditor about his difficulties that presupposes we have an auditor at this level who can ask questions not repetitive that guide the pc into talking about the difficulty that needs to be handled great command of tr 4 is the primary difference in trs from level i one understands when one doesnt by asking more questions and by really acknowledging only when one has really understood it guided comm is the clue to control at this level one should easily guide the pcs comm in and out and around without chopping the pc or wasting session time as soon as an auditor gets the idea of finite result or that is to say specific and definite result expected all this is easy pc has ptp example auditor has to have the idea he is to locate and destimulate the ptp so pc is not bothered about it and isnt being driven to do something about it as the finite result the auditor at ii is trained to audit the pc before him get the pc into comm guide the pc toward data needful to choose process and then to run the process necessary to resolve that thing found usually by repetitive command and always by ta the book of remedies is the key to this level and this auditing style one listens but only to what one has guided the pc into one runs repetitive commands with good tr 4 and one may search around for quite while before one is satisfied he has the answer from the pc needful to resolve certain aspect of the pcs case ow can be run at level i but at level ii one may guide the pc into divulging what the pc considers real overt act and having that then guide the pc through all the reasons it wasnt an overt and so eventually blow it halfacknowledgment is also taught at level iithe ways of keeping pc talking by giving the pc the feeling he is being heard and yet not chopping with overdone tr 2 big or multiple acknowledgment is also taught to shut the pc off when the pc is going off the subject level iii abridged style auditing by abridged is meant abbreviated shorn of extras any not actually needful auditing command is deleted for instance at level i the auditor always says when the pc wanders off the subject i will repeat the auditing command and does so in abridged style the auditor omits this when it isnt necessary and just asks the command again if the pc has forgotten it in this style we have shifted from pure rote to sensible use or omission as needful we still use repetitive commands expertly but we dont use rote that is unnecessary to the situation twoway comm comes into its own at level iii but with heavy use of repetitive commandsat this level we have as the primary process clay table healing in this an auditor must make sure the commands are followed exactly auditing command is ever let go of until that actual command is answered by the pc but at the same time one doesnt necessarily give every auditing command the process has in its rundown in clay table healing one is supposed to make sure the pc is satisfied each time this is done more often by observation than command yet it is done we suppose at iii that we have an auditor who is in pretty fine shape and can observe thus we see the pc is satisfied and dont mention it thus we see when the pc is not certain and so we get something the pc is certain of in answering the question on the other hand one gives all the necessary commands crisply and definitely and gets them executed prepchecking and needle usage is taught at level iii as well as clay table healing auditing by list is also taught in abridged style auditing one may find the pc being cleaned up on list question giving half dozen answers in rush one doesnt stop the pc from doing so one half acknowledges and lets the pc go on one is in actual fact handling bigger auditing comm cycle that is all the question elicits more than one answer which is really only one answer and when that answer is given it is acknowledged one sees when needle is clean without some formula set of questions that invalidate all the pcs relief and one sees it isnt clean by the continued puzzle on the pcs face there are tricks involved here one asks question of the pc with the key word in it and notes that the needle doesnt tremble and so concludes the question about the word is flat and so doesnt check it again example has anything else been suppressed one eye on pc one on needle needle didnt quiver pc looks noncommittal auditor says all right on and goes on to next question eliminating pcs possible protest read that can be mistaken for another suppress in abridged style auditing one sticks to the essentials and drops rote where it impedes case advance but that doesnt mean one wanders about one is even more crisp and thorough with abridged style auditing than in rote one is watching what happens and doing exactly enough to achieve the expected result by abridged is meant getting the exact job donethe shortest way between two pointswith waste questions by now the student should know that he runs process to achieve an exact result and he gets the process run in way to achieve that result in the smallest amount of time the student is taught to guide rapidly to have time for wide excursions the processes at this level are all ratatattat processesct healing prepchecking auditing by list again its the number of times the question is answered per unit of auditing time that makes for speed of result level iv direct style auditing by direct we mean straight concentrated intense applied in direct mannerwe do not mean direct in the sense of to direct somebody or to guide we mean it is direct by direct we dont mean frank or choppy on the contrary we put the pcs attention on his bank and anything we do is calculated only to make that attention more direct it could also mean that we are not auditing by vias we are auditing straight at the things that need to be reached to make somebody clear other than this the auditing attitude is very easy and relaxed at level iv we have clay table clearing and we have assessment type processes these two types of process are both astonishingly direct they are aimed directly at the reactive mind they are done in direct manner in ct clearing we have almost total work and itsa from pcs from one end of session to another we may have only few auditing commands for pc on ct clearing does almost all the work if he is in session at all thus we have another implication in the word direct the pc is talking directly to the auditor about what he is making and why in ct clearing the auditor hardly ever talks at all in assessment the auditor is aiming directly at the pcs bank and wants pc in front of it thinking speculating maundering or itsaing thus this assessment is very direct action all this requires easy smooth steelhandinavelvetglove control of the pc it looks easy and relaxed as style it is straight as toledo blade the trick is to be direct in whats wanted and not deviate the auditor settles whats to be done gives the command and then the pc may work for long time the auditor alert attentive completely relaxed in assessment the auditor often pays attention to the pc at all as in arc breaks or assessing lists indeed pc at this level is trained to be quiet during the assessment of list and in ct clearing an auditor may be quiet for an hour at stretch the tests are can the auditor keep the pc quiet while assessing without arc breaking the pc can the auditor order the pc to do something and then the pc working on it can the auditor remain quiet and attentive for an hour understanding everything and interrupt alertly only when he doesnt understand and get the pc to make it clearer to him again without arc breaking the pc you could confuse this direct style with listen style if you merely glanced at session of ct clearing but what difference in listen style the pc is blundering on and on and on in direct style the pc wanders off the line an inch and starts to itsa let us say with clay work and after it was obvious to the auditor that this pc had forgotten the clay youd see the auditor quick as foil look at the pc very interestedly and say lets see that in clay or the pc doesnt really give an ability he wants to improve and youd hear quiet persuasive auditor voice are you quite certain you want to improve that sounds like goal to just something some ability you know youd like to improve you could call this style oneway auditing when the pc is given his orders after that its all from the pc to the auditor and all involved with carrying out that auditing instruction when the auditor is assessing it is all from the auditor to the pc only when the assessment action hits snag like ptp is there any other auditing style usedthis is very extreme auditing style it is straightforwarddirect but when needful as in any level the styles learned below it are often also employed but never in the actual actions of getting ct clearing and assessment done note level v would be the same style as vi below level vi all style so far we have dealt with simple actions now we have an auditor handling meter and pc who itsas and cognites and gets ptps and arc breaks and line charges and cognites and who finds items and lists and who must be handled handled handled all the way as auditing ta for 2l2 hour session can go to 79 or 125 divisions compared to 10 or 15 for the lowest level the pace of the session is greater it is this pace that makes perfect ability at each lower level vital when they combine into all style for each is now faster so we learn all style by learning each of the lower styles well and then observe and apply the style needed every time it is needed shifting styles as often as once every minute the best way to learn all style is to become expert at each lower style so that one does the style correct for the situation each time the situation requiring that style occurs it is less rough than it looks but it is also very demanding use the wrong style on situation and youve had it arc break progress example right in the middle of an assessment the needle gets dirty the auditor cant continueor shouldnt the auditor in direct style looks up to see apuzzled frown the auditor has to shift to guiding style to find out what ails the pc who probably doesnt really know then to listen style while the pc cognites on chronic ptp that just emerged and bothered the pc then to direct style to finish the assessment that was in progress the only way an auditor can get confused by all style is by not being good at one of the lower level styles careful inspection will show where the student using all style is slipping one then gets the student to review that style that was not well learned and practice it bit so all style when poorly done is very easy to remedy for it will be in error on one or more of the lower level styles and as all these can be independently taught the whole can be coordinated all style is hard to do only when one hasnt mastered one of the lower level styles summary these are the important styles of auditing there have been others but they are only variations of those given in this hco bulletin tone 40 style is the most notable one missing it remains as practice style at level one to teach fearless body handling and to teach one to get his command obeyed it is longer used in practice as it was necessary to have every result and every process for each level to finalize styles of auditing i left this until last and here it isplease note that none of these styles violate the auditing comm cycle or the trs l ron hubbard lrh jwrd copyright 1964 by l ron hubbard all rights reservedflattening process lecture given on 19 march 1964 how are you today good thank you whats the date audience 19th of march 19 march 19 march 14 all right with you if i begin this lecture now what would you like to know about today anything you want to know well in view of the fact that you have preference ill talk to you about auditing and this is some of the basic knowhows of auditing somewhere along the line many an auditor lays aside some of his basic information on the subject of auditing he hides it under his emeter or something of the sort and starts doing something silly and then wonders all of sudden why hes having trouble and its very interesting how silly some of these things can be now there was subject called flattening process now this has been mostly forgotten its even part of the auditors code but it gets forgotten it gets forgotten and what you need to know about thiswhat you need to know about thisis that there are two aspects to ending process there are two aspects to this thing and they are both concerned with what are you doing with the process thats the main question what are you doing with the process well what you are doing with it tells you how to end it and how you can end it and these two things are youre trying to fix up the pc so he can be auditedthats number oneand number two you are trying to audit the pc and they give you two different endings now you can see at once that number one is basically concerned with rudiments you got present time problem well yeah i have present time problem so on so on and so on all right very good all right and iyeah i did i had an awful problem and so forth and well i guess it was mostly my fault cognition see serves as cognition all right do you have present time problem you dont get any read on the meter you dont anything and thats the end of that process what was the process well the process was just doing enough to cure the elsewhereness of the pc trying to get him into the room now if you dont know that there are two different directions in processing then you will seldom have pc in front of you to be audited and you will never finish cycle of action let show you what happens to cycle of action you start in prepcheck on gooper feathers you see you start in this prepcheck on gooper feathers thats the fuzz from peaches andyou start this thing and you got it going in the session on the twelfth and you got it going and you got one or two buttons in and the pc comes into the next session with big present time problem about angeles or something so now you run process about the present time problem in angeles and you get couple of buttons in on that but he comes to the session the next time you see with an even worse problem you see about seattle so you audit the problem about seattle so forth well thats just because you as an auditor wouldnt know the purpose of your tools you got little hatful of tools that takes out of the road what is getting in your road in trying to complete cycle of action on your pc you have business whatsoeverpresent time problem storm rain night income tax any other catastrophe seeyou have business whatsoever permitting any present time catastrophe to get in the road of your auditing well youve been presented with little kit and it says on it how to get the pc going in session and included in that is keying out knocking out destimulating getting rid of the things which have him so distracted that you cant go on now if you never use that kit you will do nothing but q and you will do nothing but leave unseat cycles of action do you see what happens you get something started in session and the pc comes into session b and hes got present time problem about something or other and hes just had big cognition that whats really wrong with his lumbosis is something or otherso you audit this please please please please what in essence have you done you have mistaken your tools made complete bust as far as what youre supposed to be doing is concerned you got this big set of tools over here you understand and they got hydraulic highpressure drills and dump trucks and all that sort of thing thats all sitting over here you see and you got this little bunch of shiny instruments of some kind or other over here and theyre just supposed to get something out of the road fast see and the pc comes in oh i had this big cognition about once upon time in angeles wofwofwog youre halfway through this prepcheck on gooper feathers you see so look looklook how idiotic it is you reach for these dump trucks and hydraulic drills over here to handle this problem about angeles oh man you know just sad its sad all you need is this little whisk broom see youre supposed to take this problem and this cognition and youre just supposed to take this little whisk broom the little kit that comes in on top about half the size of the tool box on the hydraulic drill see youre supposed to take this little kit and you take out the little brush out of it and you go fat oft oft thats the end of that process see and you put that back in again and you say all right now on the subject of gooper featherson gooper feathers in this lifetime has anything been and then were away you understand so its just basically making mistake in the purpose of the tools and therefore this leads an auditor into this kind of nonsense well hes always had troublehes always had trouble with his back so for some reason or other were doing prepcheck on his back i dont say this is good process or bad process you see but were doing prepcheck on his back and were going to end this after five minutes on cognition hey whats this now that is we have shoved the hydraulic drills and the dump trucks over here and weve picked up this little tiny kit and weve got this thing thats bothered him all of his whole lifetime and weve taken this little brush out of the kit and weve gone flick flick and nothing happens see so we kind of brush the brush off see and we take this other little thing and brush at it and nothing happens and we say well auditing doesnt worksee youre using the wrong pickax you see what i mean naw really you have to audit thing proportionately to the amount of trouble it has given the pc so there are two ways to end process and they all depend on what youre trying to do so were processing this guy on gooper feathers big prepcheck in progress its all compounded with all kinds of oddities ramifications and cognitions and its going on and on and on and on and on well now that is done only with one blunt instrument called tone arm and that tells you when it is flat and you frankly have to unflatten the whole subject before you flatten it hes got it beautifully suppressed thats tone arm flattening and today you only flatten with the tone arm while using dump trucks hydraulic drills and so forth youre handling the big case youre handling the big stuff of the case and you handle that by tone arm and that is how you end the process and that is the one way you end the process and that is auditing with an exclamation point thats mainsession auditing all done with the ta rudimenttype auditing is simply there to have an undistracted comfortable pc who is happy about sitting in the chair and getting the main performance on and thats rudimenttype processing and what ive seen of your auditors reports what ive heard of your auditors reports in recent times i may be very unjustly cruel maybe i am being cynical and sardonic professorially sneeresque but the truth of the matter is i think you are using rudiment approach to mainsession processing i think youve gotten it mixed up to the point where you take the mainsession process the big prepcheck on and youre ending it as though it were rudiment process as though you were merely trying to get the pc to sit still so he could be audited how much auditing do you think youre really going to accomplish youre not going to accomplish very much because youre using the wrong ending so you take this big thing over here youre going to get rid of this bad back you see and on back has anything been suppressed see i dont think so pc says i would sit there with my eyes rather wide open as an auditor does your back bother you or doesnt it well yes it bothers dont you think someplace in your lifetime somewhere or another in your lifetime in some place or another theres afor instance did you ever have any accidents with it when you were kid something like that you ever have anything going on you know restimulation and the guy gives away i guess i have must have because i have bad back now all right now you let repeat this question on bad back or on backnow listen to carefully now listen to this auditing question listen now on back has anything been suppressed suppressed you got that now got the question all right now go ahead and answer that question got it now huh were away for the long haul man now this is the reverse thats the main session thats the bigshow way of getting this thing on the line see thats the way of getting it all squared now get this approach just get this other brushoff approach well you say your back has been troubling you all right is that present time problemuh yes it is heh come to think about it it is well good youve had cognition thats the end of the session do i make my pernt you got to get in there and sweat youre going to see lot of auditing by lists this is moving up the first auditing by lists we saw was ow and so forth but there are many types of lists that can be designed and ive got this right on the assembly line for hgcs auditing by list its auditing by list not arc break assessments by list but you could use an arc break assessment sheet to audit by list you see but you do it differently its handled like old r2h was take each point that you get read on up with the pc see so you take this old ow this list of overts you know the old johannesburgthe joburg sec check list well do you know that by very carefully modulating your voice and making impingement on the pcbeing very careful not to make any impingement on the pc covering the questions in sort of throwaway tone of voice you seeyou ever stolen anything ah i guess not so on well thats fine thats flat nothing to that all right did you ever work under an assumed name of course you wouldnt i know that and so on so weve got that well thats flat uh its all flat its all flat its all flat oh this fellows passed his prepcheck ive seen herbie here almost just growing sparks out of his head on the subject of checking out somebody who has been sec checked on that old joburg list you see keow as an auditor you should be able to make an impingement so the instructor checking the thing out with that altitude fixes the person who is being checked out for clean sheet you see with gimlet eye and says have you ever worked under an assumed name pow the meter blows up see the poor student says why didnt that happen to see you know thats flunk flunk flunk your checksheet is not complete youve got to do this whole case over again you know whats happened to you know how come how come well he didnt bother to restimulate anything to pick up that was how come well now in mainsession auditing that which fits between the start of the body of the session and the end of the body of the session that sort of stuff is laid in with club you purposely restimulate what you are trying to pick up you dont want this to end in hurry you want this auditing to go on for while now this auditing that occurs outside of the body of the session you know in the rudiments that is just well you dont have present time problem do you good ah thank you thats the approach you use then you restimulate nothing well you look pretty good how are you doing ah youre doing all right all right is it okay with you if we start the body of the session i know you dont have that in your model session right now but im putting it down here as emphasis and maybe it ought to be put into model session to show you where the club fitsbut first before that starts you see thats just well all right well your tone arm is nice and loose here tone arm seems to be low rather and your needles nice and loose and everything seems to be okay ah nothing worrying you is it all right all right good good good im glad of that yeah all right oh you say you do have present time problem what was it about ah oh yeah yeah all right yeah all right all right good good all right well hows the present time problem now that didnt read all right now now is it all right with you if we get to work here on this subject of gooper feathers that we were prepchecking now you had any thoughts about this since the last time i audited you there you know have you gone over this in your mind anyany improvement at all on the subject of anything so forth oh you have huh restimulation see getting his mind getting his main concentration oh you have huh oh is that so yeah yeah yeah yeah you tell you used totelling you used to have nightmares about this did you have nightmare about it or anything like that last night oh yeah yeah is that so well lets see weve gotten along here pretty well down on the subject weve gotten on to suggested here pretty well and i think your last answer to this had something to do with what was your last answer to that oh yeah yeah yeah well that was on the subject yeah all right well heres the next question on that heres the next question on that on gooper feathers has anything been suggested you got that question all right good now on gooper feathers has anything been suggested all right and here we go watching that tone arm its just sitting there taking down the tone arm reads and keeping the pc going and the pc finally says well that isnt any more thereit just thatthere isnt any more l havent got any more answers to that im protesting the question all right is this question being protested im sorry theres read there ah now what else might we have run into on this you might run into something else there that you havent told or something like that did i miss an answer or something of this sort oh i did miss suggest answer oh all right well good thank you im glad we got that cleared up and heres your next question on gooper feathers has anything been suggested get the idea youre just keeping it in there man keeping that in the groove keeping that grinding on and on and on see tone arm action when do you leave it needle isnt flashing around anymore and tone arm isnt blowing down on this particular subjectwell lets unload tone arms have tendencies to go very very quiet i give you something lice twentyminute test thats little bit cruel on the pc sometimes an auditor can tell when tone arm is flat it isnt moving also when you tend to flatten one of these things the meter starts to look gummy you can tell when theyre flat shift to your next question youre trying to cover subject in the main body of the session and you are trying to recover pc for your session in the rudiment approach so realize that there are two targets for auditing in session and that gives you two different endings you dont want this pc to be dispersed out of what you are already doing so you put in rudimenttype approach since the last time i audited you has anything been suppressed well you spend fifteen twenty minutes getting in those since bmrsoh marvelous marvelous thats good now you can start in your main sessionbut it is not with the same approach youre not doing the same thing i could be very cruel at this point and say well i want to congratulate most auditors because theyve gotten up to point now to where they are ready to learn how to run the body of session having handled rudi thatd be shade too cruel wouldnt it bitter bitter but i watch this i watch this consistently and i notice that auditors vary in this approach and they very often start treating bodyofsession material as though theyre just rudiments and believe they dont do very much for pcs in fact they damage pcs how by leaving unflat cycles of action if you really want to lash pc around the telegraph pole man just start cycle of action after cycle of action and dont flatten any of them you just get enough cycles of action unflat on your pc and hell be in mess let give you some idea of how to really sock pc lets take class vi not because we have to reach into that zone because that is the most brutal area where things stand up in tremendously bold relief you make some mistakes in that area and you know it you get the evidence immediately the little men inthe ambulance backs up to the door dont you see and its quite embarrassing the neighbors talk you start to sort out goal but you dont sort it out and then you get interested in goal b but you never bring it to conclusion and then you wonder if something is happening with the meter because you dont seem to be able to get any reads in other words you really cant think of anything to ask the pc that gets read on it so you start asking some questions about the emeter but you really dont clean up the subject of the emeter dont you see and then you wonder if theres any wrong goals that the person has had that are troubling him but you really dont find all of those and clean those up and believe about that time the pc practically goes straight through the bottom of the chair he will be dealing with wog and hell be turning on pain he will be turning on dizziness the corners of the room will start going out of plumb on him he cant focus the auditor the winds of space start blowing his eyeballs into the back of his skull you know youve done it and what happened its just incomplete cycle of action followed by an incomplete cycle of action followed by an incomplete cycle of action followed by an incomplete cycle of action you really didnt do anything wrong you just didnt do anything complete and that all by itself will wind pc up in ball well now thats very exaggerated level but things stand out in such basrelief at that level that it brought around to inspecting the lower levels of auditing and i found out that the lower levels of auditing are peculiarly subject to this but its not so dramatic in other words it takes while for it to sneak up and you dont see it all in twenty minutes of auditing you see you see it over years worth of auditing you get lots less action and the pc is just feeling sort of groggy these days he just doesnt feel too good and so forth well if you were to take almost any pc in the place and say has any process ever been left unflat on you and you just ran that as process dont q and with him and try to flatten any of the processes just run process has any process ever been left unflat on you and youll see your pc start brightening up somebody whos had quite lot of auditing hell start brightening up even though it is not serious on his case it is quite capable of producing considerable improvement or result hell give you the considerations concerning it just as matter of fact of the question but its just repetitivequestion process now what do you think happens when you start prepcheck on gooper feathers and shift over to bad back before gooper feathers are flat and get into bad back and then get into this andget into that all kinds of oddball things start occurring the pcs ability to be prepchecked starts bloc ing up amongst other things pc cant be prepchecked easily anymore the auditing tool starts getting all blunted up and messed up oh i think thats quite remarkable the tool has been abused now you can put in bad comm cycle with an auditing tool also like prepchecking and get the tool very badly blunted up so that you can actually prepcheck prepchecking see prepchecking just put in all the prepcheck buttons on prepcheck on prepchecking and 80 forth you can do this several ways on suppress has anything been suppressed has anything been invalidated you know put in all the buttons on suppress there are several ways you could go about this just as general subject put in all the buttons you see as each button its quite remarkable ive seen case all hung up in mess on the subject of goals checkout and so forth till somebody was suddenly bright enough to say on suppress has anything been suppressed all of sudden its an operating button again quite remarkable revelation but the basic reason the button goes out is an incomplete cycle of action now you should as an auditor be very very well aware of this thing called cycle of action it predicates this one basis that things have point where they start that they have period when they continue and that there is point when they end blow that is cycle of action its your createsurvivedestroy cycle of action its start change and stop actually you could put it down probably less effectively as philosophic definition but more workably as start and an action and stop see start and an action and stop you could be more explicit by saying start an action which then continues and then stop and that is cycle of action that is just in that whole line life is probably cruel because things seldom stop there is great deal of thought put into continuation continuance is one of the bugs that thetans are addicted to they like to see things continue and youve got actions going right now which began with the beginning of the universe and nobody has stopped them since see theyve never been stopped and that alone gives the longevity and mass of the physical universe actions which were begun were never unbegun you know or stopped time itself is probably some basic agreedupon postulate which nobody has ever thought the end of so youve still got time you see now these things of course are done by postulate but at low level an individual is subject to them and any case is subject to the cycle of action maybe he will get up to point sooner or later where he is above the cycle of action oh i say maybe yes undoubtedly class vi weve got all the stuff to put him there and you get such oddities as guy being able to move around in time this is one of the more peculiar aspects of highlevel action youre not fixed in time span you can widen your time span almost at will and there doesnt have to be anything there in the past time but you can be in that pasttime period and so on it gives you all sorts of involvements for instance you can be at the event while it is occurring by having been in the future and come back to it and undo it before it goes on its very confusing well because its confusing and because its upsetting lets take two armies fighting each other and army attacks army b so therefore army b knows that if it is in this position where it is being attacked at the time it is attacked why then it will be attacked so the thing to do is to be in yesterday and not march to that place and we very soon have generals out of job we have various things going awry game becomes very difficult to follow and traceso the thetan settles for the simpler life and that is what is is what will be will be inshallah see fate well what theyre involved with therekismet and everything else theyre just involved with the inevitability of the cycle of action fatalism is the total subjugation of the individual by the cycle of action what will be will be if he starts going in the car he will then go down the road and eventually the car will stop well they even have it rigged that way theyve got oil prices up to point where itll run out of fuel and theyve got tires to point where they wear out and the time payments will catch up with him and the skip men will come and bet him something will stop this car in the main universe by friction and other conflicts particle traveling is acted upon until it stops in other words its allbelow the level of time everything is sort of geared up to follow in along the time if an action begins i mean single individual action not postulate like timeif it begins it is sort of geared up to stop now there are some of these things have not stopped as i said moment ago which might be the composition of matter and such things as that but even those things have tendency to deteriorate as they go along now the point im trying to make here is that everybody is used to and in agreement with this thing called cycle of action you arent using it in your auditing because it is true i spoke to you the other day about gradient realities well its one of the realities and it reaches pretty high at case level its reality which fades out just before person can put some universal laws under control i mean its way up so the reality of the pc that you process is tied in from the very lowest to fairly advanced level with this thing called cycle of action and because the pcs reality is tied in with it violations of it bring about an unreality so if you want to tell him what can you find unreal just start busting his cycle of action as part of the auditing start process dont end it get process going drop it and the next thing you know he starts going all unreal on you youve got an agreement with him that he is going to get processed in certain direction to certain distance and then thats going to all come about hes still sitting in the middle of his bank not yet having asised all the material available on this and suddenly there he is parked there is nothing more done about it and hes got this mass now and these questions which he finished upfinished up with since he didnt finish upand he carries those on over into the next process and then he never gets that finished so he carries on both of these now into the next process and he never gets that finished so he carries all three into the next process and youll find yourself all of sudden dealing with pc who is unflat on four processes well he wont smoothly asis anything only for this reason because it looks very complicated to him its getting more and more complicated hes not getting free hes getting bogged down his idea of freedom is finishing up some cycles of action and let assure you that that is very very good observation well within his zones of agreement he knows that if he finishes his work he can quit see these are realities their truth iswell its very funny to tell you this but their truth is limited but everybody agrees with it so therefore when you start snarling somebody up you have these two factors the mass he is mixed up with in his mind is restimulated but not asised so hes left with some mass hanging around and he carries this incomplete cycle of action over into the nextbegun cycle of action and he will start accumulating mass and start accumulating upsets and hell start getting losesnow the idea of win is very closely tied in with the cycle of action very intimately this fellow wins ordinarily by having accomplished something you could even win to the point of having gone to point and then not having been destroyed when reaching that point so therefore you would have accomplished something you could even have negative approach you see well ive accomplished something i came downtown today and didnt get killed see even at that low level thats win now where does all that come from now what is the upper echelon to what ive just been talking to you about what is the upper echelon of this lets really have an esoteric flight here it comes under the heading of intention intention is part of the comm cycle but intention is senior to the comm cycle intention the ability to intend an intention contains in it every power the thetan hasevery power the thetan has the ability to throw lightning bolt the ability to hold something in position the ability to make something continue the ability to do away with something strength accomplishment power wit abilitythese things are all wrapped up on the one common denominator of intention intention when youre just halfoh well when youre just halfshot as thetan and youve almost had it and you think youre on your last legs not in the condition youre in i mean but pretty bad off you know youre not yet wearing body youre probably packing around an effigy you have to be recognized and people have to say good morning to you or youre unhappy this kind of thing youre pretty plowedin with mass your own actual gpms are wrapped around your gullet your intention this is lowlevel skill this is not highlevel skill is quite good enough to for instance intend this crayon into the air in front of you to intend this emeter over to the other side of the desk this is lowlevel stuff im talking to you about guy is oh practically on his last legs when he can do this answering telephone one simply intends the telephone up into his vicinity where he is listening and can talk he intends it off the cradle up to his ear and intends it back onto the cradle giving you straight stuff now this is almost recent time youve been able to do this in recent times it baffles you sometimes when piece of mest does not instantly and immediately obey you but thats simply intention thats lowlevel intention im not talking to you now about something very esoteric this would sound very startling and make newspaper reporter turn gray overnight but intend him in horizontal position outside the door five feet off the pavement and let him stay there for while and cool off i doubt hed write it because he of all people knows he couldnt do it but there is intention you get what i mean now by intention you intend something to happen and it happens the ability to intend and that is 811 there is to thetans power there is more to his power than that there is his ability to throw lightning bolt to set house on fire to make the roof fly off to turn planet upside down that is everythinghis intention so all you have to do to weaken thetan is to get in the road of his intentionsfoul up his intentions now if you can foul up thetans intentions you can weaken him now what do i mean by weaken him person picks up on monday fivehundredpound weight but on tuesday can only pick up threehundred pound weight between monday and tuesday he has been weakened right do you understand its this graphic its not the philosophic derivation of his morals become weak dont you know well on monday he can throw raw energy beam hundred yards on tuesday morning he can only throw one ten feet between monday and tuesday he has become weakened thats what i mean by weakened see and the say that is done is to give him loses on his intentions all youve got to do is foul up or counter or blunt his intentions and he becomes weakerweakness and strength in thetan and of course well his weakness is the only thing that holds him entrapped weakness is the only thing that keeps masses pulled in on him weakness is the only thing that keeps him pinned down you can only trap thetan when he is weak and you need only really be afraid of things that are very weak with of course the proviso of certain magazine editors we skip them leave them out of that category because theyve had it the main thing that we have to watch in this then in auditing is that we do not weaken the actual intention of the pc by blunting his actual intentions and in order to do this we must differentiate between his reactive intention his dramatization in other wordsand his own intention so we have the subdivision of the pc and his bank person who is dramatizing during an arc break actually is not intending anything they say this is simply bank dramatized do you see its all bank dramatized roar roar roar roar roar he isnt intending anything that falls out then thats recording or something going off you see that is not his intention so we dont say that everything somebody must do we must validate you start validating the bank 100 percent and youve had it as an auditor but were talking about now the actual intentions of the person he intended to have twohourandahalf session and you give him threehourandahalf session you have blunted his intention he intended to get off this stuff about aunt hattie and you called the process flat long before it were flat so therefore you have blunted his intention you cant ruin pc im just talking about how smoothly you can audit you understand this because youre not going to spoil anybodys intentions or cave them in by auditing let assure you see but you can key in incidents on him and so forth where his intention is very badly blunted by simply taking an auditing cycle of action and not completing it in other words he intends so forth you intend so on and there you go and you finish it off and you wind it up youve completed cycle of action that intention has gone through complete cycle of action then if you interrupt it halfway intention goals for the session goals for the session heres good point you get pc to put in goals for the session thats actually participating intention so i always work hard on giving pc goals for the session i almost work harder to give the pc his goals for the session than i do to give him session see i can give anybody session and cure anything or straighten them up see that doesnt worry but this pc sitting down there has just got through saying to feel better about my lumbosis ill put that in i wont take up the body of the session till eve got the oddball goal out of the road but any pc that is trying to break or stop or not go through with fattening and so forth putting in bunch of sideways goals could actually stop you from auditing or completing your cycle of action and roll himself up in ball reactive barrier can arise out of this situation so he puts in lot of oddball goals that dont have anything to do about the price of the thing ill still clean them up ill still clear them up but i take out the little kit you know the little kit with the little whisk broom i get those out of the road and notice the pc apparently has present time problem this is in r6 auditing this is not ordinary auditing i mean this is therefore any kind of auditing if youd pay attention to the pcs goals for the session at r6 when youre totally capable of getting hundred ta divisions you see in two and half hours well good heavens how much would it apply down at the levels when hes getting fifteen in twoanda halfhour session and lucky to get it see so this very definitely appliespersons got goals for the session id look those things overpicketypowpow hes got present time problem here hahahahaho hohoho lets get the considerations for that present time problem well youi notice you have present time problem here what considerations have you had about that all right thats fine okay and you had bad neck been bothering you and so forth all right is that an r6 phenomenon is that from goals and yeah doesnt seem to be from goals gpm ah something else seems to have gone on here with regard to this what was the first you noticed this all right good all right well lets date this pow pow pow were doing about four and fiveminute process dont you see i mean were driving it right straight along the line we got the pc on it were just brushing this thing off see getting this out of the road but were doing this other thing were giving him the goal for the session see oh we got that out of the road we dated it the somatic blew and so forth you have to be quick on this kind of auditing hes made that goal for the session right there i havent even started the body of the session the session now iswith since mid ruds and everything else that has happenedis only thirtyfive minutes deep and were away into the body of the session on what i want to do hes already made his goals for the session you want to see the good indicators come in haha make sure the person gets any pt problem type of goal for the session and so forth get him win on it in the first five minutes of play then get down to something important oh yeah you say this takes very skilled very fast very tricky auditing you really have to know what youre doing to be able to get rid of somebodys lumbosis thats been keeping them up all night in the first ten minutes of the session whos getting rid of it we just keyed it out we just gave it swift kick so it isnt bothering the pc made his goal for the session too therefore his intention level is up so therefore hes more powerful in the session therefore he can look at his bank better see this thats why person makes progress while he has ptp his intentions are being blunted or overlooked and so he cannot rise superior to his bank so he makes progress what is ptp it is postulatecounterpostulate you could just as easily interpret this as intentioncounterintention you will not find present time problem where persons intentions have not been blunted something is fighting his intention and it seems to him that its of equal magnitudeintention versus intention he has an intention somebody else has another intention these two intentions lock together and you get present time problem it tends to hang up in time and thats how you get time hangup basic time hangup intentioncounterintention lets look at class v for momentnot because were teaching anything about class v but because this is marvelous field of demonstration why do you think in the helatrobus and the trillionstwo and other implant areas oppose was in vogue it isnt even the actual gpm the actual gpm is subvolitional intention which is way downstairs it goes in with an ax everything inevitably brings about something else doesnt matter what happens if something else is going to be brought about its very apathetic very low but these brisker levels more ambitious levels how did they knock out the power of thetan how could they possibly do anything to thetan well the implant means by using key goals like to go to stay to move to go away to forget to rememberthis type of goalall mucked up with innumerable variations of that goal serve as key intentions so when he intends to remember he of course will get nix to remember hell get an automatic and instant blunting of intention that was the intention of the implant very far from flawlessly works thetans transcend this stuff rather easily but therethere is the woof and warp of implants and how they are done and why anybody setting up implants that are going to be successful would simply blunt intentions blunt intentions thats the whole thing so he says to move he immediately gets not to move see and then the implant gpms interact one against the other so if he gets the idea to stay then he feels he has to move and if he gets the idea to move then he feels hes got to stay so they counteroppose each other too so opposition or oppose is the keynote to an implant and this is the only way theyre aberrative there is other reason bah the amount of mass andmassmass the thetan only keeps the mass of these things around because he cant get rid of them and hes automatically creating it and hes doing other things but an implant gpm has too little mass to be very upsetting to the individual but it upsets his ideas so he gets the idea to go and he gets the counterintentionhits him in the face the way they civilize child for instance all they have to do is break all his intentions somebody talking about spoiling child or upsetting child thats very silly to say that by giving child everything you spoil the child or by being nice to child you spoil child theyre just drawing longbow they couldnt be further from the mark its blunting every intention the child has and remember that there are reactive intentions and that there are analytical intentionstwo varieties so we let the reactive intention have its way child cries screams and throws tantrum we instantly give him what he wanted that validated the reactive intention the child wants to sit quietly and look out the window analytical intention 30 we get him busy doing something else by the time weve crossed these thingsin other words validated the reactive intentions by rewarding the child and obeying the reactions and blunted every analytical intention the child haswell of course have weakened the thetan becomes susceptible to illness and that sort of thing simply because masses move in on hum i mean person who is weakened is unable to hold anything at distance so everything collapses on him you understand what im talking about this is terribly simple and it evades understanding just by being in itself so idiotically simple so your pc has two types of intentions and one is totally reactiveits just dramatization so we wont call it an intention we call it dramatization every time your pc dramatizes you let him have his way and every time your pc pleasantly nicely wants to do something analytically you blunt his intention after while youre going to have your pc practically spinny on the subject of auditing reaction he wont be able to handle things in session youll find the pc isnt cogniting you find this and that and so forth theres many an auditor pays attention to the pc until the pc starts arc breaking now the auditor knows something is happening so he decides to do something for the pc because the pc has arc broken but actually the pc has been sitting there auditing splendidly beautifully and smoothly his pacing is very nice and he sort of timidly brings up the fact that hed really like toyou know hed really like to look at this engram hes seen there just moment longer he brings this up he says its bothering him little bit he doesnt quite know what its all about its little bit of an origin you see it isnt going to take any time you dont give him an additional restimulation you say yes all right all right well whats it all aboutsomething like thatsoandso and soandso and soso all right thats fine you get that out of the road and you go on dont you see but every time he says well i uh i dont know i dont really i dont really have any more answers to that question uh i uh well youre damn well going to answer the question see lois is getting on to the borderline of intention dont you see so he kind of gets upset one way or the other but the auditor doesnt pay any attention to whats going on there weve got an uncomfortable situation pcs intention cycles of action what hes doing and so forth are all kind of getting mixed up and the auditors paying attention to this because the pc is still in fairly sweet frame of mind you see when the pc finally losesyou understand pc doesnt turn nasty pc gets overwhumped by his bank thats always the case and the pc own intentions having been blunted badly then loses control and the bank powered up overwhelms him and takes over control and on an automaticity starts blowing its head offgoing into all sorts of dramatization of one kind or other even though its just the dramatization of apathy bank is in dramatization well of course the auditor acts thats what we know as acting too late catching slipping situation too late gives you these explosive arc breaks they generally telegraph themselves way ahead but whats happened there is really the pc has become overwhelmed by his own bank youre not watching the pcs intentions now youre watching the pcs dramatization but you dont do anything about the pcs intentions you will eventually get the pcs dramatizations thats quite an elementary situation its one which an auditor should understand now i spoke to you some time ago in lecture about what is win and what is lose just going over that cursorily win is accomplishing what you intend to accomplish or accomplishing the notaccomplishment of something you didnt intend to accomplish you get the idea you intended not to have any arc breaks and in the session you nothad any arc breaks you understand well thats win see and lose is just exactly the reverse just exactly the reverse things you intended not to happen happened and things which you intended to happen didnt happen thats lose and thats all win is and thats all lose is thats all so when we compare this situation to auditing we find out then that the auditors intention is valuable to the session and because hes less susceptible to dramatization from the bank in the pcsince hes not really at all greatly susceptible to the bank of the pc its pcs bank its not hitting the auditor and because the auditor is capable of standing outside that perimeter of potential dramatization the auditors intention in session is therefore senior to the pcs intention but if the pcs intention is totally neglected with regard to session we again get weakening of the pc and an encroachment of dramatization so the auditor intends to flatten off suchandsuch process and the pc intends to take care of something else he has thought about overnight well that pc has been subject to dramatization because of restimulation youd be very foolish not to flatten off the original process because that was the original intention wasnt it that wasnt finished and yet the pc wants to do another one well this is going to hang him up with an intention loss whether he likes it or not and the auditor standing outside this perimeter of course can complete the cycle of action on which he began and that gives win to the auditor and the pc you follow this pcs analytical intentions then are valuable to session and they are very often expressed in the goals of the session and they are cared for accordingly thats the way it isnow he intends to get certain distance and actually down deep he really intends to become ot hes never investigated this its running far too deep but way down underneath all the layers of godhelpus he intends to get to be ot thats for sure in other words he intends to recover he doesnt even though have enough analytical awareness of where he is going to know what he intends he intends freedom and return of power which is to say he intends freedom and return of intention well he now can go all the way he now can go all the way that is well within grasp if he walks along certain path and doesnt keep jumping off the cliff and so forth why he will arrive well therefore the intention for him to arrive is very sotto voce in him and an auditor with some experience and action on this intending him to arrive the auditors intention is actually more reliable than the pcs even though the pcs is more deep and fundamental than the auditors why because every time he starts coming up the line this pc is going to shortcircuit into some direction fail to complete cycle of action someplace leave rock in the road somewhere or another and hell get some wild idea andwell ive seen it happen man this pc is supposed to be prepchecked on something or other in order to get something or other accomplished so that he wont always be coming to session with this gross ptp about his domestic affairs or something like this dont you see and somebody has decided to get this out of the road so they can proceed and hes thrown that all sideways and hes spent the night listing goals see well in the first place is the reason he listed goals had to do with the fact that his intention about his marital problem was being blunted so case advance is now reinterpreted into some kind of an escape from his present time problem so he doesnt know which way hes going he doesnt know what cycle of action hes on is he on the cycle of action of completing his present time problem with his domestic affairs or is he on the cycle of action of becoming free being well hes on the cycle of action of becoming free from his wife hes not on the cycle of action of becoming free being well something weird goes on when youve got this kind of thing happening hes on small perimeter hes on little cycle of action and hes using huge cycle of action potential to accomplish this little cycle of action you see hes using 20millimeter machine gun to shoot grasshopper see and of course he cant shoot this grasshopper because actually you cant get the muzzle depressed enough you get this kind of yet hes got freedom mixed up with escape he wants to fix it so he doesnt have to confront things anymore all this kind of thing goes on and all that can get in an auditors road hugely im talking to you now about fine points you know you know in spite of all this you can blunder through you know im just giving you some fine points here you could get there somehow prepchecking the rough edge off of persons lumbosis and somehow or another this and somebody puts him together with sticky plaster because too many unflat processes exist on the case and then somehow or another you finally find gpm and you get enough tone arm action out of the gpm toyou get the ideato sort of cancel out some of the other sins and ills that have occurred in it youd get there somehow you could muddle through but these are the fine points these are the fine points of the business hes as weak as his intentions are blunted he will become as strong as his intentions are free the greatest bolderbacker of intentions is the person himself because he puts himself in danger every time he has dangerous intention i think your international champions in boxing let us say or something like that probably have an awful time they probably educate themselves right out of hard punch merely because they are walking through the society all the time itd be very very dangerous indeed for them to uncork hard punch in the bideawee cocktail bar see thats supposed to be reserved only for the stage see so heres an intention that is becoming narrowed and specialized they eventually become quite weak im not talking about something that you could measure by the diameter of the biceps the number of footpounds of punch deliverable you see theyre having to withhold this intention this intention has got to be very much pulled down theyve got to condition this intention if they have trainer and manager that tells him now only hit with your right hand during moments of something or other some fellow across as their opponent in the ring could stand there with his guard dropped the persons left hand in perfectly good condition to deliver the final blow that would end the whole match you see and yet would never strike the blow see his intention his intention now is far far too specialized and channeled and you ask fellow what restraints do you have to put on yourself in your everyday living youre going to get almost roaring automaticity see he has been taught that his intentions are dangerous to him hes been taught that he can get dangerous intention hes been taught as well that his intentions can get out of his control and he can accidentally intend something so every once in while you have somebody walking around in circles theres been fire in birmingham or something of the sortand there will be somebody walking around in circles worrying because he might have let an intention out from underneath his hat and started the fire in birmingham see and hell actively worry about this you see whereas the guy couldnt even warm up cup of coffee if he had stove see but thetans become very worried about this sort of thing and they become very protestive and one of the big games is to make somebody protest his intentions you see what are your intentions toward sir you see thats the standard girls question clarify your intentions and so forth wasnt it voltaire that won every argument before he even began it he said somebody had to define his terms before he could argue with him well thats very interesting but if you carried that little further youd find the guy would get so busy defining his terms that his intention to have anything else happening would be nil and you wouldnt find much of debate in progress here dont you see you must define your intentions or what youre doing society does this to us in scientology fortunately they dont know what our intentions are and frankly weve never really sat down and mapped it all out as to what our intentions should be which is probably the way it should be dont you see because therefore theres nothing to blunt nobody has ever expressed the matter sort of lazy way to go about it but they have all sorts of assignments to us in scientology as to what our intentions are they wouldnt believe our real intentions so well probably make them but we lose for instance world without insanity or war or something like that its perfectly valid intention well they consider this too highflown what are their intentions so they assign whole bunch of false intentions to the scientologist see well let them thats what makes their attacks look so silly because of course theyre fighting on set of intentions which dont exist so it makes them look like theyre walking around talking to shadows or something like that it leaves us completely free and rather unwound into the battle actually any broad intention we have is quite clearcut appears in many books but its way over their heads you see they cant figure they could blunt that intention because thats well you take world without insanity you take this as an intention well thats good roads and good weather of course very unreal unaccomplishableanybody whod look this overso therefore couldnt have anything to do with that one of these days theyre going to be awful surprised seewell have that intention moving see i even spent little time in on how would you handle vast numbers of insane and so forth see out of that original speculation we got scientology processes by the way i mean theyre just an offshoot of that id hate to have to confess that to you but that was the body of research that came out of which is just destimulate the environment give stable datum for the environment so intention intention here is everything in case recovery if person is regaining his power or ability or something like that hes merely removing out of his road what blunts his intentions and what has blunted his intentions and thats really all hes doing so if we look this over with very critical eye we find out that the auditor going through almost any sincere job of auditing even if clumsily donewill inevitably unblunt some of this pcs intentions they will be unblunted one way or the other and were talking about the upper esoterics of auditinghow to keep auditing from blunting the pcs intentions you see well an intention is cycle of action any time you say do you add time so doingness intention or accomplishingness intention has time added to it the moment that you add time or doingness to the thing youve got cycle of action so an intention is at its highest echelon totally independent of time and the cycle of action intention is simply pure intention and is not necessarily tied into time at all you could just as easily make postulate in 1492 or in 2658 as you could in 1964 there isnt any intimate and immediate relationship but as the individual has gone downscale he has of course more and more associated his intentions with cycle of action you make the intention and then certain thing occurs or the intention goes across space as in communication you seeand then it arrives at the other end and certain result therefore takes place at the other end so we have cycle of action we have the intention now worked into time and space so the intention originally is totally free of time and space and has nothing to do with it and in actual fact time and space have as their only reality the fact that they are made out of an intention doesnt matter whether this intention is an agreedupon intention or otherwise there is basic intention which gives us time and space so it is actually superior to all mest and youll have your fingers on something that doesnt have to be mest but as it comes downscale this becomes expressed to the pc particularly at the lower levels of case lower levels of cases this fellows having dreadful time hes just staggering through life man hes hitting both walls and walking backwards and falling on his knees every time he turns around well that individuals agreement with cycle of action means that an intention there are intentions anymore there however might be cycle of action see the intention has disappeared out of the cycle of action and you simply have this cycle of action when he goes down any further he goes down into pure chaos so therefore you can take person who is having terrible time and tell him to touch the wall and youve shown him an intention and shown him cycle of action you can shortsession him you can start session run session and end session ten minutes worth see then start another session run session and end session all youre doing is showing him cycle of action cycle of action cycle of action the auditing command cycle of action the auditors command the acknowledgment and the answer the acknowledgment its cycle of action all youre showing him is youre demonstrating the existence of cycle of action cycle of action cycle of actionany one of these things as they come through and eventually the reason he cognites is his own intentions start to free up out of the obsessive mestiness of it all and he starts seeing things and he starts coming back to battery he starts adding up whats going onwell now the only way the auditor can get in his road in all this of course is to foul up his own cycle of actionthe auditors cycle of action now we could foul this up one of the ways of fouling it up is to leave processes unflat or misinterpret what were doing with process were trying to get rid of this fellows lumbosisa lifetime problem hereso we treat it like its rudiment we give it little dustoff and so forth well misapplication of tools well youre not going to get the intention clear because that back is not going to get better under that kind of treatment so the auditors intention is blunted the pc s intention to have better back is blunted everybody loses under that situation so our intention on the thing laid out if were going to have wins then we must validate analytical intention knock out dramatization and be very consistent with completing cycles of action even though its an auditing command or getting rid of his lumbosis and those are the factors with which you are dealing the auditor must flatten process within the reality of what he is processingin other words within the reality of whats he got here hes got little problem thats been generated since last night so he stops auditing the back which has been going on for nine or ten years and starts using heavy artillery on this little problem that came up last night well he didnt complete the big cycle of action hes trying to make too much out of this other cycle of action hes misapplying his tools in other words hes working on this bad back and the only reason he gets last nights problem out of the way with his little dust kit is well just so he can go on and complete this bigger cycle of action you got to keep the pc on the main chance you got to flatten the big stuff that you start youre doing problems intensive i dont think you could prepcheck it in under ten or twelve hours if you did proper assessment on the thing youdten or twelve hours id think thatd be longa short haul to cover everything let us say from 1949 july on up to present time well how do you make it run that long well it isnt how long you make it run how much is there there well that depends on how much you impinge on the pc that depends on how much you make the pc work at it that depends on how hard you sweat over this particular action and how clean you keep the pc from arc breaks and how clean you keep his interim session difficulties the betweensession difficultiesfrom interrupting you from doing cycle of action and for that kind of thing weve got little brushoff things we just destimulate this stuff the rudiment approach then the mainsession approach and therefore we can achieve the intentions of the pc we can achieve the intentions of the auditor we flatten process within the reality of what is there to be flattened and how much is there to be flattened how much are we tackling here well the fellow has always had little problem that had to do withhes always had this problem and 80 forth he thinks hes inferior well thats great thats great now youre going to handle this with rudiments process i dont think so the individual comes into session and he stubbed his toe outside the door and it hurts youre going to give this fourteenhour prepcheck so the magnitude of what youre trying to handle the duration of time of what youre trying to handle to large degree establishes how much time it is going to take you and how much heavy action you will have to take on it and how thoroughly youll have to flatten it and those are the establishing factors but when all else is worked out youre trying to complete cycle of action and on the very badoff case that is all you can do that is the most basic process there is is simply get cycle of action completed and i imagine that an auditing question like this what did you have to eat for breakfast guy is having an awful time practically blindstaggers type pc see and two and half hours later with great deal of twoway comm and discussion and so forth he has answered theauditing question it sounds incredible doesnt it and yet you know the pc would have win pc would have big win you went in too high it should have been did you come to the session that wouldnt have taken so long to do but if you can get an auditing cycle completed you get win and if you dont get an auditing cycle completed whatever else you look at or what you think you are looking at youre going to get lose elementary as that so when the whole thing is squared away what youre trying to do as an auditor depends on what youre trying to handle in the pc the order of magnitude in terms of time and trouble duration and so forth and that determines on what kind of flattening you use and the flattening of the main chance the big longterm one and so forth is done very arduously indeed its all done by ta its never done by anything else but ta and of course your little stuff that youre trying to get out of the road so you can keep on with your main action is just rudimentstype kickoff and you just flatten it to cognition or till it isnt bothering the pc and its out of the road and youre away you see why this is now you see how this is all right i hope you can have some wins on this thank you audience thank you very much thank youhubbard communications office saint hill

cannot do three major actions in row in the same ten minutes this was the bug behind quickie grades 0 to iv in one session this also occurred in power when it was run all in one day the auditor would attain bona fide full dial fn the pc was still cogniting still in big win the auditor would clear the next process command he would see an fn he would clear the next process command and see an fn but it was the same fn result was that processes 2 and 3 were never run on the case this is really what is meant by quickie grades in 1958 we got real releases you could not kill the fn for days weeks several processes had this effect todays real clear also goes this way you couldnt kill the fn with an axe by running lot of level zero processes for instance you can get real swinging unkillable fn it not only gets to the examiner it comes in at the start of the next days session now if in one session you ran all of level zero and went on up to level one you would just be auditing persistent fn the pc would get benefit at all from level one hes still going wow on level zero if you ran level zero with one process that got big wide floating fn and then ran level i ii iii and iv you would have just level zero release the pcs bank was nowhere to be found so next week he has problems level i or service fac level iv and he is only grade zero yet it says right there in certs and awards log hes grade iv so now we have grade iv who has level i ii iii and iv troubles session that tries to go beyond big dialwide drifting floating fn only distracts the pc from his win big win any big win fn dialwide cog vgis gives you this kind of persistent fn you at least have to let it go until tomorrow and let the pc have his win that is what is meant by letting the pc have his win when you get one of these dialwide fns cog vgis wow you may as well pack it up for the day gradual wideningin running dianetic chain to basic in triple you will sometimes see in one session half dial on flow 1 34 of dial on flow 2 full dial on flow 3 or you may have 4 subjects to twoway comm or prepcheck in one session first action 13 dial fn then fn ta up second action l2 dial fn then fn third action 34 dial fn fourth action full dialwide floating swinging idling fn you will also notice in the same sessionlong time for 1st action shorter shorter shorter for the next three actions now you have an fn that anything you try to clear and run will just fn without affecting the case at all if you audit past that you are wasting your time and processes you have hit an unkillable fn properly called persistent fn its persistent at least for that day do any more and its wasted if an auditor has never seen this he had better get his tr0 bullbait flat for 2 hours at one unflunked go and his other trs in and drill out his flubs for thats whats supposed to happen fns on pcs audited up to for that session persistent fn always get to the examiner if you only have small fn it wont get to the examiner however on some pcs maybe thats good enough may take him several sessions each one getting final session fn bit wider then he gets an fn that gets to the examiner after that well audited on continuing basis the fn lasts longer and longer one day the pc comes into session with dialwide floating swinging fn and anything you say or do does nothing whatever to disturb that fn its real release man it may last weeks months years tell him to come back when he feels he needs some auditing and chalk up the remaining hours if sold by the hour as undelivered or if sold by result chalk up the result if the fn is truly persistent he will have objections if it isnt he will object so have him come back tomorrow and carry on whatever you were doing summary the technical bug back of quickie grades or quickie power was the persistent fn this is not to be confused with stage 4 sweep stick sweep stick or an arc broke needle pc bad indicators while fning this is not to be used to refuse all further auditing to pc

different handlings of end phenomena end phenomena will also vary depending on what youre running the definition of end phenomena is those indicators in the pc and meter which show that chain or process is ended misapplication of this definition can result in underrun and overrun processes or actions and the pc snarled up with bpc types of eps in power processing the auditor waits for specific ep and does not indicate an fn until he has gotten the specific ep for the process to miss on this in power is disastrous thus power auditors are drilled and drilled on the handling of power eps in dianetics the ep of chain is erasure accompanied by an fn cognition and good indicators you wouldnt necessarily expect rave indicators on pc in the middle of an assist under emotional or physical stress until the full assist was completed though what you would expect is the chain blown with an fn those two things themselves are good indicators the cognition could simply be the chain blew in scientology end phenomena vary with what youre auditing an arc broken pc on an l1c will peel off charge and come uptone gradually as each reading line is handled sometimes it comes in spectacular huge cog and vvgis and dial fn but thats usually after charge has been taken off on gradient whats expected is an fn as that charge being handled moves off in ruds its the same idea when youve got your fn and that charge has moved off indicate it dont push the pc on and on for some ep youve got it now major grade process will run to fn cog vgis and release youll have an ability regained but thats grade process on set up flying pc fn abuse mistakenly applying the power ep rule to ruds will have the pc messed up by overrun it invalidates the pcs wins and keys the charge back in the pc will start thinking he hasnt blown the charge and cant do anything about it in 1970 i had to write the hco b fns and end phenomena to cure auditors of chopping pc eps on major actions by indicating fns too soon this is one type of fn abuse which has largely been handled that bulletin and power ep handling have been in some instances misapplied in the direction of overrun the pc isnt getting ep on these chains as theres cognition just it erased is one example obviously the cs didnt understand the definition of cognition or what an ep is another example is the pc spots what it is and fns and the auditor carries on expecting an epots and eps an ot is particularly subject to fn abuse as he can blow things quite rapidly if the auditor misses the fn due to too high sensitivity setting or doesnt call it as hes waiting for an ep overrun occurs it invalidates an ots ability to asis and causes severe upsets this error can also stem from auditor speed the auditor used to auditing lower level pcs or never trained to audit ots cant keep up with the ot and misses his fns or reads thus overruns occur and charged areas are bypassed this could account for those cases who were flying then fell on their heads with the same problems that blew back again remedy the remedy of this problem begins with thoroughly clearing all terms connected with eps this is basically word clearing method 6 key words the next action is to get my hco bs on the subject of eps and also related metering hco bs fully understood and starrated this would be followed by clay demos of various eps of processes and actions showing the mechanics of the bank and what happens with the pc and meter trs and meter drills on spotting fns would follow including any needed obnosis drills and correction of meter position so that the auditor could see the pc meter and his admin at glance then the auditor would be gradiently drilled on handling the pc meter and admin at increasing rates of speed including recognizing and indicating eps when they occurred when the auditor could do all of this smoothly at the high rate of speed of an ot blowing things by inspection without fumbling the last action would be bullbaited drills like trs 103 and 104 on gradient to level of competence whereby the auditor could handle anything that came up at speed and do so smoothly then youd really have an ot auditor and thats what youll have to do to make them summary overrun and underrun alike mess up cases both stem from an auditor inability to recognize and handle different types of eps and inexpertness in handling the tools of auditing at speed dont overrun pcs and have to repair them let the pc have his wins lrhamsrd l ron hubbard copyright 1974 founder by l ron hubbard all rights

service method of providing person with the use of something the action or result of giving assistance or advantage work done duty performed computation that aberrated evaluation and postulate that one must be in certain state in order to succeed service facsimile the service facsimile is that computation generated by the preclear not the bank to make self right and others wrong to dominate or escape domination and enhance own survival and injure that of others note that it is computation not doingness beingness or havingness we could call this service computation but we will maintain the term we have used to describe this phenomenon throughout the technology service facsimile it is computation that the pc adopted when in an extreme situation he felt endangered by something but could not itsa it it is called service facsimile because he uses it it is of service to him aberration anybodys aberration on any subject has been of some use to them at some time or other you can trace it back its been of some use otherwise they wouldnt keep mocking it up but now if you put it up against survival standards youd find it very nonsurvival the pc adopted this because he couldnt stand the confusion in situation so he adopted safe solution safe solution is always adopted as retreat from the environmental restimulation he adopted safe solution in that instance and he survived his safe solutionbecame his stable datum he has hung onto it ever since it is the computation the fixed idea he uses to handle life his service facsimile how the service facsimile becomes fixed an idea is the thing most easily substituted for thetan an idea doesnt have any mass connected with it basically and it appears to have some wisdom in it so its very easily substituted for thetan thus the idea the stable datum he has adopted is substituted for the thetan how does this stable datum become so fixed it gets fixed and more and more firmly as time goes on by the confusion it is supposed to handle but doesnt the stable datum was adopted in lieu of inspection the person ceased to inspect he fell back from inspecting he fell back from living he put the datum there to substitute for his own observation and his own coping with life and at that moment he started an accumulation of confusion that which is not confronted and inspected tends to persist thus in the absence of his own confronting mass collects the stable datum forbids inspection its an automatic solution its safe it solves everything he longer has to inspect to solve so he never anises the mass he gets caught in the middle of the mass and it collects more and more confusion and his ability to inspect becomes less and less the more he isnt confronting the less he can confront this becomes dwindling spiral so the thing he has adopted to handle his environment for him is the thing which reduces his ability to handle his environment those things which do not respond to routine auditing that routine auditing wont change are rooted in this mechanism therefore it is important to find the idea on which he is so fixed pull the fixed idea and you free the individual for broader perimeter of inspection in service fac handling the reason you get tone arm action when the fixed idea has been pulled is that the confusion which has been amassed and dammed up for so long is now running off rightwrong dominate and survive right and wrong are the tools of survival in order to survive you have to be right there is level at which true rightness is analytical and there is level at which rightness and wrongness cease to be analytical or comprehensible when it drops below that point its aberration the point you degenerate from survive to succumb is the point you recognize you are wrong that is the beginning of succumb the moment one becomes worried about his own survival he enters into the necessity to dominate in order to survive it goes the insistence upon survival followed by the necessity to dominate followed then by the necessity to be right these postulates go downhill so you get an aberrated rightness or wrongness the game of domination consists of making the other fellow wrong in order to be right that is the essence of the service facsimilethe reason the service facsimile isnt rational is because you have aaas along the whole line coming down the line it works itself back and forth in an aberrated aaa if the individual is surviving he must be right and people will defend the most fantastic wrongnesses on the basis they are being right in pt and at any point along the track the fellow is trying to be right trying to be right trying to be right whatever hes doing hes trying to be right in order to survive you have to be right more than youre wrong so you get the obsession to be right in order to survive the lie is that he cant do anything else except survive it isnt that trying to be right is wrongits obsessively being right about something thats obviously wrong thats when the individual is longer able to select his own course of behaviour when he is obsessively following courses of behaviour which are uninspected in order to be right there is nothing sane about service facsimile there is rationality to it the computation does not fit the incident or event occurring it simply enforces exaggerates and destroys freedom of choice over the exercise of ability to be happy or powerful or normal or active it destroys power destroys freedom of choice wherever that zone or area is youll see the individual worsening he is on dwindling spiral but he himself is generating it the intention to be right is the strongest intention in the universe above it you have the effort to dominate and above that you have the effort to survive these things are strong but were talking here about mental activity thinking activity an intentional activity survivalthat just happens dominationthat just happens those are not intended things but you get down along the level of intended and its right or wrong the strongest intention in the universe it is always an aberrated solution it always exists in pt and is part of the environment of the pc hes generating it its his solution overwhelmed as he is by it he is still generating it its aberrated because its an uninspected solution and it is something that everyone unintentionally or otherwise is telling the pc is wrong and causing him to assert that it is right the perfect solution when he first got hold of it but now it monitors his life its living his life for him and it doesnt even vaguely begin to take care of his life that is the anatomy of the service facsimile you are going to find these on any pc you audit service facsimile is the clue the key to pcs case the route to succumb which he blindly asserts is his route to survival and every pc has more than one of these fortunately we have the tech to salvage him we are the only ones who do l ron hubbard founder lrhdr copyright 1978 by l ron

__________ service facsimile is brother to rses and evil intentions this is easily seen when one understands the anatomy of the service fac and the rightwrong dominate and survive computations that enter into it and when one understands that an rs always means hidden evil intention and that the total reason for an rs is to make wrong in order to get someone to succumb they have to be wrong way back up there the idea preceding the service fac was right really right then it came down bit and was method of survival and then it was method of dominating and then it was method of being right in order to make others wrong and in that contest one got enough overts so that the communication line took switcheroo what was right about it is now wrong about it and what was once wrong is now right aaa enters into the situation where rightness becomes wrongness all of his overts get piled up on one of these fixed ideas or what we call service facsimile it isnt actually facsimile at all its the guy himself keeping facsimiles in restimulation because he knows whats best the person himself is generating the fixed idea it is not the bank it isnt what aberration the individual is dramatizing its what aberration does the individual dredge up in order to make somebody wrong it isnt the accidental thing you think it is its intended the intention is to be right and make others wrong to dominate others and escape domination oneself to aid own survival and hinder the survival of others that is the service facblood brother to the hidden evil intention that is behind the rock slamthis does not mean you will necessarily see rses on every service fac you run it does mean that where pc is rsing in an area you have an area of heavy severe service fac know when you see an rs that the individual is in the grip of an evil intention which he himself is generating he intends that area or subject on which he is rsing nothing but harm calculatingly covertly he will go to great lengths to carry his intentions out at all times carefully concealing the fact the evil intention is not limited to terminals hes not rsing on terminal hes rsing on the evil intention the evil intention can associate with many terminals the rs dominates the individual it is the person he has been overwhelmed by it in that area he has ability to reason he has freedom to choose the evil intention is substituted for livingness it is his safe solution to life his service facsimile the service fac does not respond to ordinary auditing because in the course of ordinary auditing it does not get inspected it by its nature forbids inspection but when addressed at the rightwrong level the pc gives it up easily because in that area he has power of choice more than one service fac per pc we have had for many years service fac processing with which to handle these obsessions and thus to handle the person who rses but it is not just finding one service facsimile you find many service facs which then add up to the big one at saint hill in the mid60s this was commonly associated with rses it was what the pc had done with the service fac to make others wrong which was important not just finding it early on the tech included auditing them out with dianetics and you found many many more than one on each pc we used to get complete character changes with this the full tech on this has been submerged over the past several years it is probably this omission of requiring several service facs to be run and then auditing them out with dianetics that has resulted in so many rsers going on up undetected as of this writing the full tech has been exhumed and we have now new era dianetics tech to help strip these packages down and take them apart at their basics so we not only have more thorough means of handling service facs than ever before we also have more reliable route to the handling of an rser but its more than one service fac per pc you may audit off one two or three apparent service facsimiles that all answer up to the complete description of service fac and they will run but all are actually leaning on the central service fac that is in restimulation in pt as you take these lesser service facs off the central one comes to view on the first ones you find the most you can hope for is you found something that blew the ta down and moved you closer to finding the main service fac so you take them if youve found service fac the needle will be looser and the ta in reasonable range and it will run on the rightwrong etc brackets and the pc will get off automaticities when youve finally found several and walked it all the way through to the service fac its as if all theother service facs youve been peeling off are like the bands of trees and sod that lie up against the mountain peak so you take the service facsimiles and run them as you find them you unburden the cliffs before you pull the mountain out by the roots as youre running out the first service facs youre reversing the dwindling spiral youre restoring the individuals ability to handle his environment because hes now seeing it hes now beginning to confront it and by the time youve pulled the main onethe mountainout by its roots youve returned him to sanity he is now able to inspect he longer needs safe solution it is the most dangerous thing in the world to have safe solution because that is the hole

that emeter drill 5 of the book of emeter drills has been replaced with emeter drill 5ra and is not done should be done this emeter drill 5ra is the only change in the original book further it applies to the mark vi just as well as it applied to the mark v for which the book was written the controls and actions of the mark v and mark vi are practically identical though the mark vi moves up to higher level cases being able to see and read and operate an emeter has everything to do with getting reads off prepared list where an auditor misses it is simply that he has not adequately done the drills in the book of emeter drills and has not practiced up to point of full easy familiarity with the emeter the point of being able to make lists read is pointless unless the auditor can set up

position coach sitting at the keyboard of piano or organ or any usable instrument student standing beside instrument purpose to establish the pitch differences of statements and questions data training procedure if the student is girl the coach asks her to say apple as statement the coach then strikes the c above middle c as given in the data above and then the g above middle c if the student is man the coach asks him to say apple as statement and then strikes middle c and then the f below middle c this is repeated saying apple and striking the two notes until the pitch of statement can be duplicated by the student in the event the student has voice pitch at variance with these notes other notes can be found and used by the coach so long as the higher note is first and the second note is four or five whole notes below the first note it must sound like statement with the higher then lower note once the student has grasped this and can duplicate it have the student use other two syllable words or single syllable words preceded by an article using these notes of the statement then using these two notes have the student make up sentences as statements the bulk of the sentence said at the pitch of the higher note but the end of the sentence at the pitch of the lower note once the student has this down and can easily do it and it sounds natural and he is satisfied that it does go on to the question step the coach has the student say apple as question then the coach for male student strikes the f below middle c and then middle c for woman the coach strikes the above middle c and then the d an octave above middle c in case this does not agree with the voice pitch of the student the coach must work it out providing only that the upper note is three or four whole notes above the lower note it must sound natural and must sound like question the coach has the student say apple as question and then strikes the lower and higher note until the student can duplicate it now take other two syllable words or single syllable words preceded by an article and have the student say these as question following each one with the two instrument notes lower to higher when the student can do this is satisfied that it sounds natural and doesnt have to think about dolling it go on to the next step here the student makes up banal questions the first part of the question is said at the lower note and the last part is said at the higher note at each question the coach strikes the lower note and then the upper note when this sounds natural and the

separate and walk around their neighborhood and then meet and compare notes the object is to detect personal habits in questioning purpose to enlighten the student as to his own communication habits and peoples reactions to his questions commands the most common everyday social questions such as hows it going do you like the weather etc appropriate to the activities and circumstances of the person only one or two questions to separate person the questions must be banal social and ordinary but they must be questions training stress the two students agree on the areas they will cover next time they will meet again they then go over individually not together the student pauses next to people encountered and asks social question and notes the reaction of the person asked in this drill the student does not necessarily try to use tr 1q1 but is just himself speaking as he would normally speak the students then meet and compare notes and discuss what they have discovered about themselves on the subject of asking questions if they have not learned or observed anything the drill must be repeated end phenomena person who has detected any habits he has in handling pitch of

words from the prepared lists of the book of emeter drills pages 66 to 72 of the appendix training stress to get the student to use the pitch of his voice to deliver question consisting of single word it must sound like question per tr 1q1 and use similar pitchs to tr 1q1 the student is flunked for out trl for keeping his eyes glued to the list for sounding unnatural the student is also flunked for slow or comm laggy delivery or pauses the coachdesignates the list to be used changes lists when the student can do this easily second part of the drill is entered and the coach begins to use the pc origination list on page 58 so as to interrupt the student and make him combine his questions with tr 4 in this case the student acknowledges appropriately uses i will repeat the question and does so

number tr 1q4 name whole sentence questions position student and coach sit facing each other across table the emeter is set up and used copies of the book of emeter drills are used purpose to train the student to ask whole questions that sound like questions read an emeter and handle session at the same time commands the usual coach commands of tr drills the prepared lists of the appendix of the book of emeter drills the questions in these drills are reworded so that the item occurs as the last word example list 2 pg 65 or the book of emeter drills states that the assessment question is which tree do you like best this is converted for each question to do you like prepared list 4 is converted to do you dislike etc whole sentence is used in every case training stress the usual tr commands are used by the coach emeter drill 5ra must be used to start any tr errors or metering errors may be flunked but special attention is paid to the students ability to ask question that sounds like question in accordance to tr 1q1 and that sounds natural the drill has three parts in the first part although the coach is on the meter the ability to ask the question is concentrated upon the second part concentrates upon the students ability to look at the written question and then ask the coach directly without undue comm lag or hesitation the third part is to do the first two parts and read the meter in accordance with emeter drills 27 and cr00004 which may have to be reviewed if flubby and to keep session admin all smoothly and accurately if question arises about meter accuracy third person who can read meter or video tape is employed to ensure that the student is actually not missing or dubbing in reads end phenomena person who can do all the necessary actions of asking questions from prepared list and run session smoothly without errors or confusions and be confident he can history developed by l ron hubbard in april 1980 tr 8q number tr 8q name tone 40 assessment position same as tr 8 where the student is in one chair racing another chair on which sits an ashtray the coach sitting beside the student in third chair square fourcornered ashtray is usedpurpose to deliver the thought of question into an exact position wide or narrow at decision that is question with or without words commands for the first part of the drill are you an ashtray are you made of glass are you sitting there second part of drill same questions silently third part of drill are you corner to each corner of the ashtray verbal and with intention at the same time fourth part of drill any applicable question verbal and with intention at the same time put broad and narrow at choice into the ashtray exact parts of it and the surroundings training stress the coach uses usual tr coaching commands there are four stages to the drill the first stage is to land verbal command into the ashtray the second stage is to put the question with full intention silently into the ashtray the third stage is to put verbal command and silent intention at the same time into exact parts of the ashtrays the fourth stage is to put any applicable question both verbally and with intention into any narrow or any broad portion of the ashtray or its surrounds at choice and at will at the conclusion of the whole drill imagine the ashtray saying yesyesyesyes in an avalanche of yeses to balance the flow in actual life people pcs and meters do respond and return the flow end phenomena the ability to land question with full intention into an exact target area broad or narrow at will and effectively whether verbally or silently history developed by l ron hubbard in april 1980 as an extension of all earlier work on intention and tone 40 as now applied to questions and assessments tr 48q1 number tr 48q1 tr 4 for pc origin tr 8 intention q for question 1 for first part name tone 40 assessment prepared list session drill position student and coach sitting across from each other at table emeter set up and in use session admin using prepared lists purpose to train student to do all the actions necessary to full smooth accurate session using prepared lists and to do tone 40 assessment of them commands coach commands are the usual tr commands of start flunk thats it for the student all commands relating to starting session giving an r factor assessing prepared list keeping the admin indicating any item round and ending session the book of emeter drills for prepared lists as in tr 1q4 origins for coach as per pages 58 59 and 60 of that book squeeze the cans take deep breath and let it out this is the session we are going to assess prepared list assessment your item is indicate any fn end of assessment end of session training stress permit the student to continue to his first error then have him drill and correct that error and continue finally to conclude let the student go through the entire sequence of the drill beginning to end three times without error or flunk for final pass it is expected that the student will not flub any trs or metering or session patter metering may be finally verified by third student or video all assessing must be in proper tone 40 with full intention exactly placed the student must not wait to see if the meter read but catch the read of the last question as he starts the next one his vision may shift from list to pc but at all times must embrace list meter and pc this drill also would be the one used for tape or video passes as it includes all elements of metering and trs end phenomena person who can do flawless and productive assessment session tone 40history developed by l ron hubbard april 1980 tr 48q2 number tr 48q2 name listing and nulling tone 40 assessment position same as tr 48q1 purpose to teach student to do the action of listing and nulling with all metering and admin using tone 40 assessment commands the usual coach tr commands two copies of the book of emeter drills prepared list is chosen by the coach and both use the same prepared list the student reads the question and asks it and the coach reads the replies from the same list but in his own copy the student must write down the answers in proper session worksheet and note and write down any reads an fn terminates the listing if it occurs the coach need not use the whole list of replies but only half dozen chosen at random the sequence of commands is the same as tr 48q1 except that the r factor is we are going to list question and if item fns and significant read has occurred the additional action of nulling the list is undertaken with the command i will now assess the list training stress the laws of listing and nulling hcob l aug 68 apply in full as these are very important laws and ignoring them can result in severe arc breaks not so much in this drill but in actual sessions the coach may also require suppress and invalidate buttons be put in on the whole list all errors omissions hesitations and lapses from tone 40 on the part of the student are flunked coach similarly to tr 48q1 pass when the student can do it flawlessly three consecutive times this drill may be used for internship tapes and videos for assessing and metering passes end phenomena person able to do flawless l n list as the session or as part of session with all trs in with perfect metering and proper admin and using tone 40 in his listing and assessing history developed by l ron hubbard in april 1980 summary the purpose of these drills is to train the student to ask questions that will get answers and to assess prepared lists that will get accurate reads if student dolling these drills has difficulty it will be traced to false data misunderstood words or not having passed earlier trs including upper indoc or his metering drills as contained in the book of emeter drills if satisfactory result is not obtained the faults in the above items should be located and remedied and these drills repeated if any earlier omissions are found and repaired and if these drills are honestly done heightened success as an auditor or surveyor or examiner or ethics officer is assured lrhdr l ron hubbard copyright 1980 founder by l ron

purpose rundown the person red tags at the examiner or if he gets sick or upset or falls on his head shortly after the auditing this list should be assessed and handled to straighten the matter out the repair action would be 24hour repair priority per policy if there is bog during false purpose rundown session the auditor uses this list to sort the matter out and get the pc rolling again this list would normally be done method 3 as the questions are written in precise sequence the initial questions cover those items which would have to be handled first and the rest of the questions are laid out generally in the order of likelihood of what would be found to have caused the difficulty the list should be used with prefix which acts as time limiter such as in this session or on the
