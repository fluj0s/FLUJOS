property owners when they sue local governments or the federal government for alleged infringements of property rights these thres hold hurdles allow the fe deral court to avoid reaching the merits of the property owners claim when the claim is deemed by the court to be improperly or inappropriately before it the bill disavows any intention to change the substantive standard by which courts determine whether gove rnment actions effect takings under the takings clause of the fifth amendment s 2271 is designed as replacement fo r hr 1534 which the senate committee on the judiciary reported in february 1998 it is scheduled for senate floor vote should it survive likely filibuster in the near future this report supplements crs report 97877 which examines in detail the senate reported

jurisdiction abstention and ripeness which these bills seek to modify here we do not repeat that background and urge the reader to read the present brief upda in conjunction with the earlier report thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98601crs2 present report confines itself to the chan ges made by s 2271 in the committeereported version of hr 1534 those changes are1 title s 2271 is the property rights implementation act of 1998 hr 1534 is the citizens access to justice act of 1998 2 duty of notice to local governments an s 2271 provision with counterpart in hr 1534 bars the filing of an action unde r 42 usc sec 1983 alleging the taking of real property until 60 days has elapsed from the date when written notice has been provided to the defendant section 1983 actions are widely used to challenge actions of local governments in federal court 3 ripeness scope of provisions the ripeness provisions of s 2271 apply solely to claims founded on constitutional right to use real property land and things attached to land hr 1534s ripeness provisions woul d have applied to ll types of property real and personal tang ible and intangible 4 ripeness time allowed for government processing of development applications s 2271 says that the ripeness of the propert owners taking come s about only after the specified government approvals following app lication therefor have not been obtained within reasonable time hr 1534 in possibly inadvertent omission demanded only that following the property owners sub mission of its application for development approval such approval had not been obtai ned there was mention of within reasonable time 5 ripeness definition of futility s 2271 like its predecessor provides that property owner can ripen its taking claim w ithout having obtained required government approval if applying therefor would be futile hr 1534 offered definition of futile however suggesting that the terms meaning was to be drawn from takings case law s 2271 defines futile to mean t he inability of an owne r of real property to seek or obtain approvals to use such real property and the hardship endured by such inability as defined under applicable land use and invironmental law 6 ripeness definition of meaningful application both bills insist as condition for ripe taking claim that the property owner make one meaningful application to develop its property to the local land use regulating entity which is not approved hr 1534 says that the content of meaningful pplication is as defined by the locality s 2271 retain s the as defined by the locality language of hr 1534 for some uses of meaningful application the discreti onary abstention provision and where the meaningful application is not approved and is accompanied by an explanation of the development that would be accepted but not for one other use where the meaningful application is not approved and is not accompan ied by an explanation of the development that would be approved the reasons fo r having two definitions of meaningful application are not clear 7 ripeness the written explanati on provided by the locality both bills stipulate that where local government offers in conjunction with development proposal disapproval written explanation of the use density or intensity of development it would accept the landowner must to ripen its cons titutional claim submit second application taking into account that explanation and have that application just as the first one not be approved s 2271 clar ifies that such written explanati on need only specify the range of use density or intensity of development that would be approvedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98601crs3 8 abstention nature of prohi bition on district court use s 2271 states that whenever federal district court exercises jurisdiction under 28 usc sec 1343 which covers section 1983 actions among others th court shall not abstain because the party seeking redress 1 brings prior or concu rrent proceeding before state territorial or local tribunal 2 asserts claims under state or local law pendent to or arising from the same core of operative facts as claim for the taking of real property or 3 asserts claim for the taking of real property that requires interpretation of state territory or local laws this language appears to contem plate that districtcour t abstention is never categorically barred but rather cannot be based by the court on the specified factors hr 1534 by contrast takes the form of an absolu ban but states the triggering factors more narrowly than those of s 2271 under hr 1534 an abstention prohibition applies only when state law at all is filed and where parallel proceeding arising from the same facts as the taking claim is pending in state court s 2271 also contains discretionary ab stention provision not present in hr 1534 under s 2271 federal district that ex ercises jurisdiction under 42 usc sec 1343 in an action concerning real property use may abstain where the plaintiff 1 has not submitted meaningful application see item 5 to use the real property and 2 challenges whether an action of the loca lity exceeds the authority conferred upon it under state law 9 abstention when district courts s hould certify questions of state law both bills deal with the issue of when district court facing cl aim involving the use of real property that cannot be decide d without resolving an unsettle d question of state law may certify that question to the high est appellate court of the state s 2271 states that the district court in deciding wh ether to certify may consider whether the question of state law will significantly affect the merits of the claim and is patently unclear hr 1534 states that the district court shall not certify the question unless these factors are present 10 attorneys fees in claims against any act of congress or federal regulation affecting property rights s 2271 specifies that the court may award attorneys fees and other costs to the prevailing plaintiff hr 1534 used the mandatory shall instead an s 2271 provision with analog in hr 1534 is titled attorneys fees for localities this provision states that in section 1983 action under 42 usc sec 1983 alleging taking of real property di strict court may hold th property owner liable for reasonable attorneys fee and costs where the taking claim is not substantially justified unless special circumstances make such an award unjust the phrase substantially justified is apparently taken from the equal access to justice act where it performs similar function in specifying that the united states must pay attorneys fees to prevailing parties in judicial actions unless its position in the litigation was substantially justified 28 usc sec 2412d1a
