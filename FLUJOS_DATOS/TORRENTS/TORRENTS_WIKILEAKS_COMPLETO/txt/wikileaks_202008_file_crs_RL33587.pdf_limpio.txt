long as they enroll in part b during this time they will not be subjec t to penalty for complete discussion of the premium penalty see crs report rs21731 medicare part b premium penalty by jennifer osullivan 3 in order to meet this requirement employer s must have 20 or more full andor parttime employees for each working day in each of 20 or more calendar weeks in the current calendar year or the preceding calendar year the 20 weeks do not have to be consecutive the requirement is based on the number of em ployees not the number of people covered under the plan employers who did not meet the requirement during the previous calendar year may meet it at some point during the ne w calendar year and at that point medicare would become the secondary payer for the remai nder of that year and through the next yeargenerally the primary payer for individuals covered through their own or spouses current employment conditional payment ma be made in certain situations for example if an employer does not pay properly filed claim however medicare may seek repayment when the group health plan is primary but does not pay in full medicare may make secondary pa yment as prescribed by law medicare has been the secondary payer for the working aged since the passage of the tax equity and fiscal responsib ility act tefra of 1982 secondary payer rules for the disabled were first established in the omnibus budget reconciliation act obra of 1986 and medicare secondary payer rules for persons with end stage renal disease esrd have been in effect since the passage of obra 1981 the msp rules for employer group health plans have been amended in subsequent legislation working aged subject to certain conditions medicare payments are secondary to employersponsored health insurance offered to employees an employer with 20 or more employees3 must offer workers aged 65 and over the same group health insurance coverage offered to other employees in fact the statutes prohibit group health plan from taking in to account that an individual or hisher spouse who is covered by the plan by virt ue of the individuals current employment status is entitled to medicare benefits any individual age 65 or older and hisher spouse age 65 or older who has current em ployment status is entitled to the same benefits under the employers group health plan under the same conditions as any such individual or his her spouse under age 65 such employees must be in current employment status that is they must be individuals who are 1 actively working as an employee 2 the employer or 3 associated with the employer in busine ss relationship such as supplier included on the employers group health plan if the employer offers health insurance coverage to spouses it must also offe r the coverage to any employees spouse including those who are aged 65 and older working aged employees have the option of accepting or rejecting the employers coverage if working aged individual accepts coverage the employer plan is the primary payer and medicare is secondary for both the employee and the employees spouse for medicareenro lled employees who reject employerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33587crs3 4 prior to august 1993 medicare was the secondary payer for active individuals entitled to medicare on the basis of disability ac tive individuals included people who were not actually working who had employee status as indicated by their relationship to their employer for example the employer migh t have been paying the individual sick or disability pay that was subject to federal insurance contributions act fica taxes or the individual might have participated in an insurance plan that was available only to employees the standard for disabled medi care beneficiaries was changed to current employment status in 1993 to be consistent w ith the standard for the working aged those previously covered by the active individua l standard whose status changed have medicare as their primary payer 5 medicare entitlement based on esrd usually begins with the third month after the month in which the beneficiary starts regular course of dialysis referred to as the threemonth waiting period this waiting period may be waived in part or entirely if during that time 1 the individual takes an approved home dialysis training program in selfdialysis 2 the individual is admitted to medicareapproved hospital for kidney transplant or for health care services needed before the transplant if the transplant takes place during that month or the following two months or 3 the indi vidual is scheduled for transplant that is delayed more than two months after the benefi ciary is admitted to the hospital or for health care servicessponsored coverage medicare is primary however the statutes prohibit the employer from paying for supplemental be nefits for medicare covered services so as not to provide any financial incentives for employees to reject the employer sponsored coverage in favor of ss expensive supplemental coverage these msp requirements also apply to multiple employer plans plan sponsored by more than one employer nd to multiemployer plans plan jointly sponsored by the employers and unions unde r the tafthartley law when each of the employers in the group has less than 20 employees medicare is primary when all employers have 20 or more employees or if at least one employer has 20 or more employees medicare is secondary an em ployer in the group with fewer than 20 employees may request an exemption for its working aged employees in that case medicare would be primary for the exempt ed employees and the employer could offer those individuals covera ge that supplements medicare working disabled similarly medicare is the secondary payer for disabled medicare beneficiaries who have employersponsored health insurance based on their own current employment or spouses current employment4 one difference between the working aged and working disa bled requirements is the size of the employee group for the disabled the msp ru applies to large group health plan that is plan offered by an employ er with 100 or more employees on at least 50 or more of its business days during the preceding calendar year this applies to smaller plans that are part of multiple or multiemployer plan if at least one of the employers in the plan has 100 or more employees unlike the working aged rules that allow for an exemption multiple or multiemployer plan may not exempt people enrolled though an employer with less than 100 employees persons with endstage renal disease esrd for individuals with medicare entitlement based solely on esrd5 msp rules apply for those covered by an employersponsored group plan regard

through their employer or spouses employer is the primary payer fo r the first 30 months of esrd benefit eligibility referred to as the 30month coordination period after 30 months medicare becomes the primary insurer similarly for working individuals or spouses who qualify for and remain eligible for medicare based on both esrd and age or disability any group health plan coverage they receive through their employer or spouses employer is the primary payer during the 30month coordi nation period after 30 months medicare becomes primary even if the individual has employersponsored health insurance based on current employment status howe ver there is one exception to the msp rules for this group medicare would be primary immediately for these individuals if both of the following conditions were met 1 the individual was first entitled to medicare on the basis of age or disability nd then also became eligible on the basis of esrd and 2 the msp provisions for ag or disability did not apply because the plan coverage was not by virtue of current employment status or the employer did not meet the test of size for either the aged or disabled for retirees rather than workers w ho first qualify for medicare based on esrd and then turn 65 during the 30month coordination period their retiree health insurance would remain primary for the entire 30month period medicare coverage ends 12 months after the month the benefi ciary stops dialysis treatment or 36 months after the month the beneficiary has successful kidney transplant however if medicare covera ge ends and then begins again based on esrd the 30month coordination period will also begin again msp and workers compensation nofault automobile and liability insurance medicare is the secondary payer when payment

medicare providers including hospitals physicians and outpatient hosp ital departments among othe rs must ask beneficiaries series of standardized questions before providing services to ascertain whether another insurer should be pr imary to medicare for recurring outpatient hospital services the msp information needs to be verified once every 90 days while the information is not required to be collected for every visit but rather only every 90 days incorrect medicare payments are still subject to repayment providers must agree to bill other primary payers before billing medicare the provider must notify the cobc prom ptly if an attorney or insurance company requests copy of medical record or bill concerning medicare patient further if provider receives primary payment from both medicare and third party payer as well as any deductible or coinsurance amounts from the beneficiary the provider must refund the beneficiary up to the full amount that he or she paid any amount paid by the thirdparty payer gr eater than the deductible and coinsurance amount is considered to be debt to medicare because it duplicates any payment made by medicare medicare must be re imbursed within 60 days of the providers receipt of the duplicate payment beneficiary responsibilities beneficiaries are asked but not required to respond to the initial enrollment questionna ire ieq beneficiaries

amounts when medicare is the secondary payer the health care provider first submits claim to the beneficiarys primary payer who processes the claim according to terms of the coverage contract if the primary payer does not pay the full charges for the service medicare secondary payments may be made if the service is covered by medicare in case can the actual amount pa id by medicare exceed the amount it would pay as primary payer any primary payments from thirdparty payer for medicarecovered services are credited toward the beneficiarys medicare part and part b deductibles and if pplicable coinsurance amounts however if the primaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33587crs11 payment is less than the deductible the be neficiary may be responsible for paying hisher unmet medicare deductib and coinsurance amounts the medicare secondary payment amount is subject to certain limits for some services such as inpatient hospital care the combined payment by the primary payer and medicare cannot ex ceed medicares recognized payment am ount without regard to beneficiary costsharing charges as one example of how medicare would decide its secondary payment amount for inpatie nt hospital services assume that an individual received inpatient hospital rvices costing 6800 the primary payer paid 4360 for the medicarecovered services part of the inpatient hospital deductible 1024 in 2008 had previously been met medicares gross payment amount without regard to the deductib is 4700 as the secondary payer medicare would pay the lowest of medicares gross payment amount w ithout regard to deductible minus the primary payers payment 47004360 340 medicares gross payment amount minus the medicare inpatient deductible 47001024 3676 the hospital charge minus the primary payers payment 68004360 2440 the hospital charge minus the medicare inpatient deductible 68001024 5776 in this case medicare would pay 340 th combined payment made by the primary payer and medicare is 4700 the benefici ary has liability fo r medicarecovered services since the primary payers paym ent satisfied the 1024 inpatient deductible if medicares payment amount had been wer than the primary payers amount it would not have made secondary payment in other cases such as physicians services the medicare secondary payment amount cannot exceed the lowest of the cal culation of the following three options for example assume that physician charges 175 for service the primary payers allowable charge is 150 of which it pays 80 or 120 and medicares recognized payment amount for the service is 125

its insured client for injuri losses or medical expenses seeks to recover its payment an insurer in this case medicare may reserve the right of subrogation in the event of loss this means that they may choose to take action to recover the amount of claim paid for rvices provided to beneficiary if the loss was caused by third party for example if beneficiary is injured in car accident medicare may seek to recover its payment from any money collected by the beneficiary or it may sue on behalf of the beneficiary to recover its payment from automobile liability insurance uninsured motorist

lung cancer emphysema and heart disease the federal governments claims agains t the tobacco industry were premised upon the defendant tobacco companies allege d fraudulent conduct involving conspiracy to deceive and mislead the american pub lic about the harmful nature of tobacco products and the addictive natu re of nicotine one of th governments claims was that the medicare program had made conditional payments for treatment of tobacco related illnesses and that the tobacco i ndustry must reimburse medicare for these payments under the msp provisions in united states v philip morris inc 11 judge gladys kessler dismissed the governments msp claim stating that the msp provisions only allow suits to be brought against insurance entities and that the government had not shown that the defendant tobacco companies against whom the suit was brought were either insurance companies or entities that had established selfinsured plans since the msp provi sions only allow rec overy of conditional medicare payments from an insurance entity responsible for making health care payments the government could not directly sue the tobacco industry the court also stated that it is clear that congress did not intend msp to be used as an acrossthe board procedural vehicle for suing tort feasors which is precisely how the government attempts to use the statute in this case12 in 2003 congress enacted pl 108173 the medicare prescription drug improvement and moderniza tion act mma and include d several amendments to the msp provisions one of which provide d for broader definition of primary plan prior to that time the msp did not define selfinsured plan and the courts had split over what constituted sel finsurance plan under the statute13 congress in mma provided that an entity that enga ges in business trade or profession shall be deemed to have selfinsured plan if it carries its own risk whether by failure to obtain insurance or ot herwise in whole or in part14 this clarification was added to address those court cases th at allowed firms that selfinsure for product liability to avoid payi ng medicare for past medical payments related to the claim15 congress also clarified the means available for demonstrating primary plans responsibility to reimburse dicare such responsibility may be demonstrated by judgement pa yment conditioned upon the

provisions to recover medicare payments relating to tobacco illnesses number of suits were brought under the msps privat cause of action provision by individuals and private sector entities to recover medicare payments and obtain damages17 this provision gives private citizens an incentive in the form of double damages to assist the government in recovering funds in th case of primary plan which fails to provide for primary payment in one case glover v philip morris18 individual medicare beneficiaries filed suit as private attorneys general under th msp statute to recover expenditures medicare made in florida after may 26 1998 for the treatment of illnesses attributable to cigarette smoking the pl aintiff medicare beneficiaries alleged that defendant tobacco companies were tortfeasor s in that they had battered medicare beneficiaries by exposing them to the addi ctive properties of nicotine and that as such the tobacco companies were liabl for the victims smokingrelated medical expenses to the extent that medicare had made payment for such costs defendant tobacco companies argued that the msp does not provide private cause of action against an alleged tortfeasor only against an entity that has been shown to be responsible to pay for medical expenses under primary plan and that as accused tortfeasors they had not yet been found liable for any medical payments so they could not be said to have failed to make paymen ts to medicare under their insurance plans the court in glover held that while the tobacco companies might meet the expanded definition of s elfinsured plan following the 2003 amendments to the msp they had not ye t been shown to be responsible for any medicare payments for smokingrelated illnesses so an msp lawsuit to recover medicare payments was premature19 in other words the msp only provides private cause of action to recoup medicare pa yments from an insurance plan after the tortfeasors liability has been established in
