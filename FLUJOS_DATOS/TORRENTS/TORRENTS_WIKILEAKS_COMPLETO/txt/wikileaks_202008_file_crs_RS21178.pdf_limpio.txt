overview of legislative history of federal legislation the report briefly outlines the legislative process and then suggests where to find materials that describe or document piece of legislations progress through congress legal policy and legislative researchers often study how congress considered particular piece of legislation variety of questions may underlie this effort for example what were the policy and intent of congress in approving particular piece of legislation which committees and members were the lead players what arguments were asserted for or against the legislation and who made them how was the legislative language amended as it advanced through the congressional process what were the votes on proposed amendments and final passage to research these and similar questions one must identify the legislative steps the legislation followed and the material s that document what was done at each step this information the legislative steps and accompanying documentation is known as legislative history this report provides general assistance in two ways first it briefly reviews the legislative process second it suggests sources that describe or document piece of legislations progress through congress the legislative process the following is short summary of the legislative process in congress more detailed guide is available electronically on thomas service of the library of congress described belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21178crs2 forms of legislation bills most legislation that is introduced by member of congress ie the legislations sponsor is introduced as bill the general form used for legislation that will have the force of law if enacted bills are numbered sequentially in order of their introduction bills introduced in the senate are preceded by s for senate bill those in the house by hr for house of representatives bill legislation remains pending from time of introduction until final passage or the final adjournment of congress ie the numbered twoyear convocation of the house and senate that begins january 3 following each biennial federal election bills not enacted during congress die further legislative consideration requires that they be reintroduced in the next congress upon passage and presidential approval or passage by twothirds majority in both chambers after presidents veto bill becomes law joint resolutions while bills are used for purposes of general legislation joint resolutions are used to propose constitutional amendments and for variety of special or subordinate purpose s such as continuing appropriations except for those proposing constitutional amendments joint resolutions sjres or hjres become law in the same manner as bills if those proposing constitutional amendments are approved by two thirds majority in each chamber they are submitted to the states for ratification rather than to the president for approval threequarters of the states must ratify the constitutional amendment or it fails resolutions resolutions s res or h res also known as simple resolutions are unicameral proposals that are used for matters concerning the operation of the chamber where introduced and approved they may be used for creating an ad hoc investigatory committee or changing the rules under which the chamber operates or to express the principles opinions or purposes of the chamber as distinguished from the entire congress they do not have the force of law concurrent resolutions concurrent resolutions s res or h res affect operations of both chambers and are primarily used to express the principles opinions or purposes of the congress or to create joint committee they do not become law but rather are effective upon approval by both chambers budget resolutions are an example of concurrent resolutions committee action legislation is referred to committee after introduction according to its subject matter most commonly committee will further refer the legislation to one of its subcommit tees the subcommittee may request reports from government agencies or departments hold hearings mark up the bill adopt revisions and report the legislation to the full committee the full committee may take similar action with or without prior subcommittee consideration and report the legislation to its full chamber ie the house or senate hearings hearings provide committee or subcommittee the opportunity to explore topics or legislation hearings may include statements of committee members and interested parties as well as the testimony of witnesses hearings may inform members and committees in their further consideration of the legislationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21178crs3 reports most legislation never proceeds through full committee consideration and it languishes in committee for the remainder of congress however committees by majority vote do find that some bills and resolutions merit consideration by the entire chamber as suggested above most legislation that receives attention by full committee has been previously considered by subcommittee which may or may not have debated and revised the original text during markup session however the changes made during subcommittee markup and the reasons for them may be difficult to determine subcommittees do not issue formal report of its action on the legislation by contrast the full committees report to their respective chambers the house requires report but the senate does not this is usually written committee report explaining the committees actions understandings and conclusions prospective costs and regulatory impact are among the supplemental materials that must included in committee reports committee reports are identified as house report hr rpt or senate report sr rpt and given number eg senate report 10731 is the 31st report to the senate in the 107th congress floor action debate legislation may be brought up for consideration by the full house or senate after it is reported by committee or without committee under special parliamentary motion the length and scope of debate eg which floor amendments if any will be considered are governed by the rules of the respective chambers votes on amendments and final passage may or may not be in the form of formal recorded vote in which the vote of each member is identified second chamber consideration after legislation is passed by one chamber it is referred to the other chamber for action if the second chamber chooses to consider the legislation and passes it without change it is submitted to the president for approval more commonly however the bill passed by the first chamber deals with issues that were the subject of similar or identical legislation introduced in the second chamber where separate hearings may have been held and report or reports made on the second chambers version of the legislation typically the legislation passed by the first chamber will be held while the second chamber considers its own version which it substitutes for the version passed by the other chamber the result is legislation with the same number passed by both chambers but in different versions conference if there are differences between the house and senate versions of piece of legislation the last chamber to adopt its version may send its language back to the other chamber for further consideration in amended form frequently however the two chambers establish conference committee to reach agreement on common version each chamber appoints conferees usually members of the original reporting committees who may take up only those areas in disagreement each chamber votes as unit in the conference committee majority of the senate conferees and majority of the house conferees must agree on what to reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21178crs4 upon reaching agreement on common version conference committee issues report setting out the text of the legislation agreed to and joint explanatory statement the report is usually printed as house report if passed by both chambers in identical form the legislation if bill or joint resolution is sent to the president presidential action the president may approve measure veto it or take action if the president takes action the legislation becomes public law after ten days sundays excepted unless final adjournment of congress has occurred in which case the legislation does not become law known as pocket veto if the president vetoes the legislation the congress may override the veto if two thirds of the house of representatives and twothirds of the senate separately vote to override the veto if the two chambers vote to override the veto the legislation becomes law without the presidents signature legislative history resource material the resource materials discussed below vary in scope for example thomas website of the library of congress noted below is portal to all the information most researchers are commonly interested in however the information that is available on it is limited to more recent congresses by contrast print materials may be historically complete but limited to only one step of the legislative process resource materials also vary in their respective availability some reference sets are commonly available at local libraries others are often available only at law libraries or federal depository libraries some stages of the legislative process are more fully documented than others for example bills are often debated and amended extensively during their consideration by congressional subcommittees but these deliberations are not memorialized in written reports information on subcommittee action often is limited to discussion in news or newsletter accounts or in full committee reports if any on the same legislation legislative history material on the internet the internet has made legislative history resources more widely available to both the legal profession and
