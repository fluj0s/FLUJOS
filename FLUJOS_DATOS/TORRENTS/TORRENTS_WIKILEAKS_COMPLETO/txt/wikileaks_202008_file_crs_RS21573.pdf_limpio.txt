ruling 200241 and notice 200245agreements under which employ ees receive less pay eg 100 less month in exchange for equivalent contributions to their accounts in this case 1200 for the year employees choose how much to put into their accounts which can vary from year to year they forfeit unused balances at the end of the year unless the employer offers grace period for additional claims of up to 2½ months after the end of the year eg so medical expenses incurred by march 15 2009 could be reimbursed from the fsa for 2008 limited onetime rollover ma be made to health saving s account the entire annual amount of an fsa must be made available to employees at the beginning of the year contributions are not subject to income or employment taxes ie social security and medicare taxes unlike the pay employees otherwise would have received fsas funded by salary reduc tions are governed by section 125 of the internal revenue code which exempts contributions from taxes desp ite the fact that employees have the choice to receive taxable wages2 most rules regarding fsas are not spelled out in the code they were included in proposed regulations that the in ternal revenue service irs issued in 1984 and 1989 final rules regarding permissible midyear election changes were issued in 2000 and 2001 on august 3 2007 the irs issued new proposed rules that will generally be effective on january 1 2009 t hough taxpayers may adopt them sooner these rules have not yet been finaliz ed fsas are available to more than one fifth of privatesector workers typically in larger establishments and nearly half of government workers including federal em ployees though par ticipation rates are substantially lower3 health reimbursement accounts hra are also employerestablished arrangements to reimburse employees for dical and dental expenses not covered by insurance or otherwise reimbursable as is the case with fsas contributions are not subject to either income or employment ta xes however contributions cannot be made through salary reduction agreements only em ployers may contribute employers need not actually fund hras until employees draw upon them also unlike fsas reimbursements can be limited to amounts previously contri buted unused balances may be carried over indefinitely though empl oyers may limit the aggregate carryovers limited onetime rollover ma be made to hea lth savings account hras are governed by section 105 of th internal revenue code which allows health plan benefits used for medical care to be exempt from taxes and section 106 of the code which allows employer contributions to those plans to be taxexempt rules regarding hras are spelled out in irs re venue rulings and notices issued in 20024 health savings accounts hsa are taxexempt accounts for paying medical and dental expenses not covered by insurance or otherwise reimbursable they can be established and contributions made only when the owner has qualifying high

exempt from income and employment taxe s account owners ma deduct contributions they make withdrawals for medical expens are not taxed those used for other purposes are taxable and subject to an additional 10 penalty except in cases of disability death or attaining age 65 unused balances may be carried over from year to year without limit as of january 2007 nearly 45 milli on people were covered by hsahigh deductible health plans the number include s policyholders not all of whom may have had hsas as well as their family members5 hsas were first authorized by the dicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma pl 108173 most statutory rules are in section 223 of the internal revenue code though there is irs revenue guidance as well6 archer medical savings accounts msa might be viewed as restricted precursor to hsas like them msas can be established and c ontributions made only when account owners have qualifying high deductible insurance nd other coverage with some exceptions contributions made by employers are exempt from income and employment taxes while contributions ma by account owners allowed only if the employer does not contribute are deductible withdrawals are not taxed if used for medical expenses those used for other purposes are taxable and generally subject to an additional 15 penalty unused balances may be carried over from year to year without limit the principa l difference is that eligibility is limited to people who are self employed or who are employees covered by high deductible plan established by their small employer 50 or fewer employees on average in addition the minimum deductible levels are higher and the contribution limits are lower for details see the comparison table that follows msas were first authorized by the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 pl 104191 that legislation so set deadline for establishing new accounts and generally limited the total number to 750000 not counting accounts of owners who were previously uninsured among others though for tax year 2003 the irs estimated there were fewer th an 80000 accounts in total ter amendments extended the deadline for new accounts to december 31 2007 with some exceptions however most msa owners can now have hsas and their msa balances can be rolled over into the new accounts most statutory rules

deductibles there is legal requirement for hras to be associated with hi gh deductible coverage though they usually are fsas do not require high deductible insurancesome issues consumerdriven health care when the accounts discussed in this report are paired with high deductible insurance they become what some call consumer driven health plans cdhp7 one objective of cdhps is to llow owners to choose health care providers and services themselves not constr ained by managed care restrictions another is to give owners financial incentive to save for future health care expenses in exchange for accepting the greater risk of higher insurance deductible in theory cdhps will slow health care spending and encourage costeffective care the extent to which these objectives will be borne out is not clear rgely because the two accounts most likely to be effective in these respects hras and hsas are still too new to permit adequate assessment much depends on how high the insurance deductibles are how much money is put into the accounts and by whom whethe r accounts are used to pay for expenditures other than health care when allowed and whether people with accounts can make informed choices additional key questions are how much competition there is among health care providers and whether prices fo r health care are or can be transparent equity the tax savings associated with taxadvantaged health care accounts depend on the taxpayers marginal tax rates for federal income taxes alone these vary from 10 for married couples filing join t returns who have taxable incomes not exceeding 16050 up to 35 for married couples filing joint returns who have taxable incomes over 357700 these figures are for the 2008 tax year other figures apply to taxpayers with different filing status as consequence the accounts discussed in this report are more attractive for higherincome taxpayers indeed some consider hsas more vehicle for building retirement income than paying for health care critics of these accounts argue that it is unfair for public hea lth care subsidies the forgone tax revenue to flow disproportionately to higher income taxpayers par ticularly since they generally have more resources to spend on health care in the first place however if the accounts are paired with high deductible insurance it might be argued that the tax savings are appropriate for taking on more greater financial risk and using less health care to the extent this actually occurs the latter ar guments do not apply to fsas when taxpayers do not have high deductible insurance thes accounts subsidize firstdollar payments for health care and may increase health care spending as fsas are available only through employer plans they likely appear inequ itable to taxpayers who cannot have them targeted savings accounts current law provides multiple taxadvantaged savings accounts for education and retirement as well as health care it may be simpler and more effective to have fewer accounts that would be available for variety of expenses perhaps as president bush once pr oposed the presidents advisory panel on federal tax reform recomme nded in 2005 that msas hsas and fsas be replaced by new save for family accounts that could be used for health care and education expenses these would have 10000 annua l contribution limits the presidents fy2009 budget would eliminate fsas and hras as consequence of replacing the exclusion for employerpaid coverage with new st andard deduction for health insurance
