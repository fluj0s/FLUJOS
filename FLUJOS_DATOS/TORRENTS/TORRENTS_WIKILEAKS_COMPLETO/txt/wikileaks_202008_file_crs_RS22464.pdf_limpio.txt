the omni bus budget reconciliation act of 1990 obra90 an assortment of spending cuts and tax increases that was expected to reduce the federal budget deficit by an estimated 496 billion over five years on november 5 1990 obra90 became pl 101508 after it was sign ed by president george h w bush at the time it was estimated that obra90s tax increases would raise on net basis 1463 billion this represented only about 29 of the estimated total fiveyear deficit reduction two of th provisions the phaseout of the personal exemption and the limitation on itemized deductions accounted for approximately 20 of the net tax increase under obra90 although the spending reductions constitute d the vast majority of this deficitreduction package it was ob ra90s tax increases that were the focus of most of the debate in may 2001 congress passed the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act egtrra on june 5 2001 egtrra became pl 10715 after it was signed by president george w bush egtrra containe d provisions for phasedin repeal of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22464crs2 personal exemption phaseout and the limitation on itemized deductions beginning in 2006 this report examines these two tax provi sions and issues raised by their repeal personal exemption phaseout pep prior to obra90 provisions in the tax reform act of 1986 tra86 had created an individual marginal income tax rate structure that consisted of two statutory marginal tax rates 15 and 28 tra86 however so created 5 surcharge on the taxable income of certain highincome taxpayers which effectively created third marginal tax rate of 33 28 statutory rate plus the 5 surcharge and produced an anomaly that came to be known as the tax rate bubble because the surcharge was phased out as in comes increased marginal tax rates rose to 33 but then fell back to 28 and hence created the tax rate bubble ostensibly the surcharge was created to phase out the tax benefits of the 15 tax bracket and the personal exemptions for highi ncome taxpayers in reality the surcharge was adopted so that tra86 would not change the distribution of the tax burden relative to its distribution under pre 1986 tax law would meet the needed revenue targets and yet would allow tra86 to be characterized as having only two statutory marginal income tax rates obra90 created an explicit threetiered statutory marginal rate structure and eliminated the tax bubble by repealing the 5 tax surcharge although obra90 eliminated the 5 tax surcharge it instituted new and explicit approach to phasing out the tax benefits of the personal ex emption for highincome taxpayers this new phaseout of the tax benefits of the pers onal exemption pep was structured as follows each personal exemption was phased out by factor of 2 for each 2500 or fracti on of 2500 by which taxpayers adjusted gross income agi exceeded given threshold amount in 1991 th threshold amount for joint return was set at 150 000 for single return the threshold was 100000 and for heads of households the threshold was set at 125000 for example in 1991 joint household whose agi was 183000 would lose 28 of their total personal exemptions claimed the agi amount in excess of the threshold in this instance would be 33000 183000 agi less 150000 threshold limit the 33000 excess divided by 2500 would produce factor of 132 which when rounded up would equal 14 this figure is multiplied by 2 to arrive at the final disallowance amount of 28 hence if the fa mily had claimed two personal exemptions which at 2150 each would total 4300 they would be allowed to deduct only 3096 4300 total personal exemptions less the 1204 disa llowance which is 28 of the total for tax years after 1991 these threshold am ounts were to be indexed for inflation under obra90 provisions the pep rules were originally scheduled to expire after 1995 continued budgetary pressures however led to the passage of second round of tax increases in 1993 under provisions of th omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 obra93 the pep provisions were made permanent by 2006 indexation had increased the pep phaseout threshold amount for joint return to 225750 for single return to 150000 and for heads of households to 188150httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22464crs3 1 all of the changes in egtrra including th pep and pease provisions will expire sunset after 2010 congress included the sunset in egt rra to avoid byrd rule section 313 of the 1974 congressional budget act as amended viola tion in the senate the byrd rule prohibits extraneous matter in reconciliation legislati on under the rule extraneous matter includes among other things language that would cause an increase in the budget deficit or reduce budget surpluses in fiscal year beyond those covere d by the reconciliation legislation as result of the byrd rule egtrra contained language provid ing for the expiration of all of its provisions at the end of calendar year 2010 since the year s after 2010 were outside the reconciliation budget window 2 joint committee on taxation jcs103 general explanation of tax gislation enacted in the 107th congress jan 2003 p 14 the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra which was signed into law on june 7 2001 contained provisions for phasedin repeal of the personal exemption phaseout under egtrra the pep provi sions are to be phased out over fiveyear period starting in this ear for 2006 and 2007 the personal exemption phaseout is scheduled to be reduced by onethird and for 2008 and 2009 it is scheduled to be reduced by twothirds finally the pe p provisions are to be repealed for tax years after 20091 congress cited three main reasons fo r the repeal of the pep provisions2 first the personal exemption phaseout was too comp lex second the pha seout constituted hidden way of raising marginal income tax rates and thus undermined respect for the tax system third the phaseout imposed excessively high effective marginal tax rates on families at the time the joint committee on taxation jct estimated that the phaseout of the pep provision would reduce federal revenues by 8 billion over the 2006 through 2010 time period limitation on itemized ductions pease provision obra90 also contained the socalled pease provision limiting the amount of itemized deductions highincome taxpayers could claim in any given year this provision takes its name from former representative don pease of ohio who was its author under this provision for tax year s starting in 1991 otherwise allowable itemized deductions were reduced by 3 of the amount by which taxpayers agi exceeded 100000 for married couples filing separate returns the agi limit was set at 50000 for example if taxpayers agi we re 110000 then his otherwise allowable deductions would be reduced by 300 110000 less 100000 threshold times 3 this provision effectively raises the marginal income tax rate of affected taxpayers by approximately one per centage point dollar of income in excess of the 100000 agi threshold is taxed as if it were 103 since in addition to the extra dollar of income the taxpayer loses 003 of itemized deductions allowable deductions for medi cal expenses casualty and th eft losses and investment interest were not subject to the limitation also total deductions subject to the limit cannot be reduced by more than 80 for tax years after 1991 the 100000 agi threshold was indexed for inflation this provision like the pep provision washttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22464crs4 3 urbanbrookings tax policy center effects of the peppease repeal table t050023 http wwwtaxpolicy centerorgtaxmodeltmdbtmtemplatecfmoriginally scheduled to expire after ta x year 1995 as mentioned earlier however continued budgetary pressures led to the passage of s econd round of tax increases in 1993 under provisions of the obra93 th pease provision was made permanent by 2006 indexation for inflation had increased the agi threshold at which otherwise allowable itemized deduc tions are limited to 150500 as was the case with the pep provisi on egtrra contained provision for the phasedin repeal of the pease provision under egtrra the pease provision is scheduled to be repealed over fiveyear period for tax years 2006 and 2007 the overall limit on otherwise allowable itemized deductions is reduced by onethird for tax years 2008 and 2009 the limit is reduced by twothir ds and for tax years after 2009 the limit is repealed complexity was the main reason cited by congress for the repeal of the pease provisions the jct estimated that the phasedin repeal of the pease provision would reduce federal revenues by 25 b illion over the fiveyear period issues some of the complexity of the current tax system can be traced to the attempt to accurately measure real net economic income ho wever this is not the case with the pep and pease provisions the pep and pease provi sions were adopted as means of raising additional revenue without having to explicitly raise marg inal income tax rates they were also designed so that the resultant tax increases were borne by taxpayers at the upper end of the income spectrum hence while repealing the pep and p ease provisions unambiguously reduces the complexity of the tax system it will also reduce federal revenues and affect the distribution of the tax burden in total the jct estimated that repealing both the pep and pease provisions would redu ce federal revenues by 33 b illion over the fiveyear budget horizon repeal of these provisions will also affect the distribution of the federal income tax burden although official estimates of the distributional effects of repealing the pep and pease provisions are available nong overnmental estimates show that the tax reductions from repeal of these two provisions are highly concentrated in the upper end of the income spectrum3 these estimates indicate that in 2010 the ta x benefits from repeal of these two provisions accrue to only 33 of all taxpayers and that those taxpayers have incomes in excess of approximately 150000 the largest average tax reductions around 19000 accrue to taxpayers with inco mes in excess of 1 million
