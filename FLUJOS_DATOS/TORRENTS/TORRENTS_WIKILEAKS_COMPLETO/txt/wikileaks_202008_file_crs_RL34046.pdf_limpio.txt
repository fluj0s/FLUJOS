did not take up the agreement during the period between the beginni ng of fy2008 october 1 2007 and the signing of the consolidated appropria tions act 2008 congress provided funding through series continuing resoluti ons generally at fy2007 funding levels on september 12 2007 the senate passed hr 3074 which provides 1059 billion after rescissions and other adjus tments for transportation and

scorekeeping adjustments this was 300 million less than 1 over the net total provided for fy2007 the dot request was 645 billion 13 billion 2 more than the amount provided for fy2007 this increase was largely for highway net 17 billion increase and transit net 447 million increas programs thes increases reflected the increase in the fy2008 authorized fundi ng level over the fy2007 level for these two programs which receive almost all of their funding from transportation trust funds however the request did not provide the full authorized funding level it was 631 milli on below the authorized level for highway programs and 309 m illion below the authorized level for transit programs the hud request was 356 billion 10 billion 3 less than the amount provided for fy2007 this reduction reflected the administrations continued effort to reduce or eliminate funding for num ber of hud programs that it regards as ineffective or inefficient secretary jacksons introductory letter to the fy2008 hud budget summary document noted in budget season marked by the presidents goal to continue to support what works and cut the federal budget deficit the fy2008 hud budget request demonstrates an effort to prioritize funding towards programs with measurable documented results1 the administrations fy2008 budget request included spending reductions that had also been proposed by the administra tion in previous budget requests without success these proposed reductions from fy2007 funding included roughly 1 billion from reductions in several hud prog rams and elimination of several other programs and roughly 1 billion from cuts to several dot programs among the programs proposed for reduc tions or elimination were dots airport grants 764 milli on amtrak 494 million and subsidies for air service to small communities 59 million programs huds community development funds 735 million housingfor the elderly 160 million and housing for the disabled 112 million programs

total house and senate action both the house and the senate have passed versions of hr 3074 the fy2008 appropriations b ill for t hud both chambers rejected the administrations proposed re ductions and provided increases for both dot and hud over both the fy2007 levels and the fy2008 requested levels the housepassed version of hr 3074 would provide total of 1044 billion 41 billion 4 more than

to bridges in response to the co llapse of an interstate highway bridge in minnesota after passage of the house version of the bill the conference agreement the conference agreement on hr 3074 recommended total of 1058 billion this is 55 billion 6 more than requested and 62 billion 6 more than the fy2007 enacted level the agreement recommends 667 billion for dot 22 billion more than

conference agreement was reporte d on november 13 2007 it was brought to the house floor on november 14 2007 and approved by vote of 270147 later that day the primary topics of discussi on during consideration of the agreement had to do with the time available to review the bill and additions made by conferees some members complained that not only d the rule that members should be given three days to review bill before voting on it been waived but also that the informal practice that members be given at least 24 hours to review bill was being ignored there were also criticisms of the number of earmarks in the bill and of the addition by conferees of some earmarks that had not been in either the house or senate passed versions of the bill prac tice known as airdropping earmarks complaints were also voiced about provision section 193 added by conferees that would prohibit any funds in the agreement from being used to provide budget justifications to any congressiona l committee other than the appropriationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34046crs4 committees prior to may 31 2008 in 2006 th office of management and budget began directing agencies to make their budg et

continuing resolution that provided fundi ng for those agencies for fy2007 pl 110 5 the president issued statement of administration policy on the conference agreement threatening to veto the bill for exceeding the level of funding requested by the administration the margin of passa ge of the bill in the house was less than the twothirds majority that woul d be required to override veto the consolidated appropriations act in december 2007 with 11 unfinished appropriations bills including the thud bill several of which faced veto threats from the president for exceeding the level of funding requested in the administration budget proposal congress decided to combine the unfinished appropriations bills into one consolidated appropriations act the legislative vehicle used was hr 2764 originally the department of state foreign operations and related programs appropria tions act 2008 the thud appropriations act became division k of the consolidated appropriati ons act after negotiations with the administration over the total level of spending in the bill congress agreed to reduce the overall level of spending in the bill leaving it up to each appropriations subcommittee to achieve the agreed upon reduction the thud committee did so through rescission of contract authority in certain programs and 2 rescission applied to the earmarked projects in the b ill see sections

httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34046crs6 changing appropriations subcommittee structures since 2003 the house and senate committees on appr opriations have reorganized their subcommittee structure three times in 2003 new subcommittee homeland security was added in or der to maintain the existing number of subcommittees at 13 the transportati on appropriations subcommittees were combined with the treasury postal serv ice and general gove rnment appropriations subcommittees becoming the subcommittees on transportation treasury and independent agencies in early 2005 the house and senate committees on appropriations again reorganized their subco mmittee structures the house committee on appropriations reduced its number of subcommittees from 13 to 10 this change included combining the transportation treasury and indepe ndent agencies subcommittee with the district of columbia subcommittee to the resulting subcommittee in addition jurisdiction over appropriations for th department of housing and urban development and the judiciary as well as several additional i ndependent agencies was added the subcommittee was then known as the subcommittee on transportation treasury housing and urba n development the judiciary district of columbia and independent agencies or tthud the senate committee on appropriations reduced its number of subcommittees to 12 the senate also dded jurisdiction over appropria tions for the departments of housing and urban development and the judiciary to the transportation treasury and independent agencies subcommittee the senate retained separate district of columbia appropriations subcommittee as result the areas of coverage of the house and senate subcommittees with jurisdiction over this appropriations bill were almost but not quite identical the major difference being that in the senate the appropriations for the district of columbia originate in separate bill at the beginning of the 110th congress in 2007 the house and senate committees on appropriations again reorgani zed their subcommittee structures the house and senate committees divide d the responsibilities of the tthud subcommittees between two s ubcommittees transportati on housing and urban development and related agencies thud and financial serv ices and general government whose jurisdiction included the treasury department the judiciary the executive office of the president the district of columbia and many of the independent agencies formerly under th jurisdiction of the tthud subcommittees these changes make yeartoyear comp arisons of transportation and housing and urban development appropriation bills complex as their appropriations appear in different bills in combination with various other agencies other factors such as supplemental appropriations for response to disasters such as the damage caused by the gulf coast hurricanes in the fall of 2005 and changes in the makeup of the department of trans portation portions
