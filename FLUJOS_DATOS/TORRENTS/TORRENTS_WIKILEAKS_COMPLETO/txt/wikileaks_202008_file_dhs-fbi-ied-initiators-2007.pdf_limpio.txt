explosive initiators 20 july 2007 ufouo prepared by the dhscbrne branch borders and cbrne threat analysis division and the fbithreat analysis unit u scope ufouo dhs and the fbi are providing this assessment for general terrorismrelated awareness it is intended to alert law enforcement personnel first responders and homeland security personnel about techniques terrorists can use to make improvised explosive initiators u key findings ufouo government controls for safety and security instituted over the past several years are making the procurement of commercial or military initiation devices to detonate explosives more difficult incidents in the united states and abroad indicate that terrorists and other criminals are instead improvising initiators these improvised initiators are easy to assemble and can be made from commonly available materials ufouo dhs and the fbi lack specific in formation that domestic or international terrorists intend to use explosive devices including those with improvised initiators against specific homeland targets even so law enforcement officials and homeland security personnel should be aware of unc onventional methods that terrorists could use to initiate explosives recognizing improvised detonators could be key in preventing an attack unclassifiedfor official use only unclassifiedfor official use only page 2 of 4 dhs unclassified u figure 1 tubes filled with explosives to be used as detonatorsu improvised in itiation devices ufouo strict laws and licensing requi rements in the united states the united kingdom and several other countries require regulation of the storage and sale of commercial and military blasting caps making it difficult for terrorists and other criminals to obtain them therefore these gr oups have resorted to improvising initiators ufouo the july 2005 london subway bombers used homemade peroxidebased explosives to create improvised initiators ufouo in july 2006 aut horities found improvised init iators at texas city texas apartment complex in which an explosion occurred an improvised initiator also was used in december 2003 bombing of california biotechnology company the fbi is investigating these incidents ufouo with increasing frequency directio ns for synthesis of triacetone triperoxide tatp and other homemade explosives to include proper safety protocols can be obtained from internet sites many of thes initiation devices have been described in terrorist handbooks and can be made by novice from readily available materials some of the devices discussed in recent terr orist literature are described below ufouo an improvised initiator that was posted on terroristaffiliated arabiclanguage website describes method of using groundup match heads containing sulfur and potassium chlorate to initia primary explosivetatpwhich then detonates larger main charge of picric acid ufouo figure 1 depicts improvised detonators displayed on terrorist website the secondary explosive is packed in the bottom of the plastic tube followed by the primary explosive after the explosives are loaded sulfur and potassium chlorate mixture is added light bulb filament connected to electrical wires and power source is used to ignite the sulfur and potassium chlorate mixture thereby initiating the detonation of the primary and secondary explosives unclassifiedfor official use only unclassifiedfor official use only page 3 of 4 ufouo figure 2 also posted on terroristaffiliated arabiclanguage website illustrates two versions of basic improvised electric blasting caps the top version uses two wires connected with tungsten filament wire surrounded by mixture of sugar and mercury fulminate the bottom version uses the base of small light bulb filament and mercury fulminate in both cases the mercury fulminate sets off the primary explosivelead azide which in turn detonates the insensitive secondary explosive cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine rdx both devices are insulated with duct tape and require an electrical power source to function u figure 3 miniature bulb improvised detonator ufouo figure 3 illustrates another method for making homemade initiators which also was retrieved from an online terrorist foru m the head of small light bulb such as those commonly used in decorations is cut off and the base filled with incendiary materials such as potassium chlorate and suga r the bulb head then can be reattached with adhesive attached to battery or other power supply this device can be used to initiate primary explosive such as tatp dhs unclassified unclassified

initiation devices ufouo the energy required to detonate explosive materials varies primary explosivessuch as lead azideare sensitive to friction heat and shock are easy to detonate and thus require little initiation energy secondary explosives such as dynamite and trinitrotoluene tnt are difficult to detonate and require more energy an initiator is used to detonate the more sensitive primary explosive which in turn detonates less sensitive secondary explosive the secondary explosive is the main charge responsible for the majority of the explosive power ufouo the initiator also known as blasting cap or detonator shown in figure 4 historically was believed to be the most critical component for constructing an improvised explosive device blasting cap is small explosive device containing primary explosives that is used to detonate larger quantities of less sensitive secondary explosives blasting caps are used in commercial mining and demolition and in military applications u outlook ufouo law enforcement officials and homeland security personnel need to be aware that terrorists and criminals may not use commercial off theshelf components such as blasting caps in their explosive att acks improvised explosive initiation devices are limited only by the resources and imag ination of the bomber recognizing the designs and the materials used to constr uct improvised initiators can help law enforcement personnel identify explosivesrelated activity u reporting notice u dhs and the fbi encourage recipients of this document to report information concerning suspicio
