has essentially become violent gang of bandits seeking financial gain12 brief history the original leader of asg bubakar janjalani fought in the afghan war against the soviet union in the 1980s returning to the philippines in 1990 he founded abu sayyaf on the is land mindanao the traditional home of philippine islamic radicalism to continue the cause there13 in 1998 janjalani was killed in

the group maintains its own fleet of speedboats to carry out th eir abductions and move quickly between island bases connections with other terrorist organizations links between asg and qaeda are the subject of debate it is generally believed that the group received funding from qaeda in the early 1990s through mohammad jamal khalifa brotherinlaw of osama bin den qaeda collaborator ramzi yousef operated in the philippines in the mid 1990s and reportedly trained abu sayyaf fighters however there is little info rmation about recent cooperation between qaeda and asg some have claimed that abu sayyaf is subordinate to qaeda but others contend that because of the group s blatant use of ransom and extortion for profit close association between the two is unlikely25 the 2002 edition of the us

groups in the ph ilippines such as the separatist moro islamic liberation front m ilf and the mnlf deny having links with abu sayyaf both distance themselves from asg because of its attacks on

brief history alaqsa is an offshoot of yasser arafats fatah and emerged just after the start of the second intifada in september 2000 the organizations goals are to create palestinian state nd eliminate the presence of israeli soldiers and settlers in the palestinia n occupied territories the group is secular in theory but has been known to recruit young militants espousing isla mic fundamentalism31 unlike hamas and palestinian islamic jihad alaqsa does not claim to be intent on destroying the state of israel32 initially alaqsa militants exclusively attacked israeli defense force and is raeli settlers but experts sa that by early 2002 aqsa began targeting civilians in israel33 this shift may have been due to the heightened intensity of the intifada including the increased death toll of palestinians and what aqsa militants believe to be israels targeted killing of the groups west bank leader raed karmi on january 14 200234 since then alaqsas attacks have become more severe and in january 2002 the gr oup introduced the use of female suicide bombers35 in january 2003 alaqsa militants conducted two suicide bombings in downtown tel aviv that killed 23 people and wounded approximately 100 since the start of the second intifada alaqsa militants have executed more attacks than even hamas and palestinian islamic jihad36 while other palestinian groups such as

group has softened its insistence on an independent tamil state declaring that it will accept solution that respects the principle of selfdetermination possibly an autonomous area for ta milspeaking peoples within federal structure see below brief history the liberation tigers of ta mil eelam were founded by the charismatic vellupillai prabha karan and arose in the 1970s as the strongest of number of tamil groups opposing discrimina tion against tamils by the dominant sinhalese ethnic group in 1983 in retaliation for the deat hs of thirteen sinhalese soldiers several thousand ta mils were killed in riots that marked the beginning of full scale separatist war in the ensu ing 20year war an estimated 64000 people were killed and between 800000 and 16 million persons were displaced the tamil tigers have gained control of portions of the northern and eastern provinces of sri lanka and have substantial arsenal including artillery mortars and antiaircraft weapons they also ve naval component with speedboats demolition teams and fishing boats272 the lttes most infamous element is the black tigers the 500 plus member highlyt rained unit that carries out the groups suicide attacks the ltte has engaged in large number of politi cal terrorist attacks and killings most notably including the assassinations of indian prime minister rajiv gandhi and sri lankan pr ime minister ranasinghe premad asa it is the only terrorist group ever to have assassina ted two heads of state and in december 1999 three days before reelection current presiden t chandrika kumaratunga lost vision in one eye to ltte suicide attack that killed 26 citing fundamental changes in intern ational attitudes to wards violence for political ends after the september 11 attack s experts say support and funding for the ltte from the tamil diaspora fell off drama tically this was apparently factor bringing this group to the negotiating table273 since december 2001 the ltte has largely respected cease fire negotiated with the sri lankan government in september 2002 the ltte and the columbo g overnment held their first peace talks in seven years in december 2002 both side s made what could be the most important breakthrough by issuing statement saying the parties have agreed to explore solution founded on the principle of intern selfdetermination in the areas of historical habituation of

would be accepting the idea of federalism for the first time on the 4th and 5th of november 2003 sri nkan president chandrika kumaratunga removed three top cabinet officials suspended parliament and deployed troops around the sri lankan ca pital of colombo the political crisis apparently was result of power struggle between president kumaratunga who represents the more hardline faction within the government and the more conciliatory elements led by prime minister ranil wickremesinghe after reviving the norwegian brokered peace talks in late 2001 wickreme singhe has made significant gains including permanen t ceasefire established and moreorless respected since february 2002 and several rounds of successful talks however fearing kumaratunga could veto any ag reement wickremesinghe proposed constitutional amendment the 19th that would eliminate the presidents power to dissolve the parliament kumaratunga and her supporters are opposed to any settlement that would establish federal system and infringe on sri lankan sovereignty they believe the norwegia n mediators are biased in favor of the rebels275 this crisis is as yet unresolved favored tactics the lttes tactics have ranged from full military operations to terrorist attacks against civilian centers and political assassinations inspired by the apparent success of icide bombings by hizballah in the latters campaign against foreign occupation of lebanon in the 1980s the ltte launched its first suicide attack in 1987276 the group subsequently conducted the bloodiest suicide campaign on record involving more than 150 attacks277 the ltte is also noted for the first and most active use of female suicide bombe rs who have carried out 3040 of the suicide attacks of the ltte278 antiamerican activities the ltte has

instance soosai the head of the sea tigers who carry out the lttes naval attacks claimed in november 2002 interview that qaedas attack on the uss cole in 2000 had been inspired by ltte naval operations282 state supporters and other sources of funding ltte has raised funds among the tamil diaspora in north america europe and asia and from smuggling and busine sses in sri lanka283 the most common estimates state that before 2001 the tigers collected up to 1 million month from expatriates in canada britain switz erland and australia making it among the most wellfunded terrorist groups in the world284 this flow of funds wa s apparently significantly reduced after the september 11th 2001 attacks originally designated as an fto october 8 1997 redesignated october 8 1999 october 5 2001 issues of concern for congress although it is still early to be certain this extremely violent territoriallybas ed group may be an example of group that has been moved by the war on terrorism mong other things toward negotiation and peaceful resolution the apparently drama tic falloff in funding after september 11th was an important development the evoluti on of the ltte and its relationship to the sri lankan government bears close scrutin in future months for example the extremely authoritarian nature of prabha karans rule over th ltte realm may pose difficulties for trying to reach

government based on the ancient model of the caliphates the groups believe the united states and its allies are the single greatest roadblock to that goal and therefore issued proclamation calling for all muslims to kill americans military or civilian in order to secure the expulsion of western influence from the muslim world359 following is selection from the second fatwa 1998 the ruling to kill the americans and thei r allies civilians and military is an individual duty for every muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it in order to liberate the alaqsa mosque and
