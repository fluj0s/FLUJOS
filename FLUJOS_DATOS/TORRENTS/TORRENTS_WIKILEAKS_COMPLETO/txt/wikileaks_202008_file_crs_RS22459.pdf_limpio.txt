as s 2381 and hr 4890 th is report provides comparative overview of some major features in three versions of the lliva hr 4890s 2381 as introduced hr 4890 as approved by the house budg et and rules committees house substitute and title i of s 3521 with provisions in the line item veto act of 1996 pl 1041301 on june 14 2006 the house budget committee held markup of hr 4890 and voted 249 to report the bill favorably as amended the next day the rules committee held markup and voted 84 to approve an amended version in effectively the same form as that approved by the budget committee meanwhile on june 14 2006 senator judd gre gg the chair of the senate budget committee and others held press conference to unveil th stop overspending acthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22459crs2 which contains modified version of the legislative line item veto act in title i as well as other budget process reforms on j une 15 2006 the bill was introduced as s 3521 as indicated in the following table there are some noteworthy differences among the versions some features in hr 4890s 2381 as introduced have been modified to lessen the presidents flexibility for example the or iginal bills had deadline for submission of special rescission messages and limit on the number of special messages the house substitute would require submission of special messages within 45 calendar days of enactment of the law wh ich contained the am ountsprovisions proposed for cancellation whereas s 3521 would allow the submission of special message up to one year following enactment on the other hand s 3521 would limit the president to four special messages per calendar year whereas the house substitute would set limit of five special messages per act or 10 for omnibus measures with respect to these features the house substitute would be more permissive in terms of total number of special messages whereas the senate bill would be more lenient in the timing of their submissions the period for withholding of funds after s ubmission of special message is another feature on which the bills differ the lliva as introduced would allow the president to withhold funds for up to 180 calendar days despite any congressi onal action s 3521 would limit withholding to 45 calendar days as would the house substitute however the house substitute version would allow the president 45day extension for total withholding period of up to 90 days in addition the lliva as introduced included sunset termination date whereas the hous substitute for hr 4890 provides that the expedited rescission authority would expire after six years october 1 2012 and s 3521 stipulates termination afte r four years december 31 2010 some changes in the house substitute nd in s 3521 may generate new concerns both versions appear to narrow the range of possible targeted tax benefits that may be proposed for cancellation hr 4890s 2381 as introduced along with provisions in pl 104130 would cover revenuelosing measures ffecting 100 or fewer beneficiaries the house substitute for hr 4890 would apply onl to revenuelosing provision affecting single beneficiary whereas s 3521 define s targeted tax benef its as affecting particular or limited gr oup of taxpayers also s 3521 and the 1996 act would have the joint committee on taxation identify the targeted tax benefits the house substitute would designate the chairmen of the ways and means and finance committees and hr 4890s 2381 as introduced would allow the president to do so by default another change in the house substitute version of interest is its relationship to the impoundment control act of 1974 known as ica title x of pl 93344 the version approved by the house committees would re peal the ica except for section 1013 deferral authority for the president and s ection 1016 suits by the comptroller general hr 4890s 2381 as in troduced and s 3521 would amend title x by striking part c line item veto act of 1996 and inserting the text of lli va of 2006 at issue is whether the framework for expedited rescissions in the lliva would augment or replace rescission authority accorded the president unde r the ica to propose rescissions at any time but with the release of funds after 45 gislative days absent congressional approvalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22459 crs3 table 1 comparison of selected provisions in three versions of the
