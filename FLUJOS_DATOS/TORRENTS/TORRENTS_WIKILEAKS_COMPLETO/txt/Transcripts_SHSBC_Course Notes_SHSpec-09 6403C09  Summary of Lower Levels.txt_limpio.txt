6403c09 shspec9 summary of lower levels there has to be bridge between level 0 and level v level v is becoming catchall level of everything necessary before level vi we are in danger of getting up to the esoteric levels of vi and leaving bridge resulting in thirty to forty ots and nothing else someone off the street is in position to recognize any part of an actual gpm scientology progresses on reality the lower levels are the contest of achieving reality you have to achieve reality before you can make anyone better there has to be bridge to clearing its done by gradients the pc must be walked from position of norecognition of reality through recognition of some reality eventually to an ultimate reality by gradients if you skip step in gradient you get an unreality unreality is associated with charge they are the same thing an ri that is too overburdened with charge inval suppress etc will be unrecognizable to the pc matter how obvious it may be to the auditor person with too much charge on his case cant understand or achieve reality he must have reality and understanding to go free understanding is related to reality per the arc triangle therefore understanding is related to charge which you have to get off case first in order to clear it someone who has got lots of charge will do very silly things stupidity comes about from charge ie unreleased unresolved stored masses of energy for this reason you cant get person to solve his problems by mere significance the significances dont enter into it it is persons overcharged environment that makes person too stupid to solve his problems the way out of the problem of not having bridge is to attain consistency of result it breaks an auditors heart for results to vary from pc to pc to get consistent result and to get reliable bridge to clear you have to attack the common denominator of aberration in all pcs not the particular quirks of particular pcs otherwise results wont be consistent and the least common denominator of all aberration is charge if charge is what causes stupidity then obviously what we should attack is charge so the lower levels levels 0 through iv have to be aimed at getting off charge in the absence of any ability on the part of the pc to face the actual source of the charge and erase it we cant get anything but trouble from trying to put the pc into the actual cause of the charge so at the lower levels you dont erase much charge you get the pc out of the charge destimulation is what we must aim for at levels 0iv so that the pc will be moved out of masses of charge we destimulate by attacking keyins we are not trying to get rid of the charge we are trying to pull the person out of it the person cant recognize the actual goal until he is separated from the keyins that stupefy him to get the pea under the mattresses ie the bank under the keyins and upsets you have to move the mattresses out of the way another analogy there is drain at the bottom of murky pool the pc cant see it or find it but he can drown trying what you have to do is to clean away most of the water and guck then the pc can find the drain and let the water and muck drain off you have to understand an ri for it to blow since it is thought not the symbols that represent it in english that is why session arc breaks inval or whatever can prevent ris from blowing life is all jammed up for person with ris and gpms the guy with his attention gruesomely and howlingly concentrated on some little tiny piece of mattress ticking see above must be shown that he can do something about the mattresses he can do something about it and he gets big reality and hope factor and his confidence resurges on this basis if he could get his attention off just one piece of mattress ticking for few minutes it would make him feel so different and so interestingly alive compared to how he has felt that now he gets big upsurge in reality and you can get him to tackle lot more youve got gradient in some cases the environment is so charged that the person cant take any attention off of it in this case you have to give the person change of environment to nonrestimulative environment here is an analogy say you have lion tamer faced with four ferocious lions and all he has is weak chair and he is running out of blank cartridges you are trying to interest him in biteproof suit but he cant put any attention on it you have to handle the lions first lion by lion and then sell the overwhelmed trainer the lionproof suit this would be type 3 pts handling the next level up above total overwhelm level i is the person who is so engrossed in his ptps that he is obsessively solving everything solving his pt such person goes around with wild strings of sol5tis i hi1 haadann the time if i do i could and soandso wouldnt and then id and theyd etc his solutions are so pyramided that you dont dare touch any corner of the pyramid or the lot will collapse you can handle this pc by using your lowest level of actual processing with itsa on solutions which takes over the automaticity of it see also pp 576577 above on auditing problems and solutions as well as 6404c21 shspec17 problems and solutions pp 614618 below level ii is the first processing level it contains repetitive processes and objective processes here there is danger of restimulating gpms unless you use only things that are not in actual gpms is there something that isnt in an actual gpm and can therefore be processed with impunity yes nouns and most pronouns some pronouns are in goals but at level ii you are far enough from the gpm that pronouns are generally safe but farther along you had better avoid such pronouns as myself i appears as rare item in gpms also but nobody has goals in the form to be noun nowhere in gpms do you have noun terminals and oppterms there are only nesses ities and tions adjectival and adverbial forms so you can process noun terminals with impunity think of communication would perhaps lead you straight into gpm think of communicator would not that is the missing secret of why the twentieth acc made clears nouns were processed in brackets nouns can only be locks therefore when you process them you get keyouts you would key out actual gpms by keying out locks on ris adding pronoun or noun can make an unsafe process safe what is an actual gpm or an actual ri it is mass with significance that is what you need to know at level iv therefore keyin is and will always be mass with significance almost anything in short that you could think of so masses with significances key in actual gpms which is why an environment is restimulative pt is one huge mass of restimulators present time is haunted area it is not the significance that keys in the gpm or the ri so to key one out you have to get masses plus significances if you have an actual ri with significance and someone keeps throwing the significance at you it will key you in so process like how could you helphow could i help would throw the pc into the ri to make it safe you have to put in help you or so that youve got mass plus significance running masses with significance is important because since masses with significance key in actual gpms running them keys out actual gpms at level i the mass with significance that the pc gets accustomed to is the auditor recall terminal would be good process arc straightwire works because and as long as you have terminal pronoun like someone or something in it and for the same reason you can prepcheck mass that has significance as long as its there and you are running it you can run it in brackets etc at level ii you have the pc do objective processes this fact plus the fact that control communication and havingness contain basic laws of life make 8c highlevel workable process the laws of life like control communication and havingness are senior to gpms but it is the wall that makes 8c workable it was the wall which since it was mass with significance had keyed in actual gpms so when you get the pc familiar with the wall the wall keys out and the gpm destimulates the auditing cycle itself is helpful and beneficial as well the auditing cycle is probably the basic process that makes level ii the pcs awareness of the auditor as friendly helpful mass with significance is also destimulative this awareness of the auditor tends to destimulate masses in general for the pc furthermore the auditor is not just mass with significance but also involves hope factor this is twopole universe as bucky fuller once taught lrh in elizabeth nj the twopole nature of communication showed up when lrh tried solo auditing himself on line plot he could go through it but there was ta one terminal gives ta one terminal plus thousandth of terminal gives bit of ta etc the auditor has to be real to the pc for there to be session and ta early on this isnt true so it is up to the auditor to remedy the unreality of the auditor to the pc ie to help the pc to find the auditor reality should increase with auditing new process introverts the pc enough so that at first the auditor is less real to the pc so at first you could get less ta than when the pc gets used to the process early on the pc is so charged up that he has reality on any other terminals and there is terminal for him to discharge against he is mobile standing wave such an only one gets ta since there is one else around charge has accumulated on this pc to the point where other terminal exists he is trapped in the standing wave of noflow this is an animated standing wave that blocks all incoming and outgoing flow the pc is stuck in series of wins or loses he has lost terminal that he could talk to so he solves it by being in continuous communication with that terminal now if people arent that terminal they are nobody or he wasnt in comm with that one either he mustnt be there and he mustnt communicate there are tremendous keyins involved here to get ta we would have to rehabilitate otherterminalism at level ii we would do it with pronouns since we cant assess for terminals at level iii you would assess by observation discussing things on list with the pc and getting all his considerations you dont do much with the assessment this applies to r3sc slow assessment and r2c assessment by dynamics etc along with terminal we get period of time time is very important to the degree that you can destimulate somatic by dating it this works because all restimulation depends on mistake in time the pc thinks that the time something occurred is now his head hurts in 1964 because he got clobbered in 1944 the basic lesson that you are trying to teach about engrams is that the pcs time is awry the only thing that fouls you up in handling an incident by just dating the incident and having it blow is the fact that it has already been wrongly dated eg the pc already wrongly dated it you can find the date of the wrong dating you can find what the wrong date was there can be several wrong dates then you can find the actual date on which the incident occurred in view of the fact that you cannot easily run terminals that have not been accurately assessed we can use this time factor at level iii especially if an assessment has been done by higherlevel auditor to get something to run in problems intensives which involve getting the time of the incident terminals etc problems intensive is explained on pp 134 and 249 above and in hcob 9nov6l the problems intensive use of the prior confusion we have made class iv clearing level it is an assessmenttype process to make keyedout clear using prepchecks you use r3 do list of the pcs goals find one that stays in so what if it is an implant goal or wrong goal it stayed in do terminals list for that goal both goal and terminal lists should be short lists listed to clean needle you dont get somatics from wrong goals you get them from right goals that are suppressed or invalidated so you list for the terminal with who or what would have the goal find terminal that is noun then prepcheck it up to point of highlevel cognition or more ta then do another goals list and find another terminal this cycle repeated will give us clear by keying out the actual gpm keep the goals lists for later on you could use higherclassed auditors to do the assessment steps the only thing that can key in an actual gpm is mass with significance so prepchecking the mass plus significance tends to key out the locks that keep the gpm connected to pt keep it light in agreement with the pcs reality so that you dont get him protesting or invalidating the actual goal if you sum up the terminal into service fac you probably have another family of processes to use the terminal was what the pc was using as makeguilty mechanism this is cousin to ow so if the terminal wont prepcheck you could use service fac brackets on it how could you make yourself rightothers wrong about it however it is not likely that you will have to do this you can key out actual gpms actual gpms are keyed in only by masses with significance and oddly enough there will be only one mass with significance in the environment that is really raising the devil with the pc when you get that one you can key him out you can fish him out of the bank so that he can go back and clean up the actual gpms
