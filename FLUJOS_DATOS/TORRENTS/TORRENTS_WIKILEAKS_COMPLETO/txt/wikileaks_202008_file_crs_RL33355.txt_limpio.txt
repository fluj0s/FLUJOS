issues and organizational alternatives updated july 19 2006 alfred cumming specialist in intelligence and national security foreign affairs defense and trade division congressional research service the library of congress intelligence reform at the department of energy policy issues and organizational alternatives summary concerned by reported security and counterintelligence ci lapses at the department of energy doe congress in 1999 established semiautonomous agency the national nuclear security administration nnsa to oversee does national securityrelated programs within nnsa congress established the office of defense nuclear counterintelligence to implement nnsas counterintelligence program although does existing office of counterintelligence develops ci policy for both agencies it implements policy only at nonnnsa facilities some studies have questioned the effectiveness of dual office structure in combating foreign espionage and have urged the adoption of an alternative structure several alternative organizational approaches have been discussed including the following one approach which doe has initiated merges under the control of new doe office of intelligence and counterintelligence does office of intelligence which assesses foreign nuclear weapons programs and does ci office under an anticipated second phase which would require congressional approval the new office would absorb nnsas ci program proponents assert that consolidation would improve command control and communication opponents argue that consolidation would dilute the focus on counterintelligence at does weapons labs under second approach the doe and nnsa ci programs could be consolidated under the control of the nnsa administrator proponents argue that semiautonomous agency such as nnsa by virtue of its independence is better able to implement ci measures than is doe opponents contend that such consolidation would undermine the effectiveness of counterintelligence program which they argue requires consolidated doewide program that includes nnsa and is under the direct control and supervision of the energy secretary under third approach doe could integrate its office of intelligence and ci office under new doe intelligence agency but allow nnsas ci office to remain as separate entity proponents argue that such an approach would not eliminate the current bifurcated structure preferred outcome but would enhance overall communication and coordination between the two existing programs opponents counter that only way to resolve coordination and communication problems is to consolidate the two ci programs within doe fourth approach would be to completely separate the doe and nnsa counterintelligence programs proponents suggest that such an approach would clarify the chain of command opponents assert that separation could further undermine coordination and communication final approach would be to maintain the status quo proponents suggest that the current structure is required for counterintelligence to receive focused attention at the weapons labs opponents counter that dual offices are inefficient and ultimately ineffective

alternatives introduction lapses in the department of energys does security and counterintelligence programs have plagued doe since 1977 when the department was established by merging 40 government organizations including the energy research and development administration and the federal energy administration1 the purpose in establishing the new agency was to focus the governments research centers on finding solutions to the energy crisis then confronting the united states the view according to some is that does establishment represented an unsuccessful attempt to merge more than 40 different government agencies and organizations an event from which doe arguably has never recovered2 congress created the semiautonomous national nuclear security administration nnsa in 1999 in the wake of recommendation by the presidents foreign intelligence advisory board pfiab that does weapons research and stockpile management functions should be placed wholly within new semi autonomous agency within doe that has clear mission streamlined bureaucracy and drastically simplified lines of authority and accountability3 since then however some observers have questioned whether the current dual counterintelligence ci office structure established by congress with doe operating one counterintelligence office and nnsa second independent one is the most effective structure to combat foreign espionage or as some have warned does such bifurcated structure expose both agencies to the possibility of future counterintelligence missteps because it contributes to coordination and communications problems4 one of does legacies has been its continuing struggle to strike an acceptable balance between open scientific inquiry and the need to protect highly sensitive and classified information that comprises many of those inquiries in the past this inherent tension led many observers to question whether the security of does highly 1 see presidents foreign intelligence advisory board foreword

and other concerns prompted the clinton administration to issue presidential decision directive pdd61 in which he ordered doe to fundamentally restructure its counterintelligence program pdd61 called for number of changes including one that placed the federal bureau of investigation fbi in charge of does counterintelligence program in 1999 congress went further by establishing the semiautonomous national nuclear security administration nnsa and giving it control over does national securityrelated programs including the departments sensitive weapons laboratories it also established separate counterintelligence office within nnsa one separate and independent of the does office of counterintelligence this new office was given responsibility for developing and implementing counterintelligence programs within nnsa although representing separate organizations the two ci offices share resources funds and personnel for some programs5 this partially bifurcated counterintelligence structure and its longterm effectiveness continues to generate concern in some quarters6 particularly given that doe and nnsa facilities are expected to remain major espionage targets of foreign intelligence services7 doe ci management prior to the 1999 reorganization in 1998 president clinton issued pdd61 out of concern about intelligence evidence indicating that the peoples republic of china prc had stolen secrets from does weapons laboratories aimed at strengthening does 8 counterintelligence program the presidents directive mandated the establishment of an independent counterintelligence office known as the office of counterintelligence oci within the department and placed it under the supervision of senior fbi official9 previously does counterintelligence program had been highly decentralized and according to some observers grossly underfunded10 the presidents directive also mandated that the head of the new office report directly to the energy secretary and that existing doe lab contracts be amended to 5 those ci programs sharing resources funds and personnel include analysis cyber counterintelligence evaluations inspections

program that month alamos national security laboratory scientist wen ho lee was fired after allegedly failing polygraph exam11 lee had also allegedly failed to notify doe officials about certain contacts with individuals in the prc to properly safeguard classified material and to cooperate with authorities with regard to certain security matters he pleaded guilty to one felony count of unlawful retention of national defense information the government dropped 58 additional counts12 in may of that same year bipartisan house select committee charged in report that was declassified that the prc had stolen us nuclear weapons secrets in june the presidents foreign intelligence advisory board pfiab criticized doe for the worst security record on secrecy that panel members said they had ever encountered13 the criticism was contained in pfiab report the first of its kind to be publicly released in the panels 38year history although the pfiab dismissed assertions of wholesale losses of nuclear weapons technology as result of espionage the panel did concur on balance with the us intelligence communitys assessment that the prc had stolen classified us nuclear weapons information that probably enabled the prc to accelerate its development of nuclear weapons14 11 the most recent alleged espionage case with doe connection involves alleged prc spy katrina m leung who the fbi said was 20year bureau informant they now suspect was double agent who provided classified material to the prc leung allegedly had affairs with two former fbi agents william cleveland jr who until he resigned

president responded to the panels report by establishing nnsa15 and placing it charge of does national securityrelated nuclear programs16 in restructuring doe and establishing nnsa congress created dual counterintelligence offices in doe and nnsa respectively within doe the alreadyexisting office of counterintelligence was codified and made responsible for establishing counterintelligence policy for both doe and nnsa the department further directed that the office be responsible for implementing ci programs at non nnsa facilities within nnsa the office of defense nuclear counterintelligence was created by statute to implement doe counterintelligence policy but only at nnsa facilities conferees further stipulated that presidentially appointed senate confirmed under secretary for nuclear security be designated to serve as nnsa administrator and that the administrator report directly to the energy secretary in approving this reorganization conferees cited the pfiabs report which blamed does counterintelligence failures on poor organization and failure of accountability conferees also noted the pfiabs criticism of the doe bureaucracy for being dysfunctional with regard to security matters and incapable of reform17 over time this partially bifurcated ci structure has produced debate over its effectiveness critics warn that there is lack of communication and coordination between the two offices that could undermine delicate counterintelligence investigations supporters of the dual office structure argue however that separate dedicated ci office within nnsa is necessary if counterintelligence protection of does national security laboratories is to receive the focus it warrants policy issues for congress in assessing the current debate over doe counterintelligence policy observers have generally focused on two interrelated questions first are doe and nnsa effectively managing their ci programs and second is the current dual office organizational structure within doe and nnsa flawed 15 nnsa facilities include the national security laboratories alamos national laboratory alamos nm lawrence livermore national laboratory livermore ca and sandia national laboratories

commission on science and security blamed dysfunctional management at doe for deficiencies in does security and counterintelligence programs including lack of clarity consistency and broad strategic planning the commission criticized doe for failing to systematically assess the espionage risk to its programs and establish appropriate protection priorities it also said that does investments in counterintelligence technology were inadequate and that its focus on cybersecurity threats was insufficient18 authors of second study issued in january 2003 concluded that both agencies were making progress in accomplishing their basic ci missions19 the office of the national counterintelligence executive ncix reported that doe and nnsa were working cooperatively particularly in the areas of strategic planning operating procedures and creating joint informationsharing systems both studies however contained expressions of concern about the current ci organizational structure20 is the bifurcated structure most effective with regard to the current bifurcated structure two views generally prevail according to the first view articulated by the pfiab in its 1999 report real and lasting ci reform is unworkable within does current structure and culture to achieve the kind of protection that these sensitive labs does national security laboratories must have they and their functions must have their own autonomous operations structure free of all the other obligations imposed by doe management21 accordingly the pfiab advocated the establishment within doe of semi autonomous agency with its own separate and coherent counterintelligence program and structure22 18 see commission on science and security science and security in the 21st century report to the secretary of energy on

bestsecurity at its worst june 1999 p 46 22 ibid p 47 crs6 the commission on science and security summed up the opposing view in its 2002 report concluding counterintelligence must be an enterprisewide function responsible for counterintelligence issues anywhere within the doe complex furthermore counterintelligence investigations analysis and all other counterintelligence information must be developed within unified organization and provided to the secretary and other senior officials without bureaucratic delays this vital function necessitates one organization with one chief of counterintelligence reporting to the office of the secretary23 the commission went on to warn that the current bifurcated counterintelligence structure will inevitably cause counterintelligence responsibilities to fragment thereby preventing the establishment of single strong departmentwide counterintelligence program24 ncix appeared to concur with the commissions view noting in its own study that this partial bifurcation of ci responsibilities at doe not only served to further complicate the formidable challenge of managing ci at doe but also endangered the goals and implementation of an effective ci program25 the ncix further stated in its report that in light of the history of ci investigations that foundered because of miscommunications within wellestablished agencies the twooffice arrangement has raised the odds of missteps and problems26 ncix blamed the current dualoffice structure for numerous daytoday problems including duplicative and at times contradictory messages to field sites misrouting of sensitive ci information related to investigations uncoordinated communications to the fbi and the intelligence community and dual sometimes inconsistent program tasking27 according to one law enforcement officer cited by ncix the twooffice configuration might some day lead the department to miss serious ci breach or prevent the conduct of an effective investigation28 the directors of central intelligence and the federal bureau of investigation fbi endorsed the ncix findings in separate letters to the ssci chairman and vice chairman29 23 see

under one senior counterintelligence officer who would report directly to the doe secretary and who would be responsible for departmentwide counterintelligence program30 doe secretary also expresses concern about bifurcated ci structure as part of his own review former doe secretary spencer abraham concluded in 2003 that the bifurcated structure was not optimal he proposed to congress that the departments two ci programs be consolidated under does control and that the combined office report directly to the energy secretary31 instead however the senate armed services committee in the fy2005 defense authorization bill authorized the doe secretary to consolidate the two offices but under the control of the nnsa administrator32 the house disagreed and the senate receded to the houses position in agreeing to retain the bifurcated structure conferees stated in their conference report the conferees note that the nnsa was originally set up as semiautonomous agency in large part to ensure that there would be adequate focus and priority placed on counterintelligence activities the conferees urge the counterintelligence offices at doe and nnsa to work together to ensure security of both doe and nnsa programs and facilities33 possible organizational alternatives congress of course could choose to maintain the current organizational structure34 if congress however ultimately decides to modify the structure number of organizational approaches have been proposed the range of alternatives currently being discussed include the following 1 consolidate the two counterintelligence programs under the control of new doe intelligence agency 2 consolidate the two counterintelligence programs under the control of nnsa 3 29 continued fbi director robert mueller

current bifurcated ci structure see hrept 108 767 p 897 accompanying hr 4200 the fy2005 defense authorization bill 34 congress in 2004 decided to leave the current bifurcated ci structure in place see hrept 108767 p 897 accompanying hr 4200 the fy2005 defense authorization bill crs8 establish new doe intelligence agency but maintain separate nnsa counterintelligence program 4 completely sever does and nnsas counterintelligence programs and 5 maintain the status quo alternative one consolidate doe and nnsa ci programs under new doe intelligence agency one approach which the doe secretary has initiated integrates does office of intelligence whose principal task is to assess other countries nuclear weapons programs35 and does ci office under newly created doe office of intelligence and counterintelligence36 the new office contains separate directorates responsible for intelligence and counterintelligence respectively in second phase nnsas ci office would be consolidated under the new intelligence agencys counterintelligence directorate such change would require congressional approval the house of representatives has approved measure as part of the fy2007 defense authorization act that would abolish nnsas ci office and reintegrate its functions into does new intelligence and counterintelligence office37 the senates version of the legislation is silent on the issue and house and senate conferees will likely address the matter proponents assert that such consolidation would produce more efficient bureaucratic structure one that would better serve does broader intelligence needs and responsibilities specifically they suggest that by creating new intelligence agency doe will be able to improve coordination and communication between those responsible for assessing foreign intelligence and those in charge of the departments counterintelligence programs proponents also contend that by merging does and nnsas ci programs under new doe intelligence agency the department will be able to clarify roles and missions and to improve coordination and communication opponents believe the current bifurcated ci program with doe and nnsa splitting responsibilities for counterintelligence is the programs principal weakness and favor consolidating the two ci offices within single office in doe they question however the advisability of placing such an integrated ci program under the control of new intelligence agency within doe doing so they contend will weaken the authority and effectiveness of those in charge of counterintelligence by superimposing new bureaucratic layer between them and the doe secretary currently the counterintelligence leadership has direct access to the energy secretary opponents also question does commitment and congresss willingness to 35 the department of energy describes its office of intelligence as the intelligence communitys premier technical intelligence resource in four core areas nuclear weapons and nonproliferation energy security science and technology and nuclear energy safety and waste see does office of intelligence web page at httpwwwintelligencegov1 members_energyshtml 36 although both proponents and opponents generally agree that merging nnsas ci program under new doe intelligence agency would likely require congressional approval some opponents also assert that the authority of the doe secretary to establish new intelligence agency without congresss approval is unclear 37 hr 5122 sec 3117 crs9 eliminate the current bifurcated ci structure which in their view is the principal reason that counterintelligence efforts are not effective failing to eliminate program bifurcation and leaving nnsas ci program in place while permitting does new intelligence agency to absorb the departments ci program would only worsen matters according to these opponents alternative two consolidate doe and nnsa ci programs under nnsa the second approach consolidates all doe ci implementation under nnsa38 proponents suggest that this approach would improve coordination because nnsa would be able to focus its resources on program implementation while leaving does counterintelligence office to concentrate on formulating ci policy they also assert that nnsa is best suited to implement does overall ci program because it already is responsible for overseeing does most sensitive classified activities by virtue of overseeing the departments weapons labs opponents counter that leaving in place two ci offices one responsible for policy and the other for operations will contribute to continuing confusion over roles and missions alternative three establish new doe intelligence agency but maintain separate nnsa ci program this approach would integrate the does office of intelligence and counterintelligence office under new doe intelligence agency that would develop ci policy for doe and nnsa but would implement it only at nonnnsa facilities nnsas ci office would continue to function separately and remain responsible for implementing ci policy at nnsa facilities proponents concede that this approach would fall short of preferred goal which would be to consolidate doe and nnsa counterintelligence programming but argue that it nevertheless would enhance counterintelligence efforts by improving communication and coordination between the two existing programs some opponents counter the department can eliminate problems of program fragmentation coordination and communication only by eliminating the current bifurcated structure alternative four sever doe and nnsa ci this approach is complete separation of doe and nnsa counterintelligence programs with does new intelligence agency providing ci support to doe through its ci directorate and nnsas program operating independently proponents suggest that this approach would clarify lines of authority for ci within doe and 38 the senate armed services committee approved provision that authorized the secretary of energy to consolidate does and nnsas counterintelligence offices within nnsa in the meeting of conferees the senate receded to the house bill which contained similar provision see sec 3119 of s 2400 the ronald w reagan national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2005 see also hrept 108767 108th cong 2nd sess p 897 2004 crs10 nnsa thereby improving communication and coordination opponents counter that such an arrangement would produce chaos in the field could lead to future problems of redundancy coordination and communications and could undermine relations with law enforcement39 alternative five maintain status quo under this approach does office of counterintelligence would continue to be responsible for developing ci policy across doe including the nnsa but implementing that policy only at nonnnsa facilities nnsas counterintelligence office would continue to implement ci policy at nnsa facilities proponents of the status quo point to congressional concern in 1999 that doe was failing to focus necessary and appropriate attention on counterintelligence the semiautonomous nnsa and its counterintelligence office they argue were established for the express purpose of having one entity outside of doe focus on and be held accountable for implementing ci policy at does sensitive nuclear and national security programs including its weapons labs the current structure they assert accomplishes that goal while maintaining reasonably close integration of program activities with does counterintelligence office opponents counter that the current bifurcated structure produces inefficiency confusion unnecessary contention and miscommunication40 they also suggest that in some areas the nnsa structure within doe has exacerbated the general problem of too many layers in doe41 39 see national counterintelligence executive an assessment of the effectiveness of the division of the ci programs at the department of energy and the national
