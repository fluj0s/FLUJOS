permanent federal income tax credits effective since tax year 1998 for qualified postsecondary education expenses the hope scholarship credit and the lifetime learning credit the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 authorized temporary income tax deduction for higher education expenses which was extended from december 31 2005 to december 31 2007 in the tax relief and health care act of 2006 the hope credit was introduced to help ensure that students have access to the first two years of undergraduate education the lifetime learning credit and tuition and fees deduction provide support for students in any year of undergraduate and graduate study they are unique in that they are available to individuals taking occasional courses only one of the three tax benefits may be taken in the same tax year for the same eligible students qualified expenses key features of the education credits and deduction dictate who the provisions benefit and the value of assistance they confer among these are the nonrefundable nature of the credits ie persons must have income tax liabilities which must exceed the maximum amount of the credits to claim their full value the deductions availability whether or not taxpayers take itemized deductions and the statutory limits on benefit amounts and on taxpayers income accordingly middle and upper middleincome individuals are the targeted beneficiaries of these tax incentives all three benefits apply to the tuition and fees required for enrollment that are not offset by grant aid eg pell grants and scholarships and other tax benefits eg coverdell education savings accounts and section 529 plans the value of the hope credit is maximum of 1650 per student for tax year 2007 the lifetime learni ng credit 2000 per return since 2003 the value of the deduction depends on taxpayers marginal tax rates and it was available to persons higher up the income scale than typically served by the credits the deduction covers qualified expenses of up to 4000 per return in 2007 although smaller deduction of up to 2000 is available to somewhat higherincome taxpayers with the introduction of these tax benefits individuals can now receive substantial amounts of federal financial assistance for postsecondary education from two parallel systemsthe federal income tax system and the traditional student aid delivery system which provides aid such as grants loans and work opportunities the traditional system helps students meet current expenses the tax system requires families to make outlays that are reimbursed through tax reductions determined near the end of or after an academic year tax benefits may offer streamlined delivery of aid while most other aid is delivered through relatively cumbersome and laborintensive processes some criticize the co mplexity of the tax process however and the availability of the tax benefits adds another system that students and families must navigate and learn to coordinate with any traditional aid received httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31129g10g146g144g145g142g155g561g7g141g158g140g138g157g146g152g151 g561g22g138

act of 1997 tra pl 10534 established two permanent federal income tax credits for qualified postsecondary education expenses the hope scholarship credit and the lifetime learning credit they became available to taxpayers filing returns for 1998 and thereafter the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra pl 10716 established new temporary tax deduction for higher education expenses beginning in 2002 it was extended to december 31 2007 in the tax relief and health care act of 2006 pl 1094321 at present there are two parallel systems through which the federal government provides assistance for postsecondary education attendancenamely the traditional student aid delivery system and the federal income tax system the major higher education act hea title iv programs that provide federal aid are the pell grant program an estimated 14 billion in grant aid for fy2007 and the federal family education loan and direct loan programs an estimated 64 billion in new loan volume for fy2007 2 the value of the higher education credits and tuition deduction places them among the largest sources of federal support to meet the costs of postsecondary education internal revenue service irs data show that taxpayers took 61 billion in education tax credits and 108 billion in higher education deductions on their 2005 federal income tax returns there are important distinctions between the tax system as mechanism for providing benefits for postsecondary education expenses and the traditional student aid delivery system tax incentives flow through system that is dependent upon the tax status of filing units and the level of qualified higher education expenses they incur tax benefits typically are not realized until after sometimes well after education spending has occurred benefit calculations are independent of any direct measurement of the ability to pay for postsecondary education further the tax incentives are not subject to annual appropriations in contrast federal assistance provided through the traditional delivery system consists of grant loan and work aid much of this aid is awarded directly to students while some is controlled and disbursed by financial aid officers at postsecondary institutions substantial portion of this assistance is awarded on the basis of students financial need 3 finally significant portion of this assistance is subject to annual appropriations this report is intended to provide information about the direct assistance for education expenses provided through the federal income tax system thereby placing hea student aid programs in broader context the key features of these tax pr ovisionswhich largely dictate whom they assist 1 information on legislative activity during the 110th congress pertaining to the deduction and other education tax benefits enhanced temporarily by egtrra is provided in crs report rs21870 education tax benefits are they permanent or temporary by linda levine 2 minority of new loan volume consists of federal funds the majority is private capital supported by federal loan guarantees and subsidies 3 while still dominant the portion of student aid that is being awarded dependent on need may be declining as reported by the advisory committee on student financial assistance at the state level new grant aid has shifted steadily in favor of meritbased aid and against needbased aid access denied restoring the nations commitment to equal educational opportunity february 2001 p 8 the committee reports that 186 of state grant aid funds is now meritbased

qualified higher education expenses4 initially the credit for each eligible student was 100 of the first 1000 of qualified expenses and 50 of the second 1000 of such expenses for maximum benefit of 1500 the 1000 figures became indexed to inflation after 2001 the formula specified in the tra for this purpose resulted in the hope credits maximum value rising to 1650 per student in tax year 2006 ie 100 of the first 1100 in qualified expenses and 50 of the second 1100 1650 it remains at this level for tax year 2007 taxpayers can claim the credit for qualified higher education expenses of each eligible student for whom they claim tax exemptions including themselves their spouse and dependent children5 eligible students must have been enrolled on at least halftime basis for at least one academic period during the tax year in higher education program leading to degree certificate or credential they cannot have finished the first two years of undergraduate education and the credit can only be claimed for their first two years of study 6 individuals with federal or state felony conviction for drug possession or distribution are not eligible for the credit qualified higher education expenses are defined as tuition and fees required for enrollment at institutions eligible to participate in us department of education ed student aid programs including accredited public private and proprietary postsecondary institutions they include those fees required as condition for enrollment that are paid to the institution thus fees for courserelated books supplies and equipment as we ll as activity fees are included only if they are paid to the institution room and board medical expenses including student health fees and transportation are among the costs excluded from coverage qualified tuition and fees expenses must be reduced by the amount of nontaxable educational assistance exclusive of loans and gifts that an eligible student receives this includes education assistance that is excluded from taxpayers gross income eg pell grants scholarships veterans educational benefits and employerprovided tuition reimbursements the amount of the hope credit is gradually reduced for individuals whose modified adjusted gross income 7 for 2007 is between 47000 and 57000 for those filing joint returns between 4 only individuals with income tax liability can benefit from nonrefundable tax credit nonrefundable credit cannot be worth more than the amount of the tax liability in cont rast if the value of refundable credit exceeds tax liability the federal government pays the taxpayer the amount of the difference between the two 5 expenses paid by dependent or someone other than the filer spouse or dependent are treated as if paid by the taxpayer 6 the first two years of postsecondary education can include two oneyear certificate programs see 67 federal register 76687 december 26 2002 where the hope and lifetime learning credits final regulations are published 7 in general taxpayers modified adjusted gross income equals their adjusted gross income agi for taxpayers who exclude income earned abroad or from certain us territories or possessions modified agi is their agi increased by continued httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31129g10g146g144g145g142g155g561g7g141g158g140g138g157g146g152g151 g561g22g138

with student who qualifies for the dependent exemption might decide not to make such claim in the case of the credit thereby enabling the student to claim the credits full value if heshe has income below the phaseout threshold and has income tax liability against which credit could be taken as previously noted the various income thresholds are indexed to inflation the hope credit cannot be claimed for student if the lifetime learning credit is claimed for the same student in the same tax year individuals for whom hope credit is claimed cannot concurrently benefit from the deduction for qualified higher education expenses taken for the same student in the same tax year for additional information on coordination of the hope credit with other postsecondary education tax benefits eg coverdell education savings accounts and section 529 programs and for comparison of the three education tax benefits that are the subject of this report see table 1 below

fees for qualified expenses paid on or after january 1 2003 the credit per tax return is maximum of 2000 calculated as 20 of the first 10000 in qualified expenses unlike the hope credit the value of the lifetime learning credit is not adjusted for inflation8 also unlike the hope credit students eligible for the lifetime learning credit are those enrolled in one or more courses of undergraduate or graduate instruction to acquire or improve job skills there is limit on the number of years for which the lifetime learning credit may be claimed like the hope credit the lifetime learning credit is available to individuals who pay the qualified higher education expenses of eligible students for whom they claim exemptions on their tax returns qualified tuition and related expenses are calculated and treated in the same fashion as they are under the hope credit including the reduction for nontaxable educational assistance the lifetime learning and hope credits share the same incomeeligibility levels and income phaseout ranges the lifetime learning credit cannot be claimed for student if the hope credit is claimed for the same student in the same tax year individuals for whom lifetime learning credit is claimed cannot concurrently benefit from the tax deduction for qualified higher education expenses the lifetime learning credit also coordinates with other education tax benefits in the same manner as the hope credit continued those excluded amounts 8 the tra had set the credit for tax years 19992002 at 20 of the first 5000 of qualified expenses or 1000 at most

education expenses for eligible students became effective in 20029 after expiring on january 1 2006 it was reauthorized retroactive to its expiration and to december 31 2007 the maximum deduction is 4000 per return this deduction is available to individuals with an agi of up to 65000 130000 in the case of filers of joint returns there is smaller deduction of 2000 for taxpayers whose agi was more than 65000 but not more than 80000 more than 130000 but not more than 160000 for those filing joint returns 10 neither the amount of the deduction nor the income ceilings are adjusted for inflation the amount of the deduction is not gradually reduced by formula as the agi of taxpayers rises within an income range although the deduction reduces taxpayers agi dollar for dollar it ultimately is worth different amounts to taxpayers depending upon their marginal tax rates11 for example the deduction is worth 450 in reduced tax liability to taxpayer in the 15 tax bracket with 3000 in qualified expenses 015 x 3000 for an individual in the 25 tax bracket with the same amount of qualified expenses the deduction produces maximum of 750 in tax savings 025 x 3000 taxpayers can take the deduction if they pay their own qualified higher education expenses or those of their spouses or dependents for whom they claim tax exemptions as with the lifetime learning credit there are limitations on the level of postsecondary education enrollment undergraduate and graduate enrollment or the intensity of enrollment single course of study halftime enrollment or fulltime enrollment the qualified higher education expenses for the deduction are defined as they are for the two credits the deduction cannot be taken for the qualified higher education expenses of any individual for whom the hope or lifetime learning credits ar claimed for the most part qualified higher education expenses are reduced by taxfree educational assistance and coordinated with other tax benefits in the same fashion as they are for the credits see table 1 for more detail 9 an abovetheline deduction is taken as an adjustment to taxpayers gross income on irs 1040 form and therefore can be claimed whether or not the taxpayer itemizes deductions deduction affects the calculation of agi unlike credit it does not directly affect income tax liability 10 unlike the credits if an eligible student qualifies as dependent of hisher parentsregardless of whether the parents take an exemption for their childthe parents can take the higher education deduction only if they actually pay the qualified expenses even if the dependent student paid the qualified expenses one could claim the higher education deduction 11 the marginal tax rate is the tax rate applied to the last additional dollar of income

other forms of federal financial aid represent investments in human capital that are expected to yield benefits for society beyond those realized by individual recipients12 the tax benefits are not

and the deduction which can be claimed for an unlimited number of years support traditional and nontraditional students regardless of their enrollment or degree status parttime and fulltime students can qualify as can graduate undergraduate and nondegree students as consequence the lifetime learning credit and the deduction occupy unique niche in the student aid landscape the two tax incentives are widely available benefits that can support students who are taking occasional courses but are not necessarily enrolled in an educational credential or degree program they may be major source of direct financial aid available to many indivi duals who want to take courses periodically over the course of their careers to upgrade their skills 13 even though the lifetime learning credit and the deduction have been designed to provide aid to wide array of students they likely will provide good deal more benefit to traditional undergraduate and graduate students on per year basis than to sporadic coursetakers this is due to the fact that the credit covers maximum of 2000 of eligible expenses incurred within years time for example and traditional students are likely to incur more costs however sporadic coursetakers can receive support for an unlimited number of years and may ultimately gain more value from the credit over series of years than traditional students 13 among other more narrowly targeted benefits for indivi duals seeking to upgrade skills is employer education assistance httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31129g10g146g144g145g142g155g561g7g141g158g140g138g157g146g152g151

eligible for more than one of these benefits taxpayers likely will attempt to choose the one that provides the maximum value of tax savings to them in general when examining the relative worth of the benefits the following rules of thumb apply for those middleincome taxpayers filing joint return with one student who is eligible for the hope credit and with incomes below the phaseout range the hope credit generally is more valuable than lifetime learning credit if qualified expenses are less than 8500 for families with more than one student eligible for the hope credit the better choice for each child between the hope credit and the lifetime learning credit will depend upon the qualified expenses of the additional students for those middleincome taxpayers filing joint return with student eligible to receive either credit and with incomes below the phaseout range the value of the higher education deduction never exceeds that of the hope credit and only exceeds that of the lifetime learning credit when the amount of qualified expenses is 4000 or less and the taxpayers marginal tax rate is more than 20 as income increases the income thresholds at which the credits and deduction are eliminated become increasingly important in determining who can receive which benefit the figures in table 3 can be used to illustrate some of these points for marriedcouple family in the 15 tax bracket with one child eligible for the hope credit who is attending college at which tuition and fees total 10000 in tax year the lifetime learning credit is worth its maximum of 2000 in tax savingshigher than either the hope credit maximum of 1650 which is reached when qualified expenses meet or exceed 2200 or the deductions value of 600 015 x 4000 the maximum amount of qualified tuition and fees that can be subtracted from income if the same family had second child who also is eligible for the hope credit and who is attending twoyear public institution th at charges tuition of 1000 then the hope credit would be the better choice for the second child 1000 and the lifetime learning credit would continue to be the better choice for the first child 2000 the total tax savings for the family from the education credits would be 3000 other combinations of the credits or of the credits and the deduction would produce smaller tax savings for the family the importance of the amount of qualified expenses in determining the relative value of the three tax benefits can be seen by looking at each expense level in the tables first column and then across the corresponding row it is not until qualified tuition and fees are 8500 that the lifetime learning credit produces more tax savings than the hope credit for family with one eligible student 1700 and 1650 respectively becaus egtrra capped the maximum amount that may be taken as an adjustment against income at 4000 the reduction in income tax liability yielded by the higher education deduction cannot match the tax savings of the hope credit the comparative value of the deduction and the lifetime learning credit for families is more complex being affected both by the deductions limit on qualified expenses and taxpayers marginal tax rate the 4000 tuition and fee cap means that the higher education deduction produces maximum reduction in income tax liability of 600 for family with 15 marginal tax rate and of 1000 for family with 25 marginal tax rate both of whom have an agi below the credits income phaseout range at 4000 in qualified expenses the lifetime learning credit

1999 half of the higher education tax credit beneficiaries were not able to take the full credit for which they were eligible14 insufficient tax liability to claim an education credits maximum value can come about not only through low income levels but also through compe ting credits in other words other tax credits for which an individual is eligible such as the dependent care tax credit may reduce the filers income tax liability below the amount of the education credits for instance if tax filer has 1000 in tax liability and qualifies for 480 dependent care tax credit 1500 hope credit for one student and 1000 lifetime learning credit for another student the filer can only receive total tax benefit of 1000 ie the tax liability is less than the aggregate of credits for which the taxpayer is eligible taxpayers seeking to claim the education credits also may be affected by the alternative minimum tax provisions that limit the aggregate nonrefundable personal credits taxpayer can claim as result some of these taxpayers may find the deduction to be preferable option in contrast to the credits which reduce an individuals tax liability on dollar for dollar basis the deduction reduces taxpayers agi as previously shown the potential impact of that reduction on tax liability is realized through the taxpayers marginal tax rate further some taxpayers may have such limited tax liability before the application of the deduction that its actual benefit will be small

the qualified higher education expenses are less than the maximum allowable tax benefits will not be able to claim their full benefits at many public institutions low tuition and fee levels are likely to limit the ability to realize the full tax benefits for the hope credit qualified higher education expenses must be at least 2200 for the maximum credit to be realized as noted in table 3 twoyear public institutions have tuition and fees in 20072008 that average about that level 2361 realizing the full value of the lifetime learning credit may be difficult for many students at public institutions in general qualified expenses have to be at least 10000 to actualize the maximum lifetime learning credit of 2000 while the av erage tuition and fees at fouryear public institutions in 20072008 is much lower 6185 for the deduction taxpayer can claim the maximum taxratedependent value only if qualified expenses are 4000 at 4000 only the average tuition and fees at twoyear public institutions are less the average tuition and fees of 6185 at fouryear public institutions in 20072008 is somewhat greater than the cap on qualified expenses in contrast the average tuition and fees of 23712 at fouryear private institutions in 20072008 far exceeds any of the tax benefit maximums tuition and fees are probably sufficiently high at many of these institutions to pose barrier on their own to realization of the full value of the credits and deduction the ability to capture the full value of these tax benefits is further limited by their being claimed to reimburse students and their

students ie students whose families are expected to contribute resources toward postsecondary education costs students attending institutions with low tuition and fee charges and receiving large pell grants may have little or net qualified expenses remaining for which to claim an education credit or deduction at the same time these lowincome students and their families may not have much if any tax liability also restricting their ability to benefit from the credits or deduction as result students attending higher cost institutions and those receiving relatively little grant or scholarship aid

benefits represented departure from the federal governments more common practice of primarily making aid available through the traditional student aid delivery system given that the federa l government is the primary provider of direct aid to students and tax benefits have quickly grown to become major component of the federal aid effort considerable discussion has emerged related to the merits of providing aid through the tax system

support toward meeting the costs of college through the federal income tax system has number of advantages and disadvantages relative to the traditional process of providing grants loans and work support for example one issue that distinguishes the traditional student aid system and the tax system is the timing of the awards the traditional system provides aid such as grants and loans prior to the arrival of tuition bills tax benefits in contrast require families to make an initial capital outlay which is reimbursed later in the academic year through tax refunds or reduced tax payments this difference may limit the attractiveness of the tax system at least for lowerincome students who may not be able to meet current expenses that will be partially or fully reimbursed by later tax benefit nevertheless it is possible for taxpayers to adjust their tax withholding throughout the year to realize the tax benefits earlier this would require some sophistication on the part of taxpayers further for students enrolling in consecutive years the tax benefit for previous year may be provided in time to help meet the upcoming years educational expenses finally to the extent that these tax benefits are available primarily to middle and upper middleincome individuals the timing issue may be less important tax credits and deductions offer the advantage of streamlining the delivery of funds to aid recipients who directly claim their financial assistance as part of their annual taxfiling process whereas traditional student aid administered by title iv is delivered through relatively

considerable effort on the part of the applicant financial aid officers ed personnel and loan servicers in some cases these individuals must submit and gather financial data certify student eligibility for aid monitor enrollment status disburse funds and deal with refunds and account reconciliation still some have criticized the complexity of the process for taxpayers seeking to claim the tax benefits15 further there are institutional reporting requirements associated with these tax provisions that require institutions to report either the aggregate amount of payments received or the aggregate amount billed for qualified expenses during the calendar year with respect to individuals enrolled for any academic period 16 given the extensive system already in place the addition of the tax benefits albeit delivered through an arguably more streamlined process may actually increase the complexity of the overall national effort to help students and their families meet college costs with the availability of the tax credits and the deduction students and their families seeking to realize as much federally financed support as possible for college expenses must navigate not only the traditional financial aid system but also the federal income tax system potentially the tax benefits may more likely be claimed successfully by sophisticated filers

federal student aid or the amount of federal student aid that the student receives specifically hea section 480a2 specifies that in calculating what student and his or her family are expected to contribute toward college costs the expected family contribution or efc the tax credits cannot be considered income or assets for purposes of that calculation further section 480j2 provides that in determining students need for hea title iv aidcost of attendance minus the efc and all other nontitle iv assistancethe credits are not to be included as nontitle iv assistance this is important because inclusion of the credits as nontitle iv assistance would in effect reduce students need thereby also affecting his or her eligibility for and the amount of title iv needbased aid it should be noted that there is comparable language in the hea governing the interaction between the higher education deduction and the title iv assistance as result it is possible that some taxpayers who can take the deduction will in turn be found to have less financial need for traditional student aid tax benefits and title iv aid may interact in the federal funding process it is possible that in congressional deliberations over the budget and spending for federal programs the forgone tax revenue associated with the tax benefit provisions may have negative impact on the willingness or ability of congress to devote funds to the traditional federal student aid programs 15 see for example thomas r wolanin rhetoric and reality effects and consequences of the hope scholarship the institute for

officers are far from uniform in whether or how they consider the tax benefits when packaging financial aid for students indeed it is not clear whether the majority actively factors the tax benefits into this process at all financial aid officers who want to factor the value of the tax credits into the aid package may find the effort complicated by the absence of information about the actual value of the benefits students will receive as noted earlier because the actual value of the tax benefits are not known until they are claimed generally later than april 15 of the year after the payment for qualified expenses are made it would be next to impossible to determine their value during the aid packaging process that generally occurs during the late summer months certain other aspects of the design of the tax benefits may make it difficult to infer their value before they are claimed the actual value of the tax benefits to recipients is affected by series of offsets and limitations that are built into the design of the tax system for example as explored earlier recipient must have sufficient tax liability to claim the credit and even then the value of the credit may be reduced by competing credits that can be claimed the potential effects of these internal offsets and limitations make it hard for financial aid officers to project the value of the credit when packaging aid thus if there are discrepancies between the credits actual value and the value assumed by financial aid officers who would take the tax provisions into account in packaging aid recipients may be awarded more or less aid than necessary

g3g146g141g561 the effect of the tax benefits on the setting of tuition levels by states is largely unknown state higher education officials face challenges similar to those of financial aid officers stemming from the hidden value of tax credits they must make decisions about tuition levels and about the structure and targeting of state aid programs whic h can be shaped in part by assumptions about the value of aid they expect will be available to students precisely gauging the net financial benefit flowing from the tax provisions is problematic however some states have considered raising the tuition and fees in some schools to enable their students to capture as much of the tax benefits as possible17 some states have also considered targeting their state grant programs in ways that avoid inhibiting students ability to capture the full value of other credits such decisions regarding tuition and aid will affect whether and how the tax benefits will enhance recipients ability to finance postsecondary education 17 one study that explored available information on this issue concludes that the hope scholarship provides resources that are an incentive for private and public institutions of higher education to increase tuition or to reduce aid to students indeed the hope scholarship be nefits institutions of higher education only if they raise tuition or decrease student aid several states have considered or undertaken strategies to capture the hope scholarship through either tuition increases or aid reduction wolanin rhetoric and reality p 29 another report suggests that the credits inception was associated with disproportionately large tuition increases at schools whose prior tuition levels were less than needed to maximize the hope credit long the impact of
