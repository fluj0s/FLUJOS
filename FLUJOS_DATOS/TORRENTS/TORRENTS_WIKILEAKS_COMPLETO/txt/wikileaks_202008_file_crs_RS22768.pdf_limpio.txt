state condoleezza rice was said to have promised moderate arab regimes that the united states would become more engaged in the israeliarab peace process in exchange for their support for countering increasing iranian influence in the middle east1 the secretary made eight trips to the region during the year initially to work with israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian authority pa president mahmud abbas on developing political horizon that would lead to resumption of the longstalled performancebased road map to permanent twostate solution to the israelipalestinian conflict issued by the international quartet the united states european union united nations and russia on april 30 2003 2 each side maintains that the other has not fulfilled its obligations under the threephase road map independent observers agree that neither has done so phase i calls inter alia for israel to freeze all settlement activity including natural growth of settlements and for the palestinians to confront terrorists and dismantle their infrastructures from february until june 2007 palestinian unity government included hamas us designated foreign terrorist organization fto and hamass participation impeded rices efforts olmert refused to negotiate with abbas as long as hamas failed to recognize israel disavow violence and accept prior israelipalestinian agreements ie met conditions that the quartet laid down in january 2006 after hamas won the palestinian parliamentary elections in june 2007 however palestinian infighting ended with hamas in complete control of the gaza strip and abbas reacted by dissolving the unity government the bush administration and the israeli government viewed the ouster of hamas as an opportunity to return to diplomacy on july 16 president bush promised to support abbas in order to lay the foundation for serious negotiations toward the creation of palestinian state the president called for an international meeting of representatives from nations that support twostate solution reject violence recognize israels right to exist and commit to all previous agreements between the parties when announced the meeting was intended mainly to review progress toward building palestinian institutions and to look for ways to support further reform although participants also were to provide support for the parties in their bilateral negotiations on palestinian state 3 olmert and abbas and later negotiating teams led by israeli foreign minister tzipi livni and former palestinian prime minister ahmed quray alternate spellings qurei qureia met over the next four months to work on declaration of principles on final status or core issues jerusalem borders settlements refugees security and water olmert sought to keep the declaration vague in order to avoid concessions that would prompt his domestic political opponents to bring down his government while abbas wanted it to address core issues substantively in order to show his people that negotiations could lead to an improvement in the quality of their lives an end to the occupation and the establishment of palestinian state they failed to produce document 1

the us naval academy in anna polis md attendees included members of the arab league followon committee algeria bahrain egypt jordan lebanon morocco qatar saudi arabia sudan syria tunisia and yemen the g8 group of industrialized countries permanent members of the security council fellow members of the international quartet members of the organization of the islamic conference and representatives of the international monetary fund and the world bank the size of the gathering signaled strong international support for peace process the size of the arabs turnout was attributed to their need for strategic alliance with the united states against iran but also may have indicated support for abbas over hamas the presence of saudi arabian foreign minister prince saud faisal was considered significant because the desert kingdom is prowestern arab state that does not have relations with israel the foreign minister clearly stated that normalization of relations would come as result of peace and not before it4 the attendance of syria suggested that the bush administration which had been trying to isolate damascus because of its support for terrorist groups its destabilization of lebanon and its alliance with iran may now be willing to engage syria and revive its dormant peace track with israel saudi arabia and other arab governments reportedly had demanded that syria be invited to annapolis and that the conference call for comprehensive peace that would include the return of the golan heights syria would only attend if the golan were on the agenda and sent deputy foreign minister faisal miqdad while almost all other governments were represented by foreign ministers miqdads rank may have reflected belief that renewed peace process would not address the golan however russia reportedly wants followup meeting in moscow to address syrias concerns olmert publicly has said that conditions have not yet matured for the start of dialogue with syria but israel and syria have been talking via turkish and russian intermediaries iran and hamas which have the potential to act as spoilers of the peace process were conspicuously missing from annapolis iran denounced the conference before during and after it took place its influence may have been felt in the absence of the shiiteled maliki government of iraq an invitee which declined to send representative but which said that it would welcome peace yet president mahmoud ahmadinejad was unable to dissuade syrian president bashar asad his presumed ally from sending representative for their part hamas officials described the meeting as useless and stridently escalated their rhetoric vowing not to abandon their goal of palestinian state from the river to the sea ie destroying israel 5

read joint understanding at the conference that dealt with the process or structure of negotiations6 in it prime minister olmert and president abbas express their determination to immediately launch bilateral negotiations in order to conclude peace treaty to resolve all core issues without exception as specified in previous agreements they agree to engage in continuous negotiations in an effort to conclude an agreement before the end of 2008 for this purpose steering committee to oversee negotiating teams will meet continuously beginning on december 12 abbas and olmert will meet biweekly to follow and assist the negotiations negotiations will be bilateral the joint understanding does not specify role for the united states in the negotiations although one may emerge with time president bush will not be playing role similar to that of presidents carter and clinton in the past and the united states will not necessarily make proposals in the event of deadlock this is in line with longstanding administration view that it is the parties themselves who must make peace however it is anticipated that secretary of state rice will travel to the region frequently to provide encouragement and assistance the resumption of negotiations after sevenyear hiatus is viewed as the main achievement of the conference although the process may be said to have resumed with the olmertabbas talks in mid2007 in the joint understanding the parties also co mmit to immediately implement their respective obligations under the road map the united states will lead tripartite usisraelipalestinian mechanism to follow up on implementation the pa rties further commit to continue implementing the road map until they reach peace treaty unless otherwise agreed by the parties implementation of the future peace treaty will be subject to the implementation of the road map as judged by the united states the united states will monitor and judge fulfillment of their road map

corps as special envoy for middle east security the general will report to secretary rice who said that jones will oversee the full range of security issues for the israelis and palestinians as well

since 1996 the palestinian authority pa has administered both the west bank and gaza strip albeit amidst the presence of israeli defense forces and settlements factional fighting between fatah and hamas in mayjune 2007 resulted in hamas seizing total control of the gaza strip pa president mahmoud abbas then declared state of emergency dissolved the hamasled government and replaced it with one led by independent technocrat prime minister salam fayyad in practice the abbasfayyad government now administers only the west bank while hamas dominates the gaza strip abbas has been unable to prevent hamas from permitting its allies to launch rockets into southern israel israelis opposed to negotiations argue that talks are futile because abbas is weak and unable to implement the road map andor peace treaty others contend that progress in the peace process would strengthen abbas by showing him able to liver benefits for the palestinian people saudi arabia and others are urging abbas to reconcile with hamas in order to present unified palestinian front in negotiations and to increase the legitimacy of any accord however as with the prior unity government it is unlikely that israel would agree to negotiate with it unless hamas meets conditions set out in 2006 that it recognize israel disavow violence and accept all prior israelipalestinian agreements hamas officials show inclination to meet these conditions instead they organized protests against the annapolis conference rejected its results hardened their rhetoric and continued to argue that abbas lacks legitimate mandate to conduct negotiations because they won the 2006 parliamentary elections moreover hamas retains the capability to sabotage the peace process by escalating terror attacks

complete failure of the joint understanding to mention core issues by na mejerusalem is one of them should the two rightwing parties depart olmert could rely on the leftwing meretz and three small israeli arab parties to remain in power and get peace accord ratified but any agreement that depends on arab support would not be viewed by many israelis as legitimate olmerts tenure as prime minister also may be in jeopardy for other reasons he is the subject of several investigations into alleged corruption and report by commission investigating israels conduct of its 2006 war with hezbollah in lebanon is due to be submitted shortly criminal indictment or scathing report could produce increased calls for olmerts resignation israeli governments are notoriously shortlived and olme rt has already been in power for almost two years which is the average length of governments tenure finally olmert soon will undergo treatment for prostate cancer which may remove him from the negotiating process for at least limited time g18g155g152g156g153g142g140g157g156g561 the two sides are more able to fulfill their obligations under phase i of the road map now than they have been for the past four and half years and still disagree about implementation phase i calls on israel to cease settlement activity israel has more than 275000 settlers in the west bank not including east jerusalem and at annapolis olmert referred to letter that president bush gave to former israeli prime minister ariel sharon in april 2004 in it the president noted the need to take into account changed realities on the ground including already existing major israeli population centers ie settlements asserting it is unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will be full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949 7 at the time the palestinians denounced the presidents legitimization of settlements and prejudgment of final status on november 19 2007 olmert stated that he does not view freeze on building beyond the 1967 border as part of the road maps requirements he also said that israel would not build new settlements or outposts or appropriate more land for settlement use in addition israel does not believe that construction in east jerusalem is required in freeze palestinians argue that freeze means complete cessation of all settlement construction including in existing settlements phase i also requires the palestinians to confront terrorists and dismantle terrorist infrastructures palestinian officials claim that their limited actions against hamassupporting charities and deployment of polic in nablus and tulkarm prove that they are fulfilling their obligations under phase i yet they lack the capability to truly confront hamas and other terror groups even with the assistance provided thus far by the united states and israel final status issues also remain intractable for example on the issue of refugees abbas referred at annapolis to general assembly resolution 194 which the palestinians believe grants refugees the right to return to their homes now in israel the resolution also provides for an alternative right to compensation 8 however he also had joined the arab initiative which calls for an agreed upon solution to the issue israel maintains its right to remain jewish state the identity of which would be lost if the palestinian refugees were allowed to return it says that the 7 for text of letters see israels ministry of foreign affairs at httpwwwmfagov ilmfapeaceprocess
