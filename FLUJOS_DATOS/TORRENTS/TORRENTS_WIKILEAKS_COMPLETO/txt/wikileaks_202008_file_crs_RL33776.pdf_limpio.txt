30 ears hearings on the topic occurred as early as 1975 with as many as 250 additiona l hearings since that time in 1992 the united states ratified the framework convention on climate change unfccc which established goal of reducing developed countries greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000 in 1997 the parties to the unfccc as first step to advance stronger m easures negotiated bindi ng emission reductions for developed countries in the kyoto pr otocol the united states subsequently rejected the protocol focusing instead on research and on voluntary emission reduction programs3 despite these programs us emissions of greenhouse gases have continued to climb in 2005 us missions were 16 higher than in 19904 in recent years congress has expressed renewed interest in climate issues for several reasons perhaps the most impor tant factor has been the continued strengthening of the science supportin g the connection between emissions of greenhouse gases and climate

actions see crs report rl33812 climate change action by states to address greenhouse gas emissions by jonathan l ramseur there has also been shift in attitude on the part of some in industry prompted

2007 there was further attention to climate change bills in the sec ond session of the congress but significant number of questions both pr ocedural and substantive remain legislative issues should greenhouse g ases be regulated as air pollutants the relationship of climate change legislation to the more traditional air pollution programs of the environmen tal protection agency epa is one such

cl ean air act or are they more properly considered sideeffect of the use of fossil fuels to produce energy the answer to this question affects jurisdiction over climate change program particularly in the senate where both the energy and natural resources committee and the environment and public works committee have considered greenhouse gas legislation it could determine whether epa the department of energy or some other agency would administer an enacted climate change program and it might affect whether states have au thority independent of the fe deral government to control certain greenhouse gas emissions over the years epa has taken both side s of this issue under the clinton administration the agencys ge neral counsel argued that co2 is an air pollutant and thus could be regulated under the existing au thority of the clean air act the agency did not actually propose such regulation it s imply maintained that it would have the authority to do so if it chose unde r the bush administration new general counsel argued the opposite maintaining th at congress had clearly distinguished co2 from other air pollutants and while aut horizing research and data collection under the existing clean air act had expressl decided not to regulate the pollutant for further discussion of th issues see crs report rl32764 climate change litigation growing phenomenon by robert meltz th bush administration has also intervened in court to argue that controlling co2 and other greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles is equivalent to setting fuel economy standards regulatory authority that congress rese rved for the federal government not controlling air pollution where states have regulatory role in its april 2 2007 decision in massachusetts v epa 8 the supreme court resolved the issue of the clean air acts authority finding the clean air acts sweeping defin ition of air pollutant includes any air pollution agent or combination of such agents including any physical chemical substance or matter which is emitted into or otherwise enters the ambient air carbon dioxide methane nitr ous oxide and hydrofluorocarbons are without doubt physical and chemical substancess which are emitted into the ambient air the statute is unambiguous9 thus the court found doubt that the cl ean air act gives epa the authority to regulate greenhouse gases in this case from new motor vehicles although the specifics of such regulation might be subj ect to agency discretion for further discussion of the courts decision see crs report rs22665 the supreme courts climate change decision

with acid precipitation title iv and stratospheric ozone depletion title vi should legislation focus on indi vidual sectors the economy as whole or both most of the bills dubbed climate change bills would establish economywide programs to re duce greenhouse gas emissions but recent congresses including the current one have also seen dozens of bills aimed at the emissions of individual sectors notably electric utilities cars and trucks electrical appliances and commercial or government buildings together these sectors account for the lions share of energy use and ghg emissions electric utilities account for about 40 of us emissions of co2 transportation of which the dominant portion is cars and trucks accounts for about onethird appliances other electrical equipment and buildings all play important roles as consumers of energy thus reducing their energy use through effi ciency standards better insulation etc can be important means of reducing ghg emissions if the focus is on individual sectors ra ther than the economy as whole the likelihood is that new legislation to re duce ghgs would not amend the clean air act and the resulting regulatory programs would be implemented

companies with fewer or more costly options could buy allowances to cover excess emissions for more comp lete discussion of these issues see crs report rl33799 climate change design approaches for greenhouse gas reduction program by larry parker such capandtrade programs have an nviable reputation largely based on the success of the clean air acts acid rain program that program imposed cap on sulfur dioxide emissions for limited numbe r of electric power plants in 1995 and in 2000 lowered the cap and ex panded coverage to more pl ants it met its emission reduction goals at low cost with virt ually 100 compliance and with minimal administrative oversight the success of the program was at least partly the result of the favorable circumstances in which it was implemented the reduction targets were easily met because of an abundant supply of cheap lowsulfur coal there were only about 1000 entities power plants covered by the trading program making it simple and inexpensive to monitor and administer and most of the regulated entities were allowed 10 years to achieve compliance by which time early reductions had generated an enormous number of extra allowances that helped lubricate the trading system some other trading programs have not been as successf ul southern californias regional clean air incentives market reclaim for example which was implemented in 1994 to

ghg emissions would face number of challenges first with the exception of electric utilities sources of ghgs have not been generally required to monitor or report their ghg emissions what we know about sources is based for the most part on estimates thus monitoring requirement would need to be established to serve as basis for any future reduction scheme whether capandtrade or not pl 110161

congress by larry parker and brent d yacobuccisecond decisions would need to be ma regarding the comprehensiveness of any program what economic sectors to include what to establish as small emitter exemption etc again this problem is not unique to capandtrade but it assumes increasing importance if one is desi gning any economywide approach third there is wide array of issues related to the distribution or sale of allowances including what year to choose as the base year against which to measure emission reductions what crite ria or method to use to llocate allowances whether to auction allowances to existing sources of emissions or give them away whether to establish reserves for new sources etc fourth in order to prevent wild swin gs in allowance prices variety of flexibility mechanisms have been suggested including safety valve price at which the regulatory authority would sell additional allowances if the market cost rose above predicted levels the banking of excess allowances achieved through early reductions for later use borrowing au thority etc others have proposed floor below which prices would not be allowed to fall to reduce risk for sources that make ghg reductions if safety valve or floor were established the price of additional allowances andor the floor price would be key determinants of the stringency of the program fifth there are number of issues re lated to whether and how to permit international trading of llowances many of the least cost ghg reduction options may be in developing countri but verification of the ba seline emissions and of the continued application of mission controls could pose ch allenges to the regulatory authority in such cases similar questions are raised by potential domestic or international offsets to emissions in the form of sequestration activities12 what role for carbon taxes the complications of establishing viable capandtrade program suggest to some especially to those trained in economics that the simplest approach to controllin g emissions would be to impose carbon or ghg tax from the point of view of ec onomic efficiency administrative ease and comprehensiveness carbon tax has many advantages but congress has found it difficult to impose new taxes limiting support for this option it is worth noting that the safety valve discussed in the capa ndtrade section above would function to some extent like carbon tax and might represent compromise between these two options the role of state programs finally as noted earlier number of states have begun programs to reduce ghg emi ssions although the federal government is challenging some of these particularly those affecting mobile sources states do have clear authority to regulate emissions from power plants landfills residential and commercial buildings and othe r sources of ghgs the extent to which such statehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33776crs8 13 table showing the mandated reductions year byyear can be found in

14 states are arizona connecticut fl orida maine maryland massachusetts new jersey new mexico new york oregon pe nnsylvania rhode island vermont and washington under section 177 of the act states that have nonattainment or maintenance areas can adopt californias emission standards for mobile sources in lieu of federal standards every state except hawaii north dakota and south dakota would be eligible to adopt californias standards under this socalled pi ggyback provisi on thus there is broad interest in the california waiver decisi on and more at stake than would be the case if only california had adopted the regulationsprograms might serve as nati onal models is one issue nother is the degree to which federal program might preempt state measures affecting similar sources californias waiver request the question of federal preemption s already arisen under current law california has adopted regu lations requiring new motor vehicles to reduce ghg emissions beginning in model year 2009 the standards require gradual reductions of ghg emissions until they are about 30 below the emissions of the 2002 fleet in 201613 compliance would be determined by fleet averages rather than by the emissions of individual vehicles and the regulations provide additional flexibility including averaging banking and tr ading of credits within and among manufacturers although california finalized its regu lations in 2005 the standards have not gone into effect because the state first needed to obtain waiver of federal preemption from us epa the clean air act generally preempts states from adopting their own emission standards for mobile sources of air pollution but it makes conditional exception for califor nia whose air pollution problems have been more severe than those of other st ates and whose emission control program pre dated federal requirements to obtain this exception th state must be granted waiver by the epa administrator the act also permits other states to adopt standards identical to californias if ca lifornia is granted waiver 14 states have adopted identical standards14 together the states that have adopted the california standards represent nearly half the us auto market so there is broad interest in epas decision and great deal at stake to obtain waiver california must m eet four conditions laid out in caa section 209b the state must determine that its standards will be at least as protective of public health nd welfare as applicable federal standards and the epa administrator must weigh whether the states determination in this regard is arbitrary and capricious whether the state needs such standards to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions and whether the standards and accompanying enforcement procedures are consistent with sec tion 202a of the clean air act httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33776crs9 15 us house of representatives committee on interstate and foreign commerce clean air act amendments of 1977 hrept

standards would appear to be met the state identified several compelling and extraordinary conditions that the standards are design ed to address and the state provided information describing technol ogies available to meet the standards many of which are already available on vehicles and ddressed consistency with section 202a the legislative history of the waiver provision would also seem to support californias case in the most recent amendment of section 209b the house committee report stated the administrator is not to overturn californias judgment lightly nor is he to substitute his judgment for that of the state15 for further discussion see crs report rl34099 californias waiver request to control greenhouse gases under the clean air act by james mccarthy and robert meltz nevertheless the epa administrator announced on december 19 2007 that he would deny the waiver request accord ing to press reports the decision to deny the waiver was taken against the unanimous advice of the agencys technical and legal staffs16 in letter to californias gover nor schwarzenegger on that date the administrator cited the signing earlier the same day of the energy independence

of the caa the issue here is whet her ghgs are pollutants that in the words of section 202 cause or contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare the courts decision left epa three options make finding that motor vehicle ghg emissions may endanger public health or welfare nd issue emissions standards b make finding that such emissions do not endanger public health or welfare or c decide that climate change science is so uncertain as to preclude making finding either way or cite some other reasonable explanation why epa will not exercise its discretion either way24 epa has not spoken definitively on whet her climate change endangers public health but the agency appears to have already concluded that ghgs do affect welfare under the clean air act welfare is defined to include effects on soils water crops vegetation wild life weather and climate in his decision document on the california waiver request which appeared in the federal register march 6 2008 the administrator stated it is wide ly recognized that greenhouse gases have climatic warming effect by trapping heat in the atmosphere that would otherwise escape to space25 he went on to enumerate impacts on temperature precipitation sea level rise water resources coastal communities habitats invasive species air quality and other factors26 given these statements it is hard to see how the agency can do other than issue an affirmativ endangerment finding for welfare after the supreme courts decision the administrator and the president as well gave every indication that they were on the way to making such finding the president on may 14 2007 said last month the supreme court ruled th at the epa must take action under the clean air act regarding

an endangerment of welfare finding was prepared and proposed ghg emission standard was pproved by the administrator the endangerment finding was sent to the white house office of management and budget

released july 11 2008 and appeared in the federal register july 30 200831 epa staff have apparently been told that work was discontinued so that the agencys activities could be reassessed given enactment of the energy independence and security act eisa pl 110140 which set new corporate average fuel economy cafe st andards for motor vehicles which will reduce their ghg emissions in the months after the bills enactment however epa staff were not asked to analyze whether passage of the law changed the analysis of the costs and benefits of the proposed ghg regulations32 furthermore as numerous commentators have noted the passage of the new cafe requirements does not affect epas obligation to issue finding as to whether or not ghg emissions from mobile sources contribute to air pollution that endang ers public health or welfare in fact section 3 of eisa specifically states that nothing in the act s upersedes the provisions of existing environmental law if the agency does

epa to tighten standard s for ozone and fine particles fine particles as defined by ep consist of particulate ma tter 25 micromete rs or less in diameter abbreviated as pm25 the agency attributes at

outdoor ambient air that ar intended to protect public health and welfare from harmful concentrations of pollution by changing the standard epa has concluded that protectin g public health and welfare requires lower concentrations of ozone pollution than it prev iously judged to be safe the ozone standard affects larger per centage of the population than any other naaqs about 45 of the us population cu rrently lives in oz one nonattainment areas the term epa uses for areas that violate the standard 132 million people in all as result of the standards strengthening more areas will be

per million ppm averaged ove r 8 hours to 0075 ppm averaged over the same time using the most recent three years of monitoring data 345 counties 54 of all c ounties with ozone monitors would violate

numerous economic sectors and for state nd local governments the first step designation of nonatta inment areas will not take place until 2010 at the earliest but areas that exceed the new standards based on current monitoring data are already expressing concern about the potential impacts number of issues arise as result of the standards adoption including whether the administrators choices for the primary nd secondary standards are backed by the available science not only are the administrators choices weaker than those proposed by casac but the administrative record makes clear that in part they were dictated by the white house over the objections of epa whether the standards should lead to str onger federal controls on the sources of ozone pollution precursors is another likely i ssue current federal standards for cars trucks power plants and other pollution s ources are not strong enough to bring all areas into attainment thus requiring local pollution control measures in many cases epa the states and congress may also wish to consider whether the current monitoring network is adequa to detect violations of more stringent standard only 639 of the nations 3000 c ounties

category challenged in the dc circuit court of appeals the pm10 standard was remanded to epa th court having concluded that pm10 is poorly matched indicator for thoracic co arse particles becau it includes the smaller pm25 category as well as the larger par ticles in response in january 2006 the epa proposed 24hour standard for pm1025 the standard would have been set at level of 70 µgm3 compared with the current 24hour pm10 standard of 150 µgm3 the final standards promulgated in october 2006 reversed course leaving in place both the form of the standard ie pm10 and the 24hour level 150 µgm3 the only change to the pm10 standard was the revocation of its annual component the agency argues that it has provided more thorough reasoning in support of the use of pm10 as its coarse particle indicator and believes that its explanation will satisfy the court casacs views the administrators deci sions on particulate matter represented the first time in casacs near ly 30year history that the promulgated standards fell outside of th range of the scientific panels recommendations the ozone standard promulgate d in march 2008 now provides second instance in letter dated september 29

regard to pm10 the letter stated that casac was completely surprised at the decision to revert to the use of pm10 as the indicator for coarse particles noting that the option of retaining the existing daily pm10 standard was not discussed during the advisory process and that casac view s this decision as highly problematic the administrator is not required by statute to follow casacs recommendations the act section 307d3 requires only that the administrator set forth any pertinent findings reco mmendations and comme nts by casac and the national academy of sciences and if his proposal differs in an important respect from any of their recommendations pr ovide an explanation of the reasons for such differences courts in reviewing epa regulations generally defer to the administrators judgment on scientific matters focusing more on issues of procedure jurisdiction and standing nevertheless casac s detailed objections to the administrators decisions and its desc ription of the process as having failed to meet statutory and procedural requirements could play ro during judicial review46 implementation of the pm naaqs naaqs does not directly limit emissions

as it is of statutory requirements in section 109 for exampl the statute blishes clean air scientific advisory committee to make recommendations to the administrator regarding new naaqs and at fiveyear inte rvals to make reviews of existing naaqs with recommendations for revisions in practice epa staff not casac have prepared these reviews drafting criteria documents which review the

appears in the federal register during public comment period the goal according to agency officials is to speed up the review process which has consistently taken longer than th five years allowed by statute these improvements will help the agency meet the goal of reviewing each naaqs on fiveyear cycle as required by the clean air act without compromising the scientific integrity of the process48 according to the memorandum that finalized the changes the changes concern environmental groups and some in the sc ientific community however because they appear to give larg er role to the agen cys

was promulgated in 1978 the clean air act requires that naaqs be reviewed every five years but review of the standard has not been completed since that time56 despite this regulation of airborne lead is often described as one of the key successes of the clean air ac t and of the environmental protection agency the success occurred largely because epa and other federal agencies used authorities other than naaqs to order the removal of lead from wide variety of products in 1970 lead was wide ly used as gasoline additive and emissions of lead nationwide totaled 224100 tons lead was also present then in many consumer products and thus was emitted to the air in industrial proce sses and from waste incinerators the phasing out of lead from gasoline paint packaging materials and consumer products as well as stricter c ontrols on industrial emissions reduced lead emissions more than 99 to 1300 tons in 2007 as result there are now only two nona ttainment areas for lead under the 1978 standard east helena mt and herculaneum mo with combined population of 4664 people both of these towns were site s of lead smelters that operated for more than 100 years contaminating air water and

from gasoline in large part because it ruined the cataly tic converters placed on vehicle exhaust systems which were needed to contro l smog lead was removed from paint primarily to avoid its ingestion by children the basis for the proposed standard airborne lead continues to cause negative effects despite the reduction in emissions in the current naaqs review epa identified more than 6000 studies on lead health effects nvironmental effects and lead in the air published since the pr evious review these studies have found evidence of health effects at the levels of exposure currently experienced by much of the us population lead particles can be inhaled or ingested and once in the body can cause lower iq and effects on learning memory and behavior in children in adults lead exposure is linked to increas ed blood pressure cardiovascular disease and decreased kidney function thus epa staff and casac the independent panel of sc ientists who advise the epa administrator concluded that the naaqs established in 1978 was far too lenient that lead in ambient air still poses threat to public health and that the naaqs should be significantly strengthen ed casac and ep staff recommended that the standard be reduced from 15 µgm3 to higher than 02 µgm3 in promulgating more stringent naaqs the admin istrator agreed with the scientists recommendations rejecting ar

proposed to require small network of monitors to be placed in urban areas with populations greater than one milli on to gather information on the general populations exposure to lead in the air in the final rule the administrator chos thresholds different than proposed he set the source threshold at one ton of missions rather than 200600 kilograms and required monitors in urban areas with popul ations of 500000 or more rather than one million the final choice appears to have reflected concerns by industry groups including the battery council internationa l who argued that emphasis should be placed more on exposureoriented monitoring than on specific sources of emissions59 according to press reports the white house office of management and budget weighed in at the last minute in support of the change in emphasis60 the states remain free to install more monitors than epa requires if they believe that the effects of industrial sources with less than one ton of emissions should be monitored but finding the mone to do so may be difficult at time when many of the states are experiencing shortage of revenues for additional information see crs report rl34479 revising the national

carolina v epa 61 dealing serious setback to the administrations approach to controlling power plant pollution the decision has since been appealed coalfired power plants are among the largest sources of air pollution in the united states however under the clean air ac t they are not necessarily subject to stringent requirements emissions and the required control equipment can vary depending on the location of the plant when it was construc ted whether it has undergone major modifications th specific type of fuel it burns and to some extent the vagaries of epa enforcement policies more than half dozen separate clean air act programs could potentially be used to control emissions which makes compliance strategy complicated for utilities and difficult for regulators because the cost of the most stringent available contro ls for the entire industry could range into the tens of billions of dollars utilities ve fought hard and rather successfully to limit or delay regulations affecting them particularly with respect to plants constructed before the clean air act of 1970 was passed as result emissions from power plants have not been reduced as much as those from some other sources many pl ants built in the 1950s and 1960s generally referred to as grandfathered plants have little emission control equipment collectively these plants are large sources of pollution in 2003 power plants accounted for 102 million tons of sulfur dioxide so2 emissions 70 of the us total about 45 tons of merc ury emissions more than 40 of the us total and 36 million tons of nitrogen oxides 19 of the us total power plants are also considered major sources of fine particles pm25 many of which form in the atmosphere from emissions from wide rang of stationary and mobile sources in addition power plants account for about 40 of us anthropogenic emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide these emissions are not subject to federal regulation but have been the focus of much debate in recent years with new ambient air quality standards for ozone and fine particles taking effect emissions of nox which contribut to the formation of ozone and fine particles and so2 which is also among the sour ces

their costssource review requirements for existing pow er plants discussed below is also exerting pressure for more predictable regulatory structure thus many in industry envir onmental groups congress and the administration have said for several years now that the time is ripe for legislation that addresses power plant pollution in comprehensive multipollutant fashion such legislation the administration version of which was entitled the clear skies act62 would address the major pollutants on coordinated schedul and would rely to large extent on system such as the one used in the acid rain program where national or regional caps on emissions are imp lemented through system of tradeable allowances the key questions have b een how stringent the caps should be and whether carbon

few bush administration environmental initiatives that was generally supported by nvironmentalists it also had broad support among the regulated community but variety of petitioners including the state of north carolina which argued that the rule was not strong enough to address pollution from upwind sources and some individual utilities that felt they were unfairly treated by the rules emission budgets challenged the rule in the dc circuit and the court vacated it july 11 2008 unanimous court found in general that epa lacked authority to promulgate regional capa ndtrade rule under section 110 of the clean air act unless it could show link between the pollution emitted in specific states and nonattainment of st andards or failure to maintain standards in downwind states the court found that epa had established significant contribution made by power plants to pollution levels in other stat as required by section 110 but that its methodology for establishing emission budgets was unrelated to that link the court also found the fuel adjustment factors in th rule to be arbitrary and capricious it concluded cairs flaws are deep amount of tinkering will transform cair as written into an acceptable rule66 despite the seemingly high hurdle set by the language the court used epa environmental groups and the utility and min ing industries have asked the court to review

determine whether regulation of mercury from power plants under section 112 of the clean air act was appropriate and necessary it concluded that it was in december 2000 regulatory finding the finding added coal and oilfi red electric generating units to the list of categories of sources of hazardous air pollutants and triggered other provisions of the consent agreement that the agency propose ma ximum achievable control technology mact standards for them by decem ber 15 2003 and finalize the standards by march 15 2005 rather than promulgate mact standards however which would have required controls on each coalfired power plan t by 2008 epa reversed its december 2000 finding in march 2005 and established thr ough regulations national capandtrade system for power plant emissions of mercur the final cap would have been 15 tons of emissions nationwide in 2018 about 70 reduction from 1999 levels when achieved there would also have been an intermediate cap of 38 tons in 2010 this intermediate cap would not have actually limited emissions however since the agency projected emissions at 31 tons in 2010 even if 99 of the generating units installed mercury control equipment the caps would have been implemented through an allowance system similar to that used in the acid rain and cair programs through which utilities can either control the pollutant directly or purchase excess allowances from other plants that have instituted controls more stringently or sooner than required as with the acid rain and cair programs early reductions could have been banked for later use which the agency said would result in utilities delaying compliance with the full 70 reduction until well beyond 2018 as they us ed up banked allowances rather than installing further controls the agencys analysis projected actual emissions to be 243 tons less than 50 reduction as late as 2020 full compliance with the 70 reduction would have been delayed until after 202568 for additional information on the mercury rule see crs report rl32868 mercury emissions from electric power plants an analysis of epas capandtrade regulations by james mccarthy the courts decision the dc circuit in 30 decision handed down february 8 200869 found that once the agency had listed electric generating units egus as source of hazardous air pollutants it had to proceed with mact regulations under section 112 of the act unless it delisted the source categoryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33776crs28 under procedures the act sets forth in section 112c9 delisting would have required the agency to find that egus emissions exceeded level adequate to protect public health with an ample ma rgin of safety and that adverse environmental effect would result from any source difficult test to meet given the agencys estimate that egus are res ponsible for more than 40 of mercury emissions from all us sources rather than delist the egu source category therefore the agency maintained that it could simply reverse its december 2000 appropriate and necessary finding decision that was much simpler because there were statutory criteria to meet the c ourt found this approach unlawful this explanation deploys the logic of the queen of hearts substituting epas desires for the plain text of section 112c9 th court said in its unanimous opinion other mercury issues besides the question of whether epa complied with the laws requirements cr itics have found other flaw s in epas capandtrade approach to controlling mercury one of the main criticisms has been that it would not address hot spots areas where merc ury emissions andor concentrations in water bodies are greater than elsewhere it would have llowed facility to purchase allowances and avoid any mission controls if that co mpliance approach made the most sense to the plants owne rs and operators if plants near hot spots did so the capandtrade system might not have reduced mercury concentrations in the most contaminated areas by contrast mact standard would require reductions at all plants and would therefore be expected to improve conditions at hot spots many also argue that the mercury re gulations should be more stringent or implemented more quickly than the capa ndtrade regulations would have required to large extent these arguments and epas counterarguments rest on assumptions concerning the availability of control technologies controlling so2 nox and mercury simultaneously as the agency prefers would allow utilities to maximize cobenefits of emission controls controls such as scrubbers and fabric filters both of which are widely used today to control so2 and particulates have the side effect of reducing rcury emissions to some extent under epas capand trade regulations both the 2010 and 2018 rcury emission sta ndards were set to maximize use of these cobenefits which would have resulted from controls installed to comply with cair as result fe w controls would have been required to specifically address mercur emissions before the 2020s the costs specific to controlling mercury would be minimal and emissions w ould decline to about 50 of the 1999 level in 2020 besides citing the cost advantage of relying on cobenefits epa has claimed that technology specifically designed to c ontrol mercury emissions such as activated carbon injection aci would not be ge nerally available until after 2010 this assertion has been widely disputed aci and fabric filters have been in use on municipal waste and medical waste incinerators for more than decade and have been successfully demonstrated in at least 16 fullscale tests at coalfired power plants for periods as long as year manufacturers of polluti on controls and many others maintain that if the agency required the use of aci and fabric filters at power plants reductions in merc ury emissions as great as 90 could be achieved at reasonable cost in the near future rely ing on these assertions about 20 states have promulgated requirements stricter

available pollution controls on existing stationary sources of air pollution that have been modified the clean air act requires that plants undergoing modifications meet these ns r requirements but industry has often avoided the nsr process by claiming that changes to existing sources were routine maintenance rather than modifications in the 1990s the epa began reviewing records of electric utilities petroleum refi neries and other indus tries to determine whether the changes were in fact routine as result of these reviews since late 1999 epa and the department of justice ve filed suit

under the settlements they have agreed to spend about 10 billion on pollution controls or fuel switching to reduce emissions at their affected units combined these companies will reduce pollution by 165 million tons annually since july 25 2000 the agency has also reached 17 agreements with petroleum refiners repr esenting threefourths of industry capacity the refiners agreed to settle potential charges of nsr violations by paying fines and installing equipment to eliminate 315000 tons of pollution those utilities charged with nsr violations that have not settled with the epa claim that the epa has reinvented the nsr rules and that the agencys stricter interpretation of what cons titutes routine maintenance w ill prevent them from making changes that would have previously been allowed

december 2002 and october 2003 the agency promulgated five sets of changes to the ns r rules the most c ontroversial were new regulations defining what constitutes routine maintenance74 the new regulations would have exempted industrial fac ilities from undergoing nsr and thus from installing new emission controls if they were replacing safety reliability and efficiencyrated components with new functionally equivalent equipm ent and if the cost of the replacement components was ss than 20 of the replacement value of the process unit using this benchmark few if any plant modifications would trigger new pollution controls these changes were highly controversia l the administration and its supporters characterized them as streamlining or improving the program others saw them as permanently grandfathering older more polluting facilities from ever having to meet the clean air standards required of newer plants fifteen states three municipalities and veral environmental groups filed suit to block the equipment replacement routine maintenance rule the rule was stayed by the us court of appeals for the dc circuit on december 24 2003 on march 17 2006 three judge panel of the
