mechanisms in place prior to the enactment of the stafford act as noted above the office of general counsel fema has indicated th at the functions and responsibilities assigned above to the associate director are now performed by the director recovery division the position of associate director does not exist in fema at the present time 3 44 cfr 20633when an incident occurs or is imminent which the state offici responsible for disaster operations determines may exceed state and local response capabilities the state will request the fema regional director to perform joint femastate preliminary damage assessment pda this provides means to determine the impact and magnitude of damage and resulting unmet needs of individuals businesses the public sector and the affected community as whole information collected in this way is used by the state as basis for the governors request for presidential proclamation and by fema to document its recommendation to the president in response to the governors request the requirement for joint pda may be waived for those incidents of unusual severity and magnitude that do not require field damage assessm ents to determine that s upplemental federal assistance will be needed or in other situations determined by the regional director in consultation with the state an assessment may still be needed to determine unmet needs for managerial response purposes3 once request from the governor of an affected state is received by the fema regional director whose region covers that state the regional director provides written acknowledgment of recei pt of the request based on the joint pdas andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33090crs5 4 under the current regulation this reference is to the associate director of fema the regulatory language does not reflect the curre nt organizational structure in which these functions are performed by the di rector of the recovery division 5 the factors considered by fema is evalua ting governors request for major disaster declaration are set out in 44 cfr 20648 when we review governors request for major disaster assistance under the stafford act these are the primary factors in making recommendation to the president whether assistance is warranted we consider other relevant information as well public assistance program we evaluate the following factors to evaluate the need for assistance under the public assistance program 1 estimated cost of the assistance we evaluate the estimated cost of federal and nonfederal public assistance agains t the statewide population to give some measure of the per capita impact within the state we use figure of 1 per capita as an indicator that the disaster is of such size that it might warrant federal assistance and adjust this figure annua lly based on the consumer price index for all urban consumers we are establishing minimum threshold of 1 million in public assistance damages per disaster in the belief that we can reasonably expect even the lowest population states to cove r this level of public assistance damage 2 localized impacts we evaluate the im pact of the disaster at the county and local government level as well as impacts at the american indian and alaskan native tribal government levels becau at times there are extraordinary concentrations of damages that might warrant federal assistance even if the statewide per capita is not met this is particularly true where critical facilities are involved or where localized per cap ita impacts might be extremely high for example we have at times seen localized damages in the tens or even hundreds of dollars per capita though the statewide per capita impact was low 3 insurance coverage in force we c onsider the amount of insurance coverage that is in force or should have been in force as required by law and regulation at the time of the disaster and reduce the am ount of anticipated assistance by that amount 4 hazard mitigation to recognize and encourage mitigation we consider the extent to which state and local governme nt measures contributed to the reduction of disaster damages for the disaster unde r consideration for example if state can demonstrate in its disaster request that statewide building code or other mitigation measures are likely to have reduced the damages from particular disaster we consider that in the ev aluation of the request this could be especially significant in those disast ers where because of mitigation the continuedconsultation with appr opriate state and federal official s and other inte rested parties the regional director then promptly prep ares summary of the pda findings an analysis of this information including an examination of state and local resources and capabilities and other assistance available to meet the needs associated with the emergency or major disaster is submitted with recommendation to the director of the recovery division of fema4 based on available information the director of fema makes recommendation on the gover nors request to the president major disaster recommendation is based upon finding that the situation is or is not of such severity and magnit ude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state and local governments it also contains determin ation of whether or not supplemental federal stafford act assistance is necessary and appropriate5 an emergencyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33090crs6 5 continued estimated public assistance damages fell below the per capita indicator 5 recent multiple disasters we look at the disaster history within the last twelvemonth period to evaluate better the overall impact on the state or locality we consider declarations under the stafford act as well as declarations by the governor and the extent to which the state has spent its own funds 6 programs of other federal assistance we also consider programs of other federal agencies because at times their programs of assistance might more appropriately meet the needs created by the disaster b factors for the individual assistan ce program we consider the following factors to measure the severity magnitude and impact of the disaster and to evaluate the need for assistance to individuals under the stafford act 1 concentration of damages we evaluate the concentrations of damages to individuals high concentrations of damage s generally indicate greater need for federal assistance than widespread nd scattered damages throughout state 2 trauma we consider the degree of trauma to state and to communities some of the conditions that might cause trauma are i large numbers of injuries and deaths ii large scale disruption of normal community functions and services and iii emergency needs such as extended or widespread loss of power or water 3 special populations we consider whether special populations such as lowincome the elderly or the unemployed are affected and whether they may have greater need for assistance we also consider the effect on american indian and alaskan native tribal populati ons in the event that there are any unique needs for people in these governmental entities 4 voluntary agency assistance we cons ider the extent to which voluntary agencies and state or local programs can meet the needs of the disaster victims 5 insurance we consider the amount of insurance coverage because by law federal disaster assistance cannot duplicate insurance coverage 6 average amount of individual assistance by state there is set threshold for recommending individual assistance but the following averages may prove useful to states and vol untary agencies as they develop plans and programs to meet the needs of disaster victims 6 44 cfr 20637recommendation is based on report indica ting whether or not federal emergency assistance is necessary to supplement state and local fforts to save lives protect property and public health and safety or to lessen or aver t the threat of catastrophe fema will only recommend an emergency declaration if it has been determined that all other resources and authorities to meet the crisis are inadequate and that stafford act emergency assistance would be appropr iate modified federal emergency recommendation would be made based on report as to whether an emergency does or does not exist for which stafford act emergency assistance w ould be appropriate such recommendation would not be forthc oming in situations where the authority to respond or coordinate is within the jurisdiction of one or more federal agencies without presidential declaration m odified federal emer gency recommendation by fema for an emergency declaration by the president would not be foreclosed by other federal agency involvement if there are significant unmet needs of sufficient severity and magnitude not addressed by other assist ance which could appropriately be addressed under the stafford act6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33090crs7 7 44 cfr 20638 8 44 cfr 20646a 9 44 cfr 20646d 10 although
