to the nations highest office on the death resignation or removal from office of the president it delegates authority for succession beyond the vice president to congress over the past two centuries congress has exercised its authority in three succession acts in 1792 1886 and 1947 it has also added to revised and clarified the succession proce ss through sections 3 and 4 of the 20th amendment proposed by congress in 1932 and ratified by the states in 1933 and the 25th amendment proposed in 1965 and ra tified in 1967 the succession act of 1947 as amended and the two constituti onal amendments currently govern succession to the presidency presidential succession was widely considered settled issue prior to the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 thes events demonstrated the potential for mass decapitation of both the legislative and executive branches of government and raised questions as to whether current arrangements were adequate to guarantee continuity in congress and the presidency under such circumstances with respect to presidential succession there has been wide range of discussions in both congress and the public policy community since that time and members of both chambers have introduced gislation addressing this question in the contemporary context although the question of presidential succession has been considered both on capitol hill and in the public policy comm unity congress has yet to consider major revision of presidential succession pr ocedures in its most recent action the 109th congress incorporated the office of secretary of

presidential succession at the constitutional convention article ii of the constitution as originally adopte d provided the most basic building block of successi on procedures stating that in case of the removal of the president from office or of his death resignation or inability to discharge the powers and du ties of the said office the same shall devolve on the vice president and the congress may by law provide for the case of removal death resignation or inability both of the president and vice president declaring what officer shall th act as president and such officer shall act accordingly until the disability be removed or president shall be elected1 this language evolved during the cons titutional convention of 1787 the two most important early drafts of the constitution neither provided for vice president nor considered succession to the presidency and it was only late in the convention proceedings that the office of vice president emerged and the language quoted above was adopted2 while the need for vice president was debated during the ratification process the stion of succession received little attention meriting only one reference in the supporting federa list papers the vicepresident may occasionally become substitute for th president in the supreme executive magistracy3 the succession act of 1792 the second congress 17911793 exercised its constitutional authority to provide for presidential vacancy or inability in the succession act of 1792 1 stat 240 afte r examining several options including designating the secretary of state or chief justice as successor congress settled on the president pro tempore of the senate and the speaker of the house of representatives in that order these offi cials were to succeed if the presidency and vice presidency were both vacant duri ng house debate on the bill there was considerable discussion of the question of whether the president pro tempore and the speaker could be considered officers in the sense intended by the constitution if so they were eligible to succeed if not they could not be included in the line of succession the house expressed its institu tional doubts when it voted to strike this provision but the senate insisted on it nd it became part of the bill enacted andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34692crs3 4 feerick from failing hands pp 5860 5 it should be recalled that during this period presidential terms ended on march 4 of the year after the presidential election also the act provided only for election of the president since electors cast two votes for president during this period prior to ratification of the 12th amendment which specified separate electoral votes for president and vice president with the electoral vote runnerup elected vice

contemporary practice the h ouse of representatives elected in november 1880 did not convene in the 47th congress until december 5 1881 as was also customary the senate had convened on march 10 but primar ily to consider president garfields cabinet and other nominationssigned by the president4 although the speaker and pr esident pro tempore were thus incorporated in the line of succession th ey would serve only temporarily however since the act also provided fo r special election to fill the vacancy unless it occurred late in the last full year of the incumbents term of office5 finally this and both later succession acts required that designees meet the constitutional requirements of age residence and natural born citizenship presidential succession in 1841 setting precedent the first succession of vice president occurred when president william henry harrison died in 1841 vice president john tylers succession set an important precedent and settled c onstitutional questi on debate at the constitutional convention and subsequent writing on succession indicated that the founders intended the vice president to serve as acting president in the event of presidential vacancy or disability assuming the powers and duties of the office but not actually becoming president6 tylers status was widely debate d at the time but the vice president decided to take the presidential oath and considered himself to have succeeded to harrisons office as well as to his powers and duties after so discussion of the question congress implicitly ra tified tylers decision by referring to him as the president of the united states7 this action set precedent for succession that subsequently prevailed and was later formally incorporated into the constitution by section 1 of the 25th amendment the succession act of 1886 president james garfields death led to major change in succession law shot by an assassin on july 2 1881 the president struggled to survive for 79 days before succumbing to his wound on september 19 vice president chester arthur took offi ce the same day without incident but the offices of speaker and president pro tempore were vacant throug hout the presidents illness due to the fact that the house elected in 1880 had yet to convene and the senate had been unable to elect president pro tempore because of partisan strife8 congress subsequently passe d the succession act of 1886 24 stat 1 in order to insure the line of succession and guarantee that potential successors would be of the same party as the deceased incumbent this legislation transferred succession after the vice president from the president pro tempore and the speaker to cabinet officers in the chronological order in whic h their departments we re created

clause 2 expressly states that person holding an office under the united states shall be member of either house during his continuance in office they had been duly confirmed by the sena and were not under impeachment by the house further it eliminated the require ment for special ection thus ensuring that any future successor would serve the full balance of the presidential term this act governed succession until 1947 the 20th amendment 1933 section 3 of the 20th amendment ratified in 1933 clarified one detail of presidential succession proce dure by declaring that if presidentelect dies before being inau gurated the vice presidentelect becomes presidentelect and is s ubsequently inaugurated the presidential succession act of 1947 in april 1945 vice president harry s truman succeeded as president on th death of franklin d roosevelt in june of that year he proposed that c ongress revise the order of succession placing the speaker of the house and the president pro tempore of the senate in line behind the vice president and ahead of the cabinet9 the incumbent would serve until special election scheduled for the next in tervening congressiona l election filled the presidency and vice presidency for the balance of the term truman argued that it was more appropriate to ve popularly elected official s first in line to succeed rather than appointed cabinet officers bill10 incorporating the presidents proposal minus the special election provision pa ssed the house in 1945 but action was taken in the senate durin g the balance of the 79th congress the president renewed his call for legislation when the 80th congress convened in 1947 and legislation11 was introduced in the senate the same year debate on the senate bill centered on familiar questions whether the speaker and president pro tempore were officers in the sense intended by the constitution whether legislators were wellqualified for the chief executives position whether requiring these two to resign their congressional membership and offices before assuming the acting presidency was in the nations best interest12 after spirited debate the senate passed the measure on june 27 1947 while house action followed on july 10 the bill as passed embodied trumans request but again deleted the special election provisions the president signed it into law on july 18 under the act 61 stat 380 3 usc19

if properly qualified speaker or presiden t pro tempore is elected then they may assume the acting presidency supplantin g the cabinet officer the presidential succession act of 1947 has been regularly am ended to incorporate new cabinetlevel departments into the line of successi on and remains currently in force one anomaly remedied in the 109th congress was the fact that the position of secretary of homeland security was not included in the line of presidential succession when the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 116 stat 2135 established the department of homeland security in november 2002 freestanding legislation to remedy this omission was introduced in the 108th and 109th congresses but action was taken on these bills15 instead the 109th congress updated the order of succession when it incorporated the office of secretary of homeland security into the line of succession as provision of title v of the usa patriot authorization and improvement ac t of 2005 pl 109177 120 stat 192 the 25th amendment 1967 and current procedures the 1963 assassination of president john f kennedy helped set events in motion that culminated in the 25th amendment to the constitution key element in current succession procedures although vice president lyndon b johnson succeeded without incident after ke nnedys death it was noted at the time that johnsons potential immediate successor house speak er john w mccormack was 71 years old and senate president pr tempore carl t hayden was 86 and visibly frail in addition many observers belie ved that vice presidential vacancy for any length of time constituted dangerous gap in the nations leadership during the cold war an era of international tensions and the threat of nuclear war16 it was widely argued that there should be qualified vice president r eady to succeed to the presidency at all times the 25th amendment providing for vice presidential vacancies and presidential disability was proposed by the 89th congress in 1965 and approved by the requisite number of states in 196717 the 25th amendment is the cornerstone of contemporary succession procedures section 1 of the amendment formalized traditional practice by declaring that the vice president shall become president emphasis added if the president is removedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34692crs6 18 for additional information on presidential disability see crs

pres idency serves the remainder of the term constitutional eligibi lity to serve add itional terms is governed by the 22nd amendment which provides term limits for the presidency under the amendment if the vice president succeeds after more than two full years of the term have expired he is eligible to be elected to two additional terms as president if however the vice president succeeds after fewer than two full years of the term have expired the constitutional eligibility is limited to election to one additional term section 2 of the 25th amendment has been invoked twice since its ratification in 1973 when representative gerald r ford was nominated and approved to succeed vice president spiro t agnew who had resigned and again in 1974 when the former governor of new york nels on rockefeller was nominated and approved to succeed ford who had become president when president richard m nixon resigned see table 2 while the 25th amendment did not supplant the order of succession established by the presid ential succession act of 1947 its provision for filling vice presidential vacancies renders recourse to the speaker the president pro tempore and the cabinet unlikely except in the event of an unprecedented national catastrophe contemporary analysis presidential succession in the post911 era the events of september 11 2001 and th prospect of decapitation of the us government by an act of mass terrori sm have led to r eexamination of many previously longsettled elements of presidential succession and continuity of government on th federal level19 number of proposals to revise the succession act of 1947 have been introduced in the 108th through 110th congresses some of these were in the nature of housekeeping gislation that is they proposed to insert the office of secretary of the department of homeland security into the line of succession as has been done in the past when new cabinet departments are created by congress others proposed more complex changes in the legislation this growth of concern over succession issu in the wake of 911 was further reflected in the fact that the senate committees on rules and administration and the judiciary

additional information on the commission and its activities consult httpwwwcontinuityofg overnmentorghomehtml succession issues constitutional several issues dominate current disc ussions over revising the order of presidential succession some are hardy perennials constitutional questions that have risen in every debate on succession w and have been cited earlier in this report others reflect more recent concerns do the speaker and the president pro tempore qualify as officers for the purposes of presidential succession there is question as to congresss constitutional ab ility to pr ovide for presidential succession this power is directly granted by article ii section 1 clause 6 modified by the 25th amendment as noted earlier in this report what is in question here is what the constitution means by the word officer the interpretation of this phrase and by extension whether the speaker and pr esident protempore are constitutionally eligible to succeed the president has been perhaps the most durable element in the succession debate over time are they officers in the sense as noted in article ii or are their positions as officers of the congress established in article i sections 2 and 3 so fundamentally differe nt that they are ineligible to succeed the succession acts of both 1792 and 1947 assumed that the language was sufficiently broad as to include officers of congress the presid ent pro tempore of the senate and the speaker of the house of representatives the 1792 act specified this order of succession the 1947 act reversed the order placing the speaker of the house first in line followed by the president pro tempore some observers assert that these two congressional officials are not officers in the sense intended by the constitution nd that the 1792 act was and the 1947 act is constitutionally questionable attorney miller baker explained this hypothesis in his testimony before hearings held jointly by the senate committees on the judiciary committee and on rules and administration in 2003 the constitution is emphatic that members of congress are not officers of the united states the incompatibility clause of article i section 6 clause 2 provides that person holding any ffice under the united states shall be member of either house during his tinuance in office in other words members of congress by constitutional definition cannot be officers of the united states20httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34692crs8 20 continued arguments for his assertion at considerable length 21 feerick from failing hands p 59 22 ibid pp 6061 23 241 us 103 1916 according to feerick the supreme court held that member of the house of representatives was an office r of the government within the meaning of penal statute making it crime for one to impersonate an officer of the government feerick from failing hands p 206this point was raised in congressional debate over both the succession act of 1792 and that of 1947 in the former case opini on appears to have been divided james madison arguably the single most form ative influence on the constitution and serving representative when the 1792 act was debated held that officers of congress were not eligible to succeed other representatives who had also served as delegates to the constitutional convention we re convinced to the contrary21 i n addition political issues also contributed to the debate in 1792 fordham university law school dean and succession scholar john d feerick notes that the federalist dominated senate insisted on inclusion of the president pro tempore and the speaker he cites contemporary sources th at the senate sought to exclude the secretary of state largely because the incumbent was thomas jeffers on who was locked in bitter dispute with alexa nder hamilton and his fe deralist supporters jefferson was the acknowledged leader of the antifederalists the group that later emerged as the jeffersonian republica n or democratic republican party22 it thus may be inferred that the provisions of th succession act of 1792 may have been the result of political machinations and personal animosities questions as to the constitutional legitimacy of the speaker and the president pro tempore as potential successors to the president and vice president recurred during debate on the 1947 succession act at that time feerick notes long acceptance of the 1792 act passed by the s econd congress which presumably had firsthand knowledge of original intent in this question was buttressed as an argument by the supreme courts decision in lamar v united states 23 professor howard wasserman of the florida international university school of law introduced another argument in support of the speakers and president pro tempores inclusion in the order of succe ssion in his testimony before the 2003 joint hearing held by the senate judiciary committee and the committee on rules and administration the succession clause of the constitution provides that congress may by law provide for the case of removal death resignation or inability both of the president and the vice president declaring what officer shall then act as president and such officer shall act accordingly this provision refers to officers unmodified by reference to any department or branch elsewhere the constitution refers to officers of the united states or officers under the united states or civil officers in c ontexts that limit the meaning of those terms only to executive branch officer s such as cabinet secretarieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34692crs9 24 howard m wasserman testimony before the senate committees on the judiciary and rules and administration septem ber 16 2003 p 7 available at httpjudiciarysenategovhearingstestimonycfmid914wit_id2605 25 feerick from failing hands pp 204205the issue is whether the unmodified officer of the succession clause has broader meaning on one hand it may be synonymous with the modified uses of the word elsewhere all referring solely to executive branch officials in which case the speaker and the president pro tem cannot constitutionally remain in the line of succession on the other hand the absence of modifier in the succession clause may not have been inadvertent the unmodified term may be broader and more comprehensive covering not only executivebranch officers but everyone holding position under the constitution who might be labeled an officer this includes the speaker and president pro tem which are identified in article i as officers of the house and senate respectively24 given the diversity of opinion on this stion and the continuing relevance of historical practice and debate the issue of constitutional legitimacy remains an important element of any congressional effort to amend or replace the succession act of 1947 succession issues political and administrative second category of succession issues includes political questions and administrative concerns democratic principle and party continuity these two interrelated issues collectively comprise what might be termed the political aspect of presidential succession democratic prin ciple was perhaps the dominant factor contributing to the passage of the 1947 succession act simply stated it is the assertion that presidential and vice presidential succe ssion should be settled first on popularly elected officials rather th an the appointed members of the cabinet as was the case under the 1886 act according to feerick the 1886 acts provisions aroused criticism not long after vice president harry truman became president on the death of franklin d roosevelt25 president truman responded less than two months after succeeding to the presidency when he proposed to congress the revisions to succession procedures that when amended eventually were enacted as the succession act of 1947 the president ex plained his reasoning in his special message to congress on the subject of succession to the presidency by reason of the tragic death of the president it now lies within my power to nominate the person who would be my immediate successor in the event of my own death or inability to act i do not believe that in democracy this power should rest with the chief executive in so far as possible the office of the president should be filled by an elective officer there is officer in our system of government besides the president and vice president who has been elected by all the voters of the country the speaker of the house of representatives who is elected in his ow n district is also elected to be the presiding officer of the house

the united states harry s truman 1945 p 129 27 the president pro tempore is elected by the whole senate but this office is customarily filled only by the senator of the majority party who has served longest thus the act of election is arguably formality 28 akhil amar testimony before the senate committees on the judiciary and rules and administration september 16 2003 p 2 available at httpjudiciarysenategovhearingstestimonycfmid914wit_id2603 29 howard m wasserman testimony p 4 30 most often cited is the example of speaker john mccormick and president pro tempore carl hayden who were first and second in line of presidential succession for 14 months continuedfederal government whose selection next to that of the president and vice president can be most accurately said to stem from the people themselves26 conversely critics of this reasoning asse rt that the speaker while chosen by majority of his peers in the house has won approval by the voters only in his own congressional district further although ected by the voters in his home state the president pro tempore of the senate serves as such by virtue of being the longest serving senator of the majority party27 against the case for democratic succession urged by president truman the value of party continuity best assured by having cabinet officer in the first place of succession is asserted by some observers the argument here is that person acting as president under these circumstances shoul d be of the same political party as the previous incumbent in order to assure continuity of the po litical affiliation and presumably the policies of the candidate chosen by the voters in the last election according to this reasoning succession by speaker or president pro tempore of different party would be reversal of th peoples mandate that would be inherently undemocratic moreover they note this possibility is not remote since passage of the succession act of 1947 the nation has ex perienced divided government that is control of the presidency by one part and either or both houses of congress by another for 36 of the 61 intervening years as yale university professor akhil amar noted in his testimony at the 2003 joint senate committee hearing the current succession provisions can upend the results of presidential election if americans elect party to the white hous why should we end up with party b28 at the same hearing another witness argued that this connection to the president provides national base of legitimacy to cabinet officer pressed to act as president the link between cabinet fficers and the president preserves some measure of the last presidential elec tion the most recent popular democratic statement on the direction of the executive branch29 efficient conduct of

traditionally the senior member of the party in control of the nate may be particularly illsuited to the exercise of presidential duties due to reasons of health and age31 conversely it can be noted that the speaker particularly has extensive executive duties both as presiding officer of the house and as facto head of the extensive structure of committees staff and enabling infrastructure that comprises the larger entity of the house of representatives moreover it can be argued that the speakership has often been held by men of widely recognized judgment and ability eg sam rayburn nicholas longworth joseph cannon and thomas reed bumping or supplantation this question centers on the 1947 succession act provision that officers actin g as president under the act do so only until the disability or failure to qualify of any officer higher in the order of succession is removed if the disability is removed the previously entitled officer can supplant bump the person then acting as presiden t for instance assuming the death disability or failure to qualify of the pres ident the vice president the speaker the president pro tempore or senior cabinet secretary32 is acting as president supplantion could take place under any one of several scenarios death of the president vice president speaker and president pro tempore the senior cabinet secretary is acting as president the house elects new speaker w ho upon meeting the requirements ie resigning as house member and as speaker then bumps the cabinet secretary and assumes the office of acting president if the president pro tempore were serving as acting president he or she could be similarly bumped by newlyelected speaker both persons would be out of job under this scenario the president pro tempore by virtue of having re signed as member and officer of congress in order to become acting president33 and the senior cabinet secretary by virtue of the fact that under the act the taking the oath of office by cab inet secretary shall be held to constitute his resignation from the office by virtue of the holding of which he qualifies to act as president34 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34692crs12 35 howard m wasserman testimony p 8disability of the president and vice president the speaker is acting president either the president or vice president could supplant after recovering but the speaker or the president pro tempore should that officer be acting would be out of job due to the requirements noted above failure to qualify of the speaker or president pro tempore the president and vice president are di sabled or the offices are vacant the speaker and the president pro tempore decline to resign their congressional membership and offices and the acting presidency passes to the senior cabinet officer at some point the speaker or the president pro tempore decides to claim the acting presidency resigns and bumps the serving cabinet secretary the same scenario could occur to president pro tem supplanted by the speaker should these or similar scenarios occur critics assert that the supplantation provisions could lead to dangerous instability in the presidency during time of national crisis for example one witness testified as follows imagine catastrophic attack kills the president vicepresident and congressional leadership the secretary of state assumes the duties of the presidency but whenever congress elects new speaker or president pro tem that new leader may bump the secretary of state th result would be three presidents within short span of time35 moreover as noted previously any person who becomes acting president must resign his previous position in the case of the sp eaker and president pro tempore or have his appointment vacated by the act of oath taking it is certainly foreseeable that public officials might hesitate to forfeit their offices and end their careers before taking on the acting presidency particularly if the prospect of supplantation loomed the bumping question has been used by critics of legislative succession as an additional argument for removing the sp eaker and president pro tempore from the line of succession another suggested reme dy would be to amend the succession act of 1947 to eliminate the right of prior titled individuals to supplant an acting president who is acting due to vacancy in the office of president and vice president relatedly other proposals see hr 540 110th congress examined later in this report would amend the law to permit cabinet officials to take leave of absence from their departments while rving as acting president in cases of presidential and vice presidential disability they could thus return to their prior duties on recovery of either the president and vice president and their services

presidential campaigns nd transitions the related issue of succession during presidential campaigns and during the transition period between elections and th inauguration has been the subject of renewed interest since the terrorist attacks of septembe r 11 2001 the salient elements of this issue come into play only during elections when an incumbent president is retiring or has been defeat ed and the prospect of transition between administrations looms but uncertainties about succession arrangements during such period have been cause for concern among some observers procedures governing these eventualities depend on when vacancy would occur between nomination and election this first contingency would occur if there were vacancy in major party ticket before the pres idential election this possibility has been traditionally covered by political party ru with both the democrats and republicans providing for replacement by their national committees36 for example in 1972 the democr atic party filled vacancy when vice presidential nominee senator thomas eagleton resigned at the end of july and the democratic national committee met on august 8 of that year to nominate r sargent shriver as the new vice presidentia l candidate more problematic example of nominee replacement occurred following the death of vice president james s sherman on october 30 1912 just days befo re the november 5 election sherman was both incumbent and republican nominee for vice president37 the republican national committee met after election day and appointed nicholas m butler to replace sherman on the ticket and the eigh t republican electors duly cast their votes for butler38 between the election and the meeting of the electors the second contingency would occur in the event of vacancy after the election but before the electors meet to cast their vot in december this even tuality has been the subject of speculation and debate some commentators suggest that the political parties would follow their rules to provide for the filling of presidential and vice presidential vacancies and designate substitute nominee it is assumed that the electors who are predominantly party loyalists would vote unanimously for the substitute nominee given the unprecedented nature of such situation however confusion controversy and breakdown of party discipline among th members of the

and the electoral vote count by congress third contingency would occur if there were vacancy in presidential ticket during the period between the time when the electoral votes are cast monday after the second wednesday in december and when congress counts and certifies the votes january 6 the ccession process for this contingency turns on the issue of when candidates who have received majority of the electoral votes become presidentelect and vice presidentelect some commentators doubt whether an official president and vice presidentel ect exist prior to the electoral votes being counted nd announced by congress on january 6 maintaining that this is problematic contingency lacking clear constitutional or statutory direction41 others assert that once majority of electoral votes has been cast for one ticket then the recipients of these votes become th president and vice presidentelect notwithstanding the fact that the votes are not counted and certified until the following january 642 if so then the succession procedures of the 20th amendment noted earlier in this report would apply as soon as the elector votes were cast namely if the presidentelect dies then the vice presidentelect becomes the presidentelect this point of view receives strong suppor t from the language of the house committee report accompanying the 20th amendment addressing the question of when there is presidentelect the report states it will be noted that the committee uses th term president elect in its generally accepted sense as meaning the person who has received the majority of electoral votes or the person who has been chosen by the house of representatives in the event that the election is thrown into the house it is immaterial whether or not the votes have been counted

while there would be president vice president speaker and president pro tempore during this period who would step forward in the event an attack removed th officials this question takes on add itional importance since the cabinet an important element in the order of succession is generally in stat of transition at this time the previous administrations officers have generally resigned while the incoming administrations designees are usually in the midst of the confirmation process it is possible to envision situation in which not single cabinet officer will have been confirmed by the sena under these circumstances thus raising the prospect of facto decapitation of the executive branch at least for the purposes of presidential succession 110th congress proposed legislation after considerable activity in recent years only two successionrelated measures have been introduced to date in the 110th congress one hr 540 the presidential succession act of 2007 addresses several familiar issues in post911 succession while the second hjres 5 the ever vote counts amendment deals with succession tangentially within the context of presidential election reform hr 540 the presidential succession act of 2007 this bill was introduced in the 110th congress on january 17 2007 by representative brad sherman it has been referred to the subcommittee on the constitution civil rights and civil liberties of the house committee on the judiciary for the purposes of examina tion and analysis hr 540 may be divided into three segments the first section 2a1 of the bill section 1 states the short title would comprise major revision of the order of presidential succession by extending it to five additional officers the second section 2a 24 and 2b14 makes various technical changes and clarifications to the code while also eliminating bumping and making it possible for cabinet secretaries to serve as acting president without leaving their existing appointment the final part compri sing sections 3 and 4 would address two specific successionrela ted problem areas not covered by lawhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34692crs16 at the time of this writing action has been taken on hr 540 beyond committee referral expanding the line of succession section 2 a1 this section would set new precedent in the established order of presidential succession extending it for the first time beyond the vi ce president congressional leadership and the cabinet it would amend title 3 section 19 d of the united states code as amended by the usa patrio t improvement and reaut horization act of 2005 120 stat 247 by expanding the lineup of poten tial presidential successors to include the us ambassadors to the following five na tions or organizations in the following order the united nations great britain the united kingdom russia the russian federation china and france these positions would be added to the end of the current order of succession and would expand the number of design ated potential successors from 18 to 23 beginning with the vice president and endi ng with the us ambassador to france the intent here is to add highranking fe deral officers to the succession list who are normally not physically present in the washington area at any given time thus in the event of worst case scenario the ma ss decapitation of the us governments political leadership there would almost certainly be an appropriate official available to assume the acting presidency while some observers might note that any of the five ambassadors are very unlikely to ever accede to the acting presidency this provision does provide they may argue useful fail safe procedur the ambassadors concept might not be above criticism however appointees to major embassies have not always been drawn from the top ranks of the us diplomatic corps some ambassadors particularly those appointed to posts in the united kingdom and france have occasionally been major contributors to the incumbent presidents campaign or longtime friends and supporters who ma have had limited experience in either diplomacy or public service on the othe r hand the passage of this legislation might confer sense of the enhanced importan ce of these posts which could itself assure the appointment of highly qualified and experienced ambassadors to the relevant nations eliminating supplantation or b umping section 2a2b this section would end the practice by which an acting president c ould be bumped or supplanted by another officer higher on th order of succession unless he or she was serving due to the disability of the presiden t or vice president this would eliminate the uncertainties inherent under the current law for example under the provisions of hr 540 cabinet officer serving as acting president due to the death of the president vice president speaker and president pro tempore would not behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34692crs17 45 alternatively if the incumbent speaker tem porarily resigned as speaker to avoid serving as acting president but then resumed the speak ership he or she would be able to bump the acting president at later time this po ssibility or option could arguably cast shadow over the authority of the acting president eliminating bumping under these circumstances is intended to reduce the potential for uncertainty and confusion as to the authority of the acting president as well as the possibility of revolving door acting presidents 46 recall that there could be an actin g president only if the presidency and vice presidency were vacant due to the death or disability of the incumbents 47 3 usc 19d3 48 3 usc 19d3 as proposed to be amended by hr 540 110th congresssupplanted if the house of repres entatives elected new speaker45 the acting president would continue to serve out the balance of the term the bumping phenomenon is examined in greater detail earlier in this report under the heading bumping or supplantion one element left unclear by the elimin ation of the bumping provision and by this legislation in general is how it would relate to the 25th amendment would an acting president have the same authority as the president to nominate vice president to fill the vacancy in that office46 the 25th amendment refers specifically to the president who shall nominate vice president who shall take office upon confirmation by majority vote of both houses of cong ress emphasis added is this language sufficiently broad that it c ould be interpreted to confer the power to nominate vice president on the acting presid ent as well moreover what would be the succession status of newly conf irmed vice president be to the acting president who appointed him or her would the new vice presidents nonacting status confer the ability to succeed an actin g president the proposed legislation is silent on this question allowing cabinet officers to serve as acting president without vacating their prior appoint ment secti on 2a3a under current law cabinet officer acting as president under the succession act of 1947 automatically loses his job upon assuming the acting presidency the law is clear and decisive on this matter the cabinet fficer does not need to tender his or her resignation because the taking of the oa th of office shall be held to constitute resignation of the office by virtue of th holding of which he qualifies to act as president47 section 2a3a of hr 540 would eliminate this requirement substituting the following language the taking of the oath of office by an individual specified in the list in paragraph 1 of this subsection shall not require emphasis added his resignation from the office by virtue of the holding of which he qualifies to serve as acting president48 this change would eliminate one of the problematic elements in the existing provisions of the succession act of 1947 as noted previously the automatic resignation requirement of th current language could argu ably deter distinguishedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34692crs18 and capable cabinet officer from accepting the acting presidency for limited period of time if by doing so he or she would forfeit his appointment as secretary of one of the executive departments under the pr oposed revision the aff ected officer could serve as acting president for however long period required and still have the option of returning to the original position it should be noted however that while hr 540 would eliminate the automatic resignation provision it does not contain language that would specifically authorize cabinet officer serving as acting president to take leave of absence from his or her permanent position nor does it provide any of the detailed procedures that such contingency might arguably require the section concludes by revising th language governing requirements for cabinet officers serving as acting president the changes do not however alter the current requirements in section 19 in orde r to serve as acting president the cabinet officer must be 1 eligible to the ffice of president under the constitution 2 must have been appointed to the office b and with the advice and consent of the senate 3 prior to the time the powers and duties of the president devolve to such officer and 4 not be under impeachme nt by the house of representatives at the time the powers and duties of the ffice of the president devolve upon them various subsections confo rming amendments to change nomenclature establis hing the position of acting president in law number of subsections s cattered throughout the b ill as conforming amendments would change the title and actions of persons substituting for the president from the formula currently found in the title 3 secti on 19 of the us code the current law refers to persons acting as president or describes who shall act as president or who is acting as president this formula would be changed to identify such persons as acting president or persons who serve as acting president or are serving as acting president the purpose here is to establish the title of acting president in law clarify various referen ces to the position and arguably to confer greater distinction on it succession procedures for presidential candidates section 3 sections 3 and 4 of hr 540 might be scribed as aspirationa l provisions since they would promote changes in existing political arrangements through non legislative means both sections w ould express the sense of congress on succession and continuity of government questions that are not currently covered in the constitution or the us code section 3 would declare the sense of congress with respect to succession arrangements for presidential and vice pr esidential party nominees it recommends that the political parties and presumably independent candidacy organizations adopt the following specific procedureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34692crs19 each partys presidential and vice presidential nominees should announce the names of replacement ca ndidates for both offices at the partys national convention in the event the presidential minee is deceased or permanently incapacitated prior to date on whic h presidential electors convene in the states the electors would instead vote for the vice presidential nominee as president in the event the vice presidential nominee is deceased or permanently incapacitated under th aforementioned circumstances the electors would instead vote for the standby vice presidential candidate designated by th nominees at the convention in the event both candidates are deceased or permanently incapacitated under the aforementi oned circumstances then the electors would vote for the sta ndby candidates for both offices designated by the nominees at the convention and the parties should establish new ru and procedures that would incorporate the procedures r ecommended in the legislation the purpose of section 3 is to eliminat the uncertainties that would surround the death or permanent incapacity of presidential or vice presidential nominee at any time between the nomination and casting of electoral votes these issues have been discussed previously in this re port under succession during presidential campaigns and transitions although the political parties woul d not be compelled to accept these recommendations they the recommendations would carry considerable weight as the expressed sense of congress it may be argued that their apparent prudence and common sense might persuade the national committees of the major parties to consider them seriously or to adopt them in this sense the section might be considered as providing templa or model legisla tion for the parties critics however might assert that such sense of congress recommendation constitutes unprecedented governme nt intervention in the internal governance of the political parties it could they might argue be used in the future to justify further intrusions into the activities of the political parties and other nongovernmental organizations which have been historically regarded as private associations that perform quasipublic functions but have traditionally been subject to minimal intrusion by the federal government guaranteeing cabinet continuity during presidential transitions section 4 this section also expresses the sense of congress in this case on the continuity of government and the smooth transition of executive power in series of findings the findings would d eclare the sense of congress that continuity of leadership in the federal governme nt should be assured during periods of presidential transition and inauguration they urge the incumbent president and presidentelect to work together with the senate to the extent determined appropriate by the nate to ensure smooth transition of executive power the findings further cite the presidential tr ansition act of 1963 3 usc 102 whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34692crs20 seeks to avoid disruption of the functions of the federal government during these periods and also note that the nationa l commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states the 911 commission ma specific recommendations concerning continuity of government during the transition from an outgoing presidential administration to an incoming one particularly with respect to national security officials after stating these findings the bill if enacted would express the sense of congress in the following specific recommendations the incumbent president should consider sub mitting the president elects nominees for offices in the line of succession during the post election transition period the senate should consider comp leting the confir mation process conduct hearings and vote on the nominees between january 3 and inauguration day january 20 the incumbent president should consider signing and delivering commissions for all approved nominations on january 20 before the inauguration to ensure continuity of government the bills intention here is to address the contingency identified earlier in this report the awkward period around the inaugu ration when the outgoing cabinet has resigned but the newly nominated cabinet officers have yet to be approved and are not yet eligible to succeed to the presidency traditionally presidentselect announ ce their cabinet choices during the transition period that normally takes place between election day and january 20 of the following year when the newlyelected president actually assumes office also during this period the outgoing presidents cabinet officers traditionally submit their resignations generally ffective on or before inauguration day although investigations of and hearings on cabinet nominees for an incoming administration are often under way before the transfer of power official nominations by an incoming president and subsequent advice and consent by the senate cannot occur until after the new president has assumed office frequently this process continues for some weeks or longer in the case of controversial or c ontested nominations so that the full cabinet may not be sworn until well after the inauguration representative sherman and ot her observers view this gap particularly in the confirmation and swearingin of cabinet officers included in the line of succession as threat to continuity in both the presidency and in executive branch management while the presidentelect cannot submit hi s cabinet nominations until he assumes office there is legal impediment to prevent the outgoing incumbent from submitting any or all of his successors nomin ations to the senate after it reconvenes on january 3 one advantage conferred by this proposal would center on the fact that cabinet secretaries unlike elected officials do not serve set terms of office which expire on date certain further the process reco mmended by hr 540 arguably offers thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34692crs21 49

reduc ing the potential for disruption of the executive branch by terrorist attack in addition to the national securityre lated advantage this would confer it arguably could provide an impetus to streamlining the sometimes lengthy and contentious transition and appointme nts process faced by all incoming administrations the speedy transfer of executive leadership is welldocumented feature of most parliamentary democracies in the united kingdom for instance the party out of power appoints shadow secret ary for every department it is publicly understood that the shadow secretary or minister will be appointed head of the department if there is change of part control of the government adoption of advance cabinet planning would however be major innovation in current us political practices at least part of candidates future cabinet would need to be selected and vetted if not publicly announced prior to the presidential election related alternative requiring gislative action would be for cabinet secretaries of the outgoing administration to retain their offices until the nominations of their successors have been consented to by the senate both preinaugural nomination and confirmation of some or all cabinet secretaries and retention of incumbent secretaries pending senate confirmation would however face substantial obstacles since success would be dependent on high levels of good will nd cooperation between incumb ent presidents and their successors and between the political parties in the senate moreover it would impose sizeable volume of confirmati onrelated business on both the lame duck and newlysworn congresses during the 10 weeks following presidential election during this period the expiring congress tr aditionally adjourns sine die while the new congress generally performs only internal business and counts the electoral votes between its own installation on january 3 and the presidential inauguration if the election like the presidential contest of 2000

additional successionrelate d proposals discussed by analysts have been offered that have not been introduced as cu rrent legislation they seek particularly to address post911 concerns over the prospect of decapitation of the us government by terrorist attack or attack s possibly involving the use of weapons of mass destruction one proposal suggested by john c fortier51 at joint senate committee hearings held in september 2003 would ve congress establish number52 of additional federal officers whose specific duties and f unction would be to be ready to assume the acting presidency if necessary fortie r envisions that the president would appoint them subject to senate confirmation and that obvious candidates would be governors former presidents vice presidents cabinet officers and members of congress in other words private citizens who have had broad experience in government they would receive regular briefings and would also serve as advisors to the president further crucial element is that they would be located outside the washington dc area in order to be av ailable in the event of governmental decapitation fortier further suggested th at these officers s hould be included ahead of cabinet officers lower in the line of succession53 although he was not more specific in his testimony it could be argued that these officers might be inserted after the big four ie the secretaries of state the treasury and defense and the attorney general another proposal by dr fortier would amend the succession act to establish series of assistant vice presidents nominated by the president and subject to approval by advice and consen t of the senate these fficers would be included in the order of succession at an appropriate place they would be classic

the secretary of st ate were outside the united states in the event of succession catastrophe the secretary of th treasury could serve as acting president until the secretary of state returned and assumed those duties 57 akhil amar testimony p 23 58 howard wasserman testimony p 6personnel their primary functi on would be to be inform ed prepared and physically safe ready to serve as acting pr

the president would be empower ed to name an unspecified number of state governors as potential successors the constitutional mechanism here would be the presidents ability to call state militias the national guard into federal service55 baker argues that by virtue of their positions as commandersinchief of their state contingents of the nationa l guard governors could in effect be transformed into federal officers by the federalization of the guard56 professor akhil amar offered proposal similar to that of dr fortier he suggested that cabinet position of assistant vice president be established by law the assistant vice president would be minated by the president and subject to confirmation by the sena the primary duty of this fficer would be to be prepared to assume office as chief executive in th event of succession catastrophe in his testimony before the september 2003 jo int senate committee hearings dr amar suggested that presidential candidates s hould announce their choi ces for this office during the presidential campaign this would presumably enhance the electoral legitimacy of the assistant vice president as voters would be fully aware of the candidates choices for this potentially important office and include this consideration or factor in their voting decisions57 further variant was offered by howa rd wasserman during his joint senate committee hearing testimony he suggested establishment of the cabinet office of first secretary nominated by the president and confirmed by the senate the first secretarys duties would be the same as those of the offices proposed above with special emphasis on full inclusion and participation in administration policies this officer must be in contact with the pres ident and the administration as an active member of the cabinet aware of and i nvolved in the creation and execution of public policy58 finally dr fortier proposed constitu tional amendment that would eliminate the requirement that successors

george hw bush and former vice pres ident dan quayle both of whom longer live in washington to serve in the line of succession similarly future democratic president might nominate former vice pres idents gore and walter mondale to serve in the statutory line of succession60 concluding observations seemingly longsettled legislative and constitutional question the issue of presidential and vice presidential succession in the united states gained degree of urgency following the events of septembe r 11 2001 old issues have been revisited and new questions have been asked in light of concerns over potentially disastrous decapitation of the us government as the result of terrorist attack possibly by use of weapons of mass destruction although number of wideranging refo rms have been proposed in successive congresses since then the only legislative action taken to date occurred when the 109th congress acted to insert the office of secretary of homeland security into the current line of succession remedying an oversight in the legislation that created the department in 2002 in title v of the usa patriot improvement and reauthorization act of 2005 pl 109177 120 stat 192 the

current succession provisions and their lleged shortcomings they also provided venue for the presentation and discussion of airing wide range of proposals for change while foundation has thus been laid in the final analysis future congressional action in the area of presidential succession will arguably depend on such factors as strong and consistent support from congressional leadership the
